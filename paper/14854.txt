The Olympic Effect

                                             ABSTRACT

Economists are skeptical about the economic benefits of hosting “mega-events” such as the Olympic
Games or the World Cup, since such activities have considerable cost and seem to yield few tangible
benefits. These doubts are rarely shared by policy-makers and the population, who are typically quite
enthusiastic about such spectacles. In this paper, we reconcile these positions by examining the economic
impact of hosting mega-events like the Olympics; we focus on trade. Using a variety of trade models,
we show that hosting a mega-event like the Olympics has a positive impact on national exports. This
effect is statistically robust, permanent, and large; trade is around 30% higher for countries that have
hosted the Olympics. Interestingly however, we also find that unsuccessful bids to host the Olympics
have a similar positive impact on exports. We conclude that the Olympic effect on trade is attributable
to the signal a country sends when bidding to host the games, rather than the act of actually holding
a mega-event. We develop a political economy model that formalizes this idea, and derives the conditions
under which a signal like this is used by countries wishing to liberalize.

            • Economist, August 2, 2008


1    Motivation

Economists are usually skeptical of arguments about the public provision of infrastructure for

sporting events, and rightly so. Agents that endorse the construction of new sports stadia or

the staging of mega-events usually do so out of naivety or self-interest. In practice, these events

usually end up imposing large costs on their hosts that are not nearly compensated by either the

revenues earned during the event or the legacy of large stadia or obscure facilities (velodromes,

aquatic centers, archery ranges, and so forth) that are left behind. Baade and Matheson (2002)

estimate that the city of Atlanta and the state of Georgia spent $1.58 billion on the 1996 Olympics,

which created 24,742 permanent jobs under their most optimistic scenario, or $63,860 per job. The

opening ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympic games are estimated to have cost at least $100

million when around 100 million Chinese live on less than $1/day.1

    Despite the fact that most economists doubt the wisdom of such policy, there is little question

that countries commit substantial resources to become candidates to host mega-events, and much

more should they be “fortunate” enough to actually host the event. While there is usually a

vocal minority of opponents, the desire to host the Olympic games is widely held by the masses.

Moreover, there is a clear perception that national reputations are affected by the experience of

hosting the Olympics. Subsequent to learning of his country’s failure to win the rights to host the

2012 summer games, the mayor of the first arrondissement of Paris Jean-Francois Legaret lamented


                                                 1
“Somehow, the good name of France seems to be at issue, and that makes the defeat even worse.”

[Graff (2005)].

    This paper examines the possibility that both sides of the argument may be right. In particular,

we show that there is a large economic benefit associated with mega-events (justifying the public’s

enthusiasm), despite the fact that much of the requisite new infrastructure is a net cost (explaining

the skepticism of economists).

    It is commonly argued that hosting the Olympics will promote a nation’s exports. For in-

stance, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) believes that potential visitors will be drawn

to Olympic venues after being exposed to them through the games. We are dubious of the practical

relevance of this argument, and thus begin by examining it empirically, using a number of different

models of trade. Surprisingly, we find strong evidence of a large positive effect of the Olympics

on both exports and overall trade. Our results seem robust to a battery of sensitivity exercises

including tetradic and matching/treatment estimation; we show that countries which have hosted

the games seem to have exports some 30% higher, ceteris paribus. Other mega-events such as the

World Cup also have large positive effects on trade. Somewhat surprisingly (at least to us), coun-

tries that host a mega-event seem to realize an economic benefit in the form of greater openness.

If openness enhances growth (e.g., Lucas (2009)), the macroeconomic consequences of mega-events

may be large.

    While our observed effect is large and robust, it may be argued that it is attributable to

unobservable differences between those countries that host the games and those that don’t, rather

than a “hosting effect.” To address this possibility, we compare trade patterns for countries that

host the games to those that bid unsuccessfully for the games. In using this alternative group as a

control, our methodology follows a large recent literature, such as Jones and Olken (2007).2 In our

case, the operational assumption is that successful and unsuccessful candidates are similar in terms

of proclivity towards trade and liberalization, differing only by the experience of actually hosting

the Olympic games.




                                                 2
    Using this identification strategy, we find that countries that were unsuccessful candidates

for the games also experience a positive export effect, one similar in size to that experienced by

actual Olympic hosts. These findings cast doubt on the idea that a plausible motivation for hosting

a mega-event is any change in a country’s fundamentals induced by holding the games (such as

construction activity or the resulting infrastructure). Instead, our evidence is consistent with the

conclusion that all countries that bid for the games experience an increase in outward orientation,

not just hosts. This raises two puzzles. Why should bidding for the Olympics be associated with

increased openness? And if hosting the games brings no tangible benefits relative to a control group

of unsuccessful candidates, why would any country ever bid to hold an expensive mega-event?

    We offer an answer to these puzzles below. We explore the possibility that bidding to host

an international mega-event such as the Olympics is part of a costly strategy that signals trade

liberalization and results in increased openness. We develop a theoretical political-economy model

consistent with this conjecture. In the model, we obtain a separating equilibrium where bidding

to host a mega-event provides a positive signal about future policy intentions. However, consis-

tent with our empirical findings, hosting the games in and of itself has no impact on a nation’s

fundamentals or trade.

    Our model also suggests an answer to the question “Why a mega-event?” as the choice of a

signal of liberalization intentions. We find that countries will be more likely to use the Olympic

signal, the greater is the incidence of the expected cost of sending the signal on the group that

expects to benefit from future liberalization. Major sporting events like the Olympics are tradition-

ally financed by the relevant city (usually the capital) in conjunction with the central government

of the host country. Policy makers from these groups are likely to benefit from liberalization. As

such, bidding for the Olympics may serve well as a signal because it aligns the costs and benefits

of the signal. To our knowledge, this is the first model where the distributional implications of

sending the signal influence the desirability of the signal chosen. Olympic bids are also good signals

of liberalization because they are highly visible, infrequent, and have long lead times.

    In the next section we briefly review the relevant literatures on mega-events and signaling.

Our empirical investigation of the Olympic effect on trade begins in section 3; sensitivity analysis is

provided in the following section, and a comparison between successful and unsuccessful bids for the

Olympics follows. After some further robustness checks, we develop a theoretical model whereby

countries interested in signalling their future policy intention to liberalize do so by bidding for a

mega-event. The paper ends with a brief conclusion.



2     Literature Review

2.1    Literature on “mega events”

A number of studies exist that support local subsidization of sporting events; they often predict

large economic benefits. This work is typically commissioned and is not intended for the academic

audience, but it is still influential. For example, Humphreys and Plummer (1995) estimate the

short-term economic impact to Atlanta from hosting the 1996 games to be $5.1 billion. Similarly

Fuller and Clinch (2000) estimate that the total economic impact of hosting the 2012 games on the

Washington-Baltimore metropolitan area would have been $5.3 billion.

      More rigorous studies are skeptical of the net economic benefits of hosting mega-events; see

e.g., Baade and Matheson (2002) and Owen (2005). The costs of holding such events seem con-

siderable. Further, any enduring benefits derive mostly from infrastructure investments that the

host city could choose to make independently of the games. Much of the spending on the event

by local citizens is a substitute from a different leisure activity or consumption good, rather than

true additional spending [e.g., Siegfried and Zimbalist (2000) and Coates and Humphreys (2003)].

Moreover, the projects associated with the games typically seem to be white elephants, such as

poorly-used sporting facilities associated with idiosyncratic Olympic sports, or hotels and trans-

portation infrastructure built to accommodate a one-time peak demand of just three weeks.

      Some have argued that hosting sporting events yields a non-pecuniary “feel good” benefit to

local citizens who are filled with civic pride following a mega-event, even if they do not attend [e.g.



                                                  4
Rappaport and Wilkerson (2001), Carlino and Coulson (2004), or Maennig and du Plessis (2007)].

However, the very existence of this intangible spillover is uncertain, let alone its magnitude. It seems

safe to say that a majority of the profession considers it unlikely that these benefits justify the large

public expenditures involved in hosting such events [e.g. Coates, Humphreys, and Zimbalist (2006)

and Coates (2007)].


2.2    International Signaling Literature

The use of international signals to indicate future policy to prospective foreign investors has been

discussed in the literature. Bartolini and Drazen (1997) develop a model where governments with

asymmetric information about future fiscal positions signal their expectations through current

policies on capital account openness. Open capital accounts are more costly for countries in poor

fiscal condition, so those countries that expect to be in good fiscal condition in the future can signal

their prospects in ways that cannot be profitably mimicked by countries that expect to face future

fiscal difficulties.

      The signal we consider below is of a “burning money” type, not informative in its own sense,

but informative due to the fact that sending the signal is only attractive to the set of countries

that sincerely intend to pursue liberalization. In this sense, it is similar to the costs of delay in

a war of attrition model, such as that of the delayed fiscal stabilization in Alesina and Drazen

(1991). Other studies go even farther, e.g. Krugman (1998) and Mukand (2006), who argue that

countries sometimes pursue policies that are actually perverse in an effort to increase investor

confidence. Their argument is that in a globalized environment, policymakers may feel the need

to pursue policies that would confirm foreign investors’ beliefs about what constitutes good policy.

These beliefs may be biased due to herding effects [e.g. Banerjee (1992)], or alternatively because

investors may draw incorrect inferences about their impact. As a result, perverse policies may have

such an advantage in terms of their impact on agents’ expectations that pursuing them may be

superior than following the path that would yield the best outcome in terms of domestic economic

fundamentals.


                                                   5
      One question that naturally arises in these types of models is why one form of signal might be

preferred to another. We argue that one attribute of using the Olympics as a signal is the incidence

of the cost of sending the signal within the country. In particular, it is likely that the cost of

hosting the Olympics is primarily borne by the benefactors of the signaled policy change, limiting

the losses to those not favored by the policy. Mega-events like the Olympics are also infrequent,

highly visible, and have long lead times, attributes that lend themselves to signals of liberalization.



3     The Olympic Effect on Trade

If the direct economic benefits seem theoretically dubious, and any indirect effects highly uncertain,

the willingness of local and federal governments to heavily subsidize sporting activities is a mystery.

We now try to tackle this issue empirically. In particular, we take seriously the argument that

hosting a mega-event provides visibility to a host country and thus may stimulate global demand

for its exports.


3.1    Specification and Data

We start our investigation by using the well-known and widely employed “gravity” model of in-

ternational trade.3 This models bilateral trade flows between a pair of countries as a function of

the distance between the two countries and their economic “masses.” We augment this empirical

specification by adding a host of other factors that might also affect their trade intensity. We

employ the following specification:




                                                  6
  ln(Xijt ) = β0 + β1 ln(Dij ) + β2 ln(P opit ) + β3 ln(P opjt ) + β4 ln(GDP pcit ) + β5 ln(GDP pcjt )

  + β6 Contijt + β7 CUijt + β8 Langij + β9 RT Aijt + β10 Borderij + β11 Islandsij

  + β12 Areaij + β13 ComColij + β14 Colonyijt + β15 EverColij + β16 SameCtryijt

  + γO Olympicsit + γS Summerit + γW W interit + εijt .

                                                                                                         (1)



where i denotes the exporting country, j denotes the importer, t denotes time, ln(·) denotes the

natural logarithm operator, and the variables are defined as:


   • Xijt denotes real FOB exports from i to j, measured in millions of dollars,

   • D is the distance between i and j,

   • P op is population,

   • GDP pc is annual real GDP per capita,

   • Cont is a binary variable which is unity if i and j share a land border and zero otherwise,

   • CU is a binary “dummy” variable which is unity if i and j use the same currency at time t ,

   • Lang is a binary variable which is unity if i and j have a common language,

   • RT A is a binary variable which is unity if i and j have a regional trade agreement at t,

   • Border is a binary variable which is unity if i and j share a land border,

   • Islands is the number of island countries in the pair (0/1/2),

   • Area is the log of the product of the areas of the countries,

   • ComCol is a binary variable which is unity if i and j were both colonized by the same country,


                                                     7
   • Colony is a binary variable which is unity if i colonizes j at time t (or vice versa),

   • EverCol is a binary variable which is unity if i ever colonized j (or vice versa),

   • SameCtry is a binary variable which is unity if i is part of the same country at time t (or

      vice versa),

   • β is a vector of nuisance coefficients,

   • Olympics/Summer/W inter are binary variables which are unity if i hosted a post-war

      Olympics games/Summer games/Winter games at or before time t, and zero otherwise,

   • ε represents the omitted other influences on bilateral exports, assumed to be well behaved.


    The sources of our bilateral data set are described in more detail in Appendix Table A1.

This data set includes annual observations between 1950 and 2006 (though with many missing

observations) for some 196 territories and localities (we refer to these as “countries” below). The

countries themselves are tabulated in Table A2.

    We estimate this equation with OLS, using a robust covariance estimator (clustered by country-

pair dyads) to handle heteroskedasticity, adding year-specific fixed effects. We also perturb this

specification in two important ways. First, we add a comprehensive set of dyadic-specific fixed

effects (i.e., a mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive set of {βij } intercepts) to absorb any time-

invariant characteristics that are common to a pair of countries. Second, we add comprehensive

sets of exporter and importer fixed effects (i.e., sets of {βi } and {βj }) to take account of any time-

invariant country-specific factors. We also show below that our key results are insensitive to the

use of other estimation strategies.4

    We are interested in the {γ} coefficients. These represent the permanent export effect associ-

ated with having hosted the post-war Olympic games, holding other export determinants constant

through the gravity model (we try hard not to interpret these coefficients as causal). We estimate

these “Olympic effects” in two different ways, either estimating the effects of the Summer and Win-

ter games separately (in which case we set γO = 0) or estimating a single common effect of hosting

                                                   8
either type of games (in this case, we impose γS = γW = 0). The hosts of post-war Olympics games

are tabulated in Appendix Table A3.


3.2    Benchmark Results

The results of estimating our default specification are presented in Table 1. There are six different

columns; the equation is estimated with three different sets of fixed effects (none, dyadic, and

exporter/importer) for two different sets of Olympic dummy variables (separate and combined

Summer/Winter effects).

      Before we discuss the coefficients of greatest interest to us, we briefly discuss the other de-

terminants of trade flows. The gravity model seems to work well. It delivers precisely estimated

coefficients that are sensible and similar to those estimated by others. For instance, β1 is consis-

tently estimated to be economically and statistically significant; exports between a pair of countries

fall with distance (as previous researchers have found). Similarly, the size and significance of β3 and

β5 indicates that larger and richer countries both tend to import more. Exports are larger when

countries share a money, language, trade agreement, land border, or colonial heritage. Further, the

equations fit the (largely cross-sectional) data set well, explaining well over half of the variation in

exports. While these results are not of direct interest to us, they do reassure us that our estimates

are grounded in a statistical conditioning model that delivers sensible and significant results.

      Once the standard trade determinants are accounted for by the gravity model, is there any

room left for a permanent export effect of hosting the Olympics? Somewhat surprisingly (at least

initially to us), the answer is unambiguously positive. Consider the column on the extreme left-hand

side of Table 1, which estimates separate export effects for having hosted either the Summer or the

Winter Olympics games. Both estimates are positive and statistically distinguishable from zero at

all reasonable significance levels.5 Further, the “Olympic Effect” is economically large. Consider

the point estimate of γS , which is .31. Taken literally, this implies that countries that have hosted

the summer games have exports that are permanently higher by some [exp(.31) − 1] = 36%! This is



                                                   9
big, broadly comparable in our estimates to, e.g., the effects of a shared regional trade agreement. It

is also similar to the effect of hosting either the Summer or Winter games. Reassuringly, including

either dyadic or country-specific fixed effects does not change the key results very much. The

effects associated with hosting the (summer or either) games is around .3, both statistically and

economically different from zero.6

      We do not estimate strong export effects of hosting the winter games; the coefficients are

typically small and usually insignificantly different from zero (especially for the more reliable results

that include fixed effects). We do not find this particularly surprising; the scale of the winter

Games has always been dwarfed by those of the summer games, and the geographic requirements

of the winter games place more constraints on potential hosts. With a few exceptions, the winter

games have tended to be held in relatively small towns, often those considered to be winter resorts

(especially early on).7 As a result, there is considerable heterogeneity in the Olympic effect.8

      It should also be mentioned in passing that any export effect associated with the Olympic games

seems to be permanent rather than transitory. In Appendix Table A4, we present an analogue

to Table 1, but one where the three key binary variables (Olympics, Summer, and Winter) are

redefined to be unity only in the year of the actual games, and zero otherwise. In this case, we

find no strong consistent patterns for the three coefficients of interest; γO is never significant, while

both γS and γW are significant in one each of the remaining estimates. Both of the latter results

are economically small and neither is robust to the exact choice of fixed effects.9



4     Sensitivity Analysis

4.1    Robustness of Permanent Effect

Are the (surprisingly) strong linkages between exports and Olympic hosts fragile? Or instead,

do small perturbations to the exact sample or choice of conditioning model have a strong effect

on the results? No. We provide a battery of robustness checks in Table 2, which is intended to



                                                   10
reassure the skeptical reader that our results are essentially insensitive to minor changes in the

exact econometric methodology used to estimate {γ}. Each of the rows in the table corresponds to

a different sensitivity check, while the six columns correspond exactly to those of Table 1. We only

report estimates for the coefficients of interest {γ}; other controls are included in the regressions

as appropriate but not reported.10

    The first experiment of Table 2 shows the results when exports from i to j are replaced by

imports into i from j. The coefficients remain statistically large and positive. Indeed, the point

estimates are, if anything, somewhat larger than those associated with exports. This indicates that

the Olympics are associated with an increase in the openness of an Olympic host. The Games do

not seem to act as simple export promotion, but are instead associated with an increase in two-way

trade between the host and the rest of the world.

    Next we change the empirical model in two ways. First, we include country-specific linear time-

trend terms in place of country-specific intercepts. Secondly, we strip down the gravity model by

including only bilateral distance, importer population, and importer income as controls.11 However,

our key finding of strong positive γS and γO coefficients seems to persist. The same is true when

we add regional dummy variables.12

    Do our results depend sensitively on a small set of observations that might come from a special

set of observations? We check by selectively dropping different sets of observations. Since we are

interested in exporter effects and only a small number of countries have hosted the Olympics post-

war, we begin by dropping different sets of importer observations.13 We first drop all observations

for importers that are industrial. We then successively delete observations for developing countries

from: Latin America or the Caribbean; Africa; Asia; or the Middle East.14 We then successively

drop small exporters (defining a small country as one with fewer than a million people), small

importers (those with real GDP per capita of less than $1000 per annum), poor importers, and the

intersection of these four sets. None of these robustness checks shakes the confidence we have in

our basic results. We then check the sensitivity of our results with respect to time. We separately

drop late (post-2000) and early (pre-1960) observations; again this does not destroy our findings.


                                                 11
      We finish up this analysis with five further experiments. First, we drop outlier observations,

defined as those where the residual is far (more than 2.5 standard deviations) away from zero.

Second, we weight our regressions by the log of the product of the country-pair real GDP. We then

redefine our key Olympics regressor in two ways. First, we construct a variable which is 0 if neither

i nor j has hosted the Olympics at or before time t, 1 if either i or j has hosted (at or before t),

and 2 if both i and j have hosted. Second, we construct a dummy which is 0 if neither i nor j has

hosted the Olympics at or before time t, and 1 if either i or j has hosted (at or before t). The last

variable delivers insignificant results for hosting the summer games when fixed effects are included;

otherwise, our results are insensitive. Finally, we use the Glick-Taylor historical data set, which

includes bilateral trade (but not export) data stretching back to 1870. Using this long data set

allows us to incorporate observations for countries that have hosted the games at any point during

the modern Olympiad era, not just from the shorter postwar period. However, our findings remain

resilient; countries seem to have permanently higher trade flows after having hosted the games.

      We conclude that our results do not seem to result from some small subset of the data set, and

are relatively robust to reasonable changes in the sample and exact specification of our empirical

model. Countries that have hosted the Olympic games (especially the summer games) seem to have

higher trade than others.


4.2    Endogeneity

A question arises immediately: Can the choice of venue for the Olympic games be treated as

plausibly exogenous? Perhaps only countries that are open to trade are chosen to host the games?

We attempt to address this point more directly below with a treatment methodology that matches

Olympic hosts to other countries. Still, we now make several points.

      First, the endogeneity critique (along with much of our analysis) is primarily cross-sectional,

while the empirical finding is found in the time-series behavior of trade.

      Second, our analysis shows that countries become more open after the Olympics. However,



                                                  12
cities (not countries) bid to host the games. Indeed, four American cities vied for the 1948 Olympics

(which went to London); five American cities applied in 1952 (again without success), and six in

1956 (also unsuccessfully).15

    Third, the IOC provides details both on how it awards the games and why a city should be

interested. There is a long list of technical criteria which are evaluated by an IOC committee; few

of these criteria are closely associated with trade.16 Informally, there is also geographic balancing,

and the IOC seems to award perseverance (a number of cities have applied repeatedly). We also

note in passing that there is considerable randomness inherent in the process.17

    Fourth, our data does allow us to consider the issue of reverse causality directly. In particular,

we can statistically examine whether more open countries are more likely to bid for, or obtain

hosting rights to the Olympics. We conduct probit tests to that effect in Table A5 in the appendix.

In addition to including openness, we control for country size and per capita income. We find that

openness enters insignificantly throughout, suggesting that reverse causality is not an issue.18

    Why does the IOC think that cities should be interested in hosting the Olympics? They state:


     “Apart from the sporting events, the main reason for applying for candidacy lies in the
     possibilities for economic development and tourism inherent in such an event. For this
     reason, and also given the high infrastructure costs, only rich countries have the means
     to make a good return on such a large investment.”19


     “Two main reasons seem to motivate most applicant cities, namely international recog-
     nition and increased opportunities for invigorated urban and regional development.
     Indeed, the host city hopes to take advantage of the event to maximize its facilities
     due to the considerable income generated by the Games, and to give itself an enhanced
     image to attract future visitors, consumers and potential investors ... Organising the
     Olympic Games is a fantastic advertising opportunity for the host city... Moreover, or-
     ganising the Olympic Games is an opportunity for the host city and country to show the
     world their ability to undertake and organise successfully such an important event. This
     promotional aspect is often motivated by the politicians of the host country, thereby
     explaining the heavy involvement of national governments in the organisation and fi-
     nancing of Olympic Games”20

4.3    Other International “Mega-events”

While the Olympics are highly visible, they are not the only mega-event. Do other events deliver

similar results? One obvious alternative to consider is the World Cup, the only serious competitor

with the Olympics for title of most important international sporting event.

      Like the Olympics, the FIFA World Cup is held every four years. It began in 1930 in much

the small-scale way as did the modern Olympics game, with thirteen (mostly Latin American)

countries participating in a tournament held in Uruguay. The 1934 and 1938 tournaments were

also relatively small and regional, being held in Europe with limited participation by the Latins.

The event only really took off in 1950 (the 1942 and 1946 events were canceled for World War

II). This was due in part to a new convention of alternating the event between the Americas and

Europe.21 We construct dummy variables for countries that have hosted the World Cup post-war

in a manner analogous to those for the Olympic games, and add them to our specification. We

report our results in Table 3a.

      The results of Table 3a are intriguing. The effect of hosting the Olympics games remains

positive and statistically significant for all six of the specifications we estimate; the coefficients

continue to average around .3. The effects of hosting the FIFA World cup are similar in sign, size,

and statistical precision. Indeed, we can never reject the hypothesis of equal trade effects of hosting

the Olympics and the World Cup.

      What about international events that do not involve sports? After all, international expo-

sitions and world’s fairs have a much older pedigree than the modern Olympics, stretching back

at least to the 1851 Great Exhibition in London’s Crystal Palace.22 The decline of international

communication and transportation costs has largely made world’s fairs obsolete, and they have

declined in importance and number throughout the post-war period (though Expo 67 in Montreal

is widely considered to be the most successful expo ever held). Still, Table 3b adds comparably

constructed binary variables for (twenty) post-war expos and world’s fairs to our default specifi-

cation. In all six specifications, the trade effect of hosting a world’s fair or expo is positive and



                                                  14
statistically significant, though it is smaller than the Olympic effect on trade.

    There seem to be a number of ways in which a country can enhance its trade by hosting an

international mega-event. The trade-expanding effects of hosting an event like the Olympics seem

to be large, and they are broadly comparable to those associated with hosting the FIFA World

Cup. Holding an expo or world’s fair also seems to have much the same effect. Given our initial

doubts concerning the benefits of hosting a mega-event, we now dive into the issue more deeply.



5    Unsuccessful Candidates

It is difficult for us to believe that hosting the Olympics actually has such a large effect on trade,

let alone one that enhances trade permanently. Yet our sensitivity analysis shows that our results

are sturdy.

    We now take a skeptical look at our results from a different angle. To estimate the effects

of the Olympics on trade in the previous section, our statistical model compared hosts with non-

hosts. This seems a reasonable strategy, since not all countries have hosted the games (so there is

cross-sectional variation), and the countries that host the Olympics do so at different points of time

(so there is time-series variation). However, it may be that our regression results are implicitly

comparing apples with oranges; countries are not randomly chosen to host the Olympics. One way

to get at this issue is to compare the trade patterns of host countries with those that bid unsuc-

cessfully for the games. We refer to the latter as “candidate” countries; candidates are tabulated in

Appendix Table A3.23 Our implicit assumption in comparing the trade effects of Olympic hosting

and candidacy is that failed candidacies form a valid quasi-experimental counterfactual control

group for Olympic hosts (after the inclusion of other conditioning variables).24

    In Table 4, we report results when we add a set of binary variables for countries that were

unsuccessful candidates to host the Olympics. These have been constructed in the same way as our

host dummy variables. For instance, London was awarded the 1948 summer games, so the summer

host variable is unity for all British (export) observations from 1948 through the end of the sample.


                                                  15
Since Lausanne was an unsuccessful candidate for the 1948 games, all Swiss observations from 1948

also take the value of unity for the comparable summer candidate variable. We tabulate separate

export estimates for: a) being an unsuccessful Olympic candidate; and b) actually hosting the

games. Intriguingly, all the effects - that is, both the host and the candidate coefficients - are

significantly positive. Indeed, as the tests shown at the bottom of the panel show, they are also

typically similar in size; the hypothesis that host and candidate effects are equal cannot be rejected

for four of the six estimates. In one of the other cases (no fixed effects, combining the summer

and winter Olympic effects) the host effect is bigger than the candidate effect; in another (country-

specific fixed effects, separating summer and winter effects), the candidate effect is marginally larger

than the host effect.25

    This is an intriguing result, one which we find reasonably consistently throughout our investi-

gation. It implies that the (sizeable) effect on trade seems to come not from actually hosting the

games but from being a country that bids for them. More generally, signaling that the country is

capable and willing to host the Olympics through a highly visible international bid for a mega-event

seems to be associated with a sizeable trade-expanding effect on trade. Indeed, the effect of sending

this signal seems broadly comparable in size to actually hosting the games. This is consistent with

our view that any direct trade effect of hosting the games is small.26 Moreover, it suggests that the

observed effects of hosting a mega-event do not seem to stem from a “big push” type of process

[e.g. Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989)].



6    Further Robustness Checks

In this section, we briefly subject our results to three further sensitivity tests. Given our interest

in estimating and comparing the effects of both hosting and bidding for a mega-event like the

Olympics, we have three particular concerns; a) econometric issues associated with the gravity

model; b) econometric issues associated with selection bias and endogeneity; and c) the presence

of our finding in multilateral data.



                                                  16
6.1    Tetradic estimates

We begin by dealing with the problem that gravity models like ours may be mis-specificed because

of “monadic” problems. These refer to omitted factors that are specific to a single country but may

vary over time, such as those associated with “multilateral resistance” to trade [e.g. Anderson and

Van Wincoop (2003)].

      To deal with the problem, we adopt the “method of tetrads” advocated by Head, Mayer, and

Ries (2008). Under this method, consistent estimators of the coefficients of interest can be attained

in the presence of multilateral resistance by comparing export observations to exports for a pair of

base countries for the same year (the technique is tetradic since one compares trade flows for four

countries). This method avoids the large number of coefficient estimates that would be required to

estimate the monadic effects using a more conventional fixed effects method, but does not entail

non-linear estimation; Head, Mayer, and Ries (2008) provide more details.27

      One issue that arises in tetradic gravity specifications is the designation of the base countries.

To ensure that our results are robust, we use three different pairs of base countries: a) the United

States and the United Kingdom; b) Japan and France; and c) Germany and Canada. A second

issue is that the error terms in our tetrads are likely to be correlated, as error terms for individ-

ual countries appear repeatedly across observations. We therefore use the methodology of Head,

Mayer, and Ries (2008) to correct our standard error estimates. Finally, this estimation technique

requires variation across both dyads and time, so that the dummy variable we used for Table 1 is

inadmissible; we substitute instead a dummy which is 0 if neither i nor j has bid for the Olympics

at or before time t, and 1 if either i or j has.

      Our results are reported in Table 5. It can be seen that we continue to obtain positive and

statistically significant effects of either hosting or candidacy for the Olympics, regardless of our

choice of base countries. Our point estimates for the combined Winter/Summer Games are close

to those of Tables 1-4, though our point estimate for the summer games alone is implausibly large.




                                                   17
6.2    Treatment methodology

We next use a treatment methodology, comparing exports for either hosts or candidate countries

with exports for matched counterparts. This allows us to better handle the problem that candidate

and host countries for the Olympic games are not randomly selected from our sample. We match

observations using a stratification technique. Our variables used for matching country-pair*year ob-

servations include the logs of: distance, exporter and importer populations, exporter and importer

real GDPs per capita; and dummy variables for sharing a common language or border.

      We do two kinds of matching: a) we match actual Olympic host countries to candidates; and

b) we match non-candidates to the union of hosts and candidates. If host and candidate countries

experience similar trade boosts, we expect the first exercise to lead to small differences in exports.

If bidding for a mega-event is key, we expect the second exercise to result in large trade effects.

      Our results, along with bootstrapped standard error estimates are shown in Table 6. We

find that hosts of the Summer Olympics experience a small increase in exports compared with

candidates for the games. This effect is statistically significant at a 5% (but not 1%) confidence

level. However, if one compares hosts and candidates for either the summer or winter games,

this effect becomes statistically insignificant and remains economically small. These weak results

are in stark contrast to those which compare hosts and candidates to non-candidate countries.

Whether one considers the summer games alone or the combined games, hosts and candidates

jointly experience a considerable trade boost compared with non-candidates. These effects are

economically large (exports rise by about 20%) and are significant at the 1% confidence level.


6.3    Multilateral data

As a final robustness check, we examine the effect of hosting or being a candidate for the Olympics

on the aggregate export/GDP ratio; we also consider being a World Cup host. We do this by

simply regressing multilateral data (so that an observation is for a particular country and year) on

the Olympic dummies.28


                                                 18
      Our results are shown in Table 7. We find that countries which have hosted the Olympics have

trade approximately 15% (=exp(.14)-1) higher, other things be equal. We obtain qualitatively sim-

ilar positive coefficients for candidacy, but our large estimated standard errors preclude statistically

significant results at standard confidence levels. Still, our results with aggregate data mirror those

above in the sense that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the coefficient estimates on hosting

and candidacy are positive and equivalent. Finally, we also obtain similar positive and statistically

significant coefficient estimates for having hosted the World Cup in all of our reported regressions.



7     A Signaling Model

7.1    Setup

Our results suggest that the Olympic effect on trade in the data is not associated with hosting the

games but rather from bidding for them; bidding to host the games seems to send a signal that has

a sizeable trade-expanding effect. In this section, we develop a political-economy signaling model

consistent with this result. Our model is of the “burning money” type. In keeping with our empirical

results, we assume that countries that intend to pursue liberal trade policies in the future can signal

this intent by engaging in the costly activity of bidding to host the Olympic Games. The payoff for

sending this signal is that countries which expect to liberalize receive increased investment in the

export sector (the sector whose prices are raised by liberalization). Under appropriate parameter

conditions, we obtain a separating equilibrium where countries that choose to liberalize also choose

to bid for the Olympics; those that prefer to remain closed neither send the signal nor do they

liberalize. We close with some discussion about why offering to host a mega-event might serve as

a desirable signal.29

      To allow trade liberalization to have distributional consequences, we introduce a two-sector

specific factors model of a small open economy in which liberalization increases prices in the export

sector and lowers them in the import-competing sector. National governments differ in the degree to

which they value gains to the exporting sector, and we assume that they cannot credibly reveal these

                                                  19
valuations to potential investors. The government in each country makes a discrete liberalization

and signaling decision based on its expectations concerning the impact of liberalization on its utility.

     Both sectors of the economy produce using a fixed domestic factor, which can be considered

sector-specific capital. Putty capital, k, is mobile across sectors and earns an international market

rate of return, which is fixed at r ∗ .30 Real output levels in the export and import-competing sectors

satisfy yj (k), where yj′ > 0 and yj′′ < 0, j = x, m. For simplicity, we assume that all putty capital

is imported by domestic entrepreneurs, who have claims on the fixed factors and earn any residual

profits from operations.

     As the country is small, it takes world prices as given. However, domestic prices are a function

of the government’s liberalization decision. Liberalization raises prices in the export sector and

lowers them in the import-competing sector. Prices while the nation is closed to external markets

are denoted px c and pm c , while after opening they are px o and pm o respectively, where px o > px c

and pm o < pm c .

     The timing of the model is as follows: First, the government decides whether or not to submit

a bid to host the Olympics. Next, the private agents make their investment decisions, based on

their expectations of the government’s liberalization decision. Finally, the government makes its

liberalization decision, the winning Olympics host is named, and the payoffs are determined.

     To ensure sub-game perfection, we solve the model backwards. Subsequent to receiving the

government’s signal, foreign putty capital is invested in each sector to equate the value of marginal

product in that sector to the world interest rate, such that,



                                  pj l yj′ (kj∗ )l ) = (1 + r ∗ ); j = x, m, l = c, o.              (2)


where kj∗ l ; j = x, m, l = c, o represents the equilibrium amount of putty capital allocated to sector

j, i.e. the value satisfying equation (2). Since dkj∗ /dpj = −y ′ /pj y ′′ > 0; j = x, m it follows that

kx∗ c < kx∗ o and km
                   ∗ c > k∗ o .
                          m




                                                          20
    Given that the government’s liberalization decision confirms investor expectations, the return

to the domestic entrepreneurs in each sector, vj l , satisfies



                             vj l = pj l yj (kj∗ ) − (1 + r ∗ )kj∗ ; j = x, m, l = c, o.                        (3)


    It is easy to show that the return in the export (import-competing) sector is greater (lower)

under liberalization

                                                                   ∗ o
                                                                  km


    Let c represent the cost of hosting the Olympics, net of any non-pecuniary benefit of hosting

the games, such as national pride. Let π represent the probability that a candidate will be awarded

the right to host the games conditional on having sent the signal.31

    We assume that the reputation cost of being awarded the games and backing out is prohibitive.

Bidding for the Olympics and not hosting them would be highly embarrassing and would adversely

impact a nation’s international reputation. These are infrequent, highly visible events with long lead

times, features which make them attractive as signals of liberalization.32 Given this assumption,

each nation expects to host the games conditional on being awarded them. The expected cost of

sending the signal is therefore equal to πc. The government finances the cost of sending the signal

by imposing a lump-sum tax on each sector, where the export sector pays a share γ of the cost of

sending the signal, γπc, and the import-competing sector pays the rest, (1 − γ)πc.

    The government is assumed to have a utility function that is concave in earnings from each

sector. The government’s utility function is assumed to satisfy




                                                             21

                                               j


where u′ ≥ 0, u′′ ≤ 0.33 For simplicity, we normalize by setting θm = 1, and define θ ≡ θx as

the measure of the degree to which government utility favors the export sector over the import-

competing sector. However, we assume there is a continuum of heterogeneous countries z ∈ [z, z]

that differ in the relative values their governments place on local earnings from these sectors (below,

we formally specify that a higher z indicates that the government values export earnings more than

those of importers). We assume that θ z , the value of θ held by the government of country z, is

symmetrically distributed on the interval [θ, θ] with mean value 1. For notational simplicity, we

drop the z superscripts unless we are comparing decisions across countries.

      Prior to sending the signal, Ug then satisfies



                                          Ug = θu(vx c ) + u(vm c ).                                     (7)


      Similarly, let Ûg represent the government’s utility after it sends a credible signal and liberalizes.

Ûg satisfies



                               Ûg = θu(vx o − γπc) + u(vm o − (1 − γ)πc).                               (8)


7.2     Equilibrium

An equilibrium is a set of signal and liberalization decisions by each government that maximizes

its expected utility, along with a set of investment decisions in the two sectors consistent with

maximizing the returns to the domestic entrepreneurs, conditional on the signal of the government.

      We first rule out two off-equilibrium path outcomes, where the signal sent by the government

fails to match its subsequent liberalization decision. We first examine the condition that ensures



                                                      22
that the government always liberalizes following a bid for the games. Define Ûgc as expected gov-

ernment utility subsequent to sending a credible signal and failing to liberalize. Ûgc satisfies



                                  Ûgc = θu(ṽxc − γπc) + u(ṽm
                                                              c
                                                                − (1 − γ)πc)                         (9)


where ṽjc ≡ vjc (kj∗o ); j = e, m. This is the value of revenues in sector j consistent with signaling

liberalization and then not liberalizing, i.e. the revenue level conditional on capital consistent with

liberalization but prices consistent with remaining closed.34

    Second, we need to ensure that conditional on not sending the signal, the government does not

choose to liberalize. Define Ugo as the payoff to the government that liberalizes after not sending

sending a signal; Ugo satisfies



                                           Ugo = θu(ṽxo ) + u(ṽm
                                                                 o
                                                                   )                                (10)


where ṽjo ≡ vjo (kj∗c ); j = x, m, i.e. the value of revenues in sector j consistent with not signaling

liberalization and then liberalizing. This will be equal to the revenue level with capital stock levels

consistent with remaining closed but prices consistent with liberalization.

    Our analysis is aided by a lemma:


Lemma 1 Given the signal decision, the change in government utility with liberalization is mono-

tonically increasing in θ.


    Proof: Found in Appendix A.6.

    By Lemma 1 and equations (8) and (9), Ûg ≥ Ûgc if and only if


                                        c − (1 − γ)πc) − u(v o − (1 − γ)πc)
                                    u(ṽm                   m
                             θ≥                                                                     (11)
                                          u(vx o − γπc) − u(ṽxc − γπc)

    Similarly, by Lemma 1 and equations (7) and (10), Ug > Ugo if and only if

                                                      23
                                               u(vm c − u(ṽm o )
                                          θ<                       .                               (12)
                                               u(ṽxo ) − u(vx c )

    If both conditions are satisfied, the government will liberalize after submitting a bid to host the

Olympics; it will not liberalize without sending this signal. We can therefore rule out off-equilibrium

path behavior among all countries if (11) and (12) are satisfied.

    Next we extend our analysis to decisions across a set of heterogeneous countries. We number the

countries such that θ z ≤ θ z+1 . Define θ ∗ as the value of θ z which leaves the government indifferent

between staying closed and not sending the signal, and sending the signal and liberalizing. By

Lemma 1 and equations (7) and (8), θ ∗ satisfies


                                         u(vm c ) − u(vm o − (1 − γ)πc)
                                  θ∗ =                                                             (13)
                                            u(vx o − γπc) − u(vx c )

    We first verify that conditions (11) and (12) are satisfied for θ ∗ . By (13) and (11), a sufficient

(but not necessary) condition for θ ∗ to satisfy (11) is



                                             vx c ≥ ṽxc − γπc.                                    (14)


    Intuitively, this restriction requires that the earnings of the export sector without liberalization

are higher when the government does not send the costly signal. Similarly, a sufficient (but not

necessary) condition for θ ∗ to satisfy (11) is



                                             vxo − γπc ≥ ṽxo .                                    (15)


    Similarly, this restriction requires that the earnings of the export sector with liberalization

are higher when the government sends the (costly) signal. Combined, these restrictions imply that

revenues in the export sector are lower under both off-equilibrium path strategies.




                                                    24
      We adopt these restrictions below (which we reiterate are sufficient but not necessary). This

leads to our first proposition:


Proposition 1 There exists a separating equilibrium where countries with θ z ≥ θ ∗ send the signal

and liberalize, and countries with θ z < θ ∗ neither send the signal nor liberalize.


      Proof: First, consider the set of countries with θ z < θ ∗ . Since the gains from liberalizing are

monotonic in θ by Lemma 1 and we have ruled out off-equilibrium path strategies, these countries’

governments would prefer to not send the signal. Similarly, the countries with governments holding

values of θ z that satisfy θ z ≥ θ ∗ would choose to send the signal and liberalize. We therefore obtain

the separating equilibrium described in the proposition.


7.3    Incidence of Signaling Cost

It can be seen in equation (8) that the desirability of sending the signal and liberalizing is a

function of γ, the share of the cost of sending the signal that is borne by the export sector. Since

liberalization benefits the export sector and harms the import-competing sector, it seems plausible

that the government’s preference for liberalizing is increasing in γ, as it mitigates the disadvantages

from liberalization to the import-competing sector. However, this must be balanced against the

government’s preference for revenues from the export sector, parameterized by θ. If the government

favors the export sector too heavily, this could outweigh the equilibrating impact of an increase in

γ in its utility function, and the desire for liberalization would be decreasing in γ.

      More formally, differentiating θ ∗ with respect to γ in (13) yields


                          ∂θ ∗   πc[θ ∗ u′ (vx o − γπc) − u′ (vm o − (1 − γ)πc)]
                               =                                                 .                 (16)
                          ∂γ                  u(vx o − γπc) − u(vx c )

      The denominator is positive, so the sign of the derivative is equal to the sign of the bracketed

term in the numerator. There are three terms here: θ ∗ ; the marginal utility of the export sector

after liberalization; and the marginal utility of the import sector after liberalization. The entire

                                                    25
term will be negative if and only if


                                              u′ [vm o − (1 − γ)πc]
                                       θ∗ ≤                         .                            (17)
                                                   u′ [vx o − γπc]


    Condition (17) requires that θ ∗ (the relative valuation of export earnings held by the gov-

ernment that is just indifferent between liberalizing and not liberalizing) is less than or equal to

the marginal rate of substitution between post-liberalization earnings in the import-competing and

export sectors. Intuitively, this restriction implies that post-liberalization earnings in the import-

competing sector are sufficiently low relative to those in the export sector, even after adjusting

for the relative weight placed on export earnings (θ ∗ ). For example, in the benchmark case where

the government values earnings in each sector equally (θ ∗ = 1), the condition will be satisfied if

earnings in the export sector subsequent to liberalization, net of its share of the expected cost of

bidding for the games, are less than or equal to those in the import sector, net of their share of the

expected signaling costs.

    Given this condition, we obtain our second proposition:


Proposition 2 Given a separating equilibrium for all countries z ∈ [z, z], and satisfaction of

condition (17), an increase in γ reduces θ ∗ , raising the set of countries that choose to send the

signal and liberalize, while if (17) is violated, an increase in γ increases θ ∗ .


    The proof follows directly from equations (16) and (17). The intuition behind Proposition

2 lies in the fact that increases in γ improve the alignment between the costs and benefits from

liberalization. If the marginal country’s government does not favor the export sector too heavily, an

increase in γ (the exporters’ share of the burden of sending the signal) raises the share of countries

choosing to send the signal and liberalize, since the expected losses to the import-competing sector

are reduced.

    This may favor the use of bidding for the olympics as a signal of openness intentions. The costs

of hosting the Games are traditionally borne by the host city (usually the capital) in conjunction

                                                     26
with the central government of the host country. Policy makers from these groups are likely to

benefit from liberalization. In terms of our model, “mega-events” like the Olympics may be high γ

signals.

     To summarize: our model suggests that countries choose to bid for a mega-event in order to

signal investors about their future liberalization intentions. Under certain parameter conditions,

governments that wish to liberalize can profit from sending the costly signal of bidding to host the

games, while those that do not wish to liberalize do not; a separating equilibrium.

     Our model shows that the conditions imply that the probability-weighted cost of holding the

Olympics must be sufficiently large to dissuade governments that do not wish to liberalize from

sending a false signal. This motivates the choice of a costly mega-event as a signal of liberalization

intentions.

     Further, the model also demonstrates that distributional implications matter; the incidence

of the cost of the signal has an impact on its desirability. The signal must be sufficiently costly

to the export sector, the sector that would benefit from the policy change, not just costly to the

nation. Also, if the government does not favor the export sector too greatly, and liberalization has

sufficient distributional consequences, an increase in share of expected cost of hosting games borne

by the export sector increases the marginal government’s willingness to bid. That is, the higher

is the expected burden of hosting the Olympics on the exportable sector, the more attractive is a

mega-event as a signal of liberalization.



8    Conclusion

In July 2001, Beijing was awarded the right to host the Games of the XXIX Olympiad. Just two

months later, China successfully concluded negotiations with the World Trade Organization, thus

formalizing its commitment to trade liberalization. Nor is this a once-off coincidence. Rome was

awarded the 1960 games in 1955, the same year Italy started to move towards currency convertibility,

joined the UN, and, most importantly, began the Messina negotiations that lead two years later


                                                 27
to the Treaty of Rome and the creation of the European Economic Community. The Tokyo games

of 1964 coincided with Japanese entry into the IMF and the OECD. Barcelona was awarded the

1992 games in 1986, the same year Spain joined the EEC; the decision to award Korea the 1988

games coincided with Korea’s political liberalization. The correlation extends beyond the Olympics;

the 1986 World Cup was held in Mexico coincident with its trade liberalization and entry into

the GATT.35 In this paper, we model this linkage between mega-events and liberalization both

theoretically and empirically.

    The motivation for hosting a mega-event like the Olympics seems elusive to economists. Plau-

sibly measured net economic benefits are rarely large and typically negative; claims of non-economic

benefits are difficult to verify. Yet in practice countries compete fiercely for the right to host such

events. Why? This paper identifies one potential explanation; countries that host the games enjoy

a substantive permanent increase in trade – the “Olympic Effect.” Similar increases in openness

are observed for countries that host other mega-events, such as the World Cup and, until recently,

World’s Fairs. For a country pursuing a trade-oriented development strategy, such an outcome

would clearly be attractive.

    Our empirical results show that the Olympic effect is robust; hosting the games tends to

increase a country’s openness substantively and permanently. But while hosting the games is

sufficient to boost trade, it is not necessary. In practice, we find that countries that bid for the

Olympics unsuccessfully also experience a boost in trade, comparable to that received by actual

Olympic hosts. This finding implies that the Olympic Effect on trade does not stem from a change

in economic fundamentals (which might be associated with a “big push” type of process), caused

by the activity or infrastructure associated with hosting the Olympics. Instead, our empirical

findings suggest that bidding for the Olympics is a costly policy signal that is followed by future

liberalization. We explore this conjecture in a political economy model, where governments choose

whether or not to signal future liberalization by hosting the Olympics. We derive the conditions for

a separating equilibrium, where only countries that value liberalization choose to send the signal

and liberalize. Our model also suggests that the size and distributional consequences of this type


                                                  28
of signal may influence its desirability.

    We close with a number of cautions. First, our model makes no clear statement on the merit

of public support for hosting mega-events. Second, there are other motivations for hosting mega-

events which we have not modeled; for instance, our theory cannot easily explain the behavior of

countries that submit repeated or multiple bids for large sporting events. Finally, other signals of

and routes to liberalization exist, and our analysis does not examine the relative effectiveness of

these paths; we leave such issues to future research.

Appendix A.6: Proof of Lemma 1

Proof: By equations (7) and (10), the difference in government utility from liberalizing subsequent
to not sending the signal satisfies

                           Ugo − Ug = θ[u(ṽxo ) − u(vx c )] + u(ṽm
                                                                   o
                                                                     ) − u(vm c ).               (A.1)

    Differentiating with respect to θ yields

                     ∂(Ugo − Ug )
                                  = u(px o yx (kx∗o ) − φ) − u(px c yx (kx∗o ) − φ) ≥ 0.         (A.2)
                         ∂θ
where φ ≡ (1 + r ∗ )kx∗o . By equations (8) and (9), the difference in government utility from liberal-
izing subsequent to sending the signal satisfies


   Ûg − Ûgc = θ[u(vx o − γπc) − u(ṽxc − γπc)] + [u(vm o − (1 − γ)πc) − u(ṽm
                                                                              c
                                                                                − (1 − γ)πc)].   (A.3)

    Differentiating with respect to θ yields

                           ∂(Ûg − Ûgc )
                                          = u(vx o − γπc) − u(ṽxc − γπc) ≥ 0.                   (A.4)
                                ∂θ
    since vx o ≥ ṽxc . This proves Lemma 1.

Notes
  1
    Wikipedia provides estimates of the cost of the opening ceremony, while Table 2 of the 2008 World Development
Report reports that in Table 2, around a tenth of the 1.3 billion Chinese lived on less than $1/day.
   2
    Another related reference is Greenestone, Hornbeck, and Moretti (2008), who identify productivity spillovers
from new manufacturing plants by comparing the performance of incumbent plants in counties where new plants
locate to finalist “losing counties.”
   3
     We focus our attention on the effects of mega-events on trade rather than trade policy since the latter is difficult
to measure. We have experimented with the Wacziarg-Welch measure of trade liberalization, and find that it is
significantly and positively correlated with past Olympic hosting or candidacy, taking into account time- and country-
effects and controlling for country size and income. This result is quite consistent with the model we develop below.
However, we do not consider this avenue of research to be worth pursuing until we have better empirical measures
and models of trade liberalization.
   4
     We have also clustered our standard errors in other ways, such as by (exporter x year) without changing our
results substantively.
   5
       Even if our standard errors are off by a factor of two or three, the results remain significant.
   6
     If we advance the timing of the Olympic game dummies by five years (to correspond to the typical gap between
a city’s being awarded the games and actually hosting them), essentially no results are changed.
   7
    The IOC states “From 1924 to 1960, all the Winter Olympics, with the exception of Oslo in 1952, were organized
in winter sports resorts.”
   8
     Indeed, the effects of different summer games are also heterogeneous across years; the hypothesis of equal export
effects from all games can be easily rejected at any reasonable significance level. The effects of the Tokyo and Seoul
games is typically estimated to be substantially larger than other effects; the games of Mexico City seem to have had
a smaller effect than most others. This might be an interesting issue to pursue in future research.
   9
       We have also tried to estimate the Olympic effect with short distributed lag models, without much success.
  10
       For the sake of brevity, we do not report estimates for YW ; we rarely find it to be statistically significant.
  11
       That is, we set β2 = β4 = β6 = β7 = β8 = β9 = β10 = β11 = β12 = β13 = β14 = β15 = 0.
  12
    We take our regional groupings from the World Bank, so that they include only developing countries. In particular,
we include dummy variables for: East Asia and the Pacific; Europe and Central Asia; Latin American and the
Caribbean; the Middle East and North Africa; South Asia; and Sub-Saharan Africa.
  13
     Thirteen countries hosted the postwar summer Olympics in our sample, and an additional five have hosted games
but only in the Winter (a number of countries have hosted both, including Canada, Japan, and the USA).
  14
       We use country codes from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics for these classifications.
   15
      Still, the games have recently become so expensive that support from the national authorities is virtually con-
sidered a prerequisite for a successful application.
  16
    These include information related to: travel times; accommodation; taxes; technology; security; natural disasters;
public opinion; the torch relay; test events; government support; customs formalities; the environment; marketing;
Paralympics; medical services; the Olympic village; media operations; and so forth.
  17
     For instance, neither Sweden nor Finland have ever hosted the winter games, despite: a) numerous candidacies
(five by Swedish cities, six by Finnish cities), b) the fact that both countries have successfully hosted the summer
games, c) long winter sporting traditions, and d) the successful hosting of the winter games by a geographically and
economically similar country (Norway).
  18
    Other results suggest that large, wealthier, and more closed countries are more likely to bid for and be awarded
either the Summer or Winter Olympics, relative to countries who do not bid. However, we find no measurable effect
of any characteristic on the determinants of success in being awarded the games, conditional on making a bid.

      Pp 4-5 of “Candidate Cities and Venues for the Winter Olympics” available at
http : //multimedia.olympic.org/pdf /en report 666.pdf which continues: “Cities often apply to host the Olympic
Games in order to bring their urban and regional land development status more up to date. Two different types
of development can be distinguished: developments directly linked to the Games, such as sports facilities and,
parallel developments, such as communications, telecommunications networks, public buildings, etc. These various
developments bring hope that the benefits in terms of employment will be considerable (especially in the building
industry and engineering, commerce and touristic sectors), and more generally, that there will be an increase in the
local and regional economy and tourist trade. They are a long-term investment. The investments necessary are such
that the organising country, as well as the local authorities at all levels, have to make quite a significant financial
effort. The Olympic “frenzy” makes it possible to accelerate the pace of ongoing developments, since the expenses
are covered by special funds.”
  21
    This system worked smoothly through the joint hosting of the 2002 games by Korea and Japan, with only one
exception (the 1954 event was held in Switzerland, while the 1958 event was held in Sweden). We also note in passing
that there has been relatively little competition to host the World Cup, so that we are unable to plausibly compare
hosts and unsuccessful candidates, as we do below for the Olympics. Bids to host the World Cup were unopposed for:
1950, 1954, 1958, 1974, 1978, 1982, and 1986 (first round). In most of the other years, only two candidates were pre-
pared to host the World Cup. More details are available at http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F IF A W orld Cup hosts.
  22
       There were world’s fairs as far back as mid-eighteenth century, but these are less well-known.
  23
     Using “candidates” to refer to locales that bid for but were not awarded the games is not rigorous Olympic
jargon. The broadest set of cities is currently referred to by the Olympic movement as the set of “Applicant” cities,
which are potential hosts nominated by national Olympic committees. After a phase of about ten months some of
these are then chosen to become “Candidate” cities on the basis of a questionnaire and technical assessments. The
relevant criteria investigated include: government support, public opinion, general infrastructure, security, venues,
accommodation and transport. The candidate cities then go through a second phase of investigation by an evaluation
commission which includes another questionnaire and a site inspection. This information forms the basis for a report
issued by the commission, and the IOC then votes on the basis of the report. So, strictly speaking, “candidates”
include all finalists, both successful and unsuccessful.
  24
     This is analogous to, e.g., the use of losing finalist counties in Greenestone, Hornbeck, and Moretti (2008) as the
counterfactual to measure productivity spillovers from new manufacturing plants.
  25
       Twenty-five countries have either bid for or hosted the summer games since WWII.
  26
    Indeed, a similar argument has been made recently of the ongoing Asian race to put a man on the moon. In
“Why China wants to win” published in the International Herald Tribune on November 12, 2008, John Lee notes
that a moon-shot costs in excess of $100 billion, with little to show in the way of direct economic benefit. However,
he argues that the prestige associated with getting to moon matters for national pride “which can serve as a unifying
force” as well as to enhance the “soft power” of the nation and command respect from foreign powers. He writes that
“Growing its economic and military might is about demonstrating the country’s capability.”
  27
    Estimating our model with the non-linear method of Anderson and Van Wincoop (2003) would be computationally
challenging in the extreme, as would be including a comprehensive set of time-varying exporter- and importer-specific
fixed effects.
  28
       We also include as controls the logs of population, real GDP per capita, and include year and country fixed-effects.
  29
       We assume that bidding has no effect per se on the economy’s fundamentals.
  30
     We assume that capital markets are open throughout (while liberalization only takes place in goods markets)
for simplicity. The effect of generalizing the model to allow for liberalization of frictions in international capital
movements would be ambiguous, depending on whether opening capital markets would favor the import or export
sectors. This could depend in part on the relative capital intensity of these sectors. However, in cases where the
liberalization of capital markets would favor the export sector, the results should mirror those we find for trade
liberalization.
  31
     As discussed above, the IOC has explicit criteria for selecting the Olympic host. Almost all these criteria concern a
candidate’s abilities to host the games successfully, ignoring any benefit that the candidate might receive from hosting


                                                             45
the games. We could easily augment the model by making the selection process a function of these characteristics.
This would not change our qualitative results, as long as there was some residual amount of uncertainty about the
selection. As noted above, there seems to be a considerable amount of such randomness.
  32
     We know of only one counter-example; Denver backed out of hosting the winter games in 1976 when voters
rejected a bond issue to finance the event. Similarly, we also rule out signals by countries that have no chance of
winning the rights to host the games. This assumption is implicit in our specification that π, the probability of
winning hosting rights conditional on bidding, is common across countries. By way of contrast, many countries have
promised to liberalize trade without following through.
  33
    The welfare function is specified in terms of earnings in each sector for simplicity. This function is assumed to
encompass all proceeds in these sectors relevant for the consumption of private agents, including any redistribution
of government tariff revenues and the effects of other trade distortions that yield differential valuations of domestic
prices under closed and open policies.
  34
    In practice, the false signal could also affect domestic prices, as it affects the domestic capital allocation across
sector. As a result, the “closed prices” under off-equilibrium path strategies may differ from those specified above.
Accordingly, we state our conditions for separating equilibria below in terms of sectoral revenues under these strategies,
which implicitly include any secondary price distortions associated with capital allocations due to false signaling.
  35
     There are also examples of unsuccessful Olympic candidates who liberalized. For instance, South Africa began
a dramatic trade liberalization in the mid 1990s while it mounted (and lost) its bid to host the 2004 Olympics (the
choice of Athens was announced in September 1997). In the words of the WTO “South Africas average most favoured
nation (MFN) tariff rates for all goods fell from over 14% in 1996 to 8% in 2001; the MFN rates for industrial goods
also fell by 50% and 55% for textiles and clothing respectively over the same period...”
