                  The New Economics of Accelerated Depreciation


                                    ABSTRACT




     The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 included the largest business tax cut

in   U.S. history, embodied in the Accelerated Cost Recovery System. This paper

describes in detail the provisions of the new treatment of depreciable property,

and analyzes in a fairly nontechnical way its economic impact.

     Particular attention is paid to a novel part of ACRS that creates a "safe

harbor" for a wide range of sale—leaseback arrangements, effectively permitting

the sale of depreciation deductions by investors without taxable income.

   The Economic Recovery Tax Act (hereafter ERTA) of 1981 included several

significant changes in the tax law that together represent the most substantial

cut in corporate and personal income taxes since their introduction in 1913. A

particularly important and controversial element of ERTA is the radical change

in business depreciation practice introduced by the Accelerated Cost Recovery

System (hereafter ACRS). Under ACRS, tax lifetimes are, in general, substan-

tially reduced; there are now only three distinct depreciation   classes1 where

there previously were well over a hundred; the investment tax credit has been

liberalized; and a "safe harbor" has been created for a broad class of leasing

arrangements to permit firms without taxable income effectively to sell their

depreciation allowances and investment credits to corporations with taxable

income. These changes, to be fully phased in by the end of 1985, are expected

ultimately to produce a large revenue loss to the Treasury, with estimates

varying from       billion dollars2 to 61.3 billion dollars3 for fiscal year

1986.   In comparison, the total collection of the corporate income tax amounted

to 6.6 billion dollars in l98O) Thus, it would appear that, as a source of

revenue, the corporate tax has been eliminated to a great extent. However,

while this may be true in the aggregate, some significant differences remain,

and others have been introduced, in the tax treatment of different investments

and different investors that would not have existed had the corporate tax simply

been phased out.

    This acceleration of depreciation allowances is likely to have important

consequences for the mix and level of investment in the U.S. over the next

several years. After reviewing the history of investment incentives in the U.S.,

we will examine the new tax law, as it relates to depreciation, and compare it

with alternatives that arose during the policy discussion leading up to the

passage of the Economic Recovery Tax   Act.   In Section IV, we review the criteria

economists use in evaluating changes in the tax treatment of investment.

Section V presents an economic analysis of ACRS, and also touches on the rela-

tive merits of some of the other recent proposals alluded to above. Section VI

reviews separately a particularly important part of ACRS, the liberalization of

sale—leaseback arrangements, and the last section offers some concluding com-

ments on the state of the corporate income tax.

I.   A Brief History of Investment Incentives in the U.S.

     The first major change in the tax law aimed specifically at encouraging

business investment was the Revenue Act of l954, which permitted purchasers of

assets two forms of "accelerated" depreciation for tax purposes as alternatives

to the normal practice of the time, straight—line depreciation. The two new

methods, sum of the years digits and double declining balance, both permit a

large fraction of an asset's depreciation deductions to be taken in the years

shortly after its acquisition. This shifting of deductions toward earlier years

is equivalent to an interest—free loan to the purchaser, since it allows a

deferral of tax payments to later years with no increase in the amount due.

     Other major changes in depreciation practice before 1981 occured in 1962 and

1911. The introduction of depreciation guidelines by the Treasury in 1962 per-

mitted investors to write assets off over a shorter period than had been typi-

cally true before. The Revenue Act of 1911 created the Asset Depreciation Range

(ADR) system, under which the purchaser of a qualifying asset was permitted to

select a tax lifetime of between 80 and 120 percent of the 1962 guideline life

established for the appropriate asset class. The ADR system applied to personal

property (equipment), but not depreciable real property (structures). Moreover,

its election made the tax accounting more complicated for the investor. Added

complexity has been offered as one explanation for the fact that many smaller

businesses had failed to adopt ADR, even several years after its introduction,5

and also continued to use straight—line depreciation rather than one of the

accelerated methods 6

     The other    major element of tax system with a direct and narrow effect on
investment   is   the investment tax credit (ITc). Introduced in the Revenue Act
                                       _)4


of   1962 at a rate of 7 percent on new investment, it was suspended for a brief

period between 1966 and 1961, "permanently" removed in 1969, reintroduced in

1911, and increased to 10 percent in the Tax Reduction Act of 1915. Like the

Asset Depreciation Range, the ITC did not (and still does not) apply to depre-

ciable real property, and applied at reduced rates for short—lived equipment

with tax lives of less than seven years. This last feature of the ITC consti-

tuted the main reason an investor would have for using ADR to elect a tax life-

time in excess of an asset's guideline life.

     While not limited to income from investment, tax rate reductions, especially

in the corporate sector, have been viewed as a way of stimulating investment

activity. Except for a ten percent surcharge during the Viet Nam War, the cor-

porate tax has drifted downward during the last two decades, with a reduction to

15 percent from 52 percent in l961 and a further reduction to 46   percent   in

1978.

     Econometric evidence varies on the degree of stimulus provided by each of

these changes in the tax law, though there is general agreement among economists

that tax incentives do influence the scale and type of investment that occurs.1

The formulation and adoption in 1981 of the Accelerated Cost Recovery System

grew in part from a general perception that not enough investment in plant and

equipment was taking place.

II.   The Accelerated Cost Recovery System

      The key aspect of ACRS is the shortening and simplification of depreciation

schedules applicable to personal and real property. A number of its other pro-

visions were necessitated by this acceleration of depreciation allowances.

      Effective January 1, 1981, most new personal (section l245) property quali-

fies for one of two depreciation classes. Autos, light—duty trucks, and other

personal property with a midpoint life of four years or less under the old ADR

system qualify for a three—year write—off. bst other equipment may be depre-

ciated over five years. Important exceptions are long—lived public utility

property. Such property with an ADR midpoint life of between eighteen and

twenty—five years now may depreciated over ten years, while a fifteen—year

write—off is permitted for public utility assets with an ADR midpoint life

greater than twenty—five years. Real (section 1250) property is assigned to a

fifteen—year recovery period. This system of few depreciation classes and fast

write—off   is essentially the Capital Cost Recovery Act, or the "ten—five—three"
scheme originally propsed by Congressmen Conable and Jones in 1979, except that
the   recovery period for real property has been lengthened.

      The use of January 1, 1981, as the effective date for the legislation was

meant to fulfill the promise given during the legislative debate that all

investment occuring then would qualify for the new liberalized tax treatment.

Property purchased before 1981 does not qualify for ACRS, but used property

purchased after January 1, 1981, does. That is, ACRS applies to all property

purchased by the current owner after the effective date, regardless of when the

asset was originally manufactured, sold and placed in service. This application
                                        —6—




of   ACES to used property is limited to "real" transactions by a series of

"anti—churning" rules. For transfers between related parties or sale—leaseback

arrangements, the latter also receiving greatly liberalized treatment under ACRS

(see below), the purchaser must continue previous depreciation practice.

     The new legislation also specifies the pattern of depreciation allowances to

be used for each of the recovery classes. For personal property placed in ser-

vice between 1981 and 19814, the allowances mimic the use of 150 percent

declining balance with a switch—over to straight—line in the second year and

adoption   of the half—year convention, under which all assets purchased in a

given tax year are treated as if they were purchased six months into the year.

For 1985, the schedule for new personal property approximates 175 percent

declining balance with a second—year switchover to sum—of—the—years digits. For

1986 and after, the pattern of allowances follows 200 percent declining balance

with a second—year switchover to sum—of—the—year's—digits. These recovery sche-

dules are summarized in ble 1. It should be noted that the switchover to

straight—line or sum—of—the—year's—digits in the second year does not

necessarily maximize the value of switching over to the investor. For example,

for 1981—19814, a switchover to straight—line in the third year would give a

larger second year allowance for assets in the five—year class.

     For real property in the fifteen—year recovery class, except low income ren-

tal housing, allowances are not specified in the law but are supposed to

approximate the benefits of using 175 percent declining balance with an optimal

switchover   to straight—line. Low income housing qualifies for 200 percent

declining balance with a switchover to straight—line. Unlike the rules for per-

sonal property, no half—year convention is applied here.

         In addition to the above depreciation schedules, investors may also

elect to use straight—line over the entire recovery period, or to use straight—

line over one of two "extended" recovery periods specified for each recovery

class. For purposes of calculating earnings and profits to determine whether

dividends are taxable or represent a return of capital, the shorter of the

extended recovery periods and straight—line depreciation must be used, unless

the longer extended recovery period is elected for tax purposes, in which case

it must be used for calculating earnings and profits. This provision represents

an attempt to prevent the "losses" at the corporate level generated by ACRS from

spilling over into the personal tax treatment of corporate distributions. Under

previous law, the same lifetime applied to the calculation of earnings and pro-

fits and the calculation of tax depreciation (although straight—line was always

assumed for the former). The use of different lifetimes for the two calcula-

tions is consonant with the view that the recovery periods are no longer

intended to bear any close relationship to the concept of an asset's "useful

life".

    As a result of the shortening of recovery periods for asset depreciation, a

number of other issues had to be addressed as part of the same tax legislation.

First of all, so that assets in the three—year recovery class would not be

limited to an investment tax credit of 3—1/3 percent (whereas many such assets

previously could qualify for the full 10 percent credit through the use of the ADR
                              —9—

system), the credit for this class was set at 6 percent. Similarly, all other

personal property, in the five, ten and fifteen year classes, receives the full

10 percent credit.

       A second related issue is the recapture of accelerated depreciation upon the

sale of an asset. The treatment of personal property remains the same: all sale

proceeds representing prior depreciation are taxed at ordinary rather than term

capital gains rates. For example, the sale of an asset purchased for 100

dollars, with a current basis of 20 dollars, will result in the ordinary taxa-

tion of the difference between the sale price and 20 dollars for any    sale   price

up to 100 dollars and capital gains taxation of any amount by which sale price

exceeds 100 dollars. The treatment of real property is exactly the same if

straight—line is not used. If straight—line is used, then the previous method

of recapture for real property applies: only the difference between straight—

line basis and actual basis (in this case zero) is subject to ordinary income

taxation. Thus, a disincentive has been introduced against the use of the full

ACRS depreciation benefits for those purchasers of real estate who intend to

sell after a reasonably short period.

    The recapture of the investment credit is similar to previous law. It must

'be "given   back"     rata (though without interest) if the period the asset was

held   before   resale was less than the mininum specified for full credit. Thus,

an asset in the five year class sold after three years would have to pay back 140

percent of the credit originally received. The ERTA also increases, to 125

thousand dollars in 1981 and 150 thousand dollars in 1985 (from 100 thousand
                                         —11—




dollars currently), the amount of newly purchased used property to which an

investor can appy the investment tax credit. To the extent of this limitation,

it is now possible to obtain the full ITC every five years on a qualifying asset

through resale.

       The final issue raised by the large acceleration of depreciation allowances

is that many taxpayers will be thrown into the position of having a net

operating loss, for tax purposes. Since the income tax is not refundable, this

would impose a limitation on the extent to which the tax benefits of the new

legislation could be obtained. One method of lessening this effect was the

increase in carry over period for net operating losses and the investment tax

credit to fifteen years from the previously permitted three year carry back and

seven   year carry forward. However, this extension of the carryover period only
partially   extends the range of   firms capable of benefitting from ACRS. Firms
with   a record of losses or new firms without any record of profit or loss must

still carry net operating losses forward, which involves a loss in interest on

the delayed depreciation deductions as well as a cash flow constraint. Th

increase further the coverage of ACRS, the Economic Recovery Tax Act created a

"safe harbor" for a broad range of sale—leaseback arrangements, the effect of

which is to allow transactions which are very similar to the outright sale of

depreciation deductions and investment tax credits. Basically, as long as the

lessor is a corporation and has an "at risk" investment of at least 10 percent

of the asset's adjusted basis throughout the lease, the transaction will be

characterized as a lease. Among the things allowed within this "safe harbor"
                                     —12—



are financing of the other 90 percent of the purchase price by the lessee;

retention by the lessee of nominal ownership of the property for other legal

purposes (e.g. title possession and payment of local property taxes, etc.) and

resale arrangements whereby the lessor is obligated to sell the asset back to

the lessee at the termination of the lease below fair market value. With these

provisions, it is possible (see the example in Section vi) to structure a lease

so that lessor and lessee need exchange money only at the commencement of the

lease. Such an arrangement would appear to make the lease indistinguishable

from the simple sale of depreciation allowances and investment credits.

However, while there have been recent Treasury regulations on this issue, it is not

yet entirely clear that lessors can fully escape all risks associated with the

potential bankruptcy of lessees. Moreover, in the case of mass transportation

equipment owned by state and local governments and financed by tax—exempt bonds,

the current leasing arrangements allow the lessee to be a non—taxable entity.

This makes it possible for such an government to "sell" credits and depreciation

allowances for which it would never be eligible itself.

    As always, the revenue cost of such a large tax reduction as ACRS is dif-

ficult to measure with any precision, because such a calculation requires esti-

mates of how much investment (and other sources of revenue) will occur with ACRS

as well as how much would have occurred without ACRS. While macroeconomic

models exist and can be applied for such purposes, one can have confidence only

in the rough magnitudes rather than the exact values of predictions. This is

not a fault of the model—builders; there is simply too much uncertainty about the

future to make precise forcasts. Nevertheless, it is interesting to examine the

revenue costs that have been projected for ACRS.
                                      —13—


    Table 3 presents estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Office

of Tax Analysis of the Treasury of the annual revenue loss that will occur

because of the adoption of ACRS during the fiscal years 1981—1986. The estima-

tes, which are quite similar, predict an annual loss which grows steadily

throughout the period, and presumably, would continue to grow if calculations

for later years were available. There are three reasons for this growth.

First, as the nominal amount of investment grows (through real growth as well as

inflation) so will the depreciation deductions and investment credits received.

Moreover, only that fraction of capital purchased after 1981 will be receiving

the new depreciation allowances. As the years pass, this will include a larger

and larger fraction of the total capital stock. Finally, the phase—in provi-

sion, for personal property, of the degree of acceleration of deductions over

the specified recovery period, must also contribute to a growth in revenue cost.

    While these numbers are large by historical standards, they appear small

relative to the revenue losses projected by OTA and JCT resulting from the per-

sonal tax cut. For example, JCF projects a loss of 196 billion dollars in 1986

alone from personal tax cuts,8 while OTA estimates the loss to be 17J4 billion

dollars.9   However, these numbers are not really comparable to the estimates

for ACRS since, even with a constant rate of inflation, "bracket creep" caused

by the progressivity of the individual rate schedule would have caused the tax

receipts to rise. No similar increase is built into the corporate tax, since

the tax rate on virtually all income is the same. Thus, a large portion of the

individual rate cut is not really a tax cut in the same   sense   that all of ACRS

is.10

III: Other Proposals

    While effective opposition to ACHS never surfaced in Congress, there were a

number of alternatives proposed by members of the House and Senate as well as

the Carter Administration, beginning in 1980. One proposal, passed by the

Senate Finance Committee in the summer of 1980, would have established four,

rather than two recovery classes for personal property, excluding public utility

property, with lengths of two, four, seven and ten years rather than three and

five.11   Under "2——1—lO," assets in the two and four year classes were to

receive an investment tax credit of 2.5 and 6 percent, respectively, with the

other classes receiving the full credit. Public utility property was given a

liberalized   AJJR variance of 30 percent, but otherwise unaffected. Investors in
real property were allowed a twenty—year lifetime, with straight—line depre-
ciation, and   the option of using a fifteen—year straight—line write—off for low

income rental housing and a fifteen—year, 150 percent declining balance write-

off for owner—occupied non—residential structures. The bill also would have cut

the top corporate tax rate to 1i.L percent.

    The pattern of depreciation allowances to be applied to assets in the four

personal property classes was somewhat novel. The investor would have been per-

mitted to use 200 percent, 150 percent or 100 percent declining balance, but

these percentages were to be applied to the total basis of all assets owned by

the investor in the relevant recovery class, rather than separately to assets of

different ages. M3reover, the percentage declining balance could be changed

annually at the discretion of the investor. Finally, current recapture rules

for personal property would have been replaced by the requirement that the sale
                                       —i6.-



price of an asset of which an owner had disposed be deducted from the basis of

all relevant recovery class accounts; assets sold were thus to be treated in a

way symmetrical to assets purchased.

    A main benefit of this system of aggregate personal property depreciation

was its simplicity, replacing "vintage accounts" kept for assets by recovery

class and year of purchase with "open—ended accounts" for all assets in each

class. This type of simplification only could be possible in conjunction with

the move to a constant rate declining balance forraila, since the age structure

of the assets being depreciated then would have no effect on the total amount of

deductions; only the basis of each asset would be relevant, and these could be

added together before, rather than after, the application of the percentage

depreciation rate. Since ACRS uses combinations of depreciation methods, rather

than a single declining balance formula for each recovery class, it requires

continuance of the more complicated vintage account system.

    The scheme put forward by the Carter Administration in 1980, referred to as

"constant—rate depreciation", was similar to 2_14_7_l0 in that it called for a

reduction in the number of capital recovery classes (to 30) and the application

of a constant—rate declining balance formula to open—ended recovery accounts.

Neither 2_1_7_lO nor constant—rate depreciation would have provided tax reduc-

tions as large as those given by ACRS. This can be seen clearly from Table ,

which compares the revenue costs of the forerunner to ACRS, 10—5—3, with those

of 2_I_7_1Q and CRD. (The 74.5 billion dollar loss in 1986 under 10—5—3 exceeds

those for ACRS cited above because of changes such as the lengthening of the

real property recovery period.) Two other proposed changes in depreciation

practice would have replaced the stream of depreciation deductions reeceived by

an asset over its tax lifetime, or recovery period, with a single deduction in

the year of purchase. Under the First Year Capital Recovery System (FYCRS),

originally formulated by Alan Auerbach and Dale Jorgenson12, each asset would

have been assigned a capital recovery deduction in the year of purchase equal

to a certain fraction of full purchase price, with the exact value of this frac-

tion varying across classes of assets according to durability. Very short—lived

assets would have received nearly a dollar in allowances for each dollar spent,

while very long—lived assets would have been given less than half of the

purchase price as a deduction.

    The method of calculating such first—year allowances was to estimate the

fraction of its value an asset would lose during each year of its productive

life, and take the present value of such annual measures of "economic

depreciation" using a discount rate of   percent.   For example, an asset

purchased for 100 dollars new, and expected to lose one—tenth of its value every

year, would receive a deduction of $71.143, or about 71—1/2 cents for each dollar

of capital purchased-3. Like 2—b—7—l0, FYCRS would have introduced symmetric

treatment to the disposal of assets, with sellers including in income the same

amount that purchasers could deduct, the sale price niiltiplied by the first—year

allowance. It would also have been very simple, for assets would always have a

basis of zero, eliminating the need for record—keepping. Some versions of the

first year system also called for a repeal of the investment tax credit.
                                      —19—


    A related, but simpler and considerably more generous proposal, was made by

Democrats in the House shortly before the adoption of ACRS in 1981. This would

have permitted a full, rather than fractional, write—off of personal property in

the first—year of acquisition, repealed the investment tax credit, and gradually

brought the corporate rate down to 3)4 percent. The revenue loss for this plan

was thought to be similar to ACRS.

    All proposals, both ACRS and various others, stressed simplicity, and most

would have lowered to some extent the tax burden on capital investment.

However, they differed in a number of respects important from an economic

perspective, including

    (1) the overall tax burden on investment;

    (2) the distribution of this tax burden across different assets;

    (3) the sensitivity of this burden to inflation;

    (4) the revenue loss per dollar of investment; and

    (5) the distribution of incentives between the investments of taxable and

         non—taxable investors.

IV. Evaluation   Criteria

    To explore these differences and their importance, it is necessary to

discuss first the economic criteria that are involved. First of all, it has

long been recognized that virtually all taxes distort economic behavior. This

reduction in economic efficiency is referred to as the "deadweight loss" or

"excess burdent' of the tax system. While it may be inevitable that some effi-

ciency be sacrificed in order to raise revenue, not all taxes impose the same

excess burden per dollar of revenue raised. Some tax structures are more effi-

cient than others, and the area of study called t1optil tax theory" seeks to

characterize tax systems that are relatively efficient. While the results of

such work are fairly complicated, certain basic rules do come out. First, it is

usually more efficient to tax activities (e.g. types of income or purchases)

that are relatively unresponsive to price changes. For example, how high the

overall tax burden on savings and investment ought to be, from an efficiency

perspective, would depend on how responsive savings is to changes in the after—

tax rate of return15. A second general rule is that it is relatively inef-

ficient to raise revenue through a distortion of production activity. Such a

distortion would arise in the allocation of capital, for example, if different

types of investment were taxed at different rates. Such differential taxation

would cause a shift of investment into the more lightly taxed types of asset.

The term "neutrality" is often used to describe a tax sytem that does not

distort production efficiency. Of course, full neutrality with respect to the

allocation of capital would call for comparable treatment of nonbusiness capital

and business capital. The former consists mostly of owner—occupied housing,
                                      —21—



which currently receives very favorable treatment under the tax law. To the

extent that taxes on capital are higher in the business sector, any proposal

which lowers them, by effecting a shift of capital from residential to non-

residential uses, would increase allocative efficiency.

    A related issue is how the tax treatment of assets is influenced by changes

in the inflation rate. Under any capital recovery system where depreciation

allowances are based on original cost, the effect of inflation is to lower the

real value of future depreciation allowances. Their dollar value is unaffected,

but they are worth less in terms of purchasing power. This effect of inflation

may reduce economic efficiency for two reasons. First, in raising the overall

tax burden on investment income to what might be an inefficiently high level

arid, second, in its differential impact across different investments, leading

to production distortions.

    How much "bang per buck" a tax reduction has, i.e., how much new investment

will be generated by reductions in tax revenue, depends on at least three fac-

tors. First, how effective is the tax reduction at focusing on the behavior it

seeks to encourage? In the current context, this depends on the treatment of

old versus new assets. Plans that reduce the tax burden on income from existing

assets are more costly because only part of the tax reduction goes toward

encouraging new investmentl6. Second, how is the plan phased in over time? It

is possible to encourage or discourage investment today through the changes in

tax structure that are scheduled to occur in the near future. An example of

this is the phasing in under ACRS of the full depreciation deductions for per-

sonal property investments between 1981 and 1986. Third, how responsive is
                                      —22—




investment to tax incentives? This depends on a number of factors, including

the responsiveness of businesses to changes in the tax treatment of investment

income as well as the responsiveness of savers to the net rate of return. The

latter matters because if a tax cut does stimulate investment, businesses will

seek more funds in the capital market. As they do so, the price of funds, the

interest rate, will be bid up. How high it must go depends on how responsive

savers are to its increase. Empirical evidence on this savings responsiveness is

weak. Evidence on the responsiveness of business to tax incentives suggests

that previous changes in depreciation schedules and the investment tax credit

have led to increased investment, although different views exist about the

magnitudes involved-T.

    Finally an issue relevant to the current discussion is the treatment of

similar assets purchased by different investors, particularly those with and

without taxable income. Because investment incentives are often considered when

at least some sectors of the econonr are in recession, the need to have taxable

income to offset increased deductions or credits may restrict the ability of

many firms to take advantage of the tax cut. Whether this is economically

desirable is open to question. On one side is the argument that full coverage

(via refundability, for example) encourages poorly managed companies to continue

operation. On the other hand, profits as measured for tax purposes only vaguely

resemble real economic earnings, and the "bad management" argument can not be

fairly applied to new firms without any earnings history. Indeed, the indirect-

ness and complication of the new "safe harbor" leasing included in ACRS seems

to have been aimed in part at satisfying proponents on each side of this argu-

ment.

V.   The Economics of ACRS

     The design of ACRS limits the ability of investors to get any additional tax

benefits for assets first put in service before January 1, 1981. In this sense,

it should have a large "bang per buck" relative to other proposals that included

a reduction in corporate taxes, since the latter would have reduced taxes even

for those making no new investments.     As indicated above, the anti—churning

rules prevent a taxpayer from obtaining ACRS benefits on property the taxpayer

put in service prior to 1981. And, while it    is   possible under the statute to

obtain   ACRS on used property through a transfer of ownership, the full tax bene-
fits might be negative. This is because the prospective increase in depre-
ciation allowances   would be accompanied by an immediate recapture of earlier

deductions. For example, suppose a piece of equipment was purchased for 100

dollars, received the investment tax credit, now has a basis of zero and a

potential sale price of 1O dollars. If a sale occurred, the seller would pay

taxes immediately on ).O dollars of income, while the purchaser could take deduc-

tions equal to 1O dollars over five years. If they were in the same tax

bracket, the taxes paid by the seller would exceed, in present value, the taxes

avoided by the purchaser. Only to the limited extent that the investment tax

credit could be taken again might this transaction be worthwhile. For struc-

tures, the tax on recapture would be lower because of the capital gains treat-

ment of the gain over straight—line basis. However, the present value of

prospective deductions under ACRS also would be smaller, for the deductions must

be taken over a period of fifteen rather than five years. While particular

cases in which a sale would generate tax benefits are possible, this does not

appear to be a large problem, particularly because this type of sale cannot be

done in conjunction with a sale—leaseback arrangement.
                                          — 2b —




    The   other part of the "bang per buck" question concerns the phase—in of
ACRS for personal property. Because investments made in 1986 (and 1985,      to a
lesser extent)   will receive more favorable treatment than assets purchased in

1981   through 1984,   some investors who possess a degree of flexibility in the

timing   of their purchases may wait   until 1986 to invest. This will lessen the

expansionary effect of ACRS in the next four years. Whether this is good or bad

from a macroeconomic perspective largely depends on the severity of the current

recession and how expansionary the rest of the federal government's tax—

expenditure program ultimately turns out to be.

    In order to evaluate the burden imposed on different investments under ACRS,

we calculate and display in ble 5 values, discounted at an after—tax rate of

12 percent, of depreciation allowances received by typical investments in the

three, five and fifteen years classes. For the three and five year classes, the

deduction equivalent to the investment credit (for a corporation in the top

bracket), labelled "A", is also calculated to obtain the combined effect of

investment related credits and deductions. These values rise over time for the

personal property classes because of the phase—in, but exceed one even in 1981.

This means that the combination of depreciation deductions and the investment

credit offers a greater tax shield than immediate expensing without the ITC, the

alternative proposed by House Democrats in 1981. This is not the case for most

structures, which receive the equivalent of about fifty—five cents in deductions

per dollar invested.

    A useful way of understanding these numbers is to ask what reduction in tax

rate the investor would require in exchange for giving up the credits and deduc—

tions of ACRS for those consistent with economic depreciation; that is, what

effective tax rate on true economic income is imposed by the combination of a

statutory tax rate of 16 percent on investment tax credit and a rapid write—off.

To derive this effective tax rate, we imist know what the economic depreciation

of assets actually is, and must make assumptions about the inflation rate and

the real after—tax rate of return earned by corporations on their investments.

Table 6 presents effective tax rate calculations for five representative types

of investment in the three main recovery classes. For a real discount rate, we

use L percentl8. Estimates of declining—balance rates of economic depreciation

are obtained from a recent U.S. Treasury study.19 Effective tax rates for each

asset are computed for inflation rates of 6 percent and 8 percent.

       Perhaps the most startling result in Table 6 is that most of the tax rates

are negative: investors would prefer ACRS to the abolition of corporate taxa-

tion, for assets in the three—year and five—year recovery classes. This outcome

is perfectly possible, and consistent with the results in Table 5, where such

assets were found to have equivalent deductions and credits in excess of imrne—

diate write—off. In fact, these conditions are the same. As others have

pointed out in the past, immediate write—off converts the corporate tax to a

"partnership" where government bears an equal percentage of   costs   and receipts,

with   each "partner" earning the before—tax rate of return on investment.
Hence, a system more generous than immediate write—off is equivalent to govern-
ment bearing   a greater fraction of the initial cost than it receives of the

future   flows: it is subsidizing the project. Furthermore, these calculations
assume no debt is used to finance the project. Since interest payments are tax

deductible, these additional tax savings would make the effective tax rates more

negative for projects financed in part by borrowing.

    These negative tax rates differ across types of personal property, but the

key difference is between personal property and real property. At an inflation

rate of 6 percent, the effective tax rates on industrial buildings and general

industrial equipment would differ by almost 98 percentage points after 1985.

This poses an enormous distortion in the allocation of industrial capital.

    Aside from differing by asset class, the effective tax rates also depend on

the inflation rate that prevails. This is because, depreciation allowances

received in future years are eroded to the extent that prices rise between the

date of purchase and the date of the allowance. These rates rise more for the

personal property classes, though they are still negative at an inflation rate

of 8 percent. In fact, it would take a long—run inflation rate of 14 percent to

bring the post—1985 effective tax rate out of the negative range.

    These effective tax rates, especially those for equipment, are substantially

lower than those that would have applied had any of the alternative to ACRS

discussed above been enacted. For example, under "2—1—7—l0", the effective tax

rates at 8 percent inflation would have been —0.50 percent for trucks, buses and

trailers, +0.65 percent for construction machinery and +0.85 percent for

general industrial equipment2° ——   virtually   the same as in the House expensing

proposal. The Carter Administration proposal specifically precluded the total

tax benefits for any asset from exceeding those of expensing. Under the First—

Year System with no investment tax credit, the effective tax rate would have

been 16 percent for all assets.
                                      —29--




     The effective tax rates under ACRS are also more sensitive to inflation than

would have been true under either the expensing or First Year proposals. Since

each of the latter two plans offered a deduction only in the year of purchase,

the value of such deductions would not have been influenced by fluctuations in

the rate of inflation.

     Aside from the distortion caused by such large differences in tax rates

among investments competing for the same funds, it is not necessarily efficient

to tax corporate capital income at a rate near or below zero, in the aggre-

gate.21   However, given that such rates were being set, a serious problem of

coverage would have arisen had not something like the safe—harbor for leasing

been created at the same time. Indeed, this problem would have become more

acute over the years, as greater fractions of the assets owned by companies fell

under ACRS. The tax losses generated by even profitable investments would, for

a number of companies, outweigh taxable income generated by real property,

pre—1981 depreciable assets and non—depreciable assets. Indeed, the revenue cost

estimates of ACRS cited in the introduction are so large a part of total cor-

porate tax collections that this problem is obvious without detailed calcula—

t ions.

VI. Leasing

      The new safe—harbor leasing rules make it possible to structure a transac-

tion so that "lessor" makes a single, initial payment to "lessee", obtains in

return the investment tax credit and depreciation deductions on the designated

property, and all contact between the two parties may then cease. However, the

exact details of the agreement will determine how much the lessor is willing to

pay   for   the credits and deductions. One purpose of the analysis that follows is

to show this and to give a numerical example of one such hypothetical transac-

tion.

      Another issue that arises in the discussion of leasing is the question of

whether it should be available to all firms with tax losses. Imagine two types

of firms with current net operating losses and without the availability of a

carry back against previous taxable income. rpe I, the "high growth" firm, has

"losses" primarily because of the amount of investment it is undertaking. It

will have profits in future years. The pe II firm, of which Chrysler might be

an example, already has lots of tax losses to carry forward. Even if its

current investments generate a taxable profit, this company will be able to off-

set such profit using its net operating loss carry forwards. For the forseeable

future, it is essentially non—taxable. Without leasing, both would have to

carry forward those tax benefits associated with the ITC and depreciation deduc-

tions. Even with taxable income in the future to offset by these losses, the

companies would receive a lower present discounted value from these tax shields.

In the case of rpe I firms, this would put them at a competitive disadvantage
                                       —31—



with firms having taxable income: they would have to pay taxes on their gross

 income when earned, but carry forward their deductions at the beginning.

Leasing would put them on a par with taxable firms. However, since Type II

firms expect to pay no tax on their earnings, should they, too, be allowed the

full value of their deductions? The apparent answer is no, that this would give

them a tax advantage over the other types of firm. However, as we discuss

below, the problem is really more complicated because of the presence of

interest deductibility.

    Under a typical leasing arrangement, the lessee purchases (or already has

purchased) the property in question. The lessor "purchases" it, using up to 90%

borrowed money, which we shall assume is lent by the lessee. Over the period of

the lease, the lessor gets the opportunity to take the applicable investment

tax credit and depreciation deductions. The lessor makes payments of principal

and interest to the lessee on the outstanding loan, while the lessee makes

payments on the lease. At the end of the term of the lease, the lessor pays off

the balance of the loan and the lessee "repurchases" the equipment at a price

specified in the lease. By arranging for principal and interest payments to

equal lease payments, and for the repurchase price to equal the terminal loan

balance, the parties to the lease need exchange money only upon the initial

purchase. Moreover, to avoid recapture, they can arrange for the repurchase

price to be nearly zero.

    Under such an agreement, the lessor would have to pay taxes over the course

of the lease on the difference between lease payments made by the lessee and

interest payments made to the lessee. Similarly, the lessee, if taxable in

future years, would get the benefit of tax deductions of equal size. Thus, the
                                                —32—



initial amount transferred from lessor to lessee constitutes only part of the

"payment" the lessor makes to buy the lessee's depreciation deductions and tax

credit.

    For a lease of length T, with matching level annual payments, a zero

repurchase price and a loan interest rate of i, the initial payment that would

yield a zero present value for the lessor over the entire transaction is:


                                     x =   tA    —   B(l—TA)


where A is the combined present value (in terms of equivalent deductions) of the

asset's investment credit and recovery allowances, as defined in Thble 5, t        is   the

lessor's marginal tax rate (normally 16 percent since lessors xast be corpora-

tions) and B is defined by the forniila

Tables 5 and 6 are presented in Table    7.   The main result in Table 7 is that

though the initial payment, x, is far less than the value of credits and deduc-

tions to the lessor, TA,   it   is not very sensitive to the discount rate used.

For example, a lessor with a discount rate of 12 percent would pay 21.2 cents

for a five—year lease per dollar of assets in the five—year recovery class; this

figure would be 20.5 cents if the lessor had a discount rate of 6.L8 percent.22

   A fully worked out example of one of these transactions appears in Table 8,

for a five—year lease of a five—year asset and a 12 percent discount rate.23

    We   next consider the relative position of different types of firms, with the

availability of safe harbor leasing. If a fully—taxable firm sells and then

leases an asset from one in similar circumstances, the tax effects should can-

cel, with respect to bot the ITC and depreciation deductions and the taxes on

lease payments net of interest payments. Should the lessee be a Trpe I firm

with no taxable income jr-i the year of the lease but taxable income thereafter,

the lease will allow the full tax benefits of ACRS to be obtained, but the taxes

on lease payments net of interest payments will still cancel. Thus, the lessee

has been enabled to gain a position siailar to the fully—taxable firm. Finally,

however, consider the non—taxable pe II firm as lessee. It gets the full.

value of the asset's depreciation deductions, but it pays no taxes on the income

the asset generates. This appears to place it in a favored position relative to

the other firms. However, there are two extenuating factors here. First, the

non—taxable lessee cannot take advantage of the deductions of lease payments

made net of interest received from the lessor, while the lessor must include the

difference in income. Naturally, two firms in this situation could lengthen the

term of the lease substantially, and in so doing make the loan repayments

smaller, although the term of a lease cannot exceed the greater of 150 percent

of the asset's ADR midpoint life and 90 percent of its "useful life" as defined

under section 167 of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, to the extent that

the 'Irpe II firm finances its investment with borrowing of its own, it cannot

deduct the interest payments, while a firm with taxable profits can. Together,

these two factors will probably not give the advantage to the taxable firm, but

they will lessen the disadvantage from which it suffers relative to the non—

taxable firm.

    Of course, what makes a sale—leaseback agreement really different from the

sale of credits and deductions is the risk undertaken by the lessor that the

lessee will enter bankruptcy. What the position of the lessor would be in such

a case is a legal issue that can not be judged here.

VII.    Conclusions

       The Accelerated Cost Recovery System included in the Economic Recovery 'Ix

Act of 1981 reduced greatly the tax burden on nonresidential and non—owner—

occupied residential investment in the U.S. undertaken after January 1, 1981, to

the extent that it will largely offset the corporation income tax in future

years. However, its effects are quite different from the simple abolition of

the corporate tax. The effective corporate tax rate is not zero, but varies

widely across assets and is negative for many. The opportunity to deduct

interest payments makes the effective tax rates on debt—financed investments

still lower. What will keep corporate tax collections positive is many firms

continuing at least for a time to derive a large portion of their income from

sources other than depreciable personal property purchased after January 1,

1981. Those firms not in this category will be able to sell part of their

losses to those that are through safe—harbor leases. Thus, the smallness of

corporate tax collections will mask what is happening: some investments, being

taxed effectively at substantially negative rates being used to shelter others

that face positive tax rates.

    Regardless of whether reductions in capital income taxes were in general a

good idea, ACRS appears to have accomplished this objective in a rather compli-

cated and distortionary way.

10 A January, 1981, study by the Congressional Budget Office suggested that
    indexing the tax system as of January 1, 1981, to avoid bracket creep would
    have resulted in a revenue loss of $182.1 billion dollars by F1l985.
    Shifting this number back to 1986 to allow for the later passage of the ERTA
    suggests that the personal tax cut exceeds indexing by very little in the
    aggregate. See Congressional Budget Office, An Analysis of President
    Carter's Budgetary Proposals for Fiscal Year 1982, January, 1981.

13 This comes from discounting the economic depreciation of .1, .1 x (i—.i),
    .1 x (1_.1)2,... at a rate of .014.

114 The only exceptions are "lump—sum" taxes, such as head taxes, because they
    are levied on individuals without regard to any aspect of economic activity.
    Since the individual can do nothing to lessen the tax, he will not be
    induced to distort his behavior. Unfortunately, this "strength" is also
    what makes lump—sum taxes impractical.

15 The issue of how responsive savings is and how heavily it should be taxed is
    at present a hotly debated one in the area of Public Finance. Many have
    argued in favor of a cash—flow or "consumption" tax that would allow indivi-
     duals a deduction from the income tax base for net saving. Such a tax
     change would also involve either elimination of the corporate tax or an
     alternative adjustment that would effectively eliminate the tax for income
     from new investments. However, there are other arguments in favor of a con-
     sumption tax aside from those relating to efficiency. See the discussion in
     J. Pechman, editor, What Should Be Taxed: Income or Expenditure?
     (Washington: Brookings 1980).

16 Indeed, it would be cheaper still to offer incentives only to that new
    investment that would not otherwise have occured, but this would be
    impossible to implement. A more sensible approach that has come up over the
    years is to apply the incentives only to the increment in investment over
    the average of investment in previous years. This is precisely the way in
    which the new tax credit for research and development has been structured.

    Parameters on the Investment Equations in Macroeconometric Models," U.S.

    1981.

     Depreciation of Assets," 2   cit.

    and Equipment: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis," U.S. Department of the

20   Calculations assume the first asset class will receive a 2.5 percent tax
     credit and use 200 percent (double) declining balance over 2 years, while
     the other two receive a 6 percent credit and use 200 percent declining
     balance over 14 years.

21 Naturally, important distributional issues are involved in such a large cut
    in capital income taxes. However, since the main focus here is on ACRS as a
    reduction in capital income taxes, such questions are being left aside.
