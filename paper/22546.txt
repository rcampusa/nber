Heterogeneous Frictional Costs Across Industries in Cross-border Mergers and Acquisitions

                                          ABSTRACT

While there has been significant research to explore the determinants (and frictions) of foreign
direct investment (FDI), past literature primarily focuses on country-wide FDI patterns with little
examination of sectoral heterogeneity in FDI. Anecdotally, there is substantial sectoral
heterogeneity in FDI patterns. For example, a substantial share of FDI (around 40-50%) is in the
manufacturing sector, yet manufacturing accounts for a relatively small share of production
activity in the developed economies responsible for most cross-border M&A. In this paper, we
extend the Head and Ries (2008) model of cross-border M&A to account for sectoral
heterogeneity and estimate the varying effects of FDI frictions across sectors using cross-border
M&A data spanning 1985 through 2013. We find that non-manufacturing sectors generally have
greater sensitivity to cross-border M&A frictions than is true for manufacturing, including such
frictions as physical distance, cultural distance, and common language. Tradeability is positively
associated with greater cross-border M&A, and is an additional friction for the many non-
manufacturing sectors because they consist of mainly non-tradeable goods.

1. INTRODUCTION

The growth of world foreign direct investment (FDI) over the past few decades has been

rapid. In accordance with this, there has been a significant research effort to explore the

determinants (and frictions) that determine worldwide FDI patterns. Surprisingly, this

prior literature on FDI determinants has done very little to examine sectoral heterogeneity

in FDI patterns, focusing primarily on country-wide FDI flows and affiliate activity.

       Perhaps the most surprising feature in this regard is that a substantial share of FDI is

manufacturing and undertaken primarily amongst developed countries, yet manufacturing

accounts for a very small (and rapidly declining) share of activity in these same developed

countries. For example in the US, over 45% of value added by foreign affiliates operating in

the US was in manufacturing in 2012 (Calculated from Table 2.1 in Anderson, 2014).

However, total value added by manufacturing sector in the US accounted for only about 12%

of real GDP in 2012 (Elrod et al., 2013, Table E). Likewise, almost 40% of value added in

2011 by US affiliates operating in foreign countries was in manufacturing (Calculated from

Table 2.1 in Barefoot, 2013).

       These patterns suggest a number of important questions. First, what are the important

differences that make FDI in non-manufacturing (e.g., retail, financial, and service sectors)

less frequent than manufacturing? A number of possible candidates are in play. First,

cultural dissimilarities or “cultural distance” may impact the ability of a foreign firm to

operate in another country much more in these other sectors than manufacturing sectors.

Examples of such “culturally- and language-sensitive” non-manufacturing sectors include

media, film, retail, and advertising. Second, many services are non-tradeable, whereas

virtually all of manufacturing is highly tradeable. Exporting may be an important source of




                                                1
information of foreign markets for firms, significantly reducing the fixed costs (and

uncertainty) of the decision to engage in FDI. Thus, the FDI decision may involve a much

higher information hurdle for a non-tradeable sector that cannot rely on prior exporting

experience into the market. Third, many non-manufacturing sectors are connected with

market features, such as natural monopolies or public goods characteristics, that lead

governments to highly restrict FDI in these sectors or even have public ownership of the

sector, effectively prohibiting FDI. Such sectors include some modes of transportation,

utilities, communication sectors, and even health services.

       In this paper, we contribute to the growing FDI and cross-border M&A literature by

providing empirical evidence for heterogeneous sector-specific frictional costs. We extend

the Head and Reis (2008) model of cross-border M&A activity to have sectoral heterogeneity

and then examine the empirical evidence for heterogeneous sector-specific frictional costs.

The data we use for this analysis are the cross-border M&A data from Thomson SDC

Platinum database ranging from 1985-2013. There are two main reasons that we use cross-

border M&A to study frictional costs in FDI. First, cross-border M&A is typically double

that of greenfield FDI, the other major form of FDI. (For example, see Table I.10 on p. 11 of

UNCTAD, 2015). Thus, by conducting empirical analysis with the cross-border M&A data,

we are capturing a substantial component of the FDI pattern. Second, the cross-border M&A

data from SDC Platinum provide disaggregated information across all countries at the four-

digit SIC level, a level of detail that other FDI data cannot provide, even for the countries

with the most comprehensive FDI data.

       Our empirical analysis finds that physical distance, cultural distance, common

language, and tradeability all play an important role in determining the heterogeneous




                                                2
incidence of cross-border M&A activity across sectors. In general, non-manufacturing

sectors, including “Construction”, “Transportation, Communications, and Utilities”,

“Wholesale Trade,” “Retail Trade,” “Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate,” and “Services”

are more sensitive to a number of cross-border frictions. Physical distance, cultural distance,

and commonality of language affect cross-border M&A in these non-manufacturing sectors

anywhere from 5% to 50% more than the manufacturing sector. Tradeability is also an

important determinant of cross border M&A activity and is positively associated with it.

Many non-manufacturing sectors do not have tradeable goods (e.g., Construction), which

then significantly lowers the incidence of cross-border M&A activity. The only friction to

which the manufacturing sector as more senstive than the non-manufacturing sectors in our

estimates is FDI regulation, though the effect of FDI regulation is relatively minor generally.

       There is a growing literature that investigates the determinants of cross-border M&A,

including Rossi and Volpin (2004), Di Giovanni (2005) Head and Ries (2008), Hijzen et al.

(2008), and Erel et al. (2012)). They generally find that gravity-type forces are important for

cross-border M&A and especially examine the role of various types of cross-border frictions,

as well as financial and institutional frictions in the home and host country. However, there

are few papers of which we are aware that investigate heterogeneity in frictions and their

impact on cross-border M&A activity across sectors. The closest to our study is Ramasamy

and Yeung (2010) who examine FDI in OECD countries across different sectors. Unlike our

study, they rely on annual time series data aggregated at the one-digit sector level, which is

estimated by a reduced-form equation. Their focus is on host-country characteristics unlike

our focus on frictions. They find that the same types of host-market characteristics generally




                                               3
affect FDI across all sectors, and that service FDI appears to follow manufacturing FDI over

time.

        The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides empirical facts about

cross-border M&A activity. Sections 3 and 4 derive an empirical specification from the

Head and Reis (2008) model, conduct an empirical analysis, and provide evidence on the

effects of cross-border frictions on cross-border M&A activity, with a focus on sectoral

heterogeneity. The last section concludes.



2. CROSS-BORDER M&A ACTIVITY

        Like many other prior papers on M&A activity, we rely on the Thomsen Reuters

SDC Platinum M&A database to examine patterns in cross-border M&A activity. The

database begins in 1985 and records all M&A transactions across the world that are valued

at $5 million or higher. If the percentage of shares acquired by the acquiring firm is 10%

or more, we consider this an acquisition. A limitation of the data is that it does not have

information on the value of transactions for about half of the observations, as private firms

do not have to report this information. As a result, we rely on counts of M&A

transactions. The empirical model we present and estimate below naturally explains

counts of transactions.

        The entire database from 1985 through 2013 has over 600,000 acquisitions where

10% or more of the target company is acquired. About one-quarter (155,997) of these

observations are M&A transactions that are cross-border; i.e, the acquiring firm’s

headquarters are located in a different country than the target firm’s headquarters. Due to

data availability issues, we examine cross-border acquisitions between countries that are




                                               4
the top 50 target countries for M&A activity. M&A activity in these top 50 countries

accounts for almost 90% of all M&A activity in the database, and cross-border activity

between them accounts for about 63% of all cross-border acquisitions in the database. We

also look at cross-border activity between OECD countries, which represents 58% of all

cross-border acquisitions.1 Importantly, the data have information on the primary 4-digit

SIC classification of the acquiring and target firm, allowing us to focus on sectoral patterns

of cross-border acquisitions, including non-manufacturing ones. For our purposes, we

classify the M&A transaction according to the SIC of the target firm. We are interested in

explaining the cross-sectional variation in cross-border M&A, not time-series variation.

For this reason and because of the many observations of zero transactions across all our

country pairs and 4-digit SIC classifications in a given year, we sum up all the transactions

over the 1985-2013 period and seek to explain these cross-sectional totals in our empirical

analysis.2

        To get a sense of the variation in cross-border M&A activity across industries,

Table 1 looks at such activity across one-digit sectors for our full sample and the OECD

sample.3 As mentioned in the introduction, the manufacturing sector accounts for nearly

40% of all cross-border M&A activity and this is nearly identical across both the top 50

and OECD samples. Of the non-manufacturing sectors, services is largest in accounting

for about one-quarter of all cross-border M&A activity. The next largest sectors are

“Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate” (10-12%), “Transportation, Communications, and

  We rank M&A activity in terms of the number of firms targeted in that country for a M&A and define OECD
membership as of January 1, 2000 – roughly the midpoint of our sample. Appendix A lists the OECD countries,
as well as the adidtional countries that comprise the top 50 target countries comprising our full sample of
countries.

  Head and Ries (2008) use this database on cross-border M&A as a primary dataset in their analysis and
similarly sum up over years to focus on the cross-sectional variation.

  In the empirical analysis below, we examine data at a much more disaggregated 4-digit SIC level.

Utilities” (7-8%), and “Wholesale Trade” (6%). The distribution of cross-border M&A

across one-digit sectors is strikingly similar across the two samples.

        A concern for our analysis is that a high share of manufacturing in cross-border

M&A may be due to other factors that are not connected with lower cross-border frictions.

One reason is that manufacturing may simply have many more potential firms that can be

acquired even if manufacturing’s share of value added in the economy is much lower than

40% (as pointed out in the introduction). It’s not simple to measure the number of

available firms for acquistion (i.e., targets) in a given sector in general. However, we have

such data for the U.S. on a five-year basis through the U.S. censuses of various industrial

sectors. Column 1 of Table 2 shows the number of U.S. firms acquired (by both domestic

and cross-border acquisitions) over our sample (1985-2013) and compares that with the

number of firms (or “companies”) in the U.S. one-digit sectors as of 1992 -- a proxy for

the relative number of firms available in the sector as potential targets – in column 2. We

think the number of firms in 1992 is a reasonable proxy for available targets over the entire

sample because the number of firms in a sector (especially relative to other sectors) does

not change substantially over time.4 Column 3 shows the ratio of acquisitions to the

number of potential targets for each one-digit sector. The ratio in manufacturing is 0.17

and higher than all the other non-manufacturing sectors with the exception of mining,

which has a ratio of 0.42. The “Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate” sector is next highest

with a ratio of 0.11. These numbers indicate that M&A activity in manufacturing is

simply more frequent in general than for all acquisitions in a market (not just cross-

border). By itself, this fact could be explaining the differences we see in cross-border


4
 We cannot create a measure over time for this proxy as U.S. censuses later in the sample change industrial
classification from SIC to NAICS.


                                                       6
M&A activity across sectors, not differences in cross-border frictions, and so we will need

to control for this in the empirical work below.

       However, we can see evidence in the raw data that cross-border frictions may lead

to different frequencies of manufacturing vs. non-manufacturing cross-border M&A.

Table 3 shows the number of acquisitions in manufacturing and non-manufacturing for

both domestic and cross-border M&A activity across all our sample years and for various

sample countries. A universal pattern across all our differing sample of countries is that

manufacturing accounts for a significantly larger share of cross-border M&A activity

(column 6) than domestic M&A activity (column 3). For example in our two samples of

countries (top 50 and OECD), manufacturing accounts for only about 27-28% of targets

acquired by domestic acquirers, but 39% of targets acquired by foreign firms (i.e, cross-

border M&A). Across all top 10 target countries, the share of manufacturing targets is

also always larger in the cross-border activity than in the domestic activity. These

numbers suggest that cross-border M&A is relatively easier for manufacturing industries

than non-manufacturing ones, and we next build an empirical model to explore how

various cross-border frictions play a role in this.



3. MODEL

       To generate a theoretically-founded empirical specification to test our hypotheses, we

begin with the Head and Ries (2008) model of cross-border M&A and modify it to

accommodate heterogeneous sector-specific frictional costs. The Head and Ries (2008)

model views cross-border M&A as an international market for corporate control of

productive assets, where the headquarters’ monitoring cost of a (potential) subsidiary plays a




                                                 7
key role in the cross-border M&A decision. Frictional costs associated with cross-border

M&A stem from this monitoring cost because its assumed that monitoring costs increase as

the geographic or cultural distance between the home and host countries increases.

       The model starts with a simple inspection game, which is played between the

headquarters (HQ) and its subsidiary. Without monitoring by the HQ, the manager of the

subsidiary lacks incentives to exert effort to maximize the value of the subsidiary.

Monitoring requires costs that are increasing in distance (both cultural and geographic)

between the HQ and its subsidiary. The subsidiary (manager) chooses whether to work or

shirk. Gross profit depends on the contributions of the HQ and the subsidiary, which are

denoted by a and b, respectively. The HQ always adds a, whereas the subsidiary adds b if it

chooses to exert effort. The HQ simultaneously chooses whether to trust subsidiary or

monitor and verify for a cost of c that the subsidiary has worked. HQ pays w to the

subsidiary, unless monitoring reveals that the subsidiary is shirking, in which case the

subsidiary gets zero. Working generates gross output of a+b, but the subsidary incurs effort

costs of e. Head and Ries (2008) make parameter assumptions that b>w>e>c>0, and then

solve for a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of the inspection game, which yields the

following expression for the value of the subsidiary:

                                    v = a + b − 2 bc                                     (1)

As can be seen from equation (1), higher verification costs (c) lower the value of the

subsidiary to HQs. Head and Ries (2008) postulate c as an increasing function of Dij , which

is a vector of geographic and cultural distance measures between the host country i and the

home country j. Therefore, Dij acts as frictional costs and reduces the value of the merged

firm as the distance between the home and the host countries increases. This naturally



                                               8
explains the strong inverse correlations between these frictions and cross-border M&A found

in the data.

         Our focus is on potential heterogenity in frictions across sectors, and so we modify

frictions in the Head and Ries model to be sector-specific. We denote these as Dijk , where

subscript k denotes the sector. Following Head and Ries (2008), we make a functional form

                           δ k Dijk
assumption that cijk = [              ]2 , which then modifies equation (1) as follows:
                              2

                                                              δ k Dijk
                                           vijk = a + b − b                               (2)
                                                                 2

Equation (2) illustrates that Dijk acts as frictional costs and reduces the value of the merged

firm differently across sectors depending on the value of δ k as the distance between the

home and the host countries, or as other sector-specific frictions increase. Similar to Head

and Ries (2008), equation (2) illustrates an ability versus proximity trade-off; i.e. high-ability

HQs may have a lower willingness to pay for a target than a less able, but more proximate

HQs. However, unlike Head and Ries (2008), this trade-off varies across sectors in our

model.



4. EMPIRICS

4.1. Specification

         We assume that the HQ with the highest expected payoff (i.e., v) makes the highest

bid and wins the auction for control of a subsidiary. Let π ijk denote the probability that a HQ

from country j takes control of a randomly drawn target in country i in industry k. Also, let




                                                       9
K ik denote the asset value of the entire stock of targets in the host country i in industry k.

Then we can represent the expected bilateral FDI stocks as follows,

                                                 E[ Fijk ] = π ijk K ik                              (3)

       We follow Head and Ries (2008) in specifying π ijk , assume that country j has m j

headquarters, each of which have different valuations for a given target in country i.

Heterogeneity in the valuations is introduced through the HQ value-added term a. We

assume that the cumulative density of a takes the Gumbel (type-I extreme value):

exp(− exp(−( x − µ ) / σ )) , where µ is the location parameter and σ is the shape parameter.

Using the results of Anderson, de Palma, and Thisse (1992, p. 39), it can then be shown that

π ijk is given by the multinomial logit formula:

                                             µ
                                       exp[ σj + ln(m j ) − ( σb )δ k Dijk ]
                            π ijk =                                                                  (4)
                                      ∑ exp[ µσ + ln(m ) − ( σ )δ D
                                       l
                                                  l
                                                                 l
                                                                      b
                                                                          k   ilk ]



       Substituting (4) into (3), we can express expected bilateral FDI stocks as

                                                             µ
                                             m j exp[ σj − ( σb )δ k Dijk ]
                              E[ Fijk ] =                                             Kik            (5)
                                            ∑ ml exp[ µσl − ( σb )δ k Dilk ]
                                             l



       In order to obtain an estimating equation, we first define θk ≡ ( σb )δ k , which

determines the FDI-impeding effect. Also, E[ Fijk ] depends only on the shares of HQs in

                                            mj
each country, so we introduce s mj ≡                      to represent a country’s share of the world’s
                                           ∑ml        l



bidders. And finally, we define Bik ≡ ∑l slm exp[ µσl − θk Dilk ] as the “bid competition” for

targets in country i in industry k. Re-expression of (5) in terms of these variables yields:




                                                            10
                                                    µ
                                  E[ Fijk ] = exp[ σj − θk Dijk ]s mj Kik Bik−1                       (6)

        Equation (6) now resembles the gravity equation where expected bilateral stocks are

increasing in the product of origin and destination size variables ( s mj and K ik ) and decreasing

in measures of bilateral distance. Higher bid competition in i in industry k (i.e., Bik ) implies

that a higher fraction of assets in i in industry k will be taken by rivals from other countries,

thereby reducing the expected bilateral stocks of HQs from country j.

        Standard industrial classifications used to define k in our data vary for both market

structure reasons and artificial classification reasons. For example, manufacturing has many

narrowly-defined industry classifications each composed of a relatively small number of

establishments, whereas services tends to have more broadly-defined industry classifications

with many firms. This matters because it directly affects the number of potential targets (K)

and potential bidders (B) across sectors in a systematic way. To account for this we

introduce a k-specific scaling factor that we assume allows us to rewrite K ik Bik−1 as λk K i Bi−1 .

While this assumes a common industrial structure across our economies with respect to the

relative number of firms in each sector, it allows us to extend Head and Ries (2008) in a

tractable way to the sectoral level given available data.

        Further re-arrangement of equation (6) gives us some insight into how the parameters

of the model can be estimated:

                                            µ
                           E[Fijk ] = exp[ σj + ln s mj + ln K i − ln Bi + ln λk − θ k Dijk ]               (7)

Equation (7) shows that bilateral FDI can be separated into a origin j-specific term relating to

                                                                          µj
its share of the world’s HQs ( ln s mj ) and their mean ability (         σ    ), a destination i-specific term

relating to the share of target assets ( ln K i ) and the competing set of bidders ( ln Bi ). We

will denote O j ≡   σ    + ln s mj as the outward direct investment effect for origin j, and

I i ≡ ln K i − ln Bi as the inward direct investment effect for destination i. Compressing the

outward and inward effects into one term each, we obtain the following expression for

expected bilateral FDI stocks:

                                       E[Fijk ] = exp[O j + I i + ln λk − θ k Dijk ]                        (8)

       In order to move from the expected values determined in the theory to the actual

                                                                      Fijk
values of FDI recorded in the data set, we define ηijk ≡                        as the ratio of actual to
                                                                    E[ Fijk ]

expected bilateral FDI stocks. Using equation (8),

                                  Fijk = E[Fijk ]ηijk = exp[O j + I i + ln λk − θ k Dijk ]ηijk              (9)

As Head and Ries (2008) shows, with the right assumption on the error term, we can use

maximum likelhood estimation of a count data model (such as a (quasi-)Poisson) to estimate

the parameters of the model, θ k .

       The focus of our analysis is the effect of the observed variables that comprise the

vector of cross-border frictions, Dijk , and how their effects may vary across sectors of the

economy. The first ones we specify are the same as Head and Ries (2008), which relate to

factors that should increase or decrease the costs to the HQ of monitoring an acquired

affiliate. The variable Distanceij measures the physical distance between the home and the

host country. We expect the coefficient on this variable to be negative as it increases costs of

monitoring the affiliate. The variable CulturalDistij measures the cultural distance between

the home and the host country, and for the same reason, we expect the coefficient on this

variable to be negative. Similarly, for CommonLangij , a measure of the commonality of


                                                       12
language between the two countries, which should lower monitoring costs and increase

cross-border M&A. We also include variables that indicate a colonial relationship between

the two countries, AcquirorFromColonyij and TargetInColonyij , which should lower

monitoring costs and increase FDI corresponding to a positive coefficient.

       We also introduce a number of additional variables to the vector of FDI frictions,

which have cross-industry variation. The variables, Tradeablek and Tradeabilityk , indicate

whether industry k is tradeable or not and, if so, how tradeable its products are, respectively.

We split tradeability up in this non-linear way, as we hypothesize that tradeability can have

two opposing effects. On one hand, exporting products to another country can provide

information about that country that could be helpful for FDI, especially cross-border M&A.

It allows the firm to know more about the business conditions and regulations of a country,

as well as possible targets in that country for acquisition. In other words, incurring the fixed

costs of exporting to a market, should lower the fixed costs of cross-border M&A into the

country. For this reason, we expect the coefficient on Tradeablek to be positive. At the same

time, we hypothesize that the degree of tradeability, represented by Tradeabilityk , will be

inversely related to FDI and have a negative coefficient. This is from the well-known

tradeoff that firms face in deciding whether to serve foreign markets with exporting or FDI.

Lower costs of exporting, reflected in high degrees of tradeability, will mean there is less

incentive to engage in FDI.

       Finally, we include the variable FDIRegulationik , which measures the level of

regulation and other restrictions imposed on foreign investment by the host country i in




                                               13
industry k. We expect the coefficient on this variable to be negative because high regulations

inhibit FDI activity.

         Following the specification in equation (9), we control for the number of potential

bidders and targets for each observation. We include both acquirer-country-fixed effects and

target-country-fixed effects, which controls not only for the size of countries in various

dimensions that would affect potential bidders and targets, but also unobservable time-

invariant, country-wide institutions and business culture that impact all M&A activity.

However, there are also industry-specific factors that could further affect the number of

targets or acquirors, as well as the mechanical issue that the SICs do not break up economic

activity into relatively equal parts, as noted above.5 Therefore, we also include an across-

sector scaling factor, ln λk , that measures the the cross-sectional variation in potential

bidders and targets by industry. Lower numbers of potential bidders and targets will

naturally limit the number of acquisitions that may occur, ceteris paribus.



4.2. Data

         As discussed in section 2, we use cross-border M&A data from the Thomsen

Reuters SDC Platinum M&A database to construct our dependent variable over the period

from 1985 to 2013. Using the data set, we create a dependent variable of the number of

cross-border acquistions at the four-digit SIC industry level for all directional country pairs

from the set of the top 50 target countries in the database, cumulated over the period from

1985 through 2013.6 We also explore samples with only the OECD countries, which have


5
  In particular, manufacturing is broken into many more (and, thus, smaller) units of activity in terms of firms,
employees, and output in each SIC than sectors such as services.
6
  We limit to the top 50 because M&A activity begins to get sparse beyond this set and then includes countries
where we cannot easily obtain data for some of our regressors.


                                                       14
more intense M&A activity amongst them and account for a substantial share of overall

cross-border M&A activity.

           Data for a number of our covariates come from publicly available data at the CEPii

website (www.cepii.fr) and have been used by many others for statistical studies of

international economic activity. These are CommonLangij ,which indicates whether the

two countries share an official language, and the indicators of colonial status. Our distance

variable measures the physical distance (in thousands of kilometers) between the home and

the host countries’ capital cities.7

           We use Kogut and Singh’s (1988) cultural index to create a CulturalDistij variable

that measures the cultural distance between the home and host countries. This is a

composite index formed based on the weighted difference between the four cultural

dimensions (i.e. power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity/femininity, and

individualism) of each country. Algebraically, we build the following index:

                                                 4
                                       CDij = ∑ {( I ci − I cj ) 2 / Vc }/ 4
                                                c =1                           ,

where I ci stands for the host country i's cth cultural dimension, I cj is the home country j's

cth cultural dimension, Vc is the variance of the cth dimension, CDij is the cultural

distance index between the host country i and home country j. The cultural dimensions

needed to construct this index are taken from the Geert Hofstede’s website at

http://www.geerthofstede.nl/dimension-data-matrix.

           The Tradeabilityk measure is the sum of exports and imports divided by shipments

of the domestic firms in the industry. We use U.S. data for the year 2000 to construct this
7
    Also from www.cepii.fr.


                                                       15
measure for our 4-digit SIC industries (see Blonigen (2011) for more details). The

variable, Tradeablek , simply indicates whether this index is non-zero.

         To construct the variable measuring the degree of FDI regulation we use the

OECD's FDI restrictiveness index from Blanka et al. (2010). The index ranges from 0 to 1

and is a composite of information on 1) foreign equity restrictions, 2) screening and prior

approval requirements, 3) rules for key personnel, and 4) other restrictions on the

operation of foreign enterprises.8 The source of information for constructing the index for

OECD countries is the list of countries' reservations under the OECD Code of

Liberalisation of Capital Movements and their lists of exceptions and of other measures

reported for transparency under the National Treatment Instrument (NTI). For the non-

member countries additional sources of information have been used to identify restrictions.

Such additional sources include official national publications, information gathered by the

Secretariat in the preparation of OECD Investment Policy Reviews, and other international

organizations such as the WTO and IMF.

         We use the detailed U.S. data on firms by 4-digit SIC to construct a measure of

ln λk , the cross-sector scaling factor. We use data from various 1992 U.S. censuses of

economic activity in the main sectors, which can be found at

https://www.census.gov/prod/www/economic_census.html. We use the 1992 censuses

because it was the earliest where we could get data by SIC for all our sectors before the

U.S. switched over to the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS). We

collected firm (or company) data because acquisitions are typically of an entire firm, not

8
  Table I-1 of Blanka et al. (2010) provides a list of practices that are included and the weights used to aggregate
the information into an index. 1 of Golub (2003) provides a list of practices that are included and the weights
used to aggregate the information on them into an index. If the sector requires complete national ownership, the
index takes the value of 1.


                                                        16
individual establishments.9 We do not examine M&A activity in the “Agriculture,

Forestry, and Fisheries” sector (SIC 0), as there is no analogous census completed for

these industries.

        Table 4 and 5 provide descriptive statistics of our variables for the full sample and

the OECD country sample. The average number of cross-border acquisitions per country-

industry observation is fairly small considering that we are cumulating all cross-border

M&A activity over the 1985-2013 period, averaging 0.07 cross-border M&A transactions

per country-industry pair over this entire period for the full sample and 0.15 for the OECD

sample. This is due to lots of “0” observations in the data and a large variance, as the

maximum value is 531 cross-border transactions over the period for one particular

observation. Given this feature of the data, we explore below the robustness of our results

using a zero-inflated negative binomial estimator.

        There are a number of things to note about the characteristics of our regressors. A

number of them are familiar because of their heavy use in explaining international trade

patterns. The tradeability and FDI regulation measures are less well-known. Across all

our sectors, about 65% are tradeable and the average ratio of exports and imports to

shipments is about 40%. This is highly skewed by a few industries that have very high

traded goods ratios. Our measure of FDI regulation suggests that substantial FDI

regulations are not highly prevalent, but there is significant variation across sectors.




9
 An exception is the “Construction” sector where only the number of establishments are reported perhaps
because firms are more often single-establishment in this sector than others.


                                                     17
4.3. Initial Results

       We begin the empirical results by estimating equation (9) with a Poisson maximum

likelihood estimator to estimate the impacts of cross-border frictions on M&A activity.

(We get qualitatively identical estimates when we use OLS) We then explore robustness

with alternative estimators – Negative Binomial and a zero-inflated Negative Binomial –

and a sample of only OECD countries. Throughout we provide marginal effects of our

coefficients to aid in interpretation. Finally, we explore the robustness of our conclusions

when we allow our estimated marginal effects to vary across one-digit sectors and then use

these estimated marginal effects to examine how cross-border frictions have differential

impacts on cross-border M&A across various sectors.

       Column 1 of Table 6 shows the base regression results from estimating equation

(9) with a Poisson regression, which is consistent with the structural model developed in

section 3. Most of the estimated marginal effects are of expected sign and statistically

significant. Distance and cultural distance both significantly lower cross-border M&A

activity. Physical distance has a larger effect, with a standard deviation increase in

distance associated with a 9% lower rate of cross-border M&A activity, while a standard

deviation increase in cultural distance is associated with about a 3.5% lower rate.

A standard deviation increase in the extent to which countries share a common language

increases cross-border M&A activity with a similar magnitude to that of cultural distance –

about a 3.5% effect. The colony variables are of mixed sign and generally small in

magnitude. FDI regulation has the expected negative sign, but a standard deviation

increase of the index (0.1 on a 1.0 scale) is only associated with a 1% decrease in cross-

border M&A activity. Tradeability is estimated to have a significant positive effect on




                                               18
cross-border M&A activity, consistent with the hypothesis that international trade activity

can be a mechanism for information on available targets in other countries. The estimated

marginal effect indicates that tradeable sectors increase cross-border M&A activity by

about 9%. Tradeability has the expected negative sign, consistent with the hypothesis that

there will be less FDI when trading is easier, but the effect is not statistically significant.

        There is clearly substantial skewness in the dependent variable such that the

variance of the distribution is much greater than the mean. The Poisson distribution,

however, imposes the condition that the mean and variance are equal, which can bias

parameter estimates. In column 2 of Table 6, we provide estimated effects when we use a

negative binomial specification, which allows the variance and mean to differ. The

marginal effects are quite robust to this alternative specification (even in magnitude)

though the marginal effect on both colony variables are now the expected positive sign and

statistically significant. The additional parameter allowing the mean and variance of the

distribution to vary is highly statistically signficant, so we use the negative binomial

specification in our remaining reported results.

        The vast majority of M&A activity in the world is amongst the developed countries

and the dependent variable has the value of “0” in 97% of the observations in our full

sample of the top 50 countries. Even the more flexible negative binomial distribution may

not be able to fit the data well because of this. To address this concern, we first limit the

sample to only cross-border M&A activity between the OECD countries. This also allows

us to see if the impact of various frictions on M&A activity between developed countries

is different than for a sample that has both advanced and less-developed countries.




                                                 19
       Column 1 of Table 7 provides marginal effects using a negative binomial

specification for our OECD sample. While the signs are identical to our full sample results,

the magnitudes are much larger, suggesting substantial impacts of cross-border frictions on

OECD cross-border M&A activity. A standard deviation increase in physical and cultural

distance are associated with a 17% and 14% reduction in cross-border M&A activity,

respectively, while a standard deviation increase in commonality of language increases it

by 34%. Colonial relationships matter much more in the OECD sample as well with

former colonists investing in former colonies 61% more, ceteris paribus, while former

colonies are 19% more likely to invest in former colonists. Tradeability matters much

more as well. Tradeable sectors are 20% more likely to enage in cross-border M&A

activity, while a standard deviation increase in tradeability of the sector is associated with

about a 6% lower level of cross-border M&A activity. The FDI regulation index continues

to be associated with a negative impact on cross-border M&A, but at a fairly modest level

(only a 3% reduction for a standard deviation increase).

       The dependent variable takes on the value of “0” in 94% of the observations even

in the OECD sample. As as a result, we next explore a zero-inflated negative binomial

specification. To do so, we need a variable that explains whether there is any cross-border

M&A activity in country-industry observation in the first place. We use a variable

indicating whether there is any domestic M&A activity for the country-industry

observation to proxy for unobserved factors that make any kind of M&A activity in that

country and industry prohibitive. Column 2 of Table 7 provides marginal effects using

this zero-inflated negative binomial specification. The indicator for no domestic M&A

activity is highly statistically significant. Signs and significance of the main regressors are




                                               20
qualitatively identical to those estimated by a negative binomial specification, though

magnitudes of the marginal effects have changed with a couple of the regressors. Notable

changes are the marginal effect of common language falling in half, but still suggesting

about a 17% increase in cross-border M&A for a standard deviation change, and a similar

fall in the effect of FDI regulation.



4.4. Exploring Cross-sector Heterogeneity

        The focus of the paper is on sectoral differences in cross-border M&A frictions.

We can use the marginal effects in column 2 of Table 7 to infer some of these differences

with respect to the variables that vary by industry - Tradeablek, Tradeabilityk, and

FDIRegulationik. In particular, we examine the differences in manufacturing versus other

one-digit sectors by multiplying the difference in the average values of these regressors

(relative to manufacturing) by the marginal effects in column 2 of Table 7. We report

these in Table 8, while the average value of our regressors by one-digit sector are reported

in Appendix B. Our reported calculations in Table 8 show that the degree to which a

sector has tradeable goods is estimated to have a large impact on cross-border M&A

activity. For example, sectors with no tradeable goods (Construction, Wholesale Trade,

and Retail Trade) have 35% lower cross-border M&A activity. Transportation,

Communication, and Utilities, and the Service sectors also have significantly lower cross-

border M&A activity for this reason as well. In contrast, differences in the degree of

tradeability or FDI regulation have only marginal impacts on differences in cross-border

M&A activity across sectors.




                                              21
       This exercise using marginal effects when pooling all sectors together can only

take us so far in understanding sectoral differences in cross-border M&A frictions, since

the impact of the frictions may vary across sectors. For example, the importance of

commonality in language may be more or less important for the retail sector than the

manufacturing sector. To explore this, we interact our regressors with one-digit sector

indicator variables to be able to estimate separate marginal effects on all our regressors at

one-sector level.

       These results are displayed in Table 9, where marginal effects that are statistically

different from the marginal effect estimated for the same variable in the manufacturing

sector are bolded and italicized. As one can see, the majority of the marginal effects in the

non-manufacturing sectors (42 out of 63) is bolded and italicized, indicating substantial

differences in the effect of cross-border M&A frictions across sectors relative to

manufacturing. Excluding the mining sector, most of the marginal effects in the non-

manufacturing sectors suggest greater sensitivity to cross-border M&A frictions than is

true for manufacturing. For example, the impact of physical distance impedes cross-

border M&A activity in the other sectors from 5% (Finance, Insurance and Real Estate) to

38% (Construction) more than in manufacturing. Likewise, cultural distance impedes

cross-border M&A activity in the other sectors from 5% (Transportation, Communication,

and Utilities) to 46% (Finance, Insurance and Real Estate) more than in manufacturing.

Former colonial relationships are relatively unimportant in manufacturing compared to

Wholesale Trade, Services, and Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate, while the impact of

common language on cross-border M&A is 20-30% greater than manufacturing in a

number of the other sectors. Marginal effects for Tradeable and Degree of Tradeability




                                               22
were not estimated for the three one-digit sectors that do not have any tradeable sectors

(denoted as "na"), and there are generally no statistical differences in the marginal effect of

whether a sector has tradeable goods or not. Interestingly, the effect of FDI regulation in

impeding cross-border M&A is largest in manufacturing, though it still significantly

impedes activity in Mining, Transportation, Communications, and Utilities, Wholesale

Trade and Retail Trade.



5. CONCLUSION

        The empirical international trade literature often focuses on manufactured goods

because those are the main traded goods in the world economy – at least the ones for

which we can easily track. But FDI, including cross-border M&A, can occur in any sector

of the economy. Yet, manufacturing is where a disproportionately large amount of FDI

occurs as well. To this point, there has little to no analysis for why this is true.

        In this paper we empirically examine the relevance of heterogeneous sector-

specific frictional costs using detailed data on worldwide mergers and acquisitions (M&A)

activity and find evidence for substantial differences. Non-manufacturing sectors

generally show much greater sensitivity to cross-border frictions and, thus, lower

incidence of cross-border M&A activity. Tradeability is also strongly associated with

cross-border M&A activity, which is a further impediment in many non-manufacturing

sectors that are mainly comprised of non-tradeable products.

        Such differences are important to understand for a wide variety of reasons. First,

industry development and globalization is inherently linked to the ability of firms to

engage in cross-border M&A activity. Second, policymakers are often keen in




                                                23
encouraging FDI activity because they perceive it to help employment and productivity in

their economies. Our results provides some of the first evidence that not all sectors are

equal in the impediments that policymakers would face to encourage cross-border M&A

activity.

NOTES: Marginal effects come from a pooled zero-inflated negative binomial regresssion where one-digit sectoral dummies were
included and interacted with the regressors. These regressions also included individual dummy variables for each acquiring country
and each target country, excluding the United States. Marginal effects for Tradeable and Degree of Tradeability were not estimated
for the three one-digit sectors that do not have any tradeable sectors (denoted as "na"). P-values in parentheses denote whether at
coefficient is statistically significant from zero. Coefficients bolded and italicized indicate coefficients that are significantly different
from the marginal effect estimated for the same variable in the manufacturing sector.
