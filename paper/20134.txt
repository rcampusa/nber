                                             ABSTRACT

Over the last twenty-five years, a set of influential studies has placed interest rates at the heart of
analyses that interpret and evaluate monetary policies. In light of this work, the Federal Reserve’s
recent policy of “quantitative easing,” with its goal of affecting the supply of liquid assets, appears to
be a radical break from standard practice. Alternatively, one could posit that the monetary aggregates,
when measured properly, never lost their ability to explain aggregate fluctuations and, for this reason,
represent an important omission from standard models and policy discussions. In this context,
the new policy initiatives can be characterized simply as conventional attempts to increase money
growth. This view is supported by evidence that superlative (Divisia) measures of money often
help in forecasting movements in key macroeconomic variables. Moreover, the statistical fit of a
structural vector autoregression deteriorates significantly if such measures of money are excluded
when identifying monetary policy shocks. These results cast doubt on the adequacy of conventional
models that focus on interest rates alone. They also highlight that all monetary disturbances have
an important “quantitative” component, which is captured by movements in a properly measured
monetary aggregate.

                                        1. INTRODUCTION

       More than twenty-five years ago, Bernanke and Blinder (1988) compactly summarized

the choice facing a central bank. After modifying a standard, Keynesian IS curve to account for

shocks to the financial sector, their analysis reached two clear and straightforward conclusions:

         “But suppose the demand for money increases (line 2), which sends a contractionary
impulse to GNP. Since this shock raises M, a monetarist central bank would contract reserves in
an effort to stabilize money, which would destabilize GNP. This, of course, is the familiar
Achilles heel of monetarism. Notice, however, that this same shock would make credit contract.
So a central bank trying to stabilize credit would expand reserves. In this case, a credit-based
policy is superior to a money-based policy.
         The opposite is true, however, when there are credit-demand shocks. Line 4 tells us that
a contractionary (for GNP) credit-demand shock lowers the money supply but raises credit.
Hence a monetarist central bank would turn expansionary, as it should, while a creditist central
bank would turn contractionary, which it should not.
         We therefore reach a conclusion similar to that reached in discussing indicators: If
money-demand shocks are more important than credit-demand shocks, then a policy of targeting
credit is probably better than a policy of targeting money.” (p. 438)


The authors then investigated whether the demand for money or credit was relatively more stable

and found evidence to conclude that the demand for credit, especially since 1980, was more

stable; the implication was that, on the basis of this evidence, monetary policy would have better

success in stabilizing GNP if it stabilized credit rather than variations in money.

       The question posed by Bernanke and Blinder in 1988 was important then and, in view of

the large shocks to credit demand that have occurred since 2007, it still is correct to ask a similar

question of central banks today: If the stabilization of nominal spending (which encompasses the

Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of goals for price stability and real output) is to be achieved,

which intermediate targeting strategy will accomplish this most effectively? The modern

literature, however, contains relatively little of this discussion. Instead, the intervening years

have narrowed the focus almost entirely to interest rate rules of the type proposed by Taylor




	                                                1
(1993) or some alternative guide to setting the federal funds rate. The monetary aggregates have

all but disappeared from the discussion.

       In what follows, we briefly review the context in which the original Bernanke and

Blinder paper was written and the events that led to scuttling monetary aggregates both from

modern mainstream models and, by extension, from discussions of policy options. We then offer

some counter-arguments to this consensus that suggest the role of the aggregates, as information

variables or intermediate targets, may have been mistakenly closed. With this as backdrop, we

propose that the Federal Reserve’s recent “experiments” with “quantitative easing” might

usefully be viewed not as a radical break from the past necessitated by the zero lower bound on

the federal funds rate, but as an extension of policies that have led, systematically, to movements

in monetary aggregates that have been followed, first, by movements in real GDP and, later, by

movements in nominal prices. This real-world experiment illustrates both the dangers of a

monetary policy strategy that focuses solely on targeting interest rates and the limitations of an

intellectual framework that fails to account for the important role that always has, and still is,

played by variations in the growth rate of the aggregate quantity of money.



                                   2. HISTORICAL CONTEXT

       When Bernanke and Blinder (1988) appeared, the debate about choosing money or the

federal funds rate as an intermediate target was anything but closed. Only a year after this article

was published, the working-paper (1989) version of Hallman, Porter, and Small (1991) outlined

their influential P-star model, which linked M2 to the price level and had explicit Quantity

Theory foundations. Moreover, only recently, both Meltzer (1987) and McCallum (1988) had

presented monetary policy rules that used the monetary base to control variations in nominal




	                                                2
spending directly. Conversely, the Federal Reserve officially abandoned its practice of monetary

targeting in October 1982 and, since that time, has implemented monetary policy with a variety

of approaches to targeting the federal funds rate. Dissension about the reliability of the signals

given by the aggregates also had begun to grow, based in part on (faulty) predictions of renewed

inflation in the mid-1980s that were supposed to have followed the rapid growth of M1 that had

been observed. Because some of the most prominent economists had been embarrassed publicly

when their warnings of accelerating inflation never materialized (see, e.g., Friedman (1984,

1985)), cracks in the empirical foundations of monetarism had been revealed; Nelson (2007,

pp.162-168) and Barnett (2012, pp.107-111) offer discussions of the role that money supply

measurement played in this episode.

       These cracks grew larger when several key papers were published in the early 1990s.

First, Friedman and Kuttner (1992) presented evidence indicating that the strong association

between money and aggregate economic activity appeared to be an artifact of two decades: The

1960s and 1970s. If the estimation period for the same relationships contained data from the

1980s, the authors found that previously strong associations between money and aggregate

spending were no longer significant and that the demand for money function exhibited

instability. The same paper also found that money’s explanatory power was replaced by

variations in short-term interest rates, including the four-to-six-month commercial paper rate, the

three-month Treasury bill rate, and the spread between the two. Several months later, Bernanke

and Blinder (1992) reinforced these findings by examining the role of the federal funds rate in

the monetary transmission mechanism. Like Friedman and Kuttner, these authors found that any

role for money was minimized once the federal funds rate was introduced into the empirical

framework. The conclusion was that any association money might have had with aggregate




	                                               3
activity prior to 1980 had been seriously, and perhaps irredeemably, undermined by the financial

innovations era.

       The empirical evidence supporting this perspective accumulated on two fronts throughout

the 1990s. One line of investigation found that previously stable demand for money functions

now exhibited considerable instability and, in doing so, violated a basic condition necessary for

any reliance on the monetary aggregates as intermediate targets or indicator variables. A branch

of this research found consistently that variations in the federal funds rate or the commercial

paper-Treasury bill rate spread both were closely linked to the cycle. In combination, the break-

downs in what had been strong associations between money and nominal magnitudes and the

growing body of evidence linking interest rates to aggregate activity shifted the focus of research

and monetary policy to models that had the federal funds rate at their core. Taylor’s (1993)

influential paper reinforced this shift in emphasis by showing how well the Federal Reserve had

adjusted its federal funds rate target in response to movements in output and inflation during the

late 1980s and early 1990s. By the end of the decade, the mainstream macro model outlined by

Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999) included an equation for the federal funds rate but not the

aggregate quantity of money. In this “New Keynesian” model, as Eggertsson and Woodford

(2003) emphasize, the thrust of monetary policy – expansionary or contractionary – gets

summarized entirely by current and expected future short-term nominal interest rates.

       Our first set of empirical findings suggests, however, that this conventional wisdom may

have been built on the basis of results that are not entirely robust. Related arguments have been

made before. For instance, Thoma and Gray (1988) point to the importance of outliers in the

data from 1974 in driving the results in Friedman and Kuttner (1992) and Bernanke and Blinder

(1992) that link interest rates to economic activity. In addition, both Belongia (1996) and




	                                               4
Hendrickson (2011) have replicated various portions of Friedman and Kuttner (1992) by doing

nothing more than replacing the Federal Reserve’s official simple sum measures of money with

superlative (Divisia) indexes of money. After estimating the same relationships over the same

sample periods with only this change, these authors found that money still shares a strong

relationship with aggregate economic activity and that the demand for money function still

exhibits stability. Because simple sum indexes cannot internalize pure substitution effects, as

emphasized by Barnett (1980, 2012) and Belongia and Ireland (2012a), the Federal Reserve’s

official money supply data incorporate measurement error of unknown magnitude in their

construction that will influence economic inference. Our results add to this evidence by finding

that, when Divisia measures of money are included in the place of their simple sum counterparts,

these quantity measures contain information and possess significant explanatory power

comparable to that found in interest rates.

       We derive a second set of results by incorporating Divisia measures of money into a

structural vector autoregression (SVAR) similar to that developed by Leeper and Roush (2003).

Our framework shows how the use of Divisia monetary aggregates allows for better

measurement of the key variables, as well as a more theoretically appealing depiction of the

demand for monetary services; both assist in the crucial task of disentangling money supply from

money demand. We find, as do Leeper and Roush, that including measures of money in the

SVAR’s information set helps reduce the so-called “price puzzle,” according to which an

identified, contractionary monetary policy shock is associated initially with a rise in the

aggregate level of prices. More important, we show that specifications that depict monetary

policy as following a standard Taylor-type rule are rejected, statistically, in favor of an

alternative that assigns a key role to the monetary aggregates; we find that, by contrast,




	                                                5
restricting the policy equation to focus even more specifically on money does very little damage

to the model’s empirical fit. We also find, by making use of valuable new data on the Divisia

aggregates provided by the Center for Financial Stability and described by Barnett, Liu, Mattson,

and van den Noort (2013), that our results are robust to the level of monetary aggregation.

Finally, we use the structural VAR to gauge the effects of Federal Reserve policy in the years

leading up to and immediately following the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008; strikingly, these

results corroborate Barnett’s (2012) arguments that monetary instability looms as an important

factor in recent US monetary history. Our results also provide a rationale for at least some

aspects of the Fed’s moves towards “quantitative easing.”

       Throughout our analysis and discussion, we take care to avoid dogmatic interpretations of

our results. Our message certainly is not that interest rates play no role in the process through

which monetary policy actions are transmitted through the economy. Instead, we wish to

emphasize the important disconnect that appears between our empirical results (as well as those

of Leeper and Roush (2003)), pointing to a significant role for money, and the recent theoretical

literature, which focuses largely if not exclusively on interest rates instead. Understanding

where the information content of the monetary aggregates comes from, and how it can be

efficiently exploited in the design of monetary policy, remains as important today as it was a

quarter century ago, when Bernanke and Blinder’s (1988) work appeared.



          3. THE INFORMATION CONTENT OF INTEREST RATES AND MONEY

       Bernanke and Blinder (1992) examined the relative information content of money and

interest rates in explaining variations in assorted measures of real activity in the context of an

equation of this form:




	                                                6
                                        6           6             6
                            Yt = α + ∑ λiYt −i + ∑ βi X t −i + ∑ γ i Pt −i + et ,                   (1)
                                       i =1        i =1          i =1


where Yt is one of several measures of real activity to be explained, X t is a measure of

monetary policy, Pt is the Consumer Price Index, which adjusts each estimation for any effects

from changes in the general price level, α and λi , β i , and γ i , i = 1,2,…,6, are regression

coefficients, and six lags of each monthly variable appear on the right-hand side. Their measures

of real activity ranged from capacity utilization and housing starts to several measures of labor

market activity and retail sales. Bernanke and Blinder used the Federal Reserve’s simple sum

measures of M1 and M2 as well as the federal funds rate, the Treasury bill rate, and the 30-year

Treasury bond rate as measures of “X” in the equation above.

       In the interest of space and because our research question is directed to the effects of

measurement on inferences about money’s effect on economic activity and to the relative

influences of monetary aggregates and the funds rate on real activity, we report here only a

partial set of replications and extensions of the results from the original Bernanke and Blinder

paper. In particular, we limit our work to estimations with simple sum measures of M1 and M2

and the funds rate and add Divisia measures of M1, M2 and MZM (M2, less small time deposits,

plus Institution-only Money Market Mutual Funds) as described by Barnett, Liu, Mattson, and

van den Noort (2013). As discussed by Motley (1988), the MZM aggregate limits itself to items

that are immediately convertible, without penalty, to some form of a medium of exchange.

       To help foreshadow the results we report below, figure 1 compares the behavior of

simple sum and Divisia measures of M2. The top panel shows year-over-year growth rates in

both aggregates, to highlight cyclical movements while smoothing out higher frequency noise;

the bottom panel plots the difference between these series. Statistically, the difference variable



	                                                      7
shown in the bottom panel has a nonzero mean equal to −1.25, sizable standard deviation and

first-order autocorrelation of 2.57 and 0.989, and negative skewness −1.07. Moreover, a

standard Augmented Dickey-Fuller test on the difference variable indicates that this series is not

stationary (−1.95 against a 0.05 critical value of −2.87). This result implies that a central bank

attempting to achieve some nominal target by monitoring the growth rate of money eventually

will drift off path by monitoring sum M2 rather than its Divisia counterpart.

       A visual comparison of the simple sum and Divisia growth rates shown in figure 1 points

to the episode of disinflation and financial deregulation of the early 1980s as the principal source

of negative skewness, noted above, in the difference series. During this period, the Divisia

measure provides the stronger and more accurate signal of monetary tightness; the simple sum

series dramatically overstates the true rate of money growth by failing to internalize the effects

of portfolio shifts out of traditional, noninterest-bearing monetary assets and into newly-created,

but somewhat less liquid, interest-earning accounts such as monetary market mutual funds and

deposit accounts. Friedman’s (1984, 1985) predictions of a return to higher inflation during this

episode were based, primarily, on his observations of robust growth in the simple-sum monetary

aggregates; hence, these graphs support Barnett’s (2012) contention that Friedman might have

reached different conclusions had he monitored data on the Divisia aggregates instead.

       The series in figure 1 also show that, especially over the period since 1985, Divisia M2

has grown at a rate that consistently exceeds the growth rate of the simple-sum M2 during

periods of falling interest rates, particularly during the early stages of the 1990-1991, 2001, and

2007-2009 recessions; conversely, Divisia M2 growth tends to fall short of simple-sum growth

during periods of rising interest rates. Belongia and Ireland (2012a) use a New Keynesian model

to show, theoretically, how liquidity effects such as these, manifesting themselves in an inverse




	                                               8
relationship between money growth and interest rates, show up much more clearly in Divisia

monetary aggregates than in their simple-sum counterparts. Consistent with these theoretical

results and the reduced-form correlations implied by the series shown in figure 1, the SVAR we

develop and estimate below associates monetary policy easings that lower nominal interest rates

with strongly accelerating rates of Divisia money growth and, conversely, monetary tightenings

that raise nominal interest rates with sharp contractions in Divisia money growth.

       With six measures of how monetary policy might influence alternative indicators of real

activity, we were left with choices about sample periods for the model’s estimation. In a perfect

world, we would have been able to replicate all of the samples in the original Bernanke and

Blinder work but this is not possible because the Divisia data originate in January 1967 and the

first sample for the original study began in 1959. We can terminate our samples, however, in

1979.12 and 1989.12 as was the case in the original work and, in the spirit of examining the

robustness of the results, we can re-estimate the same relationships on data drawn completely

beyond the terminal date of the original study. In all, Bernanke and Blinder’s causality tests are

repeated across six samples and the results are reported in tables 1 through 6; the entries in the

tables are marginal significance levels. In each case, we are interested in two questions. First,

do differences in measurement between simple sum and Divisia aggregation indicate important

cases where money, when measured by one of the Federal Reserve’s official aggregates, shows

no effect on economic activity, yet is linked to economic activity by a Divisia measure? Second,

are Divisia measures of money and the funds rate linked to economic activity in different ways

across alternative measures of economic activity and sample periods? We now turn to the results

for answers to these questions.




	                                               9
       The first two tables report results for samples that resemble most closely those employed

in the original Bernanke and Blinder study; although the beginning date now is 1967.01, the

terminal dates are 1979.09 (to coincide with the beginning of the Federal Reserve’s announced

plan to target money growth) and 1989.12. As noted above, each entry in these tables

corresponds to the significance level for the statistic testing the hypothesis that all lags of the

monetary variable “X” can be excluded from the regression equation (1); smaller values,

therefore, point to a stronger role for the monetary policy measure. The results both confirm and

reject the findings of original work in several ways. First, as in the original paper, the funds rate

is shown to have a significant effect on all measures of economic activity but two. Unlike the

original paper when M2 affected only retail sales and M1 had no marginal significance on any

variable, the results here show that simple sum measures of money, especially M2, have effects

on multiple measures of economic activity. It is unknown whether these differing results can be

attributed to differences in vintages of data, a change in the starting date for the estimation, or

issues associated with replicating the original work as discussed in Thoma and Gray (1998,

footnote 2).

       With respect to issues of measurement, however, the tables also reveal some important

consequences. In table 1, for the sample that terminates prior to the financial innovations era,

there is little to distinguish, for example, sum and Divisia M1: Both have significant effects on

personal income, retail sales, and durable goods orders. In the case of M2, the sum measure is

significantly associated with four measures of real activity and the Divisia measure three, with a

0.06 significance level on a fourth variable. In table 2, however, which includes a sample that

terminates at 1989.12, the results reveal what was at stake when financial innovations induced

substitutions among components of a monetary aggregate and those substitutions would have




	                                                10
generated aberrant behavior in an index that could not internalize pure substitution effects. Now,

rather than diminishing the strength of any association between money and variations in real

activity, the last two rows of table 2 indicate that that Divisia M2 and MZM are related to eight

of the nine measures. And, while the funds rate is linked to all of the nine measures, these results

hardly can be interpreted as evidence that money lost its ability to explain aggregate fluctuations

after the 1970s. In fact, to emphasize the thrust of this paper, the case that money is unrelated to

aggregate fluctuations depends entirely on the results in the table’s first column where the

Federal Reserve’s simple sum measure of M1 fails to help forecast movements in all nine

measures of real activity. Instead, as a general impression, the results in Table 2 for both broad

Divisia aggregates are at odds with the conclusions of the original Bernanke and Blinder paper

and, for that matter, work in the spirit of Friedman and Kuttner as well: Monetary aggregates --

when measured properly -- exhibit significant associations with a majority of the indicators of

business cycle activity.

       Because the first two samples include 1974, a period Thoma and Gray (1998) found to

include several interest rate outliers that can influence standard inference, table 3 reports results

using an estimation period that covers 1975.04 through 1989.12.       Although the federal funds

rate remains associated with all nine measures of economic activity over this sample, both simple

sum measures of money now appear related to four out of the nine indicators. The effects of

money become stronger still when the Divisia aggregates are used: Divisia M1 is significantly

associated with four variables, Divisia M2 with five, and Divisia MZM with six. Particularly

when the issue of measurement is considered, therefore, these results are sufficient to give one

pause before abandoning the monetary aggregates as indicators of monetary policy.




	                                                11
       Table 4 reports results for a sample drawn from data completely beyond the publication

of the original study, 1990.01 through 2007.12, and they offer more evidence on the importance

of measurement. In this case, simple sum and Divisia M1 are both related to four of the

variables, while simple sum and Divisia M2 and Divisia MZM are each related to three. The

federal funds rate significantly influences five of the nine variables but, with the exception of the

unemployment rate, to different measures of activity than those closely connected to the

monetary aggregates. Thus, if one is interested in the question, “Is money or the funds rate more

closely linked to economic activity?” the results in Table 4 indicate that it matters not only how

the quantity of money is measured but also on the metric by which economic activity is

measured. Likewise, table 5 reports results from estimations across the 1975.04 - 2007.12

period, which abstracts from the interest rate outlier issue and ends prior to the beginning of the

most recent economic downturn. Again, the funds rate relates significantly to many of the

variables, but so do the measures of money, particularly, in this case, Divisia M1 and MZM.

       Finally, table 6 shows results from the period from 2000.01 through 2013.12, which

includes the financial crisis and most recent recession, during and after which the Federal

Reserve used several rounds of large-scale asset purchases -- “quantitative easing” -- in an effort

to provide further monetary stimulus while its federal funds rate target was constrained by the

zero lower bound. Notably, all six measures of monetary policy appear significantly related to

subsequent movements in real consumption spending and housing starts, variables tied most

directly to the crisis and its effects on American families. Throughout this latest episode,

however, the Divisia measures of money appear most closely linked to movements in real

economic activity, compared not only to the corresponding simple sum measures but also to the

federal funds rate, which is significant in only four of nine cases.




	                                               12
       The general message -- that the loss of explanatory power for the monetary aggregates

can be traced to the continued use of the Fed’s flawed simple sum aggregation methods -- seems

to be verified by the results in this table and the tables that precede it. These results also present,

as in Belongia (1996) and Hendrickson (2011), additional cases in which an earlier rejection of

money’s influence can be reversed when the Federal Reserve’s simple sum aggregates are

replaced by Divisia aggregates in the same experiment. Over all, there is no evidence in these

non-nested tests to conclude that the funds rate can be preferred to money -- or vice versa -- as an

indicator or potential intermediate target for the conduct of monetary policy.



                             4. MEASURING MONETARY POLICY

       To dig deeper into the sources of the links between money, interest rates, output, and

prices we follow Leeper and Roush (2003), and build a structural vector autoregressive model

for these same variables. As a first step, we move from a monthly to a quarterly frequency for

the data, which allows us to use real GDP as our measure of aggregate output Yt and the GDP

deflator as our measure of the price level Pt . We use the federal funds rate as a measure of the

short-term nominal interest rate Rt and one of the Divisia monetary aggregates to measure the

flow of monetary services M t .

       To this list of variables we add two more. First, to assist in disentangling shocks to

money supply from those to money demand, we use the user-cost measure U t , also provided by

Barnett, Liu, Mattson, and van den Noort (2013), that is the price dual to the Divisia monetary

aggregate M t . Second, to mitigate the so-called “price puzzle” that associates an exogenous

monetary tightening with an initial rise instead of fall in the aggregate price level, we follow the

now-standard practice, first suggested by Sims (1992), and include a measure of commodity


	                                                13
prices PCt -- the CRB/BLS spot index now compiled by the Commodity Research Bureau -- in

the VAR. The beginning of the quarterly sample period, 1967.1, is dictated once again by the

availability of the monetary statistics. To obtain our benchmark results, we end the sample after

2007.4 to avoid potential distortions associated with the most recent, severe recession; but later,

we also consider results that obtain when the sample is extended through 2013.4. Again

following conventions throughout the literature on structural VARs, output, prices, money, and

commodity prices enter the model in log-levels, while the federal funds rate and the Divisia user-

cost measures enter as decimals and in annualized terms, i.e., a federal funds rate quoted as 5

percent on an annualized basis enters the dataset with a reading of Rt equal to 0.05.

        Stacking the variables at each date into the 6x1 vector

                                X t = [ Pt Yt CPt            Rt    M t U t ]′ ,                   (2)

the structural model takes the form

                                                   q
                                      X t = µ + ∑ Φ j X t − j + Bε t ,                            (3)
                                                   j =1


where µ is a 6x1 vector of coefficients, each Φ j , j = 1,2,…,q, is a 6x6 matrix of coefficients, B

is a 6x6 matrix of coefficients, and ε t is a 6x1 vector of serially and mutually uncorrelated

structural disturbances, each following the standard normal distribution.

The reduced form associated with (3) is

                                                     q
                                      X t = µ + ∑ Φ j X t − j + xt ,                              (4)
                                                    j =1


where the 6x1 vector of zero-mean disturbances

                                  xt = [ pt   yt       cpt    rt   mt ut ]′                       (5)

is such that Ext xt′ = Σ.



	                                                     14
       Comparing (3) and (4) reveals that the structural and reduced-form disturbances are

linked via

                                                 Axt = ε t                                        (6)

where A = B −1 and BB′ = Σ. Since the covariance matrix Σ for the reduced-form innovations

contains only 21 distinct elements, at least 15 restrictions must be imposed on the elements of the

matrix B or its inverse A in order to identify the structural disturbances from the information

communicated by the reduced form.

       A common approach to solving this identification problem requires A to be lower

triangular. If the fourth element of the vector ε t is interpreted as a monetary policy shock, this

identification scheme assumes that the aggregate price level, output, and commodity prices

respond with a lag to monetary policy actions, and that the Federal Reserve adjusts the federal

funds rate contemporaneously in response to movements in the these same three variables but

ignores the Divisia monetary aggregates and their user costs. Although recursive schemes like

this one are based on assumptions about the timing of the responses of one variable to

movements in the others, in this case one might also interpret the fourth line in the vector of

equations from (6),

                                 a41 pt + a42 yt + a43cpt + a44 rt = ε tmp ,                      (7)

as an expanded version of the Taylor rule that includes commodity prices as well as GDP and the

GDP deflator among the variables that influence the Federal Reserve’s setting for its federal

funds rate target. Note, however, that this Taylor rule serves only to capture the

contemporaneous co-movement between the variables in (7); interest rate smoothing, and any

other systematic responses of Federal Reserve policy to lagged data, will be reflected in the

autoregressive coefficients in both (3) and (4). Likewise, the fifth line in (6),


	                                                  15
                              a51 pt + a52 yt + a53cpt + a54 rt + a55mt = ε tmd                     (8)

might be interpreted as a flexibly-specified money demand equation, linking the demand for

monetary services to the aggregate price level, aggregate output, and the short-term nominal

interest rate, with the commodity-price variable entering as well.

       An alternative approach to identification, followed by Leeper and Roush (2003), imposes

restrictions in (6) so as to allow the money supply to enter into the description of the monetary

policy rule and to provide a more tightly-specified and theoretically-consistent description of

money demand. Leeper and Roush conduct their empirical analysis using the Federal Reserve’s

simple sum M2 measure of the money supply; here, we modify and extend their approach to

apply to Divisia measures of money instead. Our benchmark non-recursive model parameterizes

the matrix A as

                                ⎛ a
                                   11

                                ⎜ a           a42    0     a44   a45    0 ⎟
                                ⎜ 41                                        ⎟

                                ⎜                                           ⎟
                                ⎝ −a65         0     0     a64   a65   a66 ⎠

       Only 19 free parameters enter into (9), implying that the model satisfies the necessary

conditions for recovering the structural disturbances in ε t from the reduced-form innovations xt

via (6). The first two rows in (9) indicate that in this specification, as in the recursive model

described above, the price level and aggregate output are assumed to respond sluggishly, with a

lag, to monetary disturbances. The absence of zero restrictions in the third row, however,

reflects our preference for modeling commodity prices as an “information variable,” responding

immediately to all of the shocks that hit the economy.



	                                                   16
       Row four of (9) continues to describe a generalized Taylor rule, but one in which the

supply of monetary services, as opposed to commodity prices, enters as an additional variable:

                                 a41 pt + a42 yt + a44 rt + a45mt = ε tmp ,                       (10)

where ε tmp represents the identified monetary policy shock. Ireland (2001) embeds a monetary

policy of this general form into a New Keynesian model. One interpretation of this rule is that it

depicts the Federal Reserve as adjusting its federal funds rate target in response to changes in the

money supply, as well as in response to movements in aggregate prices and output. An

alternative interpretation is that (10) describes Federal Reserve policy actions as impacting

simultaneously on both interest rates and the money supply. Simultaneity of this kind will arise,

quite naturally, even when Federal Reserve officials themselves pay no explicit attention to

simple sum or Divisia monetary aggregates, if, for example, the open market operations they

conduct to implement changes in their federal funds rate target also have implications for the

behavior of the monetary aggregates, which then turn out to be important for describing the

effects that those policy actions have on the economy. With monetary services now appearing in

the policy rule, it is worth recalling that Taylor’s (1979) original specification was based on

money rather than interest rates; our rule in (10), therefore, combines elements from both this

earlier specification and Taylor’s (1993) now much more celebrated rule for the funds rate.

       Row five, meanwhile, links the demand for real monetary services to aggregate output as

a scale variable and to the user cost, or price dual, associated with the Divisia quantity aggregate:

                                 a52 yt + a55 (mt − pt ) + a56ut = ε tmd .                        (11)

Belongia (2006) discusses why money demand relationships of this form are more coherent than

more commonly-used specifications, like (8), that use a nominal interest rate in its place. The

reason for this preferred specification is that economic aggregation theory provides not only a


	                                                  17
guide to measuring the quantity of money more accurately, but it also provides, in the dual to the

quantity measure, the true “price” of monetary services.

        Finally, row six of (9),

                                    a64 rt + a65 (mt − pt ) + a66ut = ε tms                          (12)

summarizes the behavior of the private financial institutions that, together with the Federal

Reserve, create liquid assets that provide households and firms with monetary services.

Belongia and Ireland (2012a) and Ireland (2012) model this behavior in more detail, to show

how an increase in the federal funds rate, by increasing the cost at which banks acquire funds,

gets passed along to the consumers of monetary services in the form of a higher user cost; (12)

adds the level of real monetary services created as well, to allow for the possibility that banks’

costs may rise in the short run as they expand the scale of their operations. Thus, in (12), ε tms

represents a shock to the monetary system that makes it more difficult and expensive for private

financial institutions to create liquid assets.

        Compared to the recursive identification scheme described initially, the non-recursive

specification in (9) at once provides a more detailed and theoretically-motivated description of

the banks that supply monetary assets and the nonbank public that demands those same assets.

In addition, (9) permits the money supply to enter into the description of Federal Reserve policy,

broadening the more conventional view that focuses on interest rates alone. In fact, (9) also

allows us to assess the adequacy of this conventional view by comparing the empirical fit of our

benchmark model to that of two more restrictive alternatives. In particular, when a45 = 0 is

imposed in (9), (10) collapses to a standard Taylor rule for adjusting the federal funds rate in

response to movements in aggregate prices and output. On the other hand, when a41 = 0 and

  a42 = 0 are imposed instead, we obtain via (10) Leeper and Roush’s (2003) preferred


	                                                   18
specification, which places money much closer to center stage by identifying monetary policy

shocks based solely on the interplay between the money supply and interest rates; Leeper and

Zha (2003) and Sims and Zha (2006) also incorporate money-interest rate rules of this simple

form into structural vector autoregressive models.

       Since none of our alternative identification strategies imposes any restrictions on the

parameters in the vector µ of constant terms or the matrices Φ j , j = 1,2,…,q, of autoregressive

coefficients, these can be estimated efficiently by applying ordinary least squares to each

equation in the reduced form (4). For the recursive identification scheme in which the matrix A

is simply required to be lower-triangular, the usual approach is followed, in which the matrix B

in (3) is obtained through the Cholesky factorization of the covariance matrix Σ of the reduced-

form innovations. For the non-recursive system (9) and its two more highly constrained variants,

the non-zero elements of A are estimated via maximum likelihood as described by Hamilton

(1994, Ch.11, pp.331-332). Throughout, the parameter q is set equal to 4, implying that one

year of quarterly lags appear in the autoregression.

       Table 7 summarizes the results from estimating the vector autoregression under each of

the four identification schemes: the recursive model, the structural model (9), and the two more

highly constrained versions of (9) just described. As noted above, the quarterly sample period in

each case begins in 1967.1 and runs through 2007.4. And while table 7 focuses on results

obtained with Divisia measures at the same three levels of aggregation -- M1, M2, and MZM --

used above to extend Bernanke and Blinder’s (1992) analysis, additional tables from the

appendix to Belongia and Ireland (2012b) report the full range of results derived with all of the

other Divisia quantity and user-cost series provided by Barnett, Liu, Mattson, and van den Noort

(2013) at the Center for Financial Stability and as well as those reported by Anderson and Jones

(2011) at the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.

       To help prevent readers from getting lost in a forest of numbers, table 7 displays

estimates of the monetary policy and money demand equations (7) and (8) for the recursive

model and the monetary policy, money demand, and monetary system equations (10)-(12) for the

non-recursive models. And to assist in their interpretations, each of these equations is

renormalized to isolate, with a unitary coefficient, the interest rate on the left-hand side of the

monetary policy equation, real monetary services on the left-hand side of the money demand

equation, and the user cost of the monetary aggregate on the left-hand side of the monetary

services equation. In this way, across all specifications and levels of monetary aggregation, the

estimated coefficients can be seen at a glance to have, with few exceptions, the “correct” signs.

       In particular, the Taylor-type monetary policy rules show the Federal Reserve increasing

the federal funds rate in response to upward movements in output and prices, while the most

parsimonious money-interest rate rule associates a contractionary monetary policy shock, that is,

a positive realization for ε tmp , as one that simultaneously decreases the money supply and

increases the funds rate. The money demand equations draw positive relationships between real

money services and output as the scale variable and negative relationships between real money

and the associated opportunity cost variable, be it the interest rate in the recursive model or the

Divisia price dual in the non-recursive frameworks. And in each of the non-recursive models,

the estimates of (12) show how the private monetary system passes increases in the federal funds

rate along to consumers of monetary services in the form of higher user costs; these estimates

also draw a positive association between real monetary services and the user costs, consistent

with our interpretation of this relationship as a “supply curve” for monetary services.



	                                                20
       Compared to the most flexible non-recursive model that includes the monetary aggregate

together with output and prices in the monetary policy equation (10), the version that reverts to a

more conventional Taylor rule by excluding money imposes a single constraint on the model.

Therefore, this restriction can be tested by comparing two times the difference between the

values of maximized log-likelihood functions across the two specifications to the critical values

implied by a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom. Likewise, the restrictions that

exclude prices and output so that money and interest rates alone appear in (10) can be tested by

comparing two times the difference in log-likelihoods to the critical values of a chi-squared

distribution with two degrees of freedom. Quite strikingly, across all three levels of monetary

aggregation, the constraint excluding money from the monetary policy rule is rejected at the 99

percent confidence level while, in the meantime, the constraints excluding prices and output

from the policy rule is imposed without any significant deterioration in the model’s statistical fit.

As a matter of fact, the constraints imposed by the model with the most parsimonious money-

interest rate rule cannot be rejected, even when the fit of this model is compared to the most

flexible, recursive specification.

       This first set of results reinforces those presented by Leeper and Roush (2003) and casts

doubt on the adequacy of conventional descriptions of monetary policy that focus on interest

rates alone. These results also join with those from Belongia (1996) and Hendrickson (2011) by

suggesting that perennial debates about the “right” level of monetary aggregation, like several

other “unsolved problems” in monetary economics, reflect more than any other factor an

unfortunate reliance on simple sum aggregates in previous empirical work. So long as one

accepts Barnett’s (1980) argument that economic aggregation theory ought to be applied to

measure the aggregate supply of monetary services just as it is applied to measure GDP,




	                                               21
industrial production, or any other index of macroeconomic activity, one remains free to choose

any monetary aggregate from M1 through MZM in drawing the main message from table 7: that

money does seem to matter, importantly, in describing the effects of Federal Reserve policy.

       Figure 2, meanwhile, reveals another problem that emerges from the recursive

specification and, as well, from the constrained version of the non-recursive model that also

excludes money from the monetary policy rule. This figure displays impulse responses of the

price level and the federal funds rate to monetary policy shocks, as identified by each of our four

alternative strategies. The figure shows the results obtained using the Divisia MZM index of

monetary services, but once again similar findings emerge when any of the other Divisia

aggregates is employed instead. Even though the commodity price variable is included in all of

the models, and even though the recursive model allows commodity prices to enter into the

monetary policy equation (7), this specification still gives rise to a noticeable price puzzle. Here,

as in Leeper and Roush (2003), including money in the policy rule helps minimize the rise in

prices that follows a contractionary policy shock. And strikingly, here, the price puzzle is greatly

magnified in the third row of figure 2, when money is excluded from the Taylor-type interest rate

rule, but is minimized in the last row, which uses the simplest money-interest rate rule instead.

In this last case, as well, the larger disinflationary effects shown in the left-hand column are

associated with the smaller rise in the interest rate shown on the right.

       All of these results provide reasons to prefer our most parsimonious description of a

monetary policy shock as one that leads to a contraction in the quantity of money and a

simultaneous “liquidity effect” on interest rates. This specification cannot be rejected in favor of

a more flexible alternative that includes prices and output in the policy rule and also produces

identified monetary policy shocks that most reliably associate tighter policy with falling prices.




	                                               22
        Figure 3, therefore, goes on to plot the impulse responses of output, prices, interest rates,

and the quantity and user cost indexes for money to all three of the structural disturbances

appearing in equations (10)-(12) -- to monetary policy, to money demand, and to the private

financial sector -- implied by the constrained, non-recursive model with the money-interest rate

rule. Once more, the results shown use Divisia MZM as the measure of money, though very

similar results obtain at all other levels of aggregation. The first column of figure 3 reveals that

the fall in prices and rise in the interest rate shown in figure 2 that follow an identified monetary

policy shock get accompanied by persistent declines in real GDP and the quantity of money.

The increase in the federal funds rate works, as well, to increase the user cost of money;

Belongia and Ireland (2006) show that, through inflation-tax effects, a response in the own-price

of money of exactly this kind transmits monetary policy shocks to output even in a model with

completely flexible prices and wages.

        The center column of figure 3 shows impulse responses to money demand shocks. The

fall in output and rise in the interest rate associated with a shock that, on impact, increases the

demand for monetary services are consistent with theory. And while the increase in the price

level is counterintuitive, Leeper and Roush (2003) present an example where aggregate prices do

rise following a positive shock to money demand. Their example is based on Ireland’s (2001)

version of the New Keynesian model in which the monetary policy rule also incorporates money

as well as the interest rate. More difficult to explain is why, after the initial increase reflecting

the shock itself, the quantity of monetary services falls persistently in figure’s fourth row; this

finding calls for a more detailed investigation of money demand dynamics using the newly-

available series on the Divisia aggregates.




	                                                23
       The right-hand column in figure 3 shows that a positive realization of the shock ε tms that

enters into equation (12) describing the behavior of the private financial sector generates a small

initial decline in output and a much larger and more persistent decrease in prices. A persistent

fall in the nominal interest rate, perhaps reflecting a deliberate, systematic monetary policy

response to the financial-sector disturbance, allows the user cost of money to decline and reverse

the initial decline in the quantity of monetary services. The panels in figure 4 examine, in various

ways, the same model’s interpretation of US monetary policy over the sample period. The top

panel simply plots the realizations of the monetary policy shock ε tmp ; since (3) normalizes each

structural disturbance to have a standard deviation of one, the graph’s scale conveniently

measures the size of each realized shock in standard deviations. Reassuringly, a series of large

contractionary (positive) monetary policy shocks stand out during the period beginning in the

fourth quarter of 1979 and continuing through the first quarter of 1982. Elsewhere in the sample,

strings of large expansionary (negative) shocks appear from 1973.4 through 1974.4 and over an

even longer period of time from 2001.1 through 2004.2.

       The bottom two panels of figure 4 show how the serially uncorrelated monetary policy

shocks are translated, via the model’s autoregressive structure, into persistent movements, first in

output and then, with a lag, aggregate prices; Laidler (1997, pp.1217-1219) describes how

dynamics like those shown here, in figure 4, and previously, in figure 3, are consistent with

“buffer-stock” models of individuals’ money demand. Each of the graphs in these two panels

plots the percentage-point difference between the actual level of output or the aggregate price

level and the level of the same variable implied by the model when the all of estimated historical

shocks except the monetary policy shocks are fed through (3). Therefore, each panel shows how




	                                               24
much higher or lower output or prices actually were at each date, compared the levels that would

have prevailed, counterfactually, in the absence of monetary policy shocks.

       The bottom panel of figure 4 highlights, in particular, how accommodative monetary

policy shocks worked to increase prices by a total of 3 percentage points in the late 1970s and

early 1980s. Interestingly, while the contractionary shocks in the early 1980s worked to halt

temporarily this upward movement, the cumulative effect of monetary policy shocks contributed

to renewed price pressures in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Monetary policy was

disinflationary throughout the 1990s, but the series of expansionary shocks realized during and

after the 2001 recession contributed to rising prices starting in 2002.4 and continuing through

2005.4. Of course, the swings in prices shown in figure 4 represent only a fraction of those

observed over the entire sample period, indicating that our structural VAR, like those estimated

previously by Leeper and Roush (2003), Primiceri (2005), and Sims and Zha (2006), attributes

the bulk of inflation’s rise and fall before and after 1980 not to monetary policy shocks but

instead to the Federal Reserve’s systematic response to other shocks that hit the economy.

       Finally, figure 5 displays the model’s implications when it is re-estimated with data

running through 2013.4, still using the Divisia MZM aggregate and our preferred money-interest

rate rule. To focus on monetary policy and its effects in the period just before, during, and after

the financial crisis and severe recession, the series in the graphs begin in 2000.1, even though the

data used to estimate the model continue to run all the way back to 1967.1. Strikingly, the

monetary policy shocks shown in the top panel are largely contractionary from 2008.3 through

2010.2, consistent with findings from previous analyses by Hetzel (2009), Ireland (2011), Tatom

(2011), and Barnett (2012), all of which point to overly restrictive monetary policy as, though




	                                               25
perhaps not the principal cause of the “great recession,” at least an important factor contributing

to its length and severity.

        Figure 6 helps in tracing these implications of the model back to original time series for

interest rates and money. The top panel shows how the Federal Reserve lowered its federal

funds rate target to a range between 0 and 0.25 percentage points in late 2008, where it has

remained ever since. By itself, this unprecedented policy action has been popularly interpreted

as indicating that an extremely accommodative monetary policy has helped counteract the effects

of the financial crisis on output both during and since the recession that began in 2007. The

statistical results presented here, however, tell a much more detailed and nuanced story. Both the

Granger causality test statistics shown in table 6, which show strong forecasting power of the

Divisia monetary aggregates for various measures of real activity, and the structural VAR, which

depicts monetary policy actions as having effects on both interest rates and those same monetary

aggregates, call special attention to the bottom panel of figure 6: For the period running from

2009.4 through 2010.2 the money stock displays -- even more severe than a deceleration in its

rate of growth -- a sustained decline in its level.

        In general, therefore, the dynamics shown in figures 5 and 6 remind us of one of the

principal lessons that Friedman and Schwartz (1963) drew from their famous analysis of the

Great Depression of the 1930s, namely, that during a banking or financial crisis the demand for

highly liquid assets may require a massive expansion of bank reserves simply to prevent broader

measures of the money stock from declining. More specifically, the pattern of monetary shocks

shown in figure 5 and the behavior of the money supply shown in figure 6 suggest strongly that

the Federal Reserve pulled back too much, too soon, when it suspended its policies of

quantitative easing during 2010.




	                                                26
       On the other hand, the monetary shocks shown in figure 5 become expansionary from

2010.3 through 2011.3, and the money stock shown in figure 6 resumes its growth at the same

time. Our model, which assigns a key role to money in the policy rule, interprets every episode

of monetary easing as “quantitative easing” by associating them with increases in money growth

and not simply declines in interest rates. It also confirms in particular that the Federal Reserve’s

second round of bond purchases in 2010 and 2011 did have its intended expansionary effects.

Thus, the middle panel of figure 5 shows that while monetary policy contributed to a cumulative

decline in output of more than 2 percent from 2008.3 through 2010.4, it has been largely

supportive of an accelerating recovery since then.



                                        5. CONCLUSION

       Our results call into question the conventional view that the stance of monetary policy

can be described with exclusive reference to its effects on interest rates and without

consideration of simultaneous movements in the monetary aggregates. Whether by replicating

and extending the results of a landmark study or by producing new results from a structural

VAR, the message from Divisia monetary aggregates is that money always has had a significant

role to play as an intermediate target or indicator variable and that any apparent deterioration in

its information content can be traced to the measurement errors inherent in the practice of simple

sum aggregation. These results also allow us to see the Federal Reserve’s recent policy of

“quantitative easing” in a new light: As having its intended stimulative effect by expanding the

growth rate of a properly measured value of the money supply, over and above whatever effects

it might have had by altering the shape of the yield curve.




	                                               27
       Our results also highlight the disconnect between modern New Keynesian models, in

which the quantity of money plays no special role once the time path for interest rates is

accounted for. In working to bridge this divide, we suspect that researchers will be led to

reconsider, as well, the same enduring questions addressed by Bernanke and Blinder (1988)

many years ago.

Notes: Each panel shows the estimates of equations (7) and (8) from the recursive specification or
equations (10)-(12) from the non-recursive models, together with the maximized value of the log-likelihood
function L. *** denotes that the null hypothesis that money can be excluded from the monetary policy rule
is rejected at the 99 percent confidence level. In no case can the null hypothesis that the monetary policy
rule includes money and interest rates alone be rejected in favor of the alternative that monetary policy
follows the Taylor rule with money.

Figure 4. Monetary Policy Shocks and Their Effects. The top panel plots the serially
uncorrelated monetary policy shock from structural VAR with the money-interest rate rule,
estimated with data from 1967.1 through 2007.4. Money is measured by the CFS’s Divisia
MZM monetary aggregate. The bottom two panels plot the cumulative effects of these shocks on
output and prices, as percentage-point differences between the actual value of each variable at
each date minus the value that, according to the estimated VAR, would have obtained in the
absence of monetary policy shocks over the entire sample.
