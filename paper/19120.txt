Is a VC Partnership Greater than the Sum of its Partners?

This paper investigates whether individual venture capitalists have repeatable investment skill and
to what extent their skill is impacted by the VC firm where they work. We examine a unique dataset
that tracks the performance of individual venture capitalists’ investments across time and as they move
between firms. We find evidence of skill and exit style differences even among venture partners investing
at the same VC firm at the same time. Furthermore, our estimates suggest the partner’s human capital
is two to five times more important than the VC firm’s organizational capital in explaining performance.

   Venture capital investments are an important engine of innovation and economic

growth, but extremely risky from an individual investor’s point of view. Sahlman (2010) re-

ports that 85% of returns come from just 10% of investments. And from 1987 until 2012 only

12.8% of investments have achieved an initial public offering.1 Furthermore, there are large

differences in fund performance between top quartile and bottom quartile venture capital

funds. In spite of the rarity of top investments, Kaplan and Schoar (2005) report persistence

in fund performance. They show that in contrast to other asset classes such as mutual funds,

venture capital firms that have a fund that outperforms the industry are likely to outperform

with their next fund.

   The ability to consistently produce top performing investments implies that there is some-

thing unique and time-invariant about venture capital firms. For example, deal flow (Sorensen

(2007)) and networks (Hochberg, Ljungqvist and Lu (2007)) have been shown to explain

much of the cross section of VC fund performance. Hellmann and Puri (2002) report that

higher quality VC’s have industry experience and Gompers, Kovner and Lerner (2009) find

that VC parter specialization can explain cross-sectional differences in performance. There

could also be firm policies or complementarities among partners or other attributes that

allow consistent top performance.

   However, it is an unanswered question as to what extent the important attributes of per-

formance are a part of the VC firm’s organizational capital or embodied in the human capital

of the people inside the VC firm. An extreme possibility is that attributes are embedded in

the firm and the people are substitutable, or alternatively a venture firm is simply a collec-

tion of people.


   1 12.8% of the investments included in the Venture Source database can be found to have eventually completed an initial

public offering.

    An analogy to universities, another human capital intensive environment we all know

well, will provide insight. The question we explore is similar to asking to what extent an

academic performs better at a top institution or are top institutions just collections of top

academics. The greater resources, reduced teaching, better students, better colleagues, etc.

of top institutions could make any researcher more productive. This scenario implies a large

effect from organizational capital. Alternatively, better research could come from human

capital differences, implying that researchers would perform equally well at any school.

    In venture capital firms, features such as brand, resources, reputation, firm deal flow,

firm network, investment processes, better colleagues, etc. could all help a partner perform

better. Alternatively, an individual might have a reputation, network, deal flow and a great

ability to find, identify or make investments. Furthermore, just as university quality may be

more important to researchers who did particular types of research, the firm may be more

important to investors involved in IPOs rather than acquisitions. We examine both of these

questions.

    Shedding light on the sources of performance in venture capital firms will help us make

progress on a fundamental question in economics as to whether a firm is more than the sum

of its parts. Williamson and Winter (1993) credit Klein (1988) with distinguishing physical

from human asset specificity. They note that Klein (1988), in a response to Coase (1988),

lecture 3, was the first to argue that an “organization is embedded in the human capital of

the employees at” the firm, but is “greater than the sum of its parts. The employees come

and go but the organization maintains the memory of past trials and the knowledge of how

to best do something.” (p. 220) Under this hypothesis, the venture firm holds some of the

knowledge of how to make great investments.

    Hart (1989) argues that “the observation that the whole of organizational capital is typi-
                                                 SUM OF VC PARTNERS?                                                      3


cally greater than the sum of its parts is equivalent to the observation that the total output

of a group of workers typically exceeds the sum of the workers’ individual outputs, to the

extent that there are complementarities.” (p. 1772) Complementarities would imply that

partners should match on quality and thus firms should contain partners of similar ability

(see Becker (1981), Kremer (1993), Burdett and Coles (1997) and Shimer and Smith (2000)

for work on complementarities and matching).

   Venture capital provides an opportunity to study these questions because we can assign

individual investments to partners and follow the latter across time as they move between

firms. This structure invites an analysis of the relative importance of partners and firms in

performance, although focusing only on venture capital limits the generality of our results.

   We begin by examining persistence at the individual partner-investment level. We use the

VentureSource database of venture capital investments in entrepreneurial firms founded

between 1987–2005 (to allow time to observe outcomes) augmented with hand collected

data. We find evidence of venture partner skill. For example, controlling for observable

firm, partner and investment characteristics such as time, industry, dollars invested, VC ex-

perience, investment round number, firm founding date, etc., we find that among investors

who made at least three investments, a one standard deviation increase in past IPO rate

implies a 18% higher probability of an IPO in their third investment.2 Given the rarity of

IPOs, the strength of persistence at the partner-investment level is quite high, particularly

in light of recent work by Phalippou (2010) that argues that ex-ante persistence comes only

from low performance and the Kaplan and Schoar (2005) results are exaggerated. Our abil-

ity to find strong persistence in IPOs, even with numerous deal and partner level controls

   2 In a complementary paper, Gompers et al. (2010) address whether the entrepreneurs receiving VC have performance

persistence. They find an explanation for the source of persistence, while we attempt to separate the importance of the firm
and person in outcomes.

not before possible, provides support for Kaplan and Schoar (2005)’s original fund level per-

sistence results as well as recent work on fund persistence by Hochberg, Ljungqvist and

Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) and Harris et al. (2013).

    We also investigate persistence in other types of exits. On average, the same people who

have IPO’d will continue to IPO, those who achieve top exits through M&A will continue to

do so and those who fail will continue to fail. Overall it seems that partners have exit “styles”

insofar as they make investments that tend to exit in the same way.3

    Next, we include the past performance of the firm by the other partners to begin to study

the role of the firm in partner performance persistence. We find that a firm’s past IPO suc-

cess rate also correlates with a partner’s probability of achieving an IPO on his next invest-

ment. But, of course, we cannot tell if this is because similar quality partners join together

to form a firm (as implied by assortative matching), in which case past firm performance

is just more information about partner quality, or if better firms make it more likely that a

partner will IPO.

    When we include VC firm cohort fixed effects, we still find significant persistence. That is,

even comparing partners in the same firm investing at the same time, we find persistence in

their relative ability to IPO or achieve top M&A exits. This finding demonstrates the strength

of the persistence. Assortative matching should have driven like quality partners to join

together, but on average venture capital firms do not seem to be collections of similar quality

partners.

    Results from looking directly at the average persistence of venture capital partners high-

lights the potential importance of the partner and the firm but cannot tell us their relative

   3 Venture partners determine which deals they want to do and then seek approval from their partners. They are not as-

signed deals, nor do they have to give deals they like to other partners. Deals are typically passed between partners if the
partner who finds the deals does not feel he has the time or expertise to investigate or manage the deal. Thus this style
persistence seems to be a quality of the VC partner.

importance. In order to separate the firm and partner, we exploit partner movement be-

tween firms. To the extent that partners change performance as they move firms, “ability”

will be allocated to the firm from complementarities, policies, brand, etc. And to the extent

the moving partners do not alter their own or their co-partners’ performance, “ability” will

be allocated to the partner.

   Bertrand and Schoar (2003) employ a similar idea when they examine CEOs who move

firms and separate out manager effects on firm policies, while Graham, Li and Qiu (2012) use

executives who move to determine the relative importance of firm and person in executive

compensation. We employ the method developed by Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999)

(hence forth AKM) and Abowd, Creecy and Kramarz (2002) to separate out partner and firm

effects on the performance of venture capital investments.4

   Estimates of the VC partner and firm fixed effects provide evidence of the relative im-

portance of VC partner human capital and VC firm organizational capital. Across different

specifications we find that the partner fixed effects are more likely to be jointly significant

than the VC firm fixed effects and that the partner fixed effect estimates explain two to five

times the variation in exit values relative to VC firm fixed effects. Thus, our estimates suggest

that both the partner and the VC firm can affect performance but that the partner’s human

capital is more important. The estimates of partner fixed effects also demonstrate signifi-

cant heterogeneity in partner type. Translated into level of exit valuation, the distribution

of partner fixed effects implies that top quartile partners produce at least $82m on average

in exit valuation, while bottom quartile partners produce less than $4m. To put this in con-

text, the mean exit value is $151m and the median is zero. The strong partner fixed effects

outcomes.

supports further study of individual partner characteristics (see Zarutskie (2010), Bottazzi,

Da Rin and Hellmann (2008), and Acharya and Kehoe (Forthcoming)), such as gender, edu-

cation, networks or experience, to better understand outcomes in venture capital.

    The use of movers in this part of the analysis clearly restricts our sample to partners at

firms where someone transferred to or away from the firm. The excluded sample covers

40% of VC firms who are less active and smaller. The included sample represents the ac-

tive and central part of the venture capital community as it covers 74% of venture-backed

investments.

    The use of movers also introduces the concern that endogenous moving affects our re-

sults. In our final sample, over 30% of partners change firms and thus provide ample data

on movement. However, our findings only tell us the average effect of movement on part-

ners who move. To what extent partners who do not move would be similarly affected is

unknown. As in all papers that use movement as an identification strategy, some endogene-

ity concerns cannot be eliminated. What we can do is consider the probable impacts from

endogenous movement as well as examine different subsamples and controls to address

empirical concerns.

    Recall that the estimation technique uses changes in performance of movers’ investment

around the move to identify the firm fixed effects. We separately look at partners who move

to historically worse performing firms compared to those who move to historically better

performing firms. Movers to better firms are more likely choosing to move and doing so

in anticipation of changes to their performance. We also consider partners who move to

very different firms versus partners who move to similar firms. In all cases, the conclusions

about the relative value of the firm are similar. Despite these and other attempts to deal with

endogeneity we acknowledge that we cannot completely eliminate the issue, and thus our

results must be interpreted with some caution.

   The balance of the paper is organized as follows. First, we explore the data and variables

of interest. This is presented in Section I. Next, we study persistence at the partner-level

across a range of outcomes. This is presented in Section II. Section III presents estimation of

a full fixed effects model. Then, in Sections IV and V we present sub-sample and robustness

results for all estimates. Section VI concludes.


                                                I.   Data description



   The main dataset begins with the venture capital financings, investors and entrepren-

eurial firms from data provider VentureSource. Using quarterly surveys, press releases and

regulatory filings, VentureSource provides a comprehensive picture of the venture capital

market. The full database covers 1987 to 2012 and includes 27,079 financings in 16,897 en-

trepreneurial firms financed by 3,777 investing firms. We improve the data on two fronts

with information provided confidentially by several venture capital firms, limited partners,

web searches and public data sources.5 First, the set of exit or investment valuations – more

often missing in similar databases – was improved for a larger set of acquisitions and pub-

lic offerings. This was done through searches of S-1 filings, a merge of VentureSource with

SDC’s M&A data and relationships with some VC firms. We believe the resulting exit valua-

tions are more representative of exits than the standard data sources.

   Next, a collection of web searches of venture capital firm websites, Capital IQ biography

data and consistency checks from other pieces of data within VentureSource each identify

where VC partners in VentureSource worked when they made their investments. This also

ensures that we separately identify partners with the same name. The resulting database

covers the employment history of venture capital partners from 1987 - present. We validated

a large, random pool of board seats using VentureXpert and “Form D” regulatory filings. The

latter are the required filings of sales of private securities that report amounts invested and

directors (i.e. VC board members). The analysis found no systematic errors and revealed we

have a comprehensive dataset of venture partner investments.

    The panel of venture capital partner board members covers 1987 to 2012 where a board

member is any investor listed on an entrepreneurial board and associated with a venture

capital or other investing firm. This definition excludes outside board members or any of

the management team of the entrepreneurial firm. We only include board members in the

data that have at least two entrepreneurial board seats for firms founded prior to 2006 and

whose investing firm has made at least four investments over the whole sample. The lat-

ter restriction eliminates small VCs, those that rarely take board seats and many corporate

venture capitalists. The major sample includes 19,031 financings, 11,885 entrepreneurial

firms, 1,573 investing firms and 5,324 unique VC partners.6 The average board member has

6 board seats (median 4).

    Venture capital partners who switch venture capital firms are an important part of our

analysis. After correcting the data on board membership that matches partners to board

seats, we can track movement of individuals between VC firms. We label a mover as a ven-

ture capital partner with multiple board seats assigned to different VC firms. Analyzing the

change in titles for the first moves of all movers shows that the vast majority are promoted

or remain at the same level. In particular, 45% of movers start as general partners (GP),

    6 We define anyone who invests in two venture financing where they sit on the board as a ‘VC’ although some may work

for a firm that also does more later stage investing in more established firms (often referred to as a PE firm), and some may be
individual, so called ‘angel’ investors.

with 76% moving up to managing director or remaining as a GP. Similarly, only 27% of the

movers who start as managing directors appear to be demoted after their first move.7 Sec-

tion III provides additional information about movers including the firms they move to and

from and a comparison of non-movers.

   There are several dependent variables of interest that we use throughout the analysis.8

We initially follow the literature and characterize success by whether the entrepreneurial

firm had an initial public offering. Some 12.8% of entrepreneurial firms in the sample and

10% of board seats had such an exit (i.e. some entrepreneurial firms have multiple obser-

vations because there are multiple board seats). The IPO dependent variable is a weaker

measure of success since 2002 as 90% of non-failure exits were acquisitions.

   We also consider success through acquisitions. We create a dummy variable for “success-

ful acquisition” which is 1 if the entrepreneurial firm sold via a merger or acquisition at a

value at least twice the total capital invested. We cannot determine actual returns for acqui-

sitions because we do not know the amount returned to the VC at exit, but if the total sale

value was more than twice the amount invested, then it is likely to be a more successful exit

on average than exits with a smaller exit value to investment ratio.9 We also cannot use all

acquisition outcomes because some do not report a value and many appear to be disguised

failures. However, the largest acquisitions (greatest successes) tend to have reported values

because the acquisition is material to the public acquirer and thus required to be disclosed.

   Combining IPOs and “successful acquisitions” the fraction of success is 23% for entre-

preneurial firms and 21% for board seats. Along with these two success variables, a dummy

variable “Failure” is set to 1 if the firm shutdown, is still private by the end of the sample

   7 The  full analysis of title changes can be found in the online appendix.
   8 Alloutcomes are measured as of the end of 2012.
    9 Note that this variable is zero for initial public offerings. The results are insensitive to defining “successful” as 1.5 − 3X of

total capital raised.

(through 2012), or had a low acquisition (less than twice total capital invested). In total

there are 6 possibilities for an investment in our sample: IPO, successful acquisition, low

acquisition, no-reported-value acquisition, failure, or still private. As a final measure, we

summarize all outcomes into one variable using the log of one plus the exit value – zero for

failures combined with IPO and reported acquisition values. Since some firms have yet to

exit or have a missing exit valuations, we deal with these firms in two ways. For our main

analysis we treat them as zeros but we also drop them from the sample and find similar re-

sults.10 Table I details these dependent variables and a host of controls that we use through

the analysis.


                              II.   Results: VC Partner Performance Persistence



     When a venture capital firm makes an investment in an entrepreneurial firm, the partner

who led the investment at the venture capital firm often takes a seat on the board. For each

of these events, we calculate the venture capital partner’s investment history. “% IPO t − 1”

measures the fraction of the partner’s investments made prior to t that exited via an ini-

tial public offering. Performance persistence implies that past performance has predictive

power for future outcomes. Our analysis of persistence tracks the relationship between a

partner’s investment success and the outcome of the current board seat investment (IPOt ).

Thus, we ask whether or not venture capital partners who have made more investments that

IPO’d in the past are more likely to IPO their current investment.

     Attrition in the data may lead to a spurious relationship between past success and fu-

ture outcomes. The null hypothesis of no persistence implies that each new investment is

  10 Firms that have not exited are often thought to be the living dead and firms that don’t report exit values tend to have

smaller exits. Our cutoff of founding dates pre-2006 implies the entrepreneurial firms have 6 years to exit. This suggests we
should treat them as zeros.

a random draw. Presumably worse performing investors are more likely to leave the sam-

ple. If this is true, then under the null, the majority of active partners in the data would

be lucky, unskilled investors. Here, naively examining the data would result in a finding of

positive persistence. However, if we looked only at investors who did at least t investments

then these investors’ past success would have no correlation with the outcome of their next

investment.

   The following regressions only consider cross-sections within the set of partners with t

investments. That is, we ask whether partners with at least three (or 5 or 7) investments

and a greater fraction of IPOs in their first two (or 4 or 6) investments are more likely to

IPO their third (or fifth or seventh) investment. Our results will therefore be the persistence

conditional on having a level of partner experience in number of investments.11

   Before reporting regression results we note that the probability that a partner’s second

investment IPOs is unconditionally 12.5%. However, conditional on the first investment

IPOing the probability of the second IPOing is 35%, while conditional on the first invest-

ment not IPOing the probability of the second IPOing is 8%. This same persistence is found

formally in the regressions below.

   Table II reports the results of a probit regression on cross-sections of partner experience

for the second, third, fifth and seventh investment. Controls include the age of the VC firm,

the time the VC has been taking board seats and entrepreneurial firm characteristics such

as industry (“Information Technology,” “Healthcare,” “Consumer/Retail,” and “Other”), in-

vestment year, dollars invested and development stage (round number fixed effects), with


   11 As we condition on investors with more and more investments this is not a random sample of investors. The estimates

of persistence we find are conditional on making t investments. They are not the average amount of skill but the relative skill
among investors with t investments. The online appendix provides the results from a regression that pools all the experience
levels.
12                                                                                                                   MAY 2013


standard errors are clustered at the investment year.12 The estimates imply a strong re-

lationship between a partner’s earlier investment outcomes and current success.13 A one

standard deviation increase in the the fraction of IPOs for investments made prior to t im-

plies a 18%, 15% and 18% increase in the predicted IPO probability for investments 3, 5 and

7 respectively (where one standard deviation is 29%, 24%, and 21% respectively). The signs

on the coefficients for the major control variables are as expected, although the estimate for

“Log years partner experience” merits discussion. Each sub-sample conditions on experi-

ence, so the interpretation of this control is the relative speed at which a partner gets to t

investments. The negative coefficient in some specifications implies that partners that take

longer to get to that t ’th investment are relatively less likely to have a subsequent IPO.

      Note that the coefficient on persistence is from a comparison with other investors who

made the same number of investments. It would seem that skill might differentiate partners

as they start their career, but attrition could reduce the sample to only the group of more and

more skilled partners. This would result in narrower, or possibly no, skill differences in the

most experienced group. Simultaneously, as we move to partners with a greater number

of investments we have more data about the partner, and thus presumably more accurate

estimates of partner quality. Overall, although each subsample is possibly quite different,

we find significant skill differences at each experience level.

      Note also that we use the eventual outcome of the earlier investments even if the exit has

not yet occurred by the t ’th investment. This is because we are not asking if the quality of

the VC was in the public information set but only whether VCs who invest in eventual IPOs

are more likely to produce an IPO with their next investment. In unreported results, we also

         also use a 17 industry classification as well as a 115 industry classification with similar results.
     13 Phalippou
                (2010) argues that fund-level persistence is non-existent or mainly driven by the left tail. Our results support
the original Kaplan and Schoar (2005) persistence result as partner level persistence should lead to fund persistence unless
fees are adjusted to match skill (something rarely done in VC).

repeat the analysis in Table II with “public IPO” or the fraction of board seats with known

success as of the current board seat. The results are similar.14 So knowledge about initial

success at the time of the next investment does not measurably affect the quality of the next

investment. This result is evidence against the idea that persistence comes from initial luck

which provides a “halo” that makes it easier to access future good investments.


                                           A.   Alternative outcome measures



   While the IPO is an accepted measure of partner and VC firm success, there is a large

range of other outcome variables for entrepreneurial investments. Consider the three addi-

tional outcome variables discussed above: successful acquisition, failure and exit valuation.

For each, we create an analogue to “% IPO t −1” that summarizes a partner’s fraction of suc-

cess or failure. “% Acq. t −1” is the fraction of the partner’s investments made prior to t that

had a successful acquisition. “% Fail t − 1” measures the same, but uses investment failure.

Finally, “Avg. Exit value t − 1” uses the average of one plus the exit value of all investments

made prior to t (logged).

   Columns 1 and 3 of Table III again show a strong correlation between the success (or

failure) of earlier investments and future outcomes. Recall that a one standard deviation

increase in IPO at investment three implies a 18% increase in future success probability. The

predicted impacts for a one standard deviation increase in historical successful acquisitions

or failures at investment three is 10% and 8% respectively. For the fifth investment these

magnitudes are 15% (IPO), 10% (Acquisition) and 6% (failure). The analogous predictions

for a one standard deviation increase in historical exit value at investments three and five

   14 Also in unreported regression, we introduce a longer history to the persistence regressions such as the partner’s IPO rate

as of two investments previous (IPOt −2 ). Longer lags remain statistically significant, while the size falls as we go further back
in the partner’s investment history.

are 13% and 14%.

     The results show that additional controls and measures of quality further our under-

standing of partner performance persistence. Persistence in returns is not simply at the

portfolio level, but also investment by investment at the partner-level for IPOs, high acqui-

sition exits and failure, even controlling for partner, firm, industry and time-varying charac-

teristics in a way that was not possible in other work. Overall, partners seem to have an exit

“style.”15


                                          B.    Persistence and the VC firm


     Does the persistence found above stem from the partner or the firm where the partner

works? For example, VC partners could simply match to high quality firms and inherit the

firm’s deal flow and resources (e.g. Sorensen (2007)). To begin to address this, we include the

past performance of the other partners in the firm. Define “%VC IPO (−i )” as the fraction

of board seats for the partner’s VC firm that had an IPO excluding those investments made

by the partner. If a partner is merely successful because of the firm, then the inclusion of

this control should eliminate or at least dramatically lower the coefficient on the partner’s

past success. The last four columns of Table II introduce this control. The inclusion of the

other partner VC performance does not alter the explanatory power of the partner’s past

investment success. In fact, both measures are statistically meaningful in nearly all specifi-

cations. The evidence suggests that both the partner and the firm play a role in investment

outcomes, but additional analysis is required to separate the two. We next introduce a ven-

ture capital fund fixed effect to compare partners in the same firm investing at the same

time.
  15 This result echo’s findings in a recent working paper Smith, Pedace and Sathe (2010) that reports that funds that have a

high percentage of IPOs or M&A exits tend to have a higher percentage in their next fund.

                                     C.   VC fund fixed effects


  Venture capital firms are potentially long-lived and each firm raises a new fund to invest

typically every few years. Partners, as well as the size of funds, can change. To compare

partners at the same firm investing at the same time we would like include fund fixed effects.

Lacking a comprehensive mapping of fund to board seat, we create an alternative VC fund

fixed effect. For each VC firm in the sample, we create “cohorts” of active VC partners by

five-year windows. Starting from the first investment made by the VC firm, each five years

creates a new firm cohort.

  Table IV presents VC cohort fixed effect results for each of the exit outcomes from Table

III using a conditional logit framework. This estimation compares partners investing at the

same firm in the same time period. Estimates show that the success of earlier investments

as measured by either IPO or successful acquisition predicts higher probabilities of such

events in the future for IPOs and successful acquisitions. The results for failure persistence

are weaker and statistically insignificant, while the exit value results in columns 7 and 8

remain strong. The results demonstrate both that the partner matters and that assortative

matching among partners is significantly less than perfect - partners at the same firms have

observably different abilities.

  Altogether our findings suggest that persistence does not arise simply because funds tend

to do the same type of investments at similar times. Rather, it seems due to real partner skill.


                              III.   Three-way fixed effects model


  The results in Table II indicate that both the venture capital firm and partner are impor-

tant variables in the cross-section of outcomes. The results in Tables II or IV which include

historical firm performance or VC fund fixed effects have two interpretations. One, VC firm
16                                                                                           MAY 2013


characteristics explain part of the partner performance persistence. Or alternatively, part-

ners with significant skill match together with similar (but not perfectly similar) partners.

Separating the firm and partner in investment outcomes requires moving away from a study

of persistence to a general cross-section analysis with fixed effects for both actors.

     Consider the following linear model of exit valuation Vi j k t :



                       Vi j k t = β1 X i t + β2Z j t + β3Uk t + αi + φ j + γt + εi j k t .       (1)



     In equation (1), i denotes the VC partner, j the VC firm, k the entrepreneurial firm and t

the date of the investment. γt is the investment year fixed effect. The variables X i t , Z j t and

Uk t include time-varying controls for each. The unit of observation a board seat taken by a

venture capital partner i in entrepreneurial firm k while working at VC firm j . The date t is

defined by the first investment made by VC firm j in firm k . Our focus is the retrieval of the

partner and firm fixed effects αi and φ j , which requires movements of partners between

firms.

     Bertrand and Schoar (2003) use movers within a sample of CEOs to identify whether in-

dividual fixed effects can explain cross-sectional variation in corporate policy variables. We

use the Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999) (AKM) refinement of this methodology de-

veloped further in Abowd, Creecy and Kramarz (2002). AKM is a part of a large literature in

labor economics that attempts to isolate sources that are statistically related to employment

compensation. Graham, Li and Qiu (2012) use this refinement to examine the impact of the

firm and individual on executive compensation. The AKM method provides estimates of

firm and partner fixed effects for both movers and stayers. The inclusion of fixed effects for

all partners and firms results in a potentially large set of parameter estimates, typically re-
                                                SUM OF VC PARTNERS?                                                     17


duced by transforming the data using the within estimator. This transformation demeans

by one of the fixed effect dimensions. AKM show that this approach does not simultane-

ously address the heterogeneity and allow parameter recovery. They show that including

firm fixed effects after first sweeping out partner heterogeneity produces the standard re-

sult from a dummy variable regression. As in the Bertrand and Schoar (2003) study, one also

has to define the sample in which fixed effects can be estimated, theirs being the mobility

sample of CEOs. The analogous group in the AKM method is the “connected” group.

   Detailed by by Abowd, Creecy and Kramarz (2002), the “connectedness” sample provides

the set of firms and partners that can be identified with the AKM method. Graph theory

is used to determine groups of individuals that are connected. Moreover, Abowd, Creecy

and Kramarz (2002) provides the normalization procedure to ensure that the fixed effect

estimates are comparable in the whole sample.

   The connectedness sample requires some partners to be employed by multiple firms.

Any two firms are connected if a partner moves from one to the other and any string of

firms is connected if they are connected to a firm that is connected to another firm. For

example, if a partner from firm A moved to firm B and another partner moved from firm

B to firm C then A, B, and C are connected. If another partner moved from firm D to A, B,

or C then A, B, C, and D are all connected. Abowd, Creecy and Kramarz (2002) show that

connections invite computationally feasible estimation of the firm and person fixed effects

for each connected group, relative to a within-group benchmark. The benefit of this method

is the ability to estimate the partner fixed effects for both movers and non-movers. Such a set

is more representative if movers are very different on both observables and unobservables.16


  16 The analysis of managerial compensation in Graham, Li and Qiu (2012) has more detail on the methodology, its strengths

and its limitations.
18                                                                                                                     MAY 2013


      It is useful to understand the basic features of how the AKM method separately identifies

the partner and firm effect using the movers.17 Define the variable Fi l t as a dummy vari-

able equal to one if partner i works at firm l at time t , and zero otherwise. We can rewrite

equations (1) as:


                                                                                  J
                                                                                  X
                           Vi j k t = β1 X i t + β2Z j t + β3Uk t + αi +                 Fi l t φl + γt + εi j k t .       (2)
                                                                                  l =1



The AKM method first sweeps out the partner fixed effect by averaging over the partner’s

investments to get:


                                                                         J
                                                                         X
                                 V i = β1 X i + β2Z i + β3U i +                 F i l φl + αi + γt + εi .                  (3)
                                                                         l =1



Here, V i is partner i’s average exit valuation across the whole sample period. Next, demean

(2) with (3) to get:



                             Vi j k t − V i =β1 (X i t − X i ) + β2 (Z j t − Z i ) + β3 (Uk t − U i )
                                                  J
                                                  X                                                                        (4)
                                              +          (Fi l t − F i l )φl + (γt − γt ) + (εi j k t − εi ).
                                                  l =1



First note that the partner fixed effects have been removed with demeaning. Second, the

term (Fi l t − F i l )φl makes clear that the VC firm fixed effect is only identified using partners

that move (i.e. Fi l t 6= F i l ). Analogous to the description in Graham, Li and Qiu (2012), the

differences in performance for partners changing VC firms allow us to estimate the firm

fixed effects for the firms where the mover was a partner.

      Finally, we can recover the partner fixed effects using the estimates from the standard

     17 This   discussion follows Graham, Li and Qiu (2012).

least square dummy variable regression in (4) and the following equation:


                                                                    J
                                                                    X
                          α̂i = V i − β̂1 X i − β̂2Z i − β̂3U i −          F i l φ̂l .        (5)
                                                                    l =1



Equation (5) uses the beta estimates and firm fixed effect estimates from equation (4) and

multiplies them by partner i 0 s average characteristics. It is interesting to note that the last

term ensures that the partner fixed effects are reduced by the firm fixed effect estimates of

all the VC firms where the partner worked multiplied by the fraction of his time he spent at

each VC firm.




  Some properties of the AKM estimator are noteworthy. An important source of variation

is the mobility of partners, which if limited can bias the estimates of the fixed effects. While

this issue exists in all studies that use mobility, the concerns are not severe in our sample

with 30% movers. Next, one important benefit of the inclusion of both movers and stayers

in the connectedness sample is the increased precision from a larger sample. Including only

movers as in Bertrand and Schoar (2003) would shrink the number of partners nearly 70%.

The fixed effect estimates themselves have properties similar to other estimators. As shown

by Wooldridge (2010) the estimates of the time-varying variable coefficients are unbiased

and consistent, while the fixed effects estimates are only unbiased. Last, the connectedness

sample requires dropping one partner by normalizing the group mean to zero for each of

the connected groups. Further, comparison of fixed effects across these groups requires

a normalization as discussed in Abowd, Creecy and Kramarz (2002). None of the results

discussed below change when we focus on the one main connected group or simply avoid

using the latter normalization procedure.

                                                  A.   Fixed effects results



     Estimation of equation (1) starts with the data on the board seat and its investment out-

come for VC partners with least four investments. This restriction ensures an ample set of

outcomes to estimate both a partner and firm fixed effect. Next, the connectedness group-

ing eliminates all partners and firms that lack a mover (to or from) during the sample pe-

riod. In the end, the sample in the AKM estimates for exit valuation has 2,114 partners, 623

VC firms and 603 movers. This collection of VC firms comprises 70% of all financing events,

74% of all entrepreneurial firms, 84% of all dollars invested.

     Estimation of the full fixed effects model includes time-varying controls for VC firm expe-

rience, entrepreneurial firm stage, dollars invested and VC partner experience. Additionally,

the model has year fixed effects, but initially excludes industry fixed effects because most

partners and firms rarely switch industries.18 Importantly, all regressions include a control

for the round number of the investment which addresses concerns about risk differences

at different stages. We use the four major outcome variables from above, but our focus will

be on the estimates from the log exit valuation regressions.19 The 60% correlation between

valuation and the IPO dummy show the variable contains much of the information in the

standard outcome measure.

     Table V presents the results of estimating equation (1) using the AKM method. We focus

on the estimates’ relative contribution to the model R 2 and on the p-values from a test that

   18 The industry fixed effect can only be identified from partners who invest in different industries over time (much like the

firm fixed effect). Table VI includes industry fixed effects and finds similar results. Sections IV and V.A discuss possible biases
due to industry effects.
   19 For the outcome variables “IPO,” “Acquisition” and “Failure” we use the linear probability model. The major cost of the

linear probability model are bounded fixed effects estimates. Let X i β̂ be the predicted values from a general model with this
form. Here, the estimates of the one-way fixed effects are bounded −X i β ≤ αi ≤ 1−x i β . Non-linear models that do not suffer
from the incidental parameters problem, such as the conditional logit, do not invite the rich analysis of separating the person
and firm fixed effects. This restriction forces us to focus the discussion of the AKM results to the continuous variable outcome
“Exit valuation,” while still reporting those of the linear probability specification for illustration.

                                                                               cov (Y, p a r t n e r F E )

the covariance of the dependent variable with the partner and firm fixed effects, each scaled

by the dependent variable variance. Rather than focus on the level of R 2 , these measures

present the fraction of the total R 2 attributable to each type of fixed effect. The partner fixed

effects explain 2 - 5 times more of the cross-sectional variation in the outcomes than the VC

firm fixed effects. For exit valuation, some 46% of the total R 2 is attributable to the estimated

partner fixed effects (the omitted category are the other control variables) while 8% of the

total R 2 is attributable to the firm fixed effects.21 Thus, the partner explains almost 5 times

more than the firm. These stark differences in explanatory power manifest themselves in

the hypothesis tests on the fixed effects. The F-test that all the partner fixed effects are the

same is rejected in all but the successful acquisitions specifications. The p-value for the

analogous test on VC firm fixed effects consistently fails to reject the null. The estimates

imply that the average partner has explanatory power in the outcome regressions.

   Not only do the estimated fixed effects point to the relative importance of firm and part-

ner, but they also provide a picture on the heterogeneity of partners. The plot of the de-

meaned partner fixed effects from the largest “connected” group in Figure 1 provides eco-

nomic magnitudes to the estimates.22 The reported fixed effects are in units of log exit valu-

ation and demeaned. The largest connected group – 86% of the full AKM sample – exhibits

significant variation in the fixed effect estimates. When translated into exit value levels, the

implied exit value advantage of the top quartile versus bottom quartile partner fixed effect

is at least $78m. To put this in perspective, 55% of exits result in no return and the mean exit


  20 The  reported F-test results only consider the largest connected group.
  21 We  also repeated the analysis using the more memory-intensive method of including dummy variables for partner, firm
and year. The results, as expected, are the same.
   22 Any report of the estimated fixed effects from AKM must condition on such a grouping because the estimates are relative

to a within-group reference fixed effect.

value is $151.


                                        IV.   Sub-samples



     Reestimation of the full fixed effects model allows us to both better understand the firm

versus person and address some possible empirical concerns. Table VI presents five sep-

arate regressions for log exit valuation. Column 1 considers the set of VC firms that are in

the top 10% of experience measured by total board seats. The movers and stayers of these

firms are then included if they satisfy the connectedness criterion. Focusing on this sample

helps us examine whether there are some VC firms that have built up organizational capital

over time. The results in column 1 on the F-test are much more favorable towards the firm.

This suggests that in the sample of top VC firms, the partner and VC firm are both important

in explaining the cross-section of outcomes with the partner explaining over three times as

much.

     Column 2 considers the first six investments of all VC partners from the full sample. Here,

we aim to examine whether the firm is more important for partners with less experience. For

example, in an academic setting, younger faculty members may be more impacted by their

university. There is some support for this idea in that the partner now explains roughly three

times more exit value variation than the firm.

     The main model (1) excluded industry fixed effects as they are only identified off of part-

ners that invest in multiple industries. We include them in column 3 of Table VI and find very

similar results. However, a large fraction of partners invest in only one industry (primarily

biotech). Therefore, in Column 4 we consider only partners who make biotech investments.

We again find very similar results. These tests suggest that the relative firm and partner ef-

fects are stemming from within industry variation. We also reestimate column 3 including
                                       SUM OF VC PARTNERS?                                      23


industry fixed effects with firms categorized into 17 or alternatively 115 different industries

(results reported in the online appendix). The partner continues to explain more than three

times more than the firm. We also directly compare partners versus industries dropping

firm fixed effects and directly employing the AKM methodology on partners and industries.

Now partners who invest only in one industry are ‘stayers’ and partners who invest across

industries are the ‘movers’ that provide the needed variation. The variance decomposition

reported in the online appendix finds the partner explains 6 times more than the industry

when using either the 4, 17 or 115 industry categorizations. Thus, the partner persistence

does not seem to arise from an industry effect.

  The last column of Table VI attempts to address concerns about the relative sample size

of partners to firms. The main specification has approximately 2,100 partners to 623 firms,

possibly giving less power to identify firm fixed effects. We use a random sampling proce-

dure to generate 1,000 different samples where the total number of partners equals the total

number of firms. Fixing the set of movers to 300, we construct the connectedness sample

and then select stayers to equate the total number of firms and partners. The estimation

is run on each sample and the table reports median F-test p-values and the means of the

R 2 contributions. The R 2 contribution is still in favor of the partner two-to-one, while the

F-test continues to fail to reject the null that all firm fixed effects are the same or zero.


                                         V.   Robustness



  The results above are robust to a wide array of specifications. There is a large set of in-

vestments that lack an outcome. We treat these firms as either non-IPOs, zero exit values or

failed acquisitions depending on the specification of the regression. This treatment is rea-

sonable because we only considered entrepreneurial firms founded prior to 2006 so many of
24                                                                                       MAY 2013


the better firms will have exited. Nonetheless, it is possible this assumption is driving some

of the results. So we repeat each estimation without investments that lack an exit event as of

the end of the sample. The results – persistence, F-tests and R 2 contributions – are similar

for exit value, successful acquisitions and IPO/acquisitions. The results for IPOs are weaker

for the partner fixed effects in the AKM model, which is likely driven by the near absence of

IPOs post-2001. We conclude that the major results are not driven by our assumptions on

outcomes for non-exited investments.

     One potential concern of the AKM method is the use of movers. Their movement provides

the variation to estimate the VC firm fixed effects and in turn, those of non-movers. Movers’

decisions are potentially endogenous to their own performance or that of their past firm.

First we examine the similarities between movers and stayers and their firms, and run some

robustness checks. Then, in the next subsection, we consider the potential effects on the

interpretation of our results.

     Table VII details features of the firms and partners that are the source of movers and their

destinations. Panel A shows that, not surprisingly, firms that movers leave are larger and

older. These firms also invest in earlier stage companies and similar industries.

     Panel A of Table VII highlights other features of firms that movers move from and to: for

example, performance is higher at firms people leave and lower at firms they go to. This

difference suggests that the average mover is being fired from good firms or selecting rela-

tively worse firms to join. However, in unreported results, we find that exclusion of the year

fixed effects in the AKM specification dramatically increases the size and importance of VC

fixed effects. This difference implies that much of the partner movement is correlated with

changes in investment performance over time, i.e., partners seem to leave around (before

and after) a peak in VC performance. Thus, the perceived difference is due to market timing
                                      SUM OF VC PARTNERS?                                      25


and the inclusion of year fixed effects is important.

  Next, Panel B of Table VII compares the characteristics of movers and stayers, reporting

the means and resulting two-sample t-tests for a set of observables. Movers and stayers

are similar across most dimensions, excluding investment stage (round number) and total

number of investments. Similarly, the analysis of title changes discussed in Section 1 (and in

the online appendix) shows that the majority of movers take positions at their second firm

with a relatively higher or the same title.

  Finally, Panel C of Table VII presents a similar comparison at the firm-level. The AKM

firm sample comprises 55% (623) of VC firms with at least two partners who sat on at least 4

board seats. The excluded firms are those that never had a mover move to or from the firm.

Such firms are likely very young or those that failed after their first fund. The exit value and

IPO rate differences show that the included firms are larger and generally more successful.

  The AKM method is also robust to the time-varying performance measures used in Tables

II and III, which Graham, Li and Qiu (2012) note help control for any assortative matching

between firms and movers. A better match may result in improved firm performance which

could bias the firm fixed effect estimates. Inclusion of both the lagged partner performance

and firm performance from Table III has no measurable impact on the conclusion that the

partner fixed effects are non-zero and explain a large fraction of the R 2 . The inclusion of

these variables does reduce the p-value on the F-test that the firm fixed effects are all zero.

  The AKM results control for year fixed effects, however, one might argue that much of the

large exit values generated in the asset class were driven by those in the late 1990s. If we

exclude all financings in 1997-1999, the results in Table V are quantitatively similar. The p-

value on the F-test for VC firm fixed effects is smaller (9%), however, the partner fixed effects

are still jointly significant and explain much of the variation in exit valuation.
26                                                                                    MAY 2013


     The estimation of Table V produces fixed effect estimates relative to a benchmark within

each group in the “connected” sample. Therefore, we cannot compare estimated FE be-

tween these groups without the normalization procedure of Cornelissen (2008). We address

this concern by re-estimating the full model with the largest “connected group” (86% of the

full sample). The result in Table V and is basically unchanged.


                                    A.   Endogenous mobility



     Panel B of Table VII shows that movers and stayers are similar across many dimensions,

while Panel C of Table VII demonstrates firms in the AKM sample are larger, more active VC

firms. If firms and partners in the AKM sample are also unobservably different, it could limit

our inference. We now discuss the impact of selection or omitted variables for VC firm and

partner fixed effect estimates.

     Recall that identification of the VC firm fixed effects comes from changes in mover per-

formance around the move as shown in equation (4). Suppose first that movers are simply

partners fired by their past firms. If such partners move to worse firms post-firing and this

affects their performance, then the estimation will find a large firm fixed effect. Now sup-

pose that movers are on average high quality partners seeking better prospects at relatively

better firms. Again, if these partners move to better firms and it affects their performance,

the estimation will attribute this to a larger average firm fixed effect. These two scenarios

seem the most economically plausible and show that non-random movement does not nec-

essarily lead to any bias in the estimated firm fixed effects.

     However, it is likely that movers who choose to move (those not asked to leave) do so

in anticipation of improvements to performance. If partners most likely to be helped by a

move are those that make a costly move, then the firm fixed effect may be overestimated
                                     SUM OF VC PARTNERS?                                      27


relative to the true effect on the average partner. Alternatively, movers are a set of partners

that are relatively unaffected by their location. Here, the estimate of firm effects are biased

downwards. We cannot rule out either concern so one must be cautious in interpreting our

results. However, we can examine different subsamples to provide support for the generality

of the main result.

  In Table VIII columns 1 and 2 we divide partners into two groups – those that moved to

a firm with an historically worse IPO rate than their current firm and those that moved to a

firm with a relatively better historical IPO rate (where the historical rate is calculated as of

the date of the move). These two groups are moving for very different reasons. Those that

move to a worse firm are presumably those that are, on average, asked to leave, while those

that move to a better firm should be those choosing to seek a better opportunity. In Table

VIII column 1 we see that the partner is about 6 times as important as the firm in the group

that moved to a worse firm. In Table VIII column 2 we see that the partner is only 2.5 times

as important as the firm. If the group of partners that moved to higher performing firms

chose to do so, then it is likely that they anticipated positive benefits to their own perfor-

mance. This sample, therefore, may have too large an estimate of the true firm effect on the

average partner. Alternatively, the firm effect is simply larger among higher quality firms.

The relatively lower explanatory power of the partner in this sample suggests endogeneity

is effecting our results but is not substantially biasing our overall conclusions.

  Perhaps firms in the connected sample are connected because partners only move be-

tween very similar firms. First note that 86% of the sample is in our largest connected group,

this would mean that the majority of firms have a relatively similar impact on the partner –

which is what our findings suggest. Second, the average absolute difference in performance

in all moves between existing firms is 18.5% (standard deviation of 14%). This means that
28                                                                                                                   MAY 2013


partners on average are moving to firms with very different IPO rates given that the aver-

age IPO rate is 12.8% . To address concerns about the characteristics of firms involved in

moves, Table VIII columns 3 and 4 divides partners into two groups. Column 4 uses only

movers that moved to firms with very similar historical IPO rates (below median absolute

difference), while Column 3 considers those that moved to a firm with a historical IPO rate

very different to their own firm’s historical rate (better or worse). We find very similar re-

sults among partners that move to different firms but the estimate of the firm effect is even

smaller among partners that move to more similar firms (as would be expected). Thus, some

of the finding that the firm is relatively unimportant comes from partners moving between

similar firms.23


     Movers can also exit their firms because of the characteristics of their partners. The spec-

ification in equation (1) ignores any externalities between VC partners. For example, all

partners may benefit from working with top partners (i.e. both improve) and movers will

want to exploit this by working with them. Any positive externalities would increase the

partner’s performance post-move, which the estimator would attribute to the VC firm fixed

effect because performance would differ between positions at VC firms. In the online ap-

pendix, we analyze the similarity of the fixed effects among partners at the same firm and

do find significant matching in partner quality. However, as Table V makes clear, most spec-

ifications find a limited VC firm fixed effect. Thus, while the AKM methodology cannot sep-

arate partner externalities from the pure firm effects, our findings suggest that on average

both externalities and other firm characteristics are less important than individual partner

characteristics.


  23 Even though the partners are moving to firms that are observably very different it is possible that partners move to firms

that are in actuality unobservably quite similar. In which case the limited effect of the firm could stem from this similarity.

  Similar arguments also demonstrate that mean-reversion in VC partner performance may

bias the estimated VC firm fixed effect to be non-zero. If partners who are lucky and leave to

go to a better firm, they will subsequently mean-revert. This change in performance across

the move will be attributed to a firm fixed effect. Alternatively, if partners who are unlucky

get fired and go to a new firm, they will also mean-revert. This change would again be at-

tributed to the firm. Both effects would lead to an over estimate the importance of the VC

firm, however we find a statistically small average VC firm fixed effects. Mean reversion,

however, could combine with other effects to dampen the estimated firm effect. If, for ex-

ample, partners get lucky and move to a better firm and they are helped by the new firm but

simultaneously mean revert then the mean reversions will bias down the effect of the firm.

  Our findings suggest that on average firms have relatively limited impact on partner per-

formance, but this is a relative statement. That is, all firms could be quite important but

have a similar impact and the fixed effect estimation would find a small relative importance

and an insignificant joint p-value. This conclusion would only relate to connected firms as

firms in different connect samples cannot be compared. However, the largest connected

sample in the AKM specification is 86% of the sample. Thus, economically what we have

found is that on average VC firms seem to be relatively similar to each other.

  In general, many endogeneity issues should artificially attribute too large an effect to the

VC firm. Since our main finding is that the average firm has relatively little impact on per-

formance, these endogeneity concerns tend to reinforce this finding. Alternatively, the en-

dogeneity in movement has biased our results to produce to low a firm effect. Although we

find a similar effect in many subsamples, if the 30% of partners who move are those whose

performance is unaffected by their location then we have underestimated the effect of a

move on those partners who stay.

                                        VI.   Conclusion



     The venture capital partner can explain a large fraction of the cross-sectional variation

in investment outcomes. The partner’s performance is persistent over time, even after con-

trolling for a large set of individual and VC firm controls. Venture capital partners, it seems,

also have a style of exit. Overall our work provides strong support for the idea the venture

partners have investing skill as well as new insights into the allocation of performance to

the firm or partner.

     The new fact that VC firm attributes are relatively less important than partner attributes

provides insight into another unexplained aspect of venture capital. The optimal venture

capital firm size seems to be a few hundred million in assets under management. Few ven-

ture capital firms are larger and many top firms cap the amount of money they will accept

below total demand. Typical explanations suggest that partner time is the limiting resource

but this does not explain why firms don’t simply increase the number of partners. Why are

there not a few huge venture capital firms with hundreds of partners instead of many firms

with a few partners? Other human capital intensive organizations such as investment banks

or law firms become quite large. Furthermore, why don’t we see mergers or acquisitions be-

tween venture capital firms? Zingales and Rajan (1998) argue that without a critical firm

asset there is nothing to hold a firm together or make it larger than just what is needed to

overcome Coasian frictions. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the organiza-

tional capital inside a venture capital firm is limited, in turn limiting firm size. Given this,

it appears that brand, process, deal flow, etc. are not critical firm level characteristics, but

rather they are partner attributes.

     Our work may also benefit limited partners (LPs) who are concerned about investing in
                                                  SUM OF VC PARTNERS?                                        31


the new fund of a venture partner or group of venture partners who have left a VC firm to

start another VC firm.24 Many LPs express reservation because the venture partners may

have left the “secret sauce” behind. This decision requires LPs to disentangle individual

partner impacts on performance from the possibility that the performance was due to the

firm organizational capital the partners left behind. Our results suggest that venture part-

ners will be relatively unaffected by movement and in turn, individual venture partner past

performance is a good predictor of future performance.

  Overall, the results suggest that venture capital partners are often significantly different

from each other, but high quality firms are those with a group of better partners. What then

is a VC firm? We suspect that the benefits of joining together may relate to fundraising. This

would be an interesting avenue for future research.

Notes: Table reports the characteristics of the sample of partners in most analyses below. The
unit of observation is the VC partner matched to an entrepreneurial investment through a board
seat. Column “Two” summarizes the partners at their second investment, “Three” at their third
investment and so on. “Other” pools all the excluded investment numbers and “Total” is the full
sample. “IPO” is a dummy for an IPO exit, “% IPO t-1” is the fraction of IPOs in the partner’s
history as of that investment and “Successful Acq.” is a dummy for an acquisition exit that has a
reported exit value greater than two times capital invested (“Fail” is for failures). “Log exit value”
is the log of one plus the exit value (in millions) for a given investment, “% VC IPO (-i)” is the
fraction of IPOs for all partners not including the one of interest at the VC firm. “Years experi-
ence” is the number of years experience as of the board seat, “# VC firm investments” is the total
number of board seat investments made by the partners VC firm. “Round #” is the round num-
ber of the board seat investment and “Dollars invested (log)” is the investment amount. “Years
since previous board” tracks the number of years between the current and last board seat, while
“CA” and “MA” identify the state of the entrepreneurial firm. “IT” is the fraction of investments
in information technology and “Biotech” is the fraction of biotech investments.

           Notes: Dependent variable is 1 for columns if the investment that the VC had a board seat at time t on exited via IPO by the end of the
MAY 2013




           sample. All specifications are probit. Each column only includes one observation per partner, who each were only observed at one VC firm
           so that all control variables are defined. “% IPO t − 1” is the VC partner’s IPO success rate as of the investment at t . “Partner experience yrs.
           (log)” is log of the years since the partner took the first board seat as of t . “VC total deals (log)” is the log of the total board seats taken by the
           VC firm of the partner as of t . “Dollars invested (log)” is the capital invested in the financing when the board seat was taken. “Years since
           previous board” is the time between the t − 1 and t investment. “Year FE” are fixed effects for the year of the investment at the date of the
           dependent variable t . “Industry FE” are dummies for “Information Technology,” “Healthcare,” “Consumer/Retail” and “Other” defined by
           the entrepreneurial firm invested in at time t . “Round # FE” are fixed effects for the round number of the partner’s investment (all truncated
           for numbers greater than 7). “% VC IPO (-i)” is the IPO success rate for the VC firm excluding those investments and outcomes associated
           with the VC partner. Standard errors are clustered at the investment year. Significance: ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

                            TABLE III—PARTNER PERFORMANCE PERSISTENCE BY EXIT TYPES

    Notes: Probit regressions (OLS for columns 3 and 6) of three different dependent variables with
    the same specification as Table II. Each column only includes one observation per partner who
    were observed at only one VC firm. ACQ–t is 1 if the partner’s t ’th board seat investment resulted
    in a successful acquisition (i.e. sold for at least twice capital invested) and “Fail” is 1 if it resulted
    in an failure or the firm had yet to exit by the end of the sample. “Exit value t ” is the log of the exit
    value at sale of the entrepreneurial firm (0 if failure or missing). “% Acq. t − 1” is the fraction of
    the partner’s investments prior to t that has a successful acquisition. “Fail rate t − 1” is the same,
    but the fraction that failed. “Avg. Exit value t − 1” is the log of one plus average exit values prior
    to this investment. “Partner experience yrs. (log)” is the log of the years of partner experience
    as a board member. See Table II for the remaining control variable definitions. Standard errors
    are clustered at the investment year. Note that observation counts differ slightly from Table II
    because of observations dropped due to multicollinearity. Significance: ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗
    p < 0.01.

                Notes: Fixed effects regression where the unit is the VC firm in five-year investment windows (i.e. VC cohort). Estimation uses the condi-
                tional logit specification for the limited dependent variable IPO–t which is equal to one if the entrepreneurial firm the VC partner sat on the
MAY 2013




                board at t went public. ACQ–t is equal to 1 if the investment was a successful acquisition. Fail–t is equal to 1 if the investment failed. The
                conditional logit requires some variation in the dependent variable for each partner, which is why the samples sizes differ across specifica-
                tions. “Exit value” is the log of one plus the exit valuation (0 if failure). The model in columns 7 and 8 are simple fixed effects estimators. The
                VC firm cohort must have at least 3 active partners to be included. “% IPO t − 1” is the VC partner’s IPO success rate as of the investment
                at t . “% Acq. t − 1” is the fraction of the partner’s investments prior to t that has a successful acquisition. “Fail rate t − 1” is the same, but
                the fraction that failed. “Avg. Exit value t − 1” is the log of one plus average exit values prior to this investment. “Year FE” and “Industry FE”
                are investment year and industry of the entrepreneurial firm invested in at time t . “Round # FE” are financing round number fixed effects.
                “Additional controls” include dollars invested and years since previous board seat as defined in Table II. Standard errors are clustered at the
                investment year. Significance: ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

                               TABLE V—PARTNER AND VC FIRM FIXED EFFECTS

Notes: Three-way fixed effects regressions using the method detailed in Abowd, Creecy and Kra-
marz (2002) and Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999) to estimate both the VC firm and VC part-
ner fixed effects. Estimation implemented using the Stata code “felsdvreg” as described in Cor-
nelissen (2008). The unit of observation is the VC partner, board seat and entrepreneurial firm
outcome. Column 1 uses log of one plus the exit valuation as the dependent variable (0 if failed
or missing), column 2 uses the dummy variable “IPO” and column 3 uses a successful acquisition
(≥ 2 times capital invested) dummy variable. Column 4 uses the dummy variable defined to be 1
if the investment failed. Firms without an IPO or successful acquisition have a 0 as the dependent
variable in columns 2 - 3. The rows for “F-test on FE” report the p-value from the null that the
estimated VC partner or VC firm fixed effects are jointly zero. cov (Y,Pa   r t ne r F E)

for the partner FE (similarly for the last row and VC FE). The percentages in parentheses report
the fraction of the R 2 that are attributable to the firm and partner FEs (see Graham, Li and Qiu
(2012) for details). “Round # (log)” is the log of the financing sequence number, “Dollars invested
(log)” is the log of the total dollars invested in the financing round when the board seat is taken
and “VC experience yrs. (log)” is the log of the total board seats made by the VC firm as of the
current investment. “Partner experience yrs. (log)” is the log of the total boards seats taken by the
VC partner as of the investment. “Fund sequence (log)” is the log of the fund sequence, set to the
five-year windows since VC founding. “Year FE” are year fixed effects for the investment year of
the board seat. “Industry FE” are dummies for the investment industry. “Mean dep. variable” re-
ports the mean of the dependent variable. “# VC firms” is the total VC firms in the sample. Robust
standard errors clustered at the VC firm are reported in parentheses. Significance: ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗

                                 TABLE VI—PARTNER AND VC FIRM FIXED EFFECTS: SUB-SAMPLES

            Notes: Three-way fixed effects regressions using the method detailed in Abowd, Creecy and Kra-
            marz (2002) and Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999) to estimate both the VC firm and VC part-
            ner fixed effects. Estimation implemented using the Stata code “felsdvreg” as described in Cor-
            nelissen (2008). The unit of observation is the VC partner, board seat and entrepreneurial firm
            outcome. All regressions use the log of exit valuation as in Table V column 1. “Top VCs” considers
            only the set of VCs in the top 10% of total investment experience who are also connected by at
            least on VC partner mover. “≤ 6 inv.” includes only movers and stayers for the first 6 of their
            investments over their whole career (i.e. when the partners are young). “Ind. FE” runs the full
            AKM specification with industry fixed effects. “Bio.” includes only partners that made healthcare
            investments. “Subset stayers” is the result of a set of random samples of partners and firms such
            that the total number of partners equals the number of firms. The AKM regression was run 1000
            times over the random samples. We report the median p-values and average proportion of R 2 .
            Coefficient estimates are excluded, but mimic those of column (1) of Table V. Robust standard
            errors are clustered at the VC firm reported in parentheses. Significance: ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05,
            ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

 Notes: Characteristics of firms that movers left and moved to. A mover is a VC partner that switched VC firms during the sample period.
 Each panel considers a different set of observations. In Panel A, observations are entrepreneurial firm and VC investor with board seat,
 where the former received its first capital prior to 2006. Numbers reported are the mean across each sub-sample. “Moved To” are the
 sample of firms that only ever had a mover move to that firm. “Moved From” are the firms that only ever had a mover leave the firm.
 Column 3 reports the differences in means and their significance between the two samples. Panel B reports the characteristics of partners
 who move and stay in the full fixed effect regressions. Numbers reported are the mean across each sub-sample. “Mover” are the partners
 that moved at least once. “Stayer” are the partners that are in the “connected” sample (i.e. worked at a firm with a mover). Column 3 reports
 the difference in means and their significance. Panel C reports the characteristics of VC firms in and out of the full fixed effect regressions
 in Table V. Numbers reported are the mean across each sub-sample. “Non-AKM Sample” are the VC firms that had a partner with at least
 four board seats, but lacked a mover to/from the firm. “AKM Sample” are those firms in Table V. The third column reports the differences
 and statistical significance. “Exit valuation” is the total dollars the entrepreneurial firm sold for at exit (0 if failure or still private by end of
 sample). “% IPO” is the fraction of the VC’s investments with board seats that had an IPO. “$ invested” is the average investment amount
 when the VC took the board seat. “Round #” is the average round number when the VC took the board seat. and “Year first inv.” is the first
 year the VC is observed taking the board seat. “Information Technology” is the fraction of board seats on companies in the IT industry.
 “Total investments” is the total number of boards seats taken by the VC firm. “Diff/s.e.” reports the difference, the standard error and the
 significance from the two-side t-test. Significance: ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

                         TABLE VIII—PARTNER AND VC FIRM FIXED EFFECTS: DIFFERENT MOVERS

     Notes: Three-way fixed effects regressions using the method detailed in Abowd, Creecy and Kra-
     marz (2002) and Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999) to estimate both the VC firm and VC part-
     ner fixed effects. Estimation implemented using the Stata code “felsdvreg” as described in Cor-
     nelissen (2008). The unit of observation is the VC partner, board seat and entrepreneurial firm
     outcome. All regressions use the log of exit valuation. “Similar” starts with movers who moved to
     a firm that was in the lower 50% of the difference in new vs. previous firm performance. “Differ-
     ent” starts with the movers who moved to a firm that was in the top 50% of the difference in new
     vs. previous firm performance. The connected group is constructed after restricting to this set of
     movers. “Moved down” includes movers whose new firm’s IPO rate was higher than their previ-
     ous firm’s IPO rate as of the move. “Moved up” is the same, but when the new firm has the same
     or better historical performance. If a mover moves to a new firm or forms a new firm, the firm
     and mover is excluded from these regressions. All other variables as defined in Table V Robust
     standard errors clustered at the VC firm are reported in parentheses. Significance: ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗
     p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.
