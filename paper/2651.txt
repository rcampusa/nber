                      SEARCH AND EFFICIENCYWAGE MODELS


                                   ABSTRACT


     This paper shows that market economies with search and in which wages

are affected by efficiency wage considerations   are not constrained Pareto

efficient.   Wages are not set at Pareto efficient levels, nor is the level

of employment (unemployment) Pareto efficient.   We identify the nature of the

biases and the welfare improving government interventions.

        Serious    macro-economists             have        long     been     faced     with    a

dilemma:         how    can    one    reconcile         the        seeming    inefficiencies

associated with the periodic episodes of unemployment and under

utilization of         capital with those             rational, competitive forces

which,     in   our traditional micro-economic paradigm, at                           least,   we

argue    ruthlessly seek out profitable opportunities, eliminating
waste    and weed out incompetent producers. In their quest for a

resolution to this dilemma,                economists have identified a number

of ways in which our economy differs from the idealization of the

Arrow-Debreu model,            ways    which can            explain the       existence and

persistence of unemployment, among the most important of which
are      the    presence      of      search        costs     and     the     dependence       of

productivity on wages           (the efficiency wage hypothesis.)                       Once we

                the     importance         of   these,         then     the    existence       of
recognize

unemployment          need    not     be    evidence          of     market    inefficiency:

economic efficiency requires the movement of labor from one job

to another,          as disturbances change             the marginal productivity of

workers in different industries;                     search takes time and resources;
even     if     it     were     always       feasible           always           to     move        labor

instantaneously from            its   low    productivity use, with no interim
period of unemployment,            it may--for some individuals,                         under      some

circumstances--be inefficient to devote the resources to search

required for such transitions;                   it may be more efficient to spend

a period unemployed.             Indeed,     the very words we use to describe

the resulting unemployment rate, "the natural rate"                                   suggests that
there is nothing particular perverse,                         or inefficient,            about      this

unemployment.

       By      the     same    token,       if       productivity           is        increased       by

increasing wages,            it is quite plausible that efficiency entails

wages at above market clearing levels.
       More      broadly,       the     approach              taken    by        modern        macro-
economists,          in which the terms of              the contracts between workers

and employers cakes            into account not only                 the absence of income

insurance       for     workers,      but        also     search/mobility costs                      and

efficiency wage considerations,                  seems to preclude the possibility

that     any     resulting      unemployment             is     inefficient:               for       the

contracts are designed to be "locally efficient,"                                      that    is,     to

maximize the firms' profits, given the reservetion utility levels

of workers.

       the     lime     of    reasoming      that        we     have    presented              in     the

preceding paragraph, as               persuasive as             it    may    seem,       is     simply
wrong.        the fundamental question in which we are interested is,


                                                 2
is a decentralized market               economy--characterized by aearch costa,

efficiency wages,         incomplete insurance markets, by                                a   variety of
other      informational imperfections,                   or     by    other deviations from

the     standard    specification of                  the        competitive model                 which

seemingly       enhance         its     realism--is              such       an    economy         Pareto

efficient?        In judging the efficiency of                             the   resulting market

allocations,      we need to take explicitly into account the coats of

search or       information acquisition;                    of    the       factors which make

productivity dependent on wages; of the absence of                                    a   complete set
of    insurance    markets.            We    ask,     are      there        feasible government

interventions,      which respect to these aspects                               of    actual market

economies,      which can make everyone better off.                               (We do not ask,.

is    it     reasonable to          assume      that        governments               which     actually
intervene      do so in such a way as to effect                        a   pareto improvement?)
In      deference       to      common         usage,          when         there         exist    such

interventions,       we      say      chat     the    economy is             constrained pareto

inefficient;       in adopting this             language,         we       emphasize that we do
not believe that the considerations                       under examination here,                   such

as information costs,              are any less "real" than production costs.



        We   show here         that     (for    rather         different reasons)                 market

economies with search and efficiency wages are, in general,                                          not

constrained Pareto efficient.                        In   earlier           work (Greenwald and

Stiglitz,      1986),     we    proved a general theorem establishing that
markets with imperfect information                        and         incomplete markets were
constrained Pareto inefficient.                       An explicit assumption of                     that
analysis,    however,     was     that markets        cleared,   whereas    here we are
concerned        with    situations where             markets    may    not.        Though
efficiency may indeed entail            the presence of some unemployment,

with     wages     set    above    market        clearing    levels,       there        is    a

presumption that neither the level of unemployment or wages is
Pareto efficient.2



                             Efficiency Wage Models


        The basic hypothesis of         the efficiency wage model                  is    that
workers'     productivity          depends       on    the   wage      paid;     here        we

generalize the standard formulation by allowing productivity (per
hour)    to depend also on the number of hours worked.                     Assume that
there are L identical workers, we assume.                    The ith firm's output

is simply a function of its effective labor supply,           L1h1r1(v1,h1)
where    v1 is the wage         its workers receive (which may differ from

the wage the       firm pays,      w1, because of taxes)            and            is the
                                                                            h1
number of hours each of its L1 workers works:

     2 Other   studies   have called attention to the Pareto
inefficiency   of   implicit contract equilibria (Newbery and
stiglitz, 1987), of search equilibria ((Hosios (1984), Mortenson
(1982), Pissarides (1984), Arnott and Stiglitz (1985), Stiglitz
(1985)), and of implicit contracts which are explicitly designed
to take into account the search which they induce (Arnott,
Hosios,  Stiglitz, 1980).    The objective of this paper is to
formulate a more general model than those previously employed,
which can embrace both efficiency wage and search considerations;
this general formulation is, in fact, a simple extension of our
general approach to the analysis of the efficiency of economies
with incomplete markets and imperfect information (Greenwald and
Stiglitz, 1986).  This general approach has the-further advantage
of being able to identify potential pareto improving government
interventions.

firm's      output.3                (Because wages are set by the firm, they do not

appear explicitly in the profit function.)
          The       fact       that      wages       may        exceed       market clearing levels              in

and        p         We     decompose the total effects                          of    the    tax    into    four

elements

(i)        A       direct    effect           in raising consumer prices and government

revenue.             These    are simply                transfer           effects--when the government

compensates the                individual for                        the    increased prices,          the    two

effects (for small taxes) cancel.

(ii)           A    general       equilibrium effect on prices;                              an    increase in

prices raises profits,                         and lowers consumers'                  utility;       again this
is a       transfer effect,                     and     so long as            the goods'      market clears

these       effects cancel                    (recalling that every firm must be owned by

(iii)      An    indirect effect              on       the    profit maximizing level            of

employment;       by       the   envelope theorem,              the    effect on profits is
zero, but the effect on consumers--since there is job rationing--

is positive; the dollar value of this is equal to the difference

between the compensation,                net of wages received, required for the

unemployed to be at the seme level of utility as the employed.
Because private firma ignore this term, market
                                                   equilibrium
entails too little employment.

(iv)      An    indirect effect             on     the       wage level.        Again,   by     the

envelope theorem, the effect on profits is zero, but the effect
on consumers is positive (if wages increase).                                Thus,   there is     a

presumption that market wages are too low, even though they are
set at above market clearing levels.

       Notice that this formulation not only establishes that there
are welfare enhancing government interventions,                              but also tells us
precisely what kinds of interventions are desirable:                                 those that
increase- employment and wages.                         Thus,    a    small ad valorem wage
subsidy,       which,       at    least      in        the    simplest versions          of   the

efficiency wage model,               will leave consumer wages unchanged, will
increase        employment           and     hence           increase    welfare.         Assume
productivity          is    positively effected by                    food consumption and

negatively affected by alcohol consumption,                             in    such a way that
the    firm    responds to           a     food    subsidy and          an    alcohol tax       by

                                                   8
increasing employment,               but    leaving        wsges unchsnged or                increased;
in   these       circumstances       a food     subsidy          and an alcohol tax may be

desirable.



                                              Search


        It has       long    been recognized that                 search          can give rise to

unemployment,            particularly if            (at       least    for        some    individuals)

off-the-job search is                more     efficient           that        on-the-job search.
Although some search unemployment will then clearly characterize
market equilibrium,               it is again by no means clear that the level

of   unemployment will be              Pareto           efficient.           We    show    that   it    is

not, using a framework similar to that employed in our diacussion

of   efficiency wages.                     Again,         there       will        be     employed      and

unemployed workera,            now depending upon which workers successfully

obtain jobs.             Firms'    deciaions concerning hiring, lay-offs, and
search       and     workers'        decisions            concerning          quits        and    search
intensities         all     generate "search"              externalities,                affecting the
likelihood of a firm finding a well-matched worker and a worker

finding      a   well-matched job.
        To see      the parallel with           the earlier             section as clearly as

possible, we focus on a special case where all individuals and
firms    are       (cx    ante)    identical,           and    where,    in        equilibrium,        all

firms pay the same wage.               The probability of a match is                          I(x,y)
where    x       is the vector of workers'                 search intensities (here, for

simplicity,         assumed to be dollars spent on search),                                and    y     is

just equal to                 N'   ,    whera            N    is the number of potential workers.

                               we partition the vector                                x —
For simplitity,                                                                              (xj;x*)             where          x*

is the search intensity of all other workers.                                                     Firm       i     chooses

wages and hiring intensities                                 to maximize expected profits (taking

into account the effect of those decisions on the likelihood of a

match);        and       its maximized value of profits can be represented by

lr*i(p;    r    ,    p    ;   z)        ,       where        z1     is a description of the relevant

market environment,                     here, the wages and hiring intensities                                        of all

other firms              and the search                  intensities              of all individuals                  (which

are,      of        course,            endogenous).                     As       before      we        can   write             the

expenditure              function of those who are successful in obtaining                                                       a

job    and those who                    are not              by     gie           and       gju    ,    respectively,
noting now            the dependence on the market environment,                                              zj           which

now    includes the search intensities                                           of   others       as    well         as       all

firms'      hiring            intensities                    and    wage         levels.          These          variables

together        determine the individual's                               expenditures on search.
       An identical argument to that employed before shows that if

the    government can                           impose       taxes       which raises                  revenue,           after

compensating individuals,                                then       the          market equilibrium is                         not

constrained                   pareto                efficient.                    Again,          straightforward

activities.

      There are two additional terms besides those discussed in
the   previous section,                arising from               the    "external" effects on
profits:     An increase in hiring intensity by one firm reduces the

likelihood of a match by another                           firm and hence has a negative

effect on       their        profits.           (These          are,    however, total           general
ecp.iilibrium      derivatives,             and        the       indirect      effect       of     these
perturbations on              workers'       search             intensity,     and    of     that      on

profits, needs to be taken into account.)
      The market failure we have identified here tan be

"missing markets" interpretation.                               Suppose there is        a    notional
employment agency that pays                  q,        for search intensity             x        and
                                                                                                       qy
for hiring intensity               y    ,   and in turn receives payments of                           q
for matches.       The expected number of matches is a function of the

vector     (xj,yi}      .     Then the employment agency maximizes

q0E $j     (x,y)    -          x   -
                                       qy   y     .        LI     looks    like the production
function of        the       employment agency.                        Since   this   formulation
eliminates      the     externality,             the       solution to         this     problem in

conjunction with          the           maximization problems of households and

firms yields         the Pareto          optimal    set of outcomes.               Looking at the

resulting equilibrium prices                       paid    to       the    notional employment

agency,     we       obtain    the        optimal       taxes        and     subsidies        that       a

government would have to impose on search related activities in
the   absence of such an agency.                          And    the      degree     to    which the

pseudo-production function                   E      exhibits decressing,                  increasing,

or    constant returns             to    scale     determines whether these payments

will leave a net surplus                 or deficit.5

        A Gemeralizatiom.                It is easy to generalize the results of

this model,      for instance to implicit contract models, where firma

sign contracts with workers to maximize their                                      profits,       for    a

given     (reservation)        expected utility of workers.                          The     contract
will specify         firms' retention (lay-off) hiring and wage decisions

as a function of the state of nature;                           expanding the         "z"    variable

to include these as well as the equilibrium search intensities                                          of

others,     x*   ,    state    contingent profit                 and      expenditure functions

subsidizing new employees)                  or discourages         lay-offs     has positive

externalities on workers,                   since    at    any    fixed     level of search

intensities on the part of worker,                    the likelihood that they find

a   (better)         match    is    increased,       but       negative externalities on
other firms          (because      of the reduced likelihood of a match)                    .     We


conjecture,          but have      not proved,       that normally the first effect

dominates the second:               there is too little hiring.

        Notice       that firms, in setting           their lay-off rates,           take into

account the effect of changes in the lay-off rate on the expected

utility of its own workers,                  but not the external effect of the

search efforts           of     its    workers on          the    likelihood of         others'

obtaining employment.
        Such   a     tax may have       a    second set of effects,             on the wages

offered by       a   different firms; if firms change their wages for new

hires,    in response to the                changed search intensity,               there       is a

second order effect on profits, which can be ignored, but a first
order effect on workers' expected utility.



                                      Comcludimg Remarks
        Im our earlier work, we showed that market equilibrium with

competitive firms, in contexts im which all markets clear, but in
which there was imperfect imformation or incomplete markets would

not, in general,             be Pareto efficient.


                                                13
       Here     we    have     extended        those       results        to     incorporate
equilibria in which            firms    are    wage      setters     rather than wage

takers,      where they set their wage to take into account efficiency

wage    considerations         (including the             effect     on        the   cost    of.


recruiting workers and on labor turnover), and where they may set
the wage at a level where markets                  do not clear.          We believe that

this provides a more           accurate     characterization of labor                 markets
than    is    provided by      the     standard perfect information,                   market

clearing model.
       It    should be     clear     that     similar      results      obtain in other
contexts--in labor, product, and capital markets--in which wages,

prices,      and interest rates        affect      market behavior,            for   instance

by conveying information.              Through efficiency may indeed entail
unemployment, credit rationing,                    or    prices exceeding marginal
costs of production,          there    is no presumption that              the extent of

rationing,      and the level of wages,             prices,    and interest          rates   in

the market equilibrium are efficient.                     The precise nature of the

distortions      depends     on the exact specification of the model:                        in

the efficiency wage          model,    there       was   too   little     employment,        as

firms        failed   to     take    into      account      the    potentially          large
discrepancy      in utility of the employed and the unemployed.
