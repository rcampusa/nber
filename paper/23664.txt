                                         ABSTRACT

We analyze older individuals’ debt and financial vulnerability using data from the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Financial Capability Study (NFCS). Specifically, in the
HRS we examine three different cohorts (individuals age 56–61) in 1992, 2004, and 2010 to
evaluate cross-cohort changes in debt over time. We also use two waves of the NFCS (2012 and
2015) to gain additional insights into debt management and older individuals’ capacity to shield
themselves against shocks. We show that recent cohorts have taken on more debt and face more
financial insecurity, mostly due to having purchased more expensive homes with smaller down
payments.

           Debt and Financial Vulnerability on the Verge of Retirement

        The United States has witnessed a steady rise in access to financial credit and

opportunities to borrow over time, yet many individuals lack the financial know-how to manage

the complex new financial products increasingly available in the financial marketplace.1 As a

consequence, it is key to learn more about how people borrow and manage debt in the modern

economy.2 In particular, older persons today appear more likely to enter retirement in debt than

in past decades. Importantly, the greater indebtedness of people on the verge of retirement has

several macroeconomic implications. For example, higher debt levels make households more

sensitive to increases in interest rates. Moreover, retirees may need to devote a rising proportion

of their incomes to servicing their debt. This paper evaluates the factors associated with older

American’s debt patterns and debt management practices to trace how these patterns have

changed over time and to evaluate whether these practices leave people particularly vulnerable in

old age.

        To this end, we examine older individuals’ debt patterns using the Health and Retirement

Study (HRS) and the National Financial Capability Study (NFCS). With the HRS, we compare

three different cohorts of people on the verge of retirement (age 56–61) as well as people slightly

older (age 62–66). We study the determinants of debt and how debt across the cohorts has

evolved. We also discuss the potential consequences of our findings regarding indebtedness on

the verge of retirement.3 With the 2012 and 2015 NFCS, we explore rich new information on

debt and debt management among the same age groups (56–61 and 62–66), highlighting many

signs of financial distress among individuals who should be close to the peak of their wealth

accumulation profiles. The NFCS data also enable us to examine the determinants of financial

fragility and over-indebtedness of individuals on the cusp of retirement.

          Our focus on debt is important for several reasons. First, debt typically grows at interest

rates higher than those which can be earned on investments. For this reason, debt management is

critical for those seeking to manage their retirement assets conservatively. Second, over time,

families have gained easier access to home mortgages and home equity lines of credit, compared

to the past.4 They have also been required to make smaller down payments when they take out

mortgages than in years gone by. In tandem, as sub-prime mortgages proliferated, credit became

increasingly accessible to consumers with low credit scores, little income, and few assets.

Consumer credit via credit card borrowing has also become more accessible, and this type of

unsecured borrowing has risen over time. Third, alternative financial services including payday

loans, pawn shops, auto title loans, tax refund loans, and rent-to-own shops, have proliferated in

many states (Lusardi and de Bassa Scheresberg, 2013). Fourth, it is important to identify

financially fragile families, which can be sensitive to shocks in retirement. Finally, the 2008-

2010 financial and economic crisis was largely driven by borrowing behavior, so understanding

debt could help us avoid a repeat of past errors.



Prior Literature

          The massive debt run-up by American households has been noted in a number of

previous studies. Total household debt rose quickly before the financial crisis, doubling between

    Lower interest rates reduced the effective cost of accessing home equity (Hurst and Stafford, 2004).
                                                                                                     3



2000 and 2008, and peaking at $12.68 trillion in the third quarter of 2008 (Federal Reserve Bank

of New York, 2016). Yet by the end of 2016, aggregate household debt was still $12.58 trillion,

just 0.8 percent below the all-time peak. And as of the fourth quarter of 2016, mortgage

originations (which include refinanced mortgages) were at their highest level seen since the

beginning of the Great Recession (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2017). Moreover,

Vornovytskyy, Gottschalck, and Smith (2011) showed that individuals age 55–64 and 65+

experienced the largest relative increases in household debt (using Census Bureau data).

Specifically, people age 55–64 saw a 64 percent increase in median household debt between

2000 and 2011, and median household debt more than doubled among those age 65+.

       Given these findings, several policy analysts have expressed concern that debt has risen

to worrisome levels in America.5 The media has also taken notice with articles exhorting people

to pay down their debt as they near retirement (e.g., Derousseau, 2016). Several authors have

documented the types of debt held at later stages in the life cycle, including Bucks et al. (2009)

who showed that more than half (55%) of the American population age 55–64 carried home

mortgages, and about the same fraction (50%) had credit card debt. Among those age 65–74,

two-thirds held some form of debt; almost half had mortgages or other loans on their primary

residences; over one-third held credit card debt; and one-quarter had installment loans.

       Others have noted that managing debt and other financial matters is problematic for many

older adults. For instance, Agarwal et al. (2009) reported an inverse U-shaped age pattern of

financial decision-making quality in 10 financial areas mostly related to debt. For instance, they

noted that fees and interest paid tend to be lowest for those in their early 50’s and rise thereafter;

moreover, older individuals pay some of the highest costs for financial services. Furthermore, it

has been suggested that debt drives decisions about retirement and the age at which workers start

claiming Social Security benefits (Butrica and Karamcheva, 2013).

       Of late, there has also been an increase in the proportion of older Americans filing for

bankruptcy. Pottow (2012) argued that the age 65+ demographic has been the fastest-growing in

terms of bankruptcy filings, which stood at 2% in 1991 but rose by more than three times by

2007. Credit card interest and fees were the most-cited reason for bankruptcy filings, with two-

thirds of those filing providing these reasons. People age 55+ held widespread credit card debt

and paid more in late payments and for exceeding their credit limits, despite the fact that they

should have been at the peak of their wealth accumulation profiles (Lusardi, 2011; Lusardi and

Tufano, 2009, 2015). Several studies have also found a link between debt management and

financial literacy. Specifically, the least financially literate reported incurring high fees and using

high-cost borrowing regularly, and they also indicate that their debt loads were excessive and

they often could not judge their debt positions (Lusardi and Tufano, 2015). This group was also

more likely to borrow from their 401(k) and pension accounts (Lu et al., 2017; Utkus and Young,

2011), and they used high-cost methods of borrowing such as payday loans (Lusardi and de

Bassa Scheresberg, 2013).

       Some recent studies have sought to understand the reasons for this rapid increase in debt

among American adults. One commonly-cited culprit is the rapid rise in housing prices during

the 2000’s, paired with the growth of easier mortgages (Christelis, Ehrmann, and Georgarakos,

2015; Dynan and Kohn, 2007; Mian and Sufi, 2011). Another often-cited explanation is that

technological change in the lending market induced risk-based pricing, reduced distribution

costs, and contributed to other innovations that made it easier for households to borrow (Dynan,

2009; Edelberg, 2006). Meanwhile, a separate strand of research has argued that improvements
                                                                                                    5



in the technology of persuasion through nonlinear contracts and uninformative sales tactics have

“shrouded” customers’ understanding of financial contracts and, in turn, boosted total amounts

borrowed and/or the costs of borrowing (Gabaix and Laibson, 2006; Agarwal and Evanoff, 2013;

Bertrand et al., 2010; Gine, Martinez Cuellar, and Mazer, 2014; Gurun, Matvos, and Seru, 2016).

Yet another strand of literature has cited the impact of income inequality as an explanation for

the rapid rise in debt (Kumhof, Ranciere, and Winant, 2015).

       That literature does offer useful insights regarding the overall rise in debt, but far less

work has been done evaluating older Americans’ debt patterns. Moreover, the few extant studies

do not look at the determinants of indebtedness close to retirement. For this reason, in what

follows, we contribute to the literature with new empirical analyses of debt and debt

management among older Americans.



Evidence from the HRS

       The HRS is a panel dataset nationally representative of the US population with both

longitudinal/panel and cross-cohort features. Using the rich information derived from the HRS,

we have assembled asset and debt information for three cohorts of people on the verge of

retirement: those age 56–61 in the HRS baseline group, those age 56–61 in the War Babies

group, and those age 56–61 in the Early Boomers group. Subsequently, we examine the slightly

older group (those age 62–66).6 For each respondent we have comparable data on assets and

  The HRS baseline cohort was born 1931–1941; the War Babies group was born 1942–1947; and the
Early Boomer group was born 1948–1953. The 56–61 age group was surveyed in 1992 for the baseline
HRS cohort, in 2004 for the War Babies, and in 2010 for the Early Boomers. The 62–66 age group was
surveyed in 1998 for the baseline HRS cohort, in 2008 for the War Babies, and in 2014 for the Early
Boomers. We also note that the survey included different numbers of respondents per cohort, since the
1992 HRS survey was substantially larger than the subsequent groups. Results reported below use
weighted data and all dollar values are expressed in 2015 dollars.

debt. The difference in time periods and age groups allows us to examine how the financial crisis

affected the amount of debt that individuals held as they neared and entered retirement.

Cross-Sectional Results

        Table 1 describes the evolution of total debt across the three cohorts of respondents age

56–61.7 Total debt is measured in the HRS as the value of mortgages and other loans on the

household’s primary residence, other mortgages, and other debt (including credit card debt,

medical debt, etc.). The percentage of people age 56–61 arriving at the verge of retirement with

debt rose from 64% in the HRS baseline group to 71% among Early Boomers. Additionally, the

value of debt held rose sharply over time. While the median amount of debt in the baseline group

was about $6,800, it more than quadrupled among War Babies and almost quintupled among

Early Boomers (respectively $31,200 and $32,700, all in 2015 dollars). We also see that the debt

distribution appears to have changed across cohorts. The top quartile of the debt distribution held

around $51,000 in debt in the baseline group (75th percentile), while in the two cohorts surveyed

more recently, this same quartile of the population held more than double ($106,000) and almost

triple ($146,800) that amount. Additionally, the top 10 percent of the debt distribution (90th

percentile) reported debt of over $272,000, more than double what had been seen for respondents

in this same age range 18 years earlier. Depending on the interest rate charged on this debt, these

families would be very likely to face sizeable monthly debt repayments and to carry debt well

into retirement. As debt levels increase, borrowers’ ability to repay becomes progressively more

sensitive to drops in income as well as increases in interest rates. For a given shock, the higher

the debt, the higher the probability of defaulting (Cecchetti, Mohanty, and Zampolli, 2011).

7
  The analysis attributes household assets and debt to each age-eligible individual in the HRS sample.
This, in effect, implies that all household assets and liabilities influence married and single respondents
when they make economic decisions. An alternative approach might seek to allocate assets and liabilities
between members of a couple, but this is difficult if not impossible, and it would not affect the debt ratios
examined below.
                                                                                                  7



Moreover, Mayer (forthcoming) shows that most households entering retirement age with a

mortgage do not fully pay the debt in retirement. In fact, only about 25 to 35 percent of older

homeowners with a mortgage in 1992 had paid off their mortgage by the year prior to death.

Table 1 here

       One factor driving this rise in debt across time is the greater value of people’s primary

residence mortgages for the cohorts surveyed more recently. In the second panel of Table 1, we

see that the percentage of people age 56–61 having mortgage debt has risen by eight percentage

points, from 41% in the baseline group to 49% among Early Boomers. Moreover, mortgage debt

amounts grew as well. For instance, looking at the third quartile (75th percentile) of the mortgage

debt distribution in the whole sample (not conditional on having a mortgage), we see that

mortgage debt more than tripled among Early Boomers compared to the baseline group. The

third panel shows that over the same period, the percentage of respondents with loans on their

primary residence grew from 11% to 17%, an increase of 50%. Here too, people’s mortgage

values rose. The mean value of other mortgages (e.g., on secondary residences) also increased, as

can be seen from the fourth panel, though relatively few (4–6%) held this form of debt. The data

show that the growth of housing debt in the boom prior to the Great Recession remains on the

balance sheets of many older households today.

       The fifth panel of Table 1 indicates that other debt for persons on the verge of retirement

also rose across cohorts, from 37% for the HRS baseline group, to 42% for the Early Boomers.

The debt distributions also became more skewed over time. For instance, those in the 90th decile

of the distribution of other debt held about $8,000 in debt in the reference group, while those in

the same decile held over $17,000 and almost $22,000 in the War Baby and Early Boomer

cohorts, respectively. Because this category includes non-collateralized debt, which comes with
                                                                                                       8



high interest rates, our findings imply that older Americans are increasingly likely to face high

monthly payments to service their debt.8 In the course of the recent global financial crisis, central

banks have lowered nominal interest rates to record levels (Schmidt 2013).                Our concern

regarding these indebtedness trends is that older households’ debt and financial situation will

deteriorate as short-term interest rates start to increase.

        Additional insight into older adults’ financial situations is provided by the ratios of debt

to assets shown in Table 2. Here the total assets measure includes all checking and savings

accounts, CDs, money market funds, T-bills, bonds/bond funds, stocks/stock market funds,

IRAs, 401(k)s and Keoghs, the value of primary residence and other real estate, vehicles,

business equity, and other savings.9 We also consider the ratio of housing debt (including home

mortgages and other home loans) to the value of the house and the ratio of other debt to the value

of liquid assets, in which the latter are defined as the sum of checking and savings accounts,

CDs, money market funds, T-bills, bonds/ bond funds, and stocks/stock market funds. These

ratios allow us to evaluate older adults’ leverage ratios and to assess how much of their home

loans they have paid off already. This, in turn, allows us to examine whether or not people will

enter retirement having to make monthly mortgage payments.

Table 2 here

        Comparing Table 2 with Table 1, we see that it is not just the value of debt that has

increased over time, but the proportion of debt to assets as well. Thus, Americans age 56–61

today are much more leveraged than were their counterparts in the past. For example, the first

panel of Table 2 shows that the median value of total debt over total assets was rather small for

8
  For example, it takes a monthly payment of $547 to pay off a debt of $21,000 with an associated annual
percentage rate (APR) of 20% in five years. Similar findings are reported by Butrica and Karamcheca
(2013).
9
  We use the measure of wealth provided in the RAND HRS, with wealth values winsorized at the top and
bottom 1%.
                                                                                                   9



the HRS baseline cohort, i.e., only about 4%, but this ratio rose to 11% and 15% in the War Baby

and Early Boomer cohorts.10 Moreover, a sizable fraction of Early Boomers had ratios over 50%

and some held debt worth as much as 90% of total assets. Debt is not necessarily a problem if

homeowners have more assets to pay back the debt. However, as Mayer (forthcoming) also

shows when considering the evolution of mortgage debt versus financial assets, not only has debt

increased as a share of home values among the elderly, but it also increased relative to financial

assets.

          One of the reasons for the observed increase in leverage is that people nearing retirement

accumulated more debt on their homes over time. The second panel of Table 2 shows that many

Early Boomers nearing retirement (age 56–61) were far more leveraged than War Baby and HRS

baseline cohorts: at the median, the ratio of primary mortgage to home value rose from 5% to

30%, and the top ten percent of the group went from 63% to 92%. This means that Early

Boomers on the verge of retirement will need to continue servicing their mortgages well into

retirement.

          Of course mortgage debt rose in part because more recently surveyed cohorts purchased

more expensive homes than their predecessors. For instance, the median HRS baseline

respondent in his or her late fifties had a home worth about $144,000, and by 2004, the median

War Baby household of the same age owned a home worth $187,000 in constant dollars (fourth

panel of Table 2). Home values for the median Early Boomer were even higher, at $218,000 in

2010, even with the collapse of the housing market in the Great Recession, which sliced home

values by half in some states. The trend toward buying more expensive homes also meant that

the percentage of total assets accounted for by the home was larger for cohorts surveyed more



10
     Ratios are defined only for those who have a strictly positive value of total assets.
                                                                                                   10



recently. Thus at the median of the debt ratio distribution, the baseline cohort held about 46% of

their total assets in their primary residence, but for the Early Boomers the percentage was 50%

(third panel of Table 2). In our previous work, we documented the great importance of housing

in Baby Boomers’ wealth holdings (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007).

       The fifth panel of Table 2 indicates that non-mortgage debt also rose as a percentage of

liquid asset values, and for some people, it rose a great deal (we note that Table 2 reports these

ratios conditional on the respondent having strictly positive liquid assets). A much higher

proportion of Early Boomer households held such debt worth the same as, or more, than their

liquid assets, and at the mean the ratios rose by ten times. Again, this implies that older people

must increasingly borrow or sell off other (less) liquid assets to pay off this non-collateralized

debt. It is also interesting that a large fraction of respondents had liquid assets even while

carrying debt. Since debt is likely to incur higher interest rates than bank accounts pay out, some

families may be overlooking opportunities to better manage their balance sheets.

       An additional diagnostic of changes in indebtedness over time is available from an

analysis of the ratio of total debt to total income. This proportion provides another indicator of

the ability to repay debt. In line with the above, the sixth panel of Table 2 indicates that the debt

to income ratio also rose across cohorts, with the median ratio growing from 14% to 45% and

50% across the three cohorts. This trend is confirmed by other studies (e.g., Dynan and Kohn,

2007), even though some decline in the median debt to income ratio was observed in the

aftermath of the financial crisis. Bricker et al. (2014) found that in 2013, the median debt-to-

income ratio for debtors went down from the level seen in 2010, to close to that witnessed in

2004. In our data, we can see that the ratio slightly increased for the cohort surveyed in 2010

compared to the War Baby cohort (surveyed in 2004), notwithstanding the deleveraging after the
                                                                                                    11



Great Recession. This increase in debt to income ratios makes households more vulnerable to

shocks and to increases in interest rates. Movements in market rates alter the terms of new

borrowing as well as the burden imposed by previous borrowing. When debts are large relative

to incomes, this effect is accentuated so that a given change in interest rates has a larger effect on

debt service and thus on the funds available for consumption (Dynan and Kohn, 2007). The

increased indebtedness makes the household sector more exposed to interest rate risk,

particularly where variable rate mortgages are prevalent, and American households have

increased their take-up of variable rate mortgages or hybrid mortgages (Debelle, 2004).

Furthermore, the easing of liquidity constraints and the increased indebtedness imply that

household consumption, and hence the economy, are likely to be more sensitive to changes in

household expectations about the future path of interest rates.

       Next we turn to several financial vulnerability indicators that offer an assessment of how

individuals fare as they near retirement.11 Adults close to retirement would be anticipated to be at

or near the peak of their wealth accumulation process, and one important decision after

retirement is how to decumulate wealth. As noted above, however, recent cohorts will also need

to manage and pay off their rising debt burdens in retirement. This is made more difficult by the

fact that older persons often move some of their assets to fixed income assets. In addition, if

equity returns are lower in the future than they were in the past (as many predict), it will be

important for current older cohorts to manage assets and liabilities wisely and pay off some of

their higher-interest debt first. Accordingly, it appears that cohorts entering retirement will need

to ensure that their income and asset drawdowns suffice not only to cover their target

consumption streams, but also to service their mortgage and other debt during retirement. This is
11
   The present analysis excludes pension and Social Security wealth. While these are important
components of total wealth, many of the individuals in the cohorts we are examining still have defined
benefit plans which often prohibit taking a lump sum.
                                                                                                   12



made increasingly complex by older workers’ lack of flexibility in adjusting mortgage payments

apart from selling their homes, moving to smaller homes, or engaging in reverse mortgages,

which many older cohorts in the past seemed unwilling to do, at least until late in the life cycle

(Venti and Wise, 1990, 1991; Hurd, 1990).

          Table 3 underscores the conclusion that the prevalence of financial vulnerability has risen

over time. Fewer than 10% of the HRS baseline respondents approached retirement with debt to

asset ratios above 0.5, but over one-fifth (22%) of Early Boomers did so, as shown in the first

panel.12 Moreover, this pattern was already observed prior to the financial crisis, since the ratio

of debt to assets was already higher among War Babies (15%) compared to the baseline group.

As noted earlier, part of this increase in debt can be attributed to the rise in home mortgages,

which led to younger cohorts nearing retirement with far higher ratios of mortgage debt to home

values. In particular, this explains why the collapse of the housing market starting in 2007

exacerbated the role of mortgages and other loans in driving near-retirement debt.

Table 3 here

          The second panel of Table 3 shows that only about 16% of the HRS baseline group (age

56–61) had loan/value ratios on their primary residences greater than 0.5, compared to 26% of

the War Babies and almost 35% of the Early Boomers. The third panel confirms that non-

mortgage debt to asset ratios also rose rapidly over time. Accordingly, Early Boomers will likely

need to dedicate some of their liquid wealth to pay off debt in retirement, and hence this cohort is

more exposed to the negative consequences of interest rate increases than their counterparts who

were surveyed earlier.




12
     These values refer only to those with strictly positive assets.
                                                                                                 13



       The last panel in Table 3 focuses on measured changes in the prevalence of very low

wealth, defined here as having less than $25,000 in savings. We focus on this cutoff as it is about

half of median household income, and it is not very high relative to a health shock or some other

costly surprise. Our results show that 15–16% had such low net worth in the HRS baseline and in

the War Baby cohort, while 24% of the Early Boomer cohort had low wealth. Accordingly, it

seems clear that over time, savings have shrunk and debt has ballooned for Americans on the

verge of retirement.

Debt Patterns in Perspective

       Our analysis so far shows that in recent years, cohorts of people age 56–61 have taken on

substantially more debt and are more financially vulnerable than their predecessor cohorts,

mostly because they purchased more expensive homes with smaller down payments. A closer

look at debt burdens of older persons is provided by a tandem analysis of respondents 62–66

years old for the HRS baseline, the War Babies, and the Early Boomers.13 This additional

analysis helps us interpret the increase in debt observed in the 56–61 age group and understand

to what extent changes in debt patterns affect retirement security.

       The evolution across cohorts of debt and debt ratios for people age 62–66 is described in

the right panels of Tables 1 to 3. In line with the younger group, the indebtedness of older

individuals also rose over time. For example, Table 1 shows that the percentage of people age

62–66 with debt rose from 52% in the HRS baseline to 64% among Early Boomers; and the

median debt increased from $580 in the HRS baseline to $8,800 (fifteen times) among War

Babies and $12,000 (twenty-one times) among Early Boomers.



13
   As explained before, the HRS baseline cohort was born 1931–1941; the War Babies group 1942–1947;
and the Early Boomer group 1948–1953. In this section we focus on those age 62–66, surveyed in 1998
for the baseline HRS cohort, in 2008 for the War Babies, and in 2014 for the Early Boomers.
                                                                                                  14



       In addition to confirming the dramatic increase in debt across cohorts, Table 1 also shows

that older people generally hold less debt than younger people. For instance, in the HRS baseline

cohort, 64% of those age 56–61 were debt holders, and the percentage was lower (52%) among

those age 62–66. This difference persists in the later cohorts, with 71% of Early Boomers age

56–61 having debt versus 64% of Early Boomers age 62–66. Moreover, older debt holders also

had less debt: Among Early Boomers, the median total debt of the older group was only about

one-third of the median debt of people age 56–61 ($12,000 compared to $32,700). The

diminished financial stability in retirement due to greater amounts of debt is likely to continue as

younger cohorts are nearing retirement age with more debt than previous cohorts. The fact that

indebtedness decreases as people age most likely means that debt continues to be repaid in old

age. It may also indicate that older people today were more conservative about taking on debt

near retirement than today’s younger generation is.

       The ratios of debt to assets reported in Table 2 also show that the proportion of debt

increased across cohorts for those age 62–66. For instance, the median ratio of primary mortgage

to home value rose from 0% in the HRS baseline to 13% among Early Boomers. However,

leverage ratios declined with age. Median debt to income ratios, which indicate potential

problems repaying debt, were twice as large among persons age 56–61 compared to those age

62–66 in the Early Boomer cohort. We interpret the evidence that people in their 50’s will need

to manage a great deal of debt at older ages as having unfortunate implications for retirement

security. The higher debt to income ratio means that people on the verge of retirement will be

more exposed to shocks and will remain exposed for a longer period of time than in the past

(Debelle, 2004). Consistent with the results discussed above, individuals in the older group (62–
                                                                                                  15



66) are less financially vulnerable, even though their vulnerability indicators such as high debt to

asset ratios and low wealth rose over time (Table 3).

Multivariate Regression Analysis

       To further examine the factors associated with financial vulnerability among older

Americans, Table 4 summarizes results from a multivariate regression analysis on the four

outcomes just discussed, for the 56–61 and 62–66 age groups. That is, the multivariate analysis

shows which factors are associated with having (a) a total debt/asset ratio >0.5, (b) a ratio of

primary residence loans to home value >0.5; (c) other debt/liquid asset ratio >0.5; and (d) total

net worth <$25,000.

Table 4 here

        Confirming our earlier tabular results, all of the cohort indicators are statistically

significant and positive for all four dependent variables. This implies that both the War Babies

and Early Boomers at age 56–61 and 62–66 were more likely to be in debt and be financially

vulnerable relative to the HRS baseline reference group. In other words, our directional

conclusions from Tables 1–3 are supported even after including controls for potential cross-

cohort differences in socio-demographic factors (these models also control for age, marital

status, gender, number of children ever born, race, educational attainment, income, and whether

they reported being in poor health). Moreover, results show that for all three debt-to-asset

measures, the Early Boomers held significantly more debt and were significantly more

financially vulnerable compared to the War Babies.

       We mention in passing that some of the socio-demographic controls included in Table 4

are significantly associated with respondent financial vulnerability. For instance, being

unmarried, nonwhite, less educated, and having lower income rendered respondents much more
                                                                                                 16



likely to be financially vulnerable. Additional factors significantly associated with greater

vulnerability include having had more children and being in poor health. Interestingly, being in

poor health is a stronger predictor of financial vulnerability for people age 62–66 compared to

those age 56–61.

          For the 56–61 age group, we also performed a multivariate regression analysis on the

same four outcomes for those married/living with a partner at the time of the survey, and for the

non-married subset only.14 As in Table 4, both single and partnered Early Boomers age 56–61

were significantly more vulnerable than their counterparts in the baseline HRS cohort.

Additionally, we found interesting associations with specific correlates. For instance, poor health

was a strong predictor of high debt ratios for the full sample (in particular, non-mortgage debt

ratios) and low wealth holdings close to retirement, perhaps because of medical debt. When we

split the sample by marital status, we find that this association is quantitatively more important

for singles than for couples. Similarly, singles did better when they had higher income compared

to those with partners. The role of education is also worth highlighting: compared to high school

dropouts, singles with a college degree were markedly wealthier and less likely to have much

debt.



Evidence from the NFCS

          We turn next to an analysis of the 2012 and 2015 NFCS surveys. These data nicely

complement the HRS analysis in two ways. First they provide more recent information, and

second, they include a unique and rich set of questions about debt and debt management.15 The

2012 wave can readily be aligned with the 2010 wave of HRS respondents to show that the two

14
     The results are available upon request.

     For information on the NFCS, see Lusardi (2011).
                                                                                                        17



data sources yield similar conclusions.16 The 2015 NFCS provides very current information and

includes additional questions about debt and indicators of retirement preparedness.17

        We examine respondents in the same age groups as those studied in the HRS data from

both the 2012 and 2015 waves of the NFCS. We do so to focus on the most recent cohort of

individuals on the verge of retirement, as above, but several years after the collapse of the

housing market and the financial crisis.

        The first two columns of Table 5 provide several indicators of both debt distress and

financial vulnerability, focusing first on people age 56–61. Once again, we see that mortgages

and other debt were problematic for many near-retirees. In 2012, about 17% of homeowners (8%

of respondents) reported being underwater, owing more on their homes than they thought they

could sell them for. Outcomes improved by 2015, but 9% of homeowners were still underwater.

Moreover, 16% of near-retirees had been late with mortgage payments at least once in 2012 (the

percentage improved in 2015), and about 3% had faced a home foreclosure in 2012.18

Table 5 here

        As far as non-mortgage debt is concerned, many near-retirees in both waves reported that

they did not pay off credit card balances in full (if they had them); more than half of credit card

holders carried credit card debt in 2012, a percentage that slightly decreased to 46% in 2015.


16
   Nevertheless, this survey does not report information about debt levels.
17
   Even though the age group does not align, as age was not a continuous variable in the 2009 NFCS, the
data from the 2009 NFCS wave align well with data from the HRS. For example, comparing respondents
who were 57–62 years old in 2009 with the 2008 HRS cohort (the cohort closer to the NFCS data in terms
of time) confirms that statistics are rather similar between surveys. For example, similar to the 2008 HRS
cohort, more than half of NFCS respondents who own their home get close to retirement carrying a
mortgage. The NFCS data also show that down payments have been decreasing over time; those who
recently bought homes had put down only 5 or 10 percent. Moreover, the 2009 NFCS shows that many
older respondents pay the minimum only on their credit cards and that a sizeable proportion have made
use of high-cost methods of borrowing, such as payday loans, pawn shops, etc. For more information, see
Lusardi and Mitchell (2013).
18
   This information is not available in the 2015 NFCS.
                                                                                                  18



About one-third of credit card holders engaged in costly borrowing behaviors such as paying

only the minimum due or using the card for cash advances. They were also charged fees for late

payment or exceeding the limits. Twenty-three percent of people age 56–61 had unpaid medical

bills in 2012, a percentage that fell by 2015, yet 20% still had unpaid medical bills. We report

these statistics, as delaying payments is a form of credit. Additionally, some borrowers used very

high-cost methods such as rent-to-own stores, pawn shops, payday loans, and auto title loans.

Nearly one-fifth of the 56–61 age group reported having engaged in these methods of borrowing.

Turning to other indicators, 6–7% of those who had retirement accounts borrowed on them, and

5–6% took a hardship withdrawal. These findings indicate that many older Americans are

exposed to illiquidity and face problems in debt management as they approach retirement.

          In the last two rows of Table 5, we examine two indicators of financial vulnerability that

illustrate near-retirees’ perception of their financial situation. While the NFCS does not report

respondent assets and debt values, the survey did ask respondents to evaluate their debt and also

their capacity to deal with shocks. Specifically, the following question was asked to evaluate

people’s perceptions of their debt position:

          How strongly do you agree or disagree with the following statement: “I have too
          much debt right now.” Please give your answer from a scale from 1 to 7, where
          1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree and 4=neither agree nor disagree. Possible
          answers: 1–7; don’t know; prefer not to say.

A second measure of households’ financial position probes how people judge their ability to deal

with a financial shock. This is our measure of household’s financial fragility.19 The wording of

the question is as follows:

          How confident are you that you could come up with $2,000 if an unexpected
          need arose within the next month?


19
     This approach was piloted by Lusardi, Schneider, and Tufano (2011).
                                                                                                         19



        Possible answers: I am certain I could come up with the full $2,000, I could
        probably come up with $2,000, I could probably not come up with $2,000, I am
        certain I could not come up with $2,000, don’t know, prefer not to say.

The $2,000 amount was selected to represent a medium-sized shock such as a car or house repair

or an out-of-pocket medical bill. This question is particularly informative because in other

research we have found that it is related to having precautionary savings and to households’

borrowing capacity and debt situation.

        There is evidence in the literature that households may borrow imprudently and

accumulate too much debt (Hyytinen and Putkuri, forthcoming). Indeed, when asked to evaluate

their debt, about 40% of people age 56–61 indicated they had too much debt in 2012,20 and the

percentage decreased just slightly in 2015, to 36%. As shown in Figure 1, the proportion of

individuals saying they had too much debt is hump-shaped with age, yet it remains quite high

among the group nearing retirement. Accordingly, continuing to manage and pay down debt will

surely be required for many people during retirement.

Figure 1 here

        Furthermore, 33–35% of respondents age 56–61 stated they (probably or certainly) could

not come up with $2,000 in a month’s time. Despite the fact that one might expect this age group

to be at the peak of its wealth accumulation, many respondents felt they had little or no ability to

shield themselves against financial shocks. The age profile in Figure 1 shows that fragility

declines initially with age, but it increases in mid-life—perhaps because of child-related

expenses—and it declines again later in life. As for debt, however, financial fragility is still high

close to retirement.




20
   They answered 5, 6, or 7 to the question: “How strongly do you agree or disagree with the following
statement: ‘I have too much debt right now.’”
                                                                                                  20



       Table 6 reports additional information useful in gauging retirement readiness as well as

debt and financial vulnerability. Just 41–44% of respondents age 56–61 were saving, and it is

worrisome that fewer than half had ever tried to figure out how much to save for retirement. This

is indicative of problems to come, as in our previous work we showed that planners are much

more likely to have retirement wealth; moreover, those who plan arrive at retirement with much

higher wealth than do non-planners (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007, 2009, 2011b,c, 2014). It is thus

not surprising that so many of these respondents age 56–61 (57%) were worried about running

out of money in retirement, as indicated by responses to a new question added to the NFCS in

2015. Accordingly, the Employee Benefit Research Institute data point out that borrowers who

have debt or lack a retirement plan are much less confident in their ability to have enough money

to fund retirement (Helman, Copeland, and Derhei, 2015).

Table 6 here

       The evidence so far clearly shows that many Americans continue to be burdened by debt

and to be financially vulnerable at older ages. To dig more deeply into debt and debt concerns of

persons closer to retirement, we compare again our sample of people age 56–61 to persons 62–66

years old. Consistent with the HRS analysis, we again find that the older age group was doing

better. The last two columns of Table 5 show that the older group was less likely to report

expensive behaviors such as carrying credit card debt, incurring credit card fees, and using high-

cost borrowing methods. Compared to younger respondents, the older age group reported lower

levels of financial vulnerability, yet still over one-quarter (26%) stated they had too much debt in

2015, and more than one in five (23%) were financially fragile. While people’s financial

situation does seem to improve with age, the older group is still financially distressed. Close to
                                                                                                21



half (47%) of those age 62–66 worried about running out of money in retirement and just over

half (55%) had planned for it.

Multivariate Regression Analysis

       Tables 7 and 8 explore the NFCS dataset in more detail using a multivariate analysis of

debt and financial fragility indicators. As noted above, respondents were asked if they thought

they had too much debt (the indicator goes from 1 to 7 for the question), and we use this variable

as a proxy of problems with debt (in place of the ratios we developed for the HRS). We also use

an indicator equal to 1 for those who said they could not (probably or certainly) come up with

$2,000 in an emergency within a month. We explore variation in these indicators using the same

socio-demographic controls used with the HRS regressions (age, marital status, number of

financially dependent children, gender, race and ethnicity, education, and income). In addition,

we are able to include an indicator for whether respondents said they experienced a large and

unexpected drop in income in the previous year. The NFCS, unlike the HRS, also included a

very valuable set of questions on financial literacy, permitting us to assess respondents’ basic

financial literacy.21 We can therefore include a financial literacy index (constructed as the

number of correct answers to the five financial literacy questions). As these variables are

measured similarly in both waves, we pool the surveys together and use a year dummy to test for

differences across time.

Tables 7 and 8 here

       Regressions on self-assessed debt appear in Table 7 for the 56–61 and 62–66 age groups,

where we see that results are consistent across the two age groups. The evidence shows that older

and higher income persons were less likely to report being in debt, while having had more


21
   The NFCS includes five questions assessing respondent numeracy, knowledge of inflation, risk
diversification, mortgages, and basic asset pricing concepts (Lusardi, 2011).
                                                                                                      22



children and being African-American were associated with reporting excessive debt. Those who

had experienced a large and unexpected income drop in the previous year also agreed they were

over-indebted, suggesting that shocks play a role in debt accumulation close to retirement.

Finally, financial literacy is negatively related to reports of excessive debt. We conclude that

shocks do predict debt accumulation among older Americans, but having resources is not

enough. People also need the capacity to manage those resources if they are to stay out of debt as

they head into retirement.22

       In Table 8 we explore the factors associated with respondents’ stated ability to come up

with $2,000 within a month (the HRS reports whether respondents have less than $25,000 in

savings, which is roughly the monthly value of $2,000 multiplied by 12). As with the HRS, the

NFCS results show that men and those with higher income are more likely to have such liquidity.

Also consistent with HRS results, gender plays a role just for the younger group. Minorities like

African-Americans and Hispanics were more likely to say they could not come up with $2,000

within 30 days. Table 8 also shows that the number of dependent children is positively associated

with financial fragility for people age 56–61 but not for the older group, suggesting some

potential for a “catch-up” after children leave home. Additionally, having experienced an income

shock made respondents more likely to report being financially fragile. Overall, people who

reported experiencing income shocks were 14–15 percentage points more likely to be fragile.

Education also plays an important role here: those with high school or more education were

substantially less likely to be financially vulnerable. Yet education is only a part of the story:

Table 8 shows that financial literacy is also a key factor. Being able to answer one additional

financial literacy question correctly was associated with a lower probability (by 3–4 percentage
22
   One could argue that financial literacy is a choice variable and one cannot simply perform OLS
regressions. While our analysis here aims to be only descriptive, in other papers we have shown that the
OLS estimates understate the true effect of financial literacy.

points) of being financially fragile. In other words, financial literacy has an independent effect on

reducing financial frailty, above and beyond the impact of education.




Conclusions and Policy Relevance

       Prior to the recent financial crisis and Great Recession, consumer credit and mortgage

borrowing expanded rapidly, leaving relatively unsophisticated consumers in the historically

unusual position of being able to decide how much they could afford to borrow. It is important to

learn whether and how indebtedness and financial vulnerability of cohorts on the verge of

retirement changed in the wake of the economic crisis, and understand likely future

consequences. Debt among older persons may increasingly be a factor in elder bankruptcy, and

even in determining lifetime wealth sufficiency and retirement security.

       Our paper has analyzed older persons’ debt and debt management practices using data

from both the HRS and the NFCS. Specifically, we examined three different cohorts of older

individuals in the HRS. This analysis provided insights into cross-cohort changes in debt

indicators over time. We also explored two recent waves of the NFCS, 2012 and 2015, which

showed how older persons manage their debt on the verge of retirement and their capacity to

shield themselves against shocks.

       Our goal was to assess how and why wealth and debt indicators among older persons has

evolved over time, and the potential consequences of this evolution for retirement security and

the whole economy. We find that the cohorts surveyed more recently have taken on substantially

more debt and face more financial insecurity as they near retirement, mostly due to having

purchased more expensive homes with smaller down payments. Regardless of whether older
                                                                                                24



persons are over-indebted, the larger stock of household debt has important macroeconomic

implications. In fact, people on the verge of retirement will be more sensitive to fluctuations in

interest rates—particularly if they are unexpected—and the current low interest rate environment

is likely to change. Comparing the 56–61 and 62–66 age groups, we show that indebtedness

decreased as people aged. Factors reducing exposure to debt include having higher income, more

education, and greater financial literacy. Factors associated with greater financial vulnerability

include having had more children, being in poor health, and experiencing unexpected large

income declines. Thus, shocks do play a role in the accumulation of debt close to retirement, but

having resources is insufficiently protective. That is, people also need the capacity to manage

those resources if they are to stay out of debt as they head into retirement. This finding

complements our recent analysis which found that financial literacy can explain 30–40% of

wealth inequality (Lusardi, Michaud, and Mitchell, 2017).

        It is interesting that most theoretical models of household portfolios to date have tended

to focus on household portfolio patterns without devoting much attention to debt patterns (e.g.,

Lusardi, Michaud, and Mitchell, 2017; Delavande, Rohwedder, and Willis, 2008; Chai et al.,

2011). Our research suggests that analysts and policymakers should explore ways to enhance

debt management practices as they examine factors driving retirement security. The fact that

interest rates charged on debt are usually much higher than rates that people can earn on their

savings is generally not taken into account. Moreover, existing models have tended to overlook

the fact that interest rates charged to individuals are not fixed but can be shaped by people’s

behavior. Our paper thus motivates additional research on key aspects of debt and debt

management to inform future policy.

Note: The sample includes all age-eligible individuals 56–61 and 62–66 in the 2012 and 2015 NFCS;
estimates weighted using sample weights. The dependent variable is the response to the following
question: “How strongly do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ‘I have too much debt
right now.’” Values range from 1 to 7, where 1 means “I strongly disagree” and 7 means “I strongly
agree.” Mean value of the dependent variable Self-assessed Debt is 3.78 for the 56–61 age group and 3.18
for the 62–66 age group. FinLit index is constructed as the number of correct answers to the five financial
literacy questions. Including FinLit index among the regressors does not change much the estimate and
significance of the other variables. Robust standard errors in parentheses. ** p<0.01, * p<0.05

Note: The sample includes all age-eligible individuals 56–61 and 62–66 in the 2012 and 2015 NFCS;
estimates weighted using sample weights. The dependent variable is a dummy variable response to the
following question: “How confident are you that you could come up with $2,000 if an unexpected need
arose within the next month?” Outcome coded as 1 for those who certain or probably could not come up
with $2,000 and 0 for those who certain or probably could come up with $2,000. Mean value of the
dependent variable Financial Fragility is 0.35 for the 56–61 age group and 0.24 for the 62–66 age group.
FinLit index is constructed as the number of correct answers to the five financial literacy questions.
Including FinLit index among the regressors does not change much the estimate and significance of the
other variables. Robust standard errors in parentheses. ** p<0.01, * p<0.05

Note: The sample includes all age-eligible individuals 56–61 in the 2012 and 2015 NFCS; statistics
weighted using sample weights. People are classified as having “too much debt” if, on a scale from 1 to 7,
they answered 5, 6, or 7 to the question: “How strongly do you agree or disagree with the following
statement: ‘I have too much debt right now,’” where 1 means “I strongly disagree” and 7 means “I
strongly agree.” People are classified as financially fragile if they reported that they certainly or probably
could not come up with $2,000, in response to the following question: “How confident are you that you
could come up with $2,000 if an unexpected need arose within the next month?”
