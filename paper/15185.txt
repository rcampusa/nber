Income Misattribution under Formula Apportionment

NBER Working Paper No. 15185

JEL No. F23,G34,H25,H87

                                              ABSTRACT

Alternatives to the current system of separate tax accounting, such as the proposed Common Consolidated
Corporate Tax Base in Europe, would apportion a firm’s worldwide profits using formulas based on
the location of employment, capital or sales. This paper offers a new method of evaluating the accuracy
of these apportionment rules and the ownership distortions they create. Evidence from European company
accounts indicates that apportionment formulas significantly misattribute income, since employment
and other factors on which they are based do a very poor job of explaining a firm’s profits. For example,
the magnitude of property, employment and sales explains less than 22 percent of the variation in profits
between firms, and the prediction estimates from using such a formula exceed half of predicted profits
64% of the time, and exceed twice predicted income 11% of the time. As a result, the use of formulas
rewards or punishes international mergers and divestitures by reallocating taxable income between
operations in jurisdictions with differing tax rates. The associated ownership distortion is minimized
by choosing factor weights to minimize weighted squared prediction errors, for which, based on the
European evidence, labor inputs should play little if any role in allocation formulas. But even a distortion-
minimizing formula creates large incentives for inefficient ownership reallocation due to the enormous
variation in profitability that is unexplained by formulary factors, implying that significant resource
allocation costs would accompany European adoption of formulary apportionment methods.

1.     Introduction

       Governments tax active business income earned within their borders, a practice that is
fraught with difficulty under any circumstances, and particularly so when a firm earns income in
more than one country. Since tax rates differ between countries, multinational firms usually
have incentives to arrange their affairs in ways that reallocate taxable income between countries.
An excessively transparent method of doing so would be to sell a paper clip from an affiliate in a
low-tax location to an affiliate in a high-tax location, charging a price of $1 million. This
transaction would create a tax deduction of $1 million in the high-tax buying country, and
taxable income of $1 million in the low-tax selling country, thereby reducing total global tax
obligations. Cognizant of these incentives, governments have adopted arm’s length pricing rules
dictating that for tax purposes the prices used for intercompany transactions must be the same as
those that would have been chosen by unrelated parties transacting at arm’s length. Clearly, the
arm’s length pricing standard takes care of the problem of $1 million paper clips, but there is
widespread concern that the difficulty of applying the arm’s length standard to many ordinary
cases, to say nothing of complex transactions involving sophisticated financial instruments or
intangible property such as patents and trademarks, leaves ample opportunity for tax avoidance.

       In reaction to fears about actual or potential tax avoidance under the arm’s length pricing
standard, there have been numerous calls for stiffer enforcement of the transfer pricing rules,
with some expressing doubt that it is possible to craft intercompany pricing rules that can ever
succeed. These advocates suggest abandoning altogether the current system of separately
accounting for income earned in distinct jurisdictions, replacing it with a system that uses simple
formulas to apportion the worldwide income of multinational firms among the jurisdictions in
which they have operations. These formulas typically use some combination of employment,
sales, and tangible property as implicit indicators of where firms actually earn their incomes.
American states currently use simple formulas to apportion the incomes of multistate businesses
within the United States, and, relying on that experience, some (e.g., Martens-Weiner, 2006)
suggest that formula apportionment might work well internationally.

       In order to adopt a system of formula apportionment it is necessary to specify the weights
attached to different factors used to apportion income, and the difficulty of doing so in a sensible



                                                                                                1
way makes vivid at least some of the costs associated with replacing separate accounting with a
system of formula apportionment. In the United States, where state governments use formulas to
apportion corporate income for tax purposes, states have failed to settle on a common formula. It
is far from clear what factors properly enter an apportionment formula – assuming that
governments could coordinate on a common formula – if the goal is to allocate income roughly
according to where it is earned. Furthermore, as noted by Gordon and Wilson (1986), the use of
formulas to apportion taxable income effectively converts an income tax into a multiple rate tax
on the use of the productive factors that enter the formula, with associated deadweight loss from
this haphazard diversity of tax rates. These problems have a common source, which is that
profits are not simple scalar functions of employment, sales or tangible property. Instead, profits
are produced by many factors, including managerial inputs, that are difficult to measure or
subject to reporting manipulation, and therefore omitted from the formulas that governments use.
Put simply, the formulas do not apportion income accurately among the jurisdictions in which it
is earned.

       There is something distasteful and very possibly inequitable about misattributing income
for tax purposes, but the associated problems do not stop there, as income misattribution creates
incentives for firms to structure their affairs in new ways. Since the formulas apply to affiliates
within consolidated groups, it follows that the use of allocation formulas creates incentives to
modify the ownership of companies or operations in order to reduce associated tax burdens.
Consider, for example, a profitable German company with income taxed by Germany at a high
rate. If European governments required companies for tax purposes to allocate their profits
among affiliates using formulas that rely heavily on the location of employment, then the
German company would have a strong incentive to acquire an unprofitable Irish company with a
large labor force. In joining the German and Irish operations under common ownership, many of
the German profits would be attributed to Ireland for tax purposes, where they would be subject
to the much lower Irish corporate tax rate. Conversely, if the Irish company had large profits and
the German company did not, then the use of formula apportionment might discourage a merger
of the two firms even if the merger would otherwise make sense for business reasons.

       Formula apportionment is typically defended as a pragmatic compromise, representing an
imperfect alternative to the current, arguably flawed, system of separate accounting. The



                                                                                              2
purpose of this paper is to analyze the nature and magnitude of ownership distortions created by
allocation formulas, the extent to which formulas misattribute income when firms merge or
divest their operations. Evidence can be obtained by considering the consequences of
hypothetical mergers between firms that are currently independent and therefore report their
incomes, employment, sales and property separately. Using data from a large sample of
European companies, it is clear that mergers among them, treating two firms for this purpose as
though located in different countries, would result in significant reallocations of taxable income,
even in the absence of any effect of the mergers on actual operations or profitability.

       The formulas used to attribute income between countries can be thought of as forecasts of
what fraction of total firm income is likely to have been earned by affiliates with given shares of
employment, sales, and property. The analysis in this paper formalizes this notion, identifying
conditions under which the formula that minimizes the efficiency cost of ownership distortions is
the same as the formula that minimizes the weighted sum of squared residuals in a regression
explaining total pretax income. This framework implies that regressions can be used to compare
formulas that assign different weights to employment, sales, and property, as well as to construct
alternative formulas.

       The evidence implies that existing formulas fare poorly from a prediction standpoint: the
absolute value of prediction errors from a formula based equally on employment, sales and
property exceeds predicted profits 64% of the time, and exceed twice predicted profits 11% of
the time. In unconstrained regressions employment seldom gets a significant coefficient. This is
hardly surprising given that employment expenditures are costs and therefore subtractions in
calculating pretax income, but employment nonetheless persists in playing significant roles in
most contemplated and actual allocation formulas. For example, the European Commission
(2004) notes that its Home State Taxation pilot scheme would allocate profits of
multijurisdictional firms based entirely on employment (either payroll or numbers of employees),
or else on an equal-weighted three-factor formula including payroll, sales and property. While
none of these schemes would succeed in accurately representing income, use of the employment
formulas would be particularly inaccurate. In view of the sizeable ownership and resource
allocation distortions introduced by any of these formulas in Europe, the relevant policy question
is whether the alternative is sufficiently bad to warrant such a step.



                                                                                             3
       Section 2 describes current systems of separate entity accounting, evidence of taxpayer
responses, and proposed formulary alternatives and their consequences. Section 3 analyzes the
distortions associated with misattribution of income, and presents a framework that can be used
to estimate the consequences of formulary alternatives. Section 4 describes the available data on
European companies, and section 5 presents the empirical estimates of the magnitudes of
prediction errors due to the use of formulas. Section 6 is the conclusion.

2.     Separate Accounting and Formulary Methods

       The current international practice of using separate accounting to determine taxable
income has come under considerable fire from critics who point to the difficulties of enforcing
the arm’s length pricing standard against the determined behavior of taxpayers. There is direct
and indirect evidence that firms currently arrange their affairs in ways that relocate taxable
income from high-tax countries to low-tax countries,1 which is likely to be inefficient. There are
several possible solutions to this problem, including stiffer enforcement together with minor
modifications of existing rules (Gresik and Osmundsen, 2008), though radical reform is always
an option. Whereas separate accounting is generally acknowledged to offer a theoretically
satisfying method of measuring income for tax purposes, concern over the practical ability of
governments to operate separate accounting underlies much of the appeal of alternative methods
of determining the location of business income.

       Formulary alternatives to separate accounting can take different forms, relying to
differing degrees on sales, property, and employment factors to apportion income among related
parties. In the equal-weighted three-factor formula once commonly used by American states, the
fraction of a firm’s national income taxed by an individual state equals the state’s share of the
firm’s sales, tangible property, and employee compensation, with each of these three factors
weighted equally. There is considerable recent interest in possible adoption of a form of
formulary apportionment within Europe, the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base
(Commission of the European Communities, 2001). Gordon and Wilson (1986) analyze some of
the distortions introduced by making tax obligations functions of sales, property, and
employment rather than the production of income: the tax system thereby discourages sales,




                                                                                                 4
investment, and employment. Given these distortions, it is perhaps not surprising that American
states have modified their apportionment formulas over time to emphasize the less distortionary
sales factors at the expense of property and employment,2 even though this evolution may or may
not be in the interest of states as a group. One of the open questions about formulary methods in
the international context is the extent to which the use of separate accounting by the rest of the
world increases or reduces the desirability of using formula apportionment within a small
federation of countries.3 The adoption of formulary methods would occasion significant
redistributions through changes in the tax obligations of individual firms (Shackelford and
Slemrod, 1998) and the tax revenues of individual countries (Devereux and Loretz, 2008; Fuest
et al., 2007). Formula apportionment does not require information on location-specific
profitability, though this feature may make it more difficult for governments to tailor their tax
systems to extract rents from taxpayers in the most efficient possible manner (Gresik, 2008).
Even the possible administrative cost and compliance benefits of formulary methods (Mintz,
2004) may be suspect; Roin (2008) notes that many of the methods taxpayers have honed in
avoiding income taxes under separate accounting can be deployed to avoid taxes determined by
formulary methods, in some cases at greater social cost and to greater effect on tax collections.

        One of the costs associated with using formulary apportionment is that these systems
create incentives for firms to change their operations through mergers or divestitures. Even in
the absence of formula apportionment it is very common for mergers and divestitures to have
significant tax effects by triggering the realization of capital gains, changing the ability to offset
profits from one operation against losses from another, influencing a firm’s ability to claim
foreign tax credits, changing asset bases for depreciation purposes, and other tax consequences.4
There is considerable evidence that tax attributes influence the likelihood and structure of
mergers and divestitures, as well as the accompanying transaction prices.5 Consequently it is

apportionment might significantly influence patterns of mergers and divestitures.

3.      Distortions

        This section analyzes the ownership distortions associated with the use of formulary
methods, and in particular, the method by which it is possible to estimate the magnitude of these
distortions using data from a cross section of independent firms.

3.1     The extent of income misattribution from using formulas.

        It is helpful to consider the tax consequences of a merger of two firms, designated firm 1
and firm 2. Firm 1 operates entirely in country 1, where it faces a profit tax rate of τ 1 ; firm 2
operates entirely in country 2, where its profits are subject to tax at rate τ 2 . Countries 1 and 2 tax
multijurisdictional firms using a common formula with weights α i to each of i = 1,..., n factors
                                                                     n
such as employment, fixed capital, and sales, with              ∑α  i =1
                                                                           i   = 1 . Firm 1’s taxable profits are

represented by π 1 , where profits equal revenues minus deductible costs including purchases of
intermediate goods from other firms, labor and interest expense, but not including the
opportunity cost of invested capital. Firm 1’s factors are denoted x1i for all i = 1,..., n ; similarly,

firm 2’s profits are denoted π 2 , and its factors denoted x 2i . The aggregate tax obligation for the
two firms in the absence of a merger equals:

(1)                                          (τ 1π 1 + τ 2π 2 ) .

If the two firms merge in such a way that their factor use and profits are unchanged, then the
only difference produced by the merger is that their tax obligations to countries 1 and 2 will be
determined by formula, and the total is:

                                   ⎧ ⎡   n
                                                               ⎤       ⎡n            ⎤⎫
                        (π 1 + π 2 )⎨τ 1 ⎢∑ α i         x1i
                                                                 + τ 2 ⎢∑ α i
                                                                              x2i
                                                   (x1i + x21 )⎦ ⎣ i =1 (x1i + x2i )⎥⎦ ⎬⎭
                                                               ⎥
(2)                                                                                       .
                                   ⎩ ⎣ i =1

        The difference between (1) and (2) is (τ 1 − τ 2 )ψ , for which:



                                                                                                                    6
                                                                n
                                                                      π 2 x1i − π 1 x2i
(3)                                                      ψ = ∑αi                          .
                                                               i =1     (x1i + x2i )

The difference in total tax obligation induced by formula apportionment is the product of tax rate
differences and differences in ratios of profitability to factor use. Clearly, there is no difference
                     π 2 x2i
if τ 1 = τ 2 or if      =    ∀i . In the first of these cases the equality of tax rates implies that the
                     π 1 x1i
taxpayer’s total obligation is the same regardless of the jurisdiction to which income is assigned;
in the second case, the formulas assign income exactly as it is earned. For most cases, however,
                                                                   ⎛π ⎞
neither of these conditions will hold. Introducing a new variable ⎜⎜ ⎟⎟ , the ratio of average
                                                                   ⎝ xi ⎠
profits among all firms (π ) and average use of factor i ( xi ) , equation (3) can be rewritten as:

                                n    ⎡            ⎛π     ⎞⎤        x1i        n    ⎡           ⎛ π ⎞⎤       x2i

                              i =1   ⎣            ⎝ xi    ⎠⎦ ( x1i + x 2i ) i =1 ⎣             ⎝ xi ⎠⎦ ( x1i + x2i )

                                                                                                    n
                                                                                                                x1i
         In analyzing the implications of (4) it is helpful to define s1 ≡ ∑ α i                                        to be firm
                                                                                                   i =1    (x1i + x2i )
one’s average share of all factors, weighted as in the common allocation formula, and similarly
for firm two, so that s2 = 1 − s1 . Then (4) can be rewritten as:


               ⎡          n
                                         ⎛ π ⎞⎤        ⎡        n

                                                                                           ⎛π ⎞
(5)      ψ = ⎢π 2 − ∑ α i x2i ⎜⎜              ⎟⎟⎥ s1 − ⎢π 1 − ∑ α i x1i ⎜⎜ ⎟⎟⎥ s2 − ∑ α i ⎜⎜ ⎟⎟[x1i − s1 (x1i + x 2i )] .

         The right side of equation (5) consists of three terms, the first of which is s1 times the

                                                        ⎝ xi ⎠
think of this difference as being the residual from a regression equation in which the α i are

regression coefficients used to predict π 2 based on x 2i . The mean prediction error of this

regression is clearly zero, since the α i sum to one and firm profits must average the sample

mean π , but the sum of squared residuals from this regression depends on the values of the α i .



                                                                                                                            7
It is convenient to denote the value of the residual predicting π 2 in this regression, the first
bracketed term on the right side of equation (5), as r2 . Likewise the second term on the right
side of equation (5) is the product of s2 and the analogous residual from the equation predicting
π 1 based on x1i ; hence this product can be represented as r1 s2 .

         The third term on the right side of (5) is the weighted sum of the difference between x1i

                                                   ⎛π ⎞
and s1 ( x1i + x 2i ) , with weights equal to α i ⎜⎜ ⎟⎟ . This sum is a function not of the ability of
                                                   ⎝ xi ⎠
factors to predict profitability, but instead of differences in the relative factor intensities of firms
1 and 2, since x1i differs from s1 ( x1i + x 2i ) because s1 is an average taken across all input
factors, not merely factor i. The value of this sum is likely to be of second order importance
relative to the prediction errors that constitute the first two terms on the right side of equation
(5); for example, it is exactly zero in the case in which a single factor receives unit weight in the
allocation formula and other factors have zero weight.6 Taking this term to be of second order
relative to the others, equation (5) can be written:

(6)                                           ψ = r2 s1 − r1 s2 .

Hence the merger of two firms misallocates their income for tax purposes by an amount equal to
the weighted difference of the residuals in the equations explaining their incomes.

3.2      The economic cost of income misattribution.

         From the standpoint of efficient resource allocation, the cost of misattributing economic
income by using an allocation formula includes the possibility that this misattribution may
influence whether firms merge or divest their operations. A merger between firms 1 and 2 is tax
favored if (τ 1 − τ 2 )ψ is negative, and tax disfavored if (τ 1 − τ 2 )ψ is positive; the magnitude of
(τ 1 − τ 2 )ψ   determines the extent of tax incentive. A conglomerate consisting of two affiliates
equivalent to firms 1 and 2 similarly faces incentives to divest one affiliate if (τ 1 − τ 2 )ψ is


6
 As noted in the discussion of the empirical evidence in section 5, empirically this third term in equation (5) is of
much smaller magnitude than the other terms in the equation.


                                                                                                                8
positive, and to avoid divestiture if (τ 1 − τ 2 )ψ is negative. These tax incentives say nothing
about the business merits of these mergers or divestitures, though as a general matter the
existence of such tax incentives can be expected to reduce efficiency by introducing
considerations other than pretax profits into ownership decisions.

       In order to estimate the magnitude of the ownership distortion due to formula
apportionment, it is necessary to understand the extent to which firms are likely to change their
ownership of affiliates or other firms in response to these tax incentives. There is apt to be
considerable variation, since influencing the decision requires that a firm be sufficiently close to
the margin that tax considerations become decisive. Firm size is sure to be correlated with this
proclivity: Exxon Mobil is unlikely to attempt to acquire British Petroleum in order to save $100
million in taxes – given the other costs associated with such an acquisition – even though two
medium sized firms would find a tax saving of that size an irresistible inducement to merge.
Exxon Mobil might, on the other hand, consider acquiring a small oil company in return for a
modest tax saving, since relative to the size of the acquisition the tax saving could loom large.

       One way to formalize these notions is to specify that the probability that firms 1 and 2
merge is given by:


(7)
                                                (τ − τ )ψ
                                        k + γ ~ 1 ~ 2~ 2 ~ 2 ,
                                              (x1 + x2 )s1 s2

in which k is a function of various non-tax attributes of firms 1 and 2, γ is a constant, ~
                                                                                          x1 is the

size of firm 1’s assets, and ~
                             s12 is the squared value of firm 1’s share of the total assets of firms 1
                ~
                x2
and 2, ~
       s12 = ~ 1~ 2 . The numerator of the ratio in (7) is the tax consequence of the merger,
            (x1 + x2 )
and the denominator captures that doubling the size of both the target and the acquirer also
doubles the required tax saving to have the same effect on merger probabilities. This
denominator reflects the cost of merging, and its size effects are not symmetric: whereas
increasing the size of the smaller of firms 1 and 2 indeed increases the tax benefit necessary to
encourage a merger, increasing the size of the larger of the two firms may reduce the needed tax




                                                                                                 9
benefit. Thinking of the much larger firm as the acquirer, as the acquirer grows in size it has
greater access to financial and managerial resources that reduce the cost of a merger.

        With a probability of merger given by (7), the standard Harberger triangle approximation
(Hines, 1999) to the deadweight loss associated with tax incentives, denoted Δ , is given by one-
half the product of the tax incentive [(τ 1 − τ 2 )ψ ] and the induced behavioral change:


                                               1 (τ 1 − τ 2 ) ψ 2
                                                                     2
(8)                                         Δ = γ ~ ~ ~2~2 .
                                               2 ( x1 + x 2 )s1 s2


The value of ψ 2 is given by:


(9)                                         ψ 2 = r22 s12 + r12 s22 − 2r1r2 s1 s2 .

Taking firms 1 and 2 to be randomly matched, it follows from the fact that r1 and r2 both have

mean zero that the expected value of ψ 2 is:


(10)                                        E (ψ 2 ) = s12 E (r22 ) + s22 E (r12 ).


In evaluating (8) it simplifies matters greatly to set s12 = ~
                                                             s12 , reflecting that the ratio of two firms’
assets roughly tracks the ratios of their factors used in the allocation formulas. Furthermore, the
expected value of the squared prediction error is itself a function of firm size, so:

                                                       E (r12 )     ~
                                                                    s12
                                                                =
                                                       E (r22 )
(11)                                                                ~   .
                                                                    s2
                                                                     2



        Imposing (10) and (11), and the approximation that s12 = ~
                                                                 s12 , (8) becomes:


(12)                    Δ =γ
                                (τ 1 − τ 2 )2 E (r12 ) = γ (τ 1 − τ 2 )2 E (r12 )(~x1 + ~x2 ) ,
                                   (~x1 + ~x2 )~s12                       ~

which in turn implies that:




                                                                                                  10

Equation (13) indicates that the deadweight loss from income misattribution by formulary
methods is proportional to the product of the square of tax rate differences and sum of squared
estimation errors, normalized by asset sizes. Clearly, the formulary system that minimizes the
deadweight loss from ownership misallocation associated with income misattribution is one that
minimizes the weighted sum of squares of prediction errors, with weights equal to firm assets.

3.3.   Interpretation.

       Equation (13) implies that the expected economic cost of ownership distortions
introduced by misattributing income is proportional to the product of the square of tax rate
differences and the expected squared prediction error from using a formula. This comes from the
Harberger triangle representation of deadweight loss, which takes a second-order approximation
that the distribution of tax benefits is roughly uniform across the affected population, so for those
firms whose merger or divestment decisions are influenced by the use of formula allocation, the
average economic cost of this distortion equals half of the tax incentive produced by the formula.
This, together with the equation determining the likelihood of tax-motivated ownership changes,
implies that small tax incentives produce very small expected deadweight losses, whereas large
tax benefits for some firms may create significant deadweight losses.

       The analysis in section 3.2 considers a potential merger of two firms chosen at random,
and it is the randomness of this matching that makes it possible to ignore the third term on the
right side equation (9), the expectation of which is zero, and thereby replace equation (9) with
equation (10). Clearly, potential merger candidates are not in fact randomly matched, though
whether their matching is random relative to potential tax benefits introduced by the use of
formula apportionment is another matter. The analysis considers individual firm matches, but
once a system of formula apportionment is in place the distribution of firm attributes will change
as assets are reallocated in response to tax incentives. As Gordon and Wilson (1986) note, in the
absence of merger costs every firm will face the same average tax rate in equilibrium, since any
tax differences will be eliminated through the process of tax-motivated mergers and divestments.
It is, however, unrealistic to think that asset reallocation can proceed so costlessly or easily. The


                                                                                               11
framework underlying the empirical analysis assumes that potential merger partners are brought
together for non-tax business reasons, at which point tax considerations have the potential to
influence the outcome by affecting the potential net benefits of a merger. Furthermore, tax-
motivated mergers are either sufficiently limited in number that they do not significantly
influence the distribution of firm attributes throughout the economy, so these attributes can be
taken to be exogenous from the standpoint of the analysis, or else they are quite frequent, in
which case it is clear that they are the source of large economic distortions.

          Both tax and prediction error terms enter the formula for efficiency cost in Equation (13).
Assuming that tax rates are determined by considerations that do not include the details of
formula apportionment, and taking firm attributes to be distributed independently of tax rates, it
follows that the formula that minimizes the expected squared prediction error also minimizes
deadweight loss from ownership distortions. This is the ordinary least squares estimate of the
formula components: OLS is the minimum variance unbiased linear estimator, and by
construction in this case the mean estimation error is zero and the estimates are linear in the
components. Hence in order to implement equation (13) to find the distortion-minimizing
formulary apportionment scheme, it is simply necessary to run regressions explaining
profitability on the basis of observed factors.

4.        Data

          In order to evaluate the magnitudes of tax-induced ownership distortions it is necessary to
estimate the extent to which apportionment factors explain the variation in firm profitability.
The data on European firms come from the Amadeus-Bureau Van Dijk database, which
includes firm-level data on over 5 million private and publicly owned non-financial firms in 34
European countries in both eastern and western Europe. The Amadeus database is created by
collecting standardized data received from information providers across Europe. The local source
for these data is generally company registrar offices, which require all incorporated firms to
submit annual filings. The database includes firm-level accounting data in standardized financial
format.

          The empirical analysis considers only firms with 100 or more employees, since Amadeus
coverage of very small firms varies with country- level filing requirements, and tax-motivated



                                                                                              12
international ownership changes are likely to be focused on larger firms. The key variables in
this analysis are fixed assets, enterprise value, sales, profit/loss before taxation, number of
employees, and labor compensation. Fixed assets are defined as “tangible fixed/long-term assets
net of depreciation”, which does not include financial assets; fixed assets can be thought of as
property plant and equipment (PPE). Enterprise value is the sum of a firm’s yearend market
capitalization and debt (both long term and short term) minus cash. Excluding firms with
missing value for these variables, and using only consolidated statements, the final sample
includes 11,103 firms for which there is information on a firm’s profit/loss before taxation, and
1,473 firms for which there is information on year-end enterprise value.

         Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for these variables;7 the top panel reports the
figures for the sample with information on profits and losses, and the bottom panel for the
significantly smaller sample with information on enterprise value. The skewed distribution of
firm sizes is evident from this table, in that mean entries for every variable greatly exceed sample
medians. In the sample of firms reporting profits and losses, median profit for 2004 was $3.9
million; these firms had median sales of $116.2 million, median property, plant and equipment
holdings of $23.6 million, median labor compensation of $21.6 million, and a median of 427
employees. The smaller sample of firms reporting enterprise value had median enterprise values
of $160.9 million, and had roughly double the median sales, property plant and equipment, labor
compensation and employment of firms not reporting enterprise values.

         The empirical work in section 5 uses these data to estimate the extent to which
observable factors explain income differences. Since the Amadeus data are financial accounting
entries, they need not correspond to taxable incomes, and are potentially subject to their own
sources of bias and noise, as executives may manage entries to meet earning targets and
otherwise present their firms to financial markets as favorably as possible. Whether these
financial data are more or less reliably reported than information presented to tax authorities is
an interesting question, but in any case tax data are confidential and therefore unavailable for this
analysis, and it is revealing to use the financial data to compare the accuracy of alternative
methods of predicting a firm’s income.

7
 Appendix Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for versions of these variables weighted by the square root of firm
assets; these are the variables used in the regressions that follow.


                                                                                                              13
        The available information covers the operations and incomes of independent companies,
whereas the analysis in section 3 concerns separate operations within the same multinational
firms. In using data from separate companies to estimate the consequences of allocating income
using formulary methods, there is an implicit assumption that the income generating process in a
cross section of firms resembles the income generating process among affiliates of the same
firm. Certainly this assumption looks sound if mergers are tax-driven marriages of convenience;
and even in the case that ownership of divisions or affiliates is determined by pretax profitability,
with production, sales, and cost spillovers among components of the firm, it is nonetheless
reasonable to expect that to a first order the contribution of an affiliate to total firm profitability
is closely related to its profitability as a stand-alone entity.

5.      Determinants of Income and Market Valuation

        In evaluating the predictive quality of different allocation formulas, it is helpful to start
with benchmark formulas whose coefficients are unconstrained by prior choices but instead
determined by the data. These benchmark formulas come simply from regressions of income on
factors that enter the formulas. These regressions have the potential to reveal the ability of
different factors to account for income production, and to help evaluate the extent to which
simple formulary rules depart from weights that are indicated by the data.

        Table 2 presents regressions of profits and losses, and enterprise values, on measures of
sales, tangible property, and employment. The regressions reported in columns 1 and 3 use labor
compensation as measures of labor input, whereas the regressions reported in columns 2 and 4
use numbers of employees; as a result, the sample sizes are much larger in the even-numbered
columns. In all of the regressions variables are weighted by the square root of firm assets.
Observable measures do a creditable job of predicting operating income, in that the R-squareds
lie between 0.2 and 0.4, though this largely reflects differences between small firms and large
firms. The point estimates in column one imply that, controlling for property and employment,
$100 of additional sales, interacted with the ratio of mean income to mean sales, is associated
with $60.95 of additional operating income. Given the values reported in Appendix Table 1, this
implies that $100 of additional sales, conditional on property and employment, correlates with
$2.80 of additional income. Similarly, controlling for other factors, the regression implies that



                                                                                                  14
$100 of additional property, interacted with the ratio of mean income to mean property, is
associated with $25.60 of additional operating income – or that $100 of additional property,
conditional on sales and employment, correlates with $7.13 of additional income. The estimated
coefficients on sales and tangible property are both significant, though it is notable that the t-
statistic on the sales coefficient exceeds that on the property coefficient. The 0.0654 point
estimate on labor compensation implies that $100 of additional labor compensation, interacted
with the ratio of mean income to mean labor compensation, is associated with $6.54 of additional
income, and this magnitude does not differ statistically from zero. The regression reported in
column two using employment as a measure of labor input produces similar results.

       Columns 3 and 4 report coefficient estimates obtained by repeating these regressions with
enterprise value as the dependent variable. Sales and property again significantly affect
measured income, and the employment variables perform significantly better in these
regressions, with positive and statistically significant estimated coefficients, albeit smaller than
those for sales and property.

       Figure 1 plots predicted and actual values of profits and losses, where the prediction is
drawn from the model reported in column 1 of Table 3. It is clear from the figure that while
predicted values capture the central tendencies of the data, there is just an enormous amount of
idiosyncratic variation that no three-factor formula can hope to reflect. Figure 2 performs the
same exercise for the equation predicting enterprise value, a dependent variable that is truncated
at zero, but that nevertheless exhibits considerable unexplained variation. Of course,
constraining the formulas by omitting one or two of the factors, or imposing equality among the
coefficients on all three, only reduces the predictive power of the equations.

       Tables 3 presents estimated coefficients from regressions that include just two factors,
sales and measures of employment. The results indicate that the sales variable does almost all of
the work in explaining measured income. The employment coefficients are statistically
insignificant in the regressions reported in columns 1 and 2 in which profit is the dependent
variable, and the employment variable is insignificant in the regression reported in column 4 in
which enterprise value is the dependent variable. Only in column three, in which enterprise
value is the dependent variable, does the labor compensation variable have a coefficient that



                                                                                                15
differs significantly from zero, and its t-statistic of 2.06 is quite a bit smaller than the
corresponding t-statistic of 8.53 on the sales coefficient.

        It may not be surprising that labor cost factors do a very poor job of predicting income,
given that labor expenses are deductible in calculating income; whereas capital expenses are
typically only partially deductible, and greater sales conditional on factor inputs contribute to
income. As Goolsbee and Maydew (2000) and Anand and Sansing (2000) note, American states
have moved over time to give greater weight to sales factors in their apportionment formulas,
and typically have incentives to do so in order to attract mobile economic activity, quite apart
from any improved income attribution (though the destination-based sales definition in the
formulas does not correspond exactly to the firm-based sales definition in the Amadeus data). In
contrast, the variant of the European Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base proposal in
which income would be allocated purely on the basis of labor inputs would attribute income
production particularly poorly.

        In practice, formulary methods as used by U.S. states and Canadian provinces, and
advocated for use internationally, do not correspond to the unconstrained regressions presented
in Tables 2 and 3. Instead these formulas follow fixed rules, such as equal weights on each of
the sales, property and employment factors, or double weighting sales in a three-factor formula,
or two factor formulas with equal weights on property and employment. Table 4 presents
summary statistics from regressions based on these and other formulary alternatives. The table
reports R 2 statistics from the underlying regressions in each row. The first row presents data for
the unconstrained three-factor regression, and all of the following rows report the extent to which
their R 2 statistics exceed that of the unconstrained regression.

        The figures in Table 4 illustrate the extent to which constraining the regressions reduces
their predictive power. The equal weighted three-factor formula produces an R 2 that is 6.29%
smaller than that for the unconstrained formula predicting profits (using labor compensation as a
measure of employment), and 4.62% smaller in predicting enterprise value. Use of a three-factor
formula with double weight on the sales factor significantly mitigates the loss of R 2 , as do the
two-factor regressions in which labor compensation does not appear. Even with sales and
property constrained each to have 50% weight, these two-factor formulas come within 4.8% of



                                                                                               16
the R 2 of unconstrained three-factor formula predicting profits (using labor compensation as the
employment measure) and 1.9% of the R 2 of unconstrained three-factor formula predicting
enterprise value.

          The two-factor formulas that include labor compensation and are constrained to use equal
weights perform very poorly from an R 2 standpoint, the equation in which property and wages
predict profits producing an R 2 22% lower than that for the unconstrained three-factor formula.
The culprit is clearly the labor compensation variable, as revealed by the one-factor formulas
reported in the bottom four rows of Table 4. Whereas use of the sales factor alone to predict
profits produces an R 2 value within 7.4% of that produced by an unconstrained three-factor
formula, the labor compensation factor generates an R 2 40.2% smaller, and total employment an
R 2 58.2% smaller. The property factor alone is similar to the labor factors in generating low R 2
values.

          One indicator of the performance of a formula is the distribution of its predictions relative
to actual values. Table 5 presents the distribution of the ratio of forecast errors to forecasted
incomes for the unconstrained regressions. Columns 1 and 2 indicate that the absolute value of
the error in predicting firm profits exceeds half of the predicted value 64% of the time, and the
error in predicting enterprise value exceeds half of that predicted value roughly 50% of the time.
The table indicates that the absolute value of the error in predicting profits exceeds twice the
predicted level of profits 11% of the time, and the error in predicting enterprise value exceeds
twice the predicted value 8-9% of the time; clearly, there are significant numbers of cases of
large prediction errors.8

          The constrained regressions perform considerably worse on average than do the
unconstrained three-factor formulas. Table 6 presents the distribution of forecast errors for the
three-factor formulas in which sales, property and employment are assigned equal weights. The

  A similar calculation can be used to measure the absolute magnitude of the third term on the right side of equation
(5) relative to predicted firm profits. In order to evaluate this third term it is necessary to specify a merger partner,
which is taken to be a firm with mean values of sales, property, and labor compensation. The absolute values of the
third term are tiny compared to the prediction errors that are the basis of the calculations presented in Table 5. For
example, in the regression reported in the first column, only 12.1% of firms have third terms that exceed (in absolute
value) 10% of predicted firm profits, 2.3% of firms have third terms that exceed 25% of predicted profits, fewer than
0.05% of firms have third terms that exceed 50% of predicted profits, and none exceed 75% of predicted profits.


                                                                                                                17
absolute value of the prediction error from the equal-weighted three-factor formula exceeds half
of predicted profits 65% of the time, and exceeds twice profits 11-13% of the time. These
prediction errors do not differ greatly from those reported for the unconstrained regressions in
Table 5, and the differences between the prediction errors of the unconstrained and constrained
three-factor regressions are similarly modest for equations predicting enterprise values.

6.     Conclusion

       Formulary alternatives to separate entity accounting hold the undeniable appeal of
reducing certain opportunities for tax-motivated international income reallocation. This comes at
a serious cost, which is that the factors that enter the formulas do not accurately correspond to
the determinants of business incomes. As a result, the formulas misattribute income, so their use
in an international setting would misallocate tax revenue among countries and tax burdens
among taxpayers. In so doing, the adoption of formula apportionment creates incentives for new
forms of tax avoidance through mergers and divestitures.

       Evidence from European companies indicates that commonly proposed formulas predict
little more than one fifth of the observed variation in profits, and roughly one third of the
variation in market capitalization. In particular, the labor cost factors do a very poor job of
predicting income. The analysis in section 3 of the paper shows that the ownership distortions
associated with the use of formulary methods are proportional to the mean squared prediction
error in a regression explaining firm income, with weights equal to the inverse square root of
firm size. Since the estimated coefficients are very unkind to the labor factors, they suggest that
governments that must use formulas maximize the accuracy of income attribution and minimize
the deadweight loss of ownership distortions by ignoring or significantly downplaying the labor
input factors – though since the formulas also distort investment, employment, and other
economic decisions in addition to ownership, the total distortion-minimizing formula would
incorporate all of these considerations.

       Is it sensible to consider formulary alternatives to separate accounting for tax purposes,
given the inaccuracy of formulary methods and the incentives they create? Evaluating this
question requires a careful comparative examination of all of the unappetizing tax choices that
governments face. Hard experience makes problems more evident in the tax systems that


                                                                                                18
governments use than in the alternatives, but it does not follow that tax reform improves matters,
since it generally replaces one set of problems with another. It is clear from the evidence that
formulas attribute income very imperfectly, so whether the associated costs are acceptable
depends on how dire one considers the international tax regime today.

Notes:

Model 1 is the following specification: dependent variable regressed on sales,
net PPE, and labor costs. Model 2 is identical to Model 1 except that number
of employees is substituted for labor costs.


A firm's actual profit level or enterprise value is denoted π, whereas the
predicted value is denoted hat(π).

Notes:

Model 1 is a constrained estimation using the following independent variables:
sales, net PPE, and labor costs, each constrained to have identical coefficients.
Model 2 is identical to Model 1 except that number of employees is substituted
for labor costs.


A firm's actual profit level or enterprise value is denoted π, whereas the
predicted value is denoted hat(π).
