                  Labor Force Transitions and Unemployment


     This paper challenges conventional views of unemployment. Its results

suggest that failure to examine closely labor force transitions has led to a

misleading picture of unemployment and the way the labor market functions in

general. There are four main conclusions. First, labor force transitions

are the principal determinant of fluctuations in employment and unemployment.

We find that the vast majority of those newly employed come not from unemploy-

ment but from outside the labor force. Likewise, most spells of employment

end with labor force withdrawal rather than unemployment. Second, traditional

estimates of the duratiofl of unemployment and the ease of job finding are

seriously flawed by failure to take account of the 45 percent of all unemploy-

ment spells which end in labor force withdrawal. Third, re-entrant unemployment

is to a large extent the result of job-ending followed by a brief spell outside

the labor force. Many re-entrants would almost certainly be better classified

as job losers and leavers completing long spells of unemployment rather than as

entrants starting a new spell of unemployment. Fourth, it appears that many of

those counted as out of the labor force are functionally indistinguishable from

the unemployed.

          Economists in recent years have come to treat unemployment as a

dynamic phenomenon. This view holds that high unemployment rates are not

the result of a shortage of jobs but of high turnover. Indeed, the high

proportion of unemployment attributable to sources other than job loss

has been emphasized repeatedly.1 The apparently short duration of

unemployment spells has led many observers to downplay the welfare

significance of unemployment. It has also been cited to support the view

that jobs are readily available for those who really want them.

          This paper re-examines the dynamics of the labor market using the

BLS gross changes data. The results confirm the importance of high turn-

over, but suggest that the nature of this turnover has been badly mis-

understood. While movements between employment and unemployment dominate

the conventional image of labor market mobility, they in fact account for

a small part of movements into and out of unemployment and employment.

Most movements in fact involve either labor force entrance or exit. This

has important implications for usual views about unemployment.

          For example, our results indicate that calculation of completed

spell lengths for the unemployed is deceptive. Many persons experience

a spell of unemployment followed by a brief tenure outside the labor force,

and an interval of "re-entrant" unemployment. While the official statis-

tics capture two brief spells, the experience might better be viewed as a

single lengthy spell of unemployment. Apart from this difficulty, the

results suggest that focus on average spell length is likely to be quite

misleading since most unemployment is attributable to the relatively few

long spells.
                                   -2-

           Modern views of unemployment place considerable emphasis on job

search. Unemployed workers are portrayed as engaged in productive labor -

i.e.,   searching for the best possible use of their talents. We find that

search by the unemployed can explain only a small part of labor market

behavior. Most persons who find jobs were out of the labor force rather

than unemployed in the preceding month. Likewise, most separations from

employment involve withdrawal from the labor force rather than the decision

to seek work. Contrary to the usual search theory view, a fairly high

proportion of unemployment spells end in labor force withdrawal rather

than employment.

           An additional important implication of our results involves the

interpretation of the official unemployment statistics. The extremely high

rates of transition between unemployment and the not in the labor force

state lead us to suspect that many persons in these two states are

functionally indistinguishable. Many of the movements picked up by the

official statistics are likely to be the result of inconsistent reporting

of relatively consistent behavior rather than actual behavioral shifts.

           The paper is divided into six sections. In Section I, we docu-

ment the importance of labor force transitions in determining levels of

employment and unemployment. The second section examines in detail the

characteristics of unemployment spells and demonstrates the importance of

labor force withdrawal. The experience of those who withdraw from the

labor force is considered in Section III. We derive estimates indicating

that a very high proportion of those who withdraw from the labor force

return relatively quickly. These estimates are shown to be consistent

with the expressed intentions of those outside the labor force. In
                                      -3-

Section IV, we examine the characteristics of unemployed re-entrants, and

show that much of this group may be viewed as completing longer spells of

unemployment. The fifth section of the paper uses the annual Work Experi-

ence Survey to provide independent evidence corroborating the view put

forth in preceding sections. Finally, Section VI discusses the implications

of the results.



                                        I


          This study makes use of the BLS gross changes data to analyze

the structure and dynamics of unemployment.2 From two—way tabulations of

labor force status this month by labor force status last month, it is

possible to find the number of individuals who moved, for example, from

unemployment to employment during the last month. Since there are three

possible labor market states (employment, unemployment, not-in-the-labor

force), there are nine monthly flows which may be calculated.

          We summarize the available information for each month in a 3x3

matrix of transition probabilities and a vector of three stocks. Thus,

for each of several demographic groups we consider the matrix:

                      P     P     P
                       ee    eu    en

          P           P     P     P                                (1)
                       ue    uu    Un

                  P         P     P
                  _ne        nu   on

where, for example, 1'en represents the proportion of employed workers

last month who were out of the labor force this month. Since a worker

must always be in one of the three labor force states, the rows of P sum

to 1.
                                           -4-

            The focus of this study is on labor force transitions. It will

therefore be convenient to define a state L, for labor force, which in-

cludes both E and U. Letting F.. represent the flow of workers into

state j from state i, it is clear that:

            Fnl   =   F
                      ne
                           +Fflu
            Fin =F en+Fun                                           (2)


The transition probabilities may then be represented as:

            Pni =P ne+Pnu

The Importance of Labor Force Transitions

            A striking feature of the data is the enormous magnitude of all

the f lows.3 In an average month between 1968 and 1976, about 4 percent of

those in the labor force or 3.8 million people left the labor force and 4.0

million people entered. While the flows are greatest for teenagers, they

are large even for prime age males. Close to 0.275 million men between

the ages of 25 and 59 leave the labor force each month. A slightly smaller

number enter each month. As one would expect, women have much higher flow

probabilities than men, reflecting greater volatility in labor force parti-

cipation.

            The role of entrance and exit flows in explaining unemployment

and employment is examined in Table 1. It is instructive to consider

the group with the greatest labor force attachment, prime-age males, 25-

59. Even though between 1968 and 1976 this group had an average parti-

cipation rate of 92 percent, one-third of employment entrance occurred

from outside of the labor force. Likewise, 28 percent of employment spells

ended in labor force withdrawal. Similar relationships characterize unem-

ployment. Almost 25 percent of unemployment spells end in labor force

withdrawal. Other demographic groups are characterized by even greater

flows into and out of the labor force. For adult women, 83.7 percent of

all employment spells begin with labor force entrance, and 77.8 percent end

in labor force withdrawal. For the total population, about 70% of

entrances into employment occur without recorded unemployment, and a com-

parable proportion of employment spells end in withdrawal. Almost half of

unemployment spells begin and end outside of the labor force.


Duration of Completed Spells

             The tremendous volatility of labor force behavior may also be

conveyed by examining the mean duration of completed spells in each of

the states. Assuming a steady state, the mean duration of a completed

spell in state i is estimated as:4

                         1
             D. -

The mean duration of completed spells in the various states are presented

in Table 2, for different demographic groups. The spells are surprisingly

short. The average completed spell of employment lasts for only 21 months.

For teenagers the figure is only 6 months. The typical duration of spells

outside the labor force is even shorter, averaging about 15 months over

the 1968-1976 period. For adult women, traditionally viewed as being

only loosely attached to the labor force, the average duration of a spell

of employment is 18 months, while the average spell outside the labor force

lasts only 17 months. These figures imply that the average number of labor

force entrances among women during their adult lifetime is 12. For men the

comparable number is 4. Of course these high averages may result from

extreme volatility on the part of a small part of the sample.

          Unemployment spells are far shorter than spells in any of the

other states. The average spell of unemployment lasted slightly over two

months.5 The duration was less for teenagers and women and somewhat greater

for prime-age males. These durations would be much longer but for the

fact that almost half of all workers leave unemployment by withdrawing

from the labor force. In the final column of the table, the expected duration

is computed for a hypothetical worker who is unwilling to withdraw from the

labor force. As expected, such a worker has a much longer expected duration -

almost four months over the 1968-1976 period. This calculation also makes

clear that labor force withdrawal, and not ease of transition into employ-

ment, accounts for teenagers' and women's apparently short unemployment

spells. Teenagers and women unwilling to withdraw from the labor force

have longer spells of unemployment than do prime-age males -   e.g.,   5.60

months for adult women, contrasted with 3.20 months for adult men.

         The results in Tables 1 and 2 underscore the importance of labor

force transitions in determining the frequency and duration of unemployment.

The evidence suggests that estimates of the ease of job finding are over-

stated by failure to take into account the extent of labor force withdrawal.

Spells of unemployment appear to be short because of frequent exit from the
                                   —9—


labor force. The estimates of duration in Table 2 ignore any hidden unem-

ployment which occurs after labor force withdrawal. It seems plausible that

at least some of those who end unemployment by leaving the labor force, do

so because they are unable to find work. The calculations also ignore any

hidden unemployment which occurred before labor force entry for those classi-

fied as re-entrants. These issues are taken up in subsequent sections. In

the next section, we examine in more detail the way in which spells of

unemployment end, by studying how the probability of labor force withdrawal

is affected by the duration of and reason for unemployment.



                                   II


          This section examines the transition out of the unemployment state.

We estimate hazard functions relating transitions to durations for various

demographic groups. From the hazard function it is possible to generate

density functions for the duration of completed spells ending in both employ-

ment and labor force withdrawal.

          A hazard function relates the probability of exit from a state to

the duration in the state. We generalize the notion usually employed in

reliability theory by estimating separate hazard functions for exit to

employment, and labor force withdrawal. The data come from the BLS gross

change tabulations. They make available the flow from unemployment to

employment, and unemployment to not in the labor force for those unemployed

0-4 weeks, 5-6 weeks, 7—10 weeks, 11-14 weeks, 15-26 weeks and 27+ weeks.

To estimate hazard functions we fit curves by associating each range

probability with the range midpoint. Various functional forms were tried

with only slight effects on the conclusions. Results with the logarithmic
                                       - 10   -




form are presented here, since its performance was marginally superior.

Thus, for each group for each year, we estimated the pair of equations:

          P
           ue   =ci
                  1
                    +lnt+u 1
                          1



                                                                         (5)


where t is the midpoint of the duration range, and u1 and u2 are error terms.

          Typical results for men and women in 1969 and 1975 are presented

in the appendix. The data quite clearly reject the simple Markov model.

In virtually all cases the transition probabilities are dependent on dura-

tion. This could be the result of two quite different effects. First, it

may be that the longer one is unemployed, the more difficult it becomes

to find a job, and the less one can afford to take time off from job search

and leave the labor force. Second, the observed duration dependence may

be the result of heterogeneity. If each individual has a constant escape

probability, those who remain unemployed longest will on average have the

lowest escape probabilities, so the observed escape probability will

decline with duration.6

          The observed hazard functions may be used to create monthly

transition probabilities. This is done by assuming that each monthly

transition probability may be approximated by the probability at the

month's midpoint. Given P and               for each month j, the distribution
                              Un       ue
of completed spells is easily computed. For example, the proportion of

spells ending in labor force withdrawal after t months is:

                     t-l           .

         hUn Ct) =       fl   (1-P3 - pJ ) Pt                           (6)

          H(t)           =             h       (j)                (7)
                               j=t+l

          From the density functions, the mean lengths of completed spells,

and the proportion of unemployment accounted for by spells of a given length

may be computed. For example, the mean length of completed spells ending

in labor force withdrawal, is:




          D
               un
                     =   ti    hun(t)      t
                                                                  (8)


                         tl    htin(t)

Similar calculations yield the mean duration of completed spells ending in

employment and of total completed spells.

          The proportion of all unemployment accounted for by each type of

spell may also be calculated from the density function of completed spells.

If the flow into unemployment, F, is constant, the number of people unem-

ployed at any moment is constant, and may be written as:


          S         =    F   ( H(j) ÷ H(j))                       (9)
                             j=O

The proportion of unemployment due to, for example, those who will exit the

labor force is:


                                   (   H(j))
          It
                                                                 (10)
              tin

                         ( Hun(j)      +j0H(j))
In a similar way, the proportion of unemployment accounted for by those

with spells which will exceed k weeks when they are completed can be

calculated:
                                       - 12   -




                                  H(j))
                                                                      ll
                    Z   (H(j) +               ÷ (k) (H(k) + Hue(k))
            k   =
          it

                                  (X   H(j) +      H(j))
                              j0                  j0
          In Table 3 we present various features of the distribution of

completed spells derived from the estimated hazard functions. The results

confirm the importance of exit unemployment. In both years 35 percent of

male spells of unemployment ended in withdrawal.7 However, in 1975

exiters accounted for 46 percent of male unemployment. This is because

the average duration of spells ending in exit was 2.82 months compared to

2.36 months for those ending in employment.

          The results here confirm that most unemployment spells are very

short. Even in 1975, when the unemployment rate reached a post-war high,

close to 49 percent of all unemployment spells ended in less than a month

for men, and 57 percent for women. However, these figures are quite

misleading. Many short spells, 33 percent for men and 54 percent for women,

end outside the labor force. More importantly, the fact that most spells

are short does not imply that most unemployment is due to short spells.

Longer spells obviously contribute disproportionately to total unemployment.

Indeed, in 1975 for men, fully half of all unemployment was due to spells

lasting over four months, and 34 percent was due to spells exceeding six

months. The extremely cyclical character of long-term unemployment also

stands out. For men, the proportion of unemployment due to spells lasting

longer than three months was 34 percent in 1969 when the national unemploy-

ment rate was 3.5 percent, compared to 65 percent in 1975 when the national

rate was 8.5 percent.

          An important feature of the results in Table 3 is the greater

length of spells of unemployment which end in labor force withdrawal. This

occurs because a disproportionate share (close to 60%) of long-term unemploy-

ment spells end in labor force exit. It seems reasonable to conjecture

that many persons who search for six months and then withdraw from the labor

force are in some sense discouraged workers. If so, this suggests the

possibility that there is a significant amount of hidden unemployment.

This hypothesis is borne out by the evidence on discouraged workers

presented below.

          Another possible explanation relies on the unemployment insurance

system. It might be suggested that many people remain in the labor force

only in order to collect benefits, and then withdraw when their benefits

run out. While this pattern clearly does explain some of the high rates

of labor force exit, it seems unlikely that it can explain most with-

drawal. Most withdrawals occur among demographic groups, such as adult

women and teenagers, in which UI benefits are least concentrated. More-

over, in 1975 and 1976 the UI benefit period was extended from 26 to 65

weeks with almost no effect on the rate of labor force exit.

Probability of Exit and Reason for Unemployment

         The significance of unemployment spells ending in withdrawal

depends on the type of unemployed persons who end their spells in this

way. Unfortunately BLS does not make available exit data by reason for

unemployment. From observed data on the stock of unemployment by reason,

and the extent of labor force withdrawal, it is possible to draw some

inferences. The procedure described below is an adaptation of the

standard random coefficients regression technique.8 For each group of
                                           - 15    —




the unemployed, we allow the probability of leaving unemployment through

withdrawal to depend on aggregate demand and a constant term. Thus,

              Pexit.
                   it
                        =    a.1 +   .uit + v.it                              (12)

where   U represents aggregate demand, and the subscript i represents the

category of unemployment (losers, leavers, etc.). It is an identity that:

              Pexit =
                   t
                            Z s. Pexit.
                               it         it                                  (13)

where   the       represent the shares of the th category in total unemploy-

ment. Combining equations (17) and (18) yields an equation which may be

estimated from available data:

              Pexit = Z s.a. +           (              +
                                                            Zsv               (14)


in the actual estimation we modify equation (19) by adding seasonal dummies.

              We have used the monthly data on the stock of unemployment

to calculate the share of unemployment due to job losers, job leavers and

labor force entrants.         It. has also been assumed that aggregate demand

conditions may be proxied by a fixed weight distributed lag on the prime-age

male unemployment rate (RU). In the results reported here, U =                        +
                                                                            .4RUt.1
         +              +
.3RUt2        .2RUt3        .1RU4.
              The results of estimating equation (14) have been used to calcu-

late average values of Pexit for job losers, leavers and labor force

entrants.9 The results are reported in the top half of Table 410 in

method I a separate value of            was estimated for each group. Since the

data fail to reject (i.e., F(2,97) =           1.39),   the hypothesis that all the

are equal, we also present the estimates when this constraint is imposed.

The numbers in parentheses are the standard errors of the estimates.11

          It appears clear from the evidence of Table 4 that labor force
exit is most common among entrants. This is consistent with the finding

noted earlier that Pexit is highest in the demographic groups, women and

teenagers, where entrance is the largest cause of unemployment. While job

leavers appear more likely to withdraw from the labor force than job losers,

the difference is not statistically significant. In interpreting the values

of Pexit for job losers and job leavers, it is important to recall that the

vast majority of those who leave the employment state do not pass through

the unemployment state. Hence, these figures greatly underestimate actual

labor force withdrawal amongst job enders. In toto, close to 80 percent

of job enders leave the labor force before getting a new job.

          In the top half of the table we have derived estimates of the

proportion of spells of unemployment which end in withdrawal for job

exiters and entrants. From the flows data presented in Table 1, it is

possible to calculate the proportion of spells which begin in each of

these ways. Combining this information, spells of unemployment may be

decomposed into four categories based on initial and final state. That

is, a spell may begin or end in state N, out of the labor force, and may

begin or end in state E, employment. The decomposition of spells is pre-

sented in the bottom half of Table 4. The results confirm the importance

of labor force transitions. Less than one-third of unemployment spells

result from job change. In the first set of estimates, the most common

type of unemployment spell does not either begin or end in employment.

Both sets indicate that more than two-thirds of all unemployment spells

begin or end outside of the labor force.

          This   section has documented the importance of labor force transi-

tions as a factor in determining unemployment. We have shown that the bulk

of unemployment is accounted for by those in the process of entering or

leaving the labor force. The welfare significance of this sort of unemploy-

ment depends critically on whether the withdrawals from and entries into

the labor force are "voluntary" or are forced by economic exigencies. While

the data are not available to fully answer this question, some information

may be gleaned from a consideration of the permanence of labor force with-

drawal. This issue is taken up in the next section.



                                   III


          This section examines the permanence of labor force withdrawal.

Evidence bearing on this question has already been discussed. In Section I,

estimates of the mean duration of labor force withdrawal for various demo-

graphic groups were presented. The estimates were surprisingly low, ranging

from 4.7 months for male teenagers, to 5-1/2 years for women over 60. Even

for males over the age of 60, the mean duration was only 2.8 years. This

average of course includes all of those who retire permanently. However,

mean durations may be deceptive, since the distribution of spell lengths

may be extremely assymetric. In order to deal with this possibility, this

section presents estimates of the proportion of those who leave the labor

force who return within a year.

          In deriving these estimates, we rely on the gross changes data

and unpublished BLS data on the number of people outside the labor force

who have worked within the past 12 months. If all of those who withdrew

remained outside the labor force for more than a year, the number outside
                                    - 19   -




the   labor force with recent experience should equal the total of the previous

12 monthly flows. To the extent that the flow out of the labor force exceeds

the number outside the labor force with recent experience, we can infer that

labor force re-entry has taken place. We define re-entry rates as:
                     —
           R. =           N*
                   1-                                               (15)
                              F1
                               ln
                        t=l

where N* is the total number of those outside the labor force who have been

in the labor force within the past 12 months, and F is the monthly flow

out of the labor force for the       demographic group.

           A data problem makes it necessary to calculate two rates.

Ideally one would want to compare the number with recent labor force

experience to the outflow. The data provide, however, only the number

with recent employment experience. Hence, the appropriate calculation is

unclear. Many of those with work experience within the preceding 12

months enter the N state following a spell of unemployment. Thus
                                                                   Fen
understates the extent of 1abor force withdrawal. On the other hand, some

of those who left unemployment by withdrawing from the labor force within

the past year did not work during the year, so Fen +     overstates the
                                                     Fun
                  12
appropriate flow.

           Before examining the re-entry rates presented in Table 5 it is

important to emphasize their meaning. We have estimated the proportion

of those who exited the labor force within the last 12 months who have

re-entered the labor force as of a given moment. This figure is certain

to underestimate the proportion of labor force exiters who return within

12 months. Many of those who left the labor force within the past 12

months, and who are now outside the labor force, will return within a

year from their date of labor force withdrawal. The calculations presented

here are thus very conservative estimates of the re—entry rate. Some indi-

cation of just how conservative may be garnered from the observation that

55 percent of those now out of the labor force who worked within the past

12 months intend to return to work within a year.

          Even the most conservative estimates found for Re-entry Rate I

are extremely high. For all demographic groups except women 20-24, almost

two-thirds of those who left the labor force within the past year have

returned. The more realistic but probably still conservative estimates of

Re-entry Rate II approach 80 percent. Even for males over 60, close to

70 percent of those who withdraw from the labor force appear to return

within a year.

          These estimates are borne out by the intentions of those out-

side the labor force. Unpublished data provided by BLS suggests that almost

45 percent of those out of the labor force who worked within the previous

year intend to return to work within a year.13 Since those most likely

to re-enter are least likely to be observed outside the labor force,

these figures are expected to greatly underestimate the actual re-entry

rate. The data do not make possible any direct separate calculation of

the rate of re-entrance for those who leave the labor force from unemploy-

ment. It seems reasonable to conjecture that the re-entry rate for those

leaving unemployment would be, if anything, greater than the re-entry

rate for those leaving employment. The BLS data indicate, for example,

that among discouraged workers, the proportion intending to return within

a year is almost twice that for the total NILF category. Furthermore,

regression of the probability of labor force entrance on the share of

recent exits from unemployment suggest that the re-entry rate is greater

for those who leave the labor force after being unemployed.

          In   sum, we are led to conclude that the great majority of those

who leave the labor force after being unemployed return within a year.

About 75 percent of those who left the labor force within the previous

year have returned as of any given moment, This estimate is too low

because it ignores all of those who will return within a year from their

time of withdrawal, but have not yet returned. tioreover, the available

evidence suggests that unemployed leavers are more likely to return than

other leavers. Correcting for these two biases conservatively suggests

to us that the true re-entry rate approaches 90 percent.

          The extremely high rates of labor force exit and entrance suggest

that the conventional view of those unemployed due to re-entrance may be

very misleading. Re-entrants are traditionally portrayed as people trying

to return to work after a long hiatus, or secondary workers with weak job

attachment looking for summer, part-time or temporary work.'4 The welfare

significance of this form of unemployment is therefore downgraded. Yet

it seems likely that many of the re-entrants have experienced only quite

brief spells outside the labor force. It may be more appropriate to view

this group as representing long-term unemployment rather than labor force

turnover or transition after a long absence. We examine this conjecture

in the next section.



                                    Iv

          In   this section we briefly examine re-entry unemployment to

determine whether re-entrants evince patterns of behavior consistent with

long-term unemployment. The data come from the Job Search supplement to

the May 1976 CPS. Unemployed respondents were asked questions about their
                                     - 23   -




job   search activity during the current spell of unemployment. The survey

provides a good deal of information about work intentions, work experience

and, for re-entrants, permits a rough calculation of the time spent out of

the labor force prior to re-entry.

           Table 6 presents data on the characteristics of re-entrants. In

line la we examine the importance of re-entry unemployment for different

demographic groups. In lines lb and lc the share of each demographic group

in re-entrant and total unemployment is presented. The data indicate that

those groups most likely to end a spell of unemployment by withdrawing

from the labor force -teenagers and adult women -   are an important source

of re-entry unemployment. Re-entry is much less important among prime-

aged men, where job losers make up 75.5 percent of the unemployed. A compari-

son of lines lb and lc suggests that, except for prime-aged males, the

demographic composition of re-entrant unemployment is very much like that

for total unemployment. Female teenagers, for example, account for 10.4

percent of all unemployment and comprise 10.5 percent of re-entrants.

Prime-aged women account for 23 percent of unemployment and 28 percent

of re-entrants. Males 20-24 comprise 13.1 percent of total unemployment

and 12.4 percent of re-entrants. We are led to conclude that women

and teenagers comprise a large share of re-entry unemployment because

they comprise a large share of the unemployed.

           While the demographic composition of re-entry unemployment is

consistent with the evidence on propensities to exit and enter presented

earlier, it is of importance to identify how long re-entrants have been

out of the labor force, and to determine the extent to which re-entrants

have weaker job attachment than the unemployed generally. These issues are

examined in lines 2-4. In line 2, we present a cumulative distribution

of   time between the last job and the beginning of the current spell of

unemployment. Because those currently unemployed may have experienced

more than one spell of unemployment, this measure overstates time spent

out of the labor force. Even with this conservative measure, we find that

25 percent of re-entrants have been out of the labor force less than three

months and that 62 percent return within a year of exit. Those returning

after an absence exceeding two years make up less than 18 percent of all

re-entrants.

           Similar patterns emerge across demographic groups. Except for

prime—age women, the proportion reporting time out of the labor force of less

than a year lies between 65 and 75 percent. Among prime-age males, for

example, 40 percent have been out less than three months, while 75 percent

have been out less than a year. Only 8.5 percent report being out of the

labor force longer than two years. The view of re-entry unemployment which

stresses long absence is of any importance only for prime-aged females

where only 38 percent report being out of the labor force less than a

year. Even in this group, however, close to two-thirds of the returnees

were out of the labor force less than two years.

           Return to the labor force within a year of exit seems to be the

dominant pattern of labor force transition among re-entrants. The evi-

dence suggests that the views of re-entry unemployment which stress return

after an extended absence fail to capture the central tendency in the

data. The extent to which re-entrance occurs because of weak job

attachment and frequent turnover is examined in lines 3 and 4. Whether

one looks at desire for full-time work or job instability, the general

thrust of the data is that re-entrants are not much different than those

unemployed for other reasons. The data on work intentions, for example,
                                  - 26


indicate that the majority of re—entrants are looking for permanent, full-

time jobs. Even among teenagers, fully 72 percent are seeking full-time

employment. Among prime-aged adults, the intentions of re-entrants are very

similar to those of job losers and leavers. A similar finding emerges

from the data on work experience prior to the current spell of unemployment.

          In line 4a we find that about 13.5 percent of re-entrants report

having had more than two jobs in the last two years, a proportion only

slightly greater than that found among those on layoff. If we make the

calculation after excluding those who have not worked within the last two years

and those who failed to answer the questions (line 4b), re-entrants are

found to have no more job instability than job losers or leavers. Indeed,

there is a surprising degree of uniformity across demographic groups and

among the unemployed as a whole. All groups report about 20 percent with

more than two jobs.

          Our brief examination of the work experience and work intentions

data suggests that on average, most re-entrants have as much job attach-

ment as people unemployed for other reasons. Most are not seeking-temporary

or part-time work, and of those who have worked within the last two years,

over 80 percent have held one or two jobs during that period. Measured

by number of jobs held, job instability is no less prevalent among job

losers and leavers. The evidence on time out of the labor force and the

findings in lines 3 and 4 suggest that re-entry after extended absence

and extensive movement between jobs are not dominant factors in determining

re-entry unemployment.

          Evidence in previous sections suggests that 70 percent of unemploy-

ment is accounted for by labor force transitions. We have found that labor

force exit is frequent and temporary, with very high rates of re-entry with-

in a year of withdrawal. An important implication of the analysis is that

true spells of unemployment are much longer than those estimated from

monthly data. The annual March Work Experience Survey provides an oppor-

tunity to corroborate this view of unemployment. If it is correct, and

time out of the labor force between spells of unemployment is actually

almost equivalent to time unemployed, then it seems reasonable that those

whose period of unemployment is broken by a short spell outside the labor

force will report retrospectively only one spell of unemployment. Thus,

the number and duration of spells reported in the work experience survey

ought to exceed those reported monthly. Emphasis on work experience also

leads us to focus on total weeks of unemployment per person rather than

weeks per spell.

          These issues are examined in Tables 7 and 8 using work experience

data from 1974 and 1976. In Table 7 we present a comparison of the total

number of spells of unemployment reported in the monthly CPS, and the

Annual Work Experience Survey. The data are presented in raw form in

line 1, and as a fraction of total labor force participants in line 2.

Examination of the column containing data for the total work force reveals

a much larger number of total spells in the monthly data. In 1976, for

example, the Work Experience Survey reports 24.5 percent fewer spells.

Much of the difference comes from teenagers, for whom labor force

Note: To insure comparability, the labor force estimate in line 2 was taken
       from the Work Experience Survey and was the same for both groups. Total
       spells from the Work Experience Survey were estimated from Table B—l2
       (1974) and C—i (1976) as follows: We first calculated total reported
       spells as the sum of number reportIitg one spell plus twice the number
       reporting two spells plus 3.5 times the number reporting 3 or more
       spells; those who were unemployed but did not work were given 1 spell.
       We then subtracted those spells begun in the previous year to get total
       spells. Total spells from the monthly data were estimated as nu  F + Feu
       from the gross flows data.

Note: Data in lines 1—2 are in weeks. Total weeks is calculated from Tables B—l2
       and B—20 of the 1976 WES and Tables C—l and D—1 of the 1974 WES, using
       midpoints of the unemployment weeks categories. In making the calculation
       we assumed the distribution of weeks of unemployment of 18—19 year olds
       without work experience, but with unemployment was equal to that for 18—24
       year olds. Total spells is calculated as the sum of the number of people
       with one spell, twice the number with two spells and 3.5 times the
       number with 3 or more spells; we assumed that those with unemployment,
       but without work, had one spell. In line 2 average duration =      + W41 —
                                                                                       (T         W)I
       (S —        where T =   total   weeks, S =   total     spells, J = number of people
      unemployed in December of year t—l who are still unemployed in January of t,
      W =     . DU, where DU average duration of unemployment in year t; for
      1976, we used DU76 to get W77. Total persons with unemployment in year t
      is taken from the same tables as total weeks and total spells. Lines 4 and
      5 were calculated from WES tables (B—l2, C—l).

transitions   are a particularly important source of unemployment. We also

find fewer spells reported retrospectively among adult women, while adult

men report more unemployment experiences in the March survey. The larger

number of spells for adult men may reflect the greater incidence of short

(1-3 week) spells of unemployment from temporary layoff among adult men

which are not picked up in the monthly data, but are reported in the Work

Experience Survey.

          It appears from Table 7 that time out of the labor force between

spells of unemployment is viewed in retrospect as time unemployed. The

evidence on number of spells thus suggests that estimates of duration

from the monthly data should be shorter than estimates from the March

survey. This issue is examined in Table 8. In line 1 we present estimates

of average duration adjusted for spells begun (completed) but not completed

(begun) in the year. Failure to adjust for incomplete spells biases

duration estimates downward. The adjustment used here involves excluding

weeks of unemployment associated with spells begun in the previous year,

and adding weeks of unemployment associated with spells completed in the

following year. The adjustment results in a moderate increase in estimates

of mean duration. The estimate for all unemployed in 1975 is 9.9 weeks, and

12.8 weeks in 1976. The adjustment has a similar effect in the disaggre-

gated demographic groups. These estimates are about 10-20 percent higher

than corresponding estimates from the monthly data.

         The discrepancy between estimates of average duration from the

Work Experience Survey and from monthly data provides furtherevidence that

many of.those who leave the labor force from unemployment think of them-

selves as being unemployed, even after withdrawal. The evidence implies
                                  — 31 -



that   job finding was more difficult than might be inferred from published

data from the monthly CPS. This observation is further substantiated in

line 2 where weeks of unemployment per person rather than per spell is

presented. These data provide a different picture of the burden of

unemployment than that provided by conventional estimates of weeks per

spell. In 1974, for example, adult males with unemployment in the year

experienced, on average, 13.3 weeks of unemployment. In 1976, weeks per

person jumped to 17.5 for adult males, and to 15.1 for adult women.

           The relatively large number of weeks per person estimated in line

2 might be due to a concentration of unemployment among a relatively small

group. The concentration of unemployment is examined in lines 3 and 4 of

the table. We present the proportion of those with work experience and

of total unemployment accounted for by persons with 26 or more weeks of

unemployment. Among men 20 and over, for example, only 3.0 percent experi-

enced more than 26 weeks of unemployment in 1976, but this relatively

small group accounted for 52.1 percent of total unemployment. A similar

pattern emerges in other demographic groups. In aggregate, 3.9 percent of

those working or looking for work experienced more than 26 weeks of unemploy-

ment, and accounted for 50.4 percent of total unemployment. Even this estim-

ate understates the true extent of chronic joblessness because it ignores

those who withdraw from the labor force.

           The results presented in this paper challenge what has in recent

years become the conventional wisdom regarding unemployment. They suggest

that analyses focusing on the brevity of typical spells of unemployment and

high turnover among the unemployed obscure more than they reveal. Iluch of
                                 - 32   -




what appears to be turnover among the unemployed represents labor force

withdrawal. Short durations may not indicate the easy availability of jobs,

but rather workers' decision to abandon search quickly. Our results

suggest that traditional estimates of the length of a completed spell

understate by close to 100 percent, the duration of a spell for a worker

who is unwilling to leave the labor force. Moreover, many of those who

withdraw from the labor force are in situations effectively equivalent

to those of unemployed persons. They appear to be sensitive to available

job opportunities, and to return to work within a few months after leaving

the labor force. The spells of actual as opposed to measured unemployment

are thus even longer for this group than for those who return to work

directly from unemployment. Indeed, the probability that a labor force

entrant will find a job within the first month of unemployment, far exceeds

(by almost 300 percent) the likelihood of an unemployed person's finding

a job within a month. Among the small portion of labor force entrants who

do not find a job before the next monthly survey, our evidence suggests

that the vast majority have had recent work experience. The common depic-

tion of re-entrants as comprised largely of teenagers, and those returning

after long hiatus from work is not true.

         We interpret this evidence as indicating that the welfare signi-

ficance of unemployment has been greatly underestimated. Attractive jobs

are not nearly as available as the short duration of unemployment has

suggested. Retrospective evidence indicates that much of unemployment

is experienced by those with long-term spells. Further, the data indicate

the existence of a substantial number of hidden unemployed, who are counted

as not in the labor force despite having recent work experience and
                                 - 33   -




 imminent plans to return to work. Conventional dismissals of re-entrant

unemployment as frictional also seem to be inappropriate. Re-entrants

are in fact frequently completing rather long spells of actual unemployment

even though their measured spells are quite brief. Hence, they may be

amongst the more serious unemployment problem.

          There is another possible interpretation of our results. High

flows into and out of the labor force might reflect the movements of a rela-

tively small number of workers with little work attachment. Movements out

of the labor force may be voluntary, and not result from inability to find

employment. While we do not doubt that some of the large observed flows

do represent this phenomenon, it seems unlikely that it can account for most

of it. The proportion of workers who leave the labor force rises with the

length of unemployment. This is consistent with the view that many of those

who withdraw do so because of discouragement. It is hard to understand why

a person with very weak job attachment would plan to search for several

months and then to leave the labor force.

          Moreover, the vast majority of discouraged workers appear to have

been recent labor force exiters, with plans to return soon. In 1974, about

39.4 percent of the discouraged workers had left the labor force within the

past year. Of those, over 88 percent intended to return within a year.

Most left the labor force for economic reasons. The total of discouraged

workers equals about one month's flow from unemployment out of the labor

force, providing direct evidence that many of the withdrawals are due to

discouragement.

          Future research is necessary to provide more precise estimates

of the magnitude of the phenomena discussed in this paper. More important,

the results suggest that attention must be devoted to the development of
                                  - 34   -




theories   explaining labor force transitions. The option of abandoning search

is not incorporated in usual mødels of search unemployment. Likewise, the

timing of decisions to enter the labor force which accounts for the vast

majority of new employment is not well understood. The development of

such theories will be greatly aided by newly available monthly longitudinal

data on the unemployed.

    Economic Reports of the President.

2. Modern work with the gross flows data has been pioneered by the Urban
    Institute. Examples of recent research include Toikka (1976), Smith
    (1977), and Toikka, Scan].on and Holt (1977). See also papers by
    Marston (1976) and Hall (1972). There are several limitations of the
    gross flows data, summarized in Hilaski (1968). First is the set of
    consequences of mismeasurement. Errors in measurement will lead to
    systematic overestimates of labor force flows. Second, data on gross
    changes are not available for those in their, first or fifth month in
    the sample. Since there are systematic differences in reporting
    between rotation groups, the changes data do not correspond to the
    stock data. The Urban Institute has developed a regression procedure
    for adjusting the changes data to make it consistent with the pub-
    lished stock data. This study uses the flows data as adjusted by
    them. Researchers there report tht the adjustments are typically not
    large enough to affect substantive conclusions. A detailed discussion
    of the adjustment procedure may be found in Vanski (1975).

3. The magnitude of the monthly flows is well known, and has been docu-
    mented in several places. See, for example, Smith (1972). Other
    references which have noted the importance of labor force transitions
    include Perry (1972), Hall (1972) and Marston (1976).

4. This identity may be verified quite easily. Let g.(s) be the density
    function, for the lengths of completed spells of    state i. Then the
    mean duration of a completed spell D. may be represented as:


        D.      Z sg(s)                                         (A)
               s0
   If we allow l-G(s) to represent the cumulative density of completed
   spells, then (6) implies that:


        D.          G(s)                                        (B)
         1
               s0
   If we let the flow into state i in each period be represented by
   the definition of G(s) implies that:                             F,

        S. = F.        G(s)                                     (C)
              1
                  s0
   Since the steady state assumption implies that the number of entrants
   into state i must equal the number who exit, it follows from the
   definition of P.. that:
                  11
                                   - 36   -




           (1-P.11.)S. = F.                                          (D)
                    1     1

      Substituting equations (C) and (D) into (B) yields the desired result.
      It should be emphasized that nothing was assumed in this derivation
      about either duration dependence or heterogeneity. The result here
      holds for any density g(s) of completed spell lengths. The result
      found here closely parallels the well-known renewal theorem. The
      result here depends critically on the steady state assumption. Since
      this analysis relies on annual average probabilities, any deviation
      from a steady state is likely to be small. This conclusion was con-
      firmed by a procedure described below which does not rely on steady
      state assumptions.

5. All of the estimates of the duration of unemployment presented here
    are potentially subject to an important upward bias. Individuals are
    observed only monthly. Hence, many short spells of unemployment fall
    between observations and are missed. In order to estimate the magni-
    tude of this bias we used unpublished estimates of the weekly flow
    into unemployment to calculate duration. The results are not signi-
    ficantly different from those presented here. This may be the result
    of large reporting errors for short spells of unemployment which bias
    upwards the estimates from weekly data.

 6. A thorough discussion of these issues is contained in Salant (1977).

 7. This figure matches almost exactly the average proportion of exiters
     as calculated from the changes data.

 8. See, Rao (1965) and Swamy (1970), for a discussion of models in which
     the coefficients are random.

 9. The equation was estimated using ordinary least squares. Equation (19)
     suggests that if the v. do not have equal variances, correction for
     heteroscedasticity would be appropriate. We tested for heteroscedasticity
     by regressing the residuals on the S. The null hypothesis of no
     heteroscedasticity was easily accepted.   The results are available
     on request from the authors.

10. The calculation was performed at the average value of U and the S1.
     The results suggest that the patterns noted here do not vary
     greatly over the cycle.

11. These are calculated from the variances and covariances of the coeffi-
     cients of s. and s.U. The standard error is evaluated at the mean.

      of those who became unemployed during a 12-month period have work
      experience during the period.
