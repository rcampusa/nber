                Torts in Which Victim and Injurer
                        Act Sequentially

                             ABSTRACT

     The effect of liability rules on accident avoidance is
studied in two types of situations in which potential
victims and potential injurers act sequentially: those
where victims act first and injurers second; and those where
the reverse is true. What is of special interest about the
working of liability rules in such sequential situations is
that the party who acts second behaves in response to the
party who acts first, and that the party who acts first
takes this into account. The major result shown is that
liability rules induce optimal behavior provided that they
lead the party who acts second to act optimally if and only
if the first party did so. In an important extension of the
basic model considered, however, this result may not hold.

I.     Introduction

      This article will study the effect of liability rules
on accident avoidance in situations where potential victims

and potential injurers act sequentiaiiyJ Two types of
these sequential situations are possible: those where
victims act first and injurers2 second; and those where the
reverse is true. The cases of Davies v. Mann3 and Topping

v. Oshawa Railway,4 for instance, provide illustrations of
both types of situations, as in the former case the victim
Davies left his donkey fettered on a road and Mann later
came along the road and ran the animal down; while in the
latter case a truck halted on streetcar tracks and then the
"victim" streetcar traveling down the tracks failed to avoid
a collision that resulted in injury to its passengers.
Other examples of situations where the victim and the injurer

acted sequentially are easily adduced;5'6 on reflection,
such situations do not seem to be at all infrequent.

      In the analysis below of sequential situations, a simple
model of accidents will be considered.7 In this model,
parties are assumed to have full knowledge of accident
                              2



risks and to take the actions that are in their financial
self-interest given the applicable liability rule. Four
liability rules are studied: the negligence rule with the

defense of contributory negligence; this rule without the
defense; the comparative negligence rule; and strict liability
with a defense of contributory negligence.
     What will be of special interest about the working of
liability rules in the model is two-fold--that the party who

acts second behaves in response to the party who acts first,
and that the party who acts first will take the response of

the party who acts second into account.8
     This can be illustrated, and the main points of the
article indicated, by a brief discussion of Davies. The
decision in the case was that despite Davies' contributory
negligence in leaving his donkey on the road, he should

succeed in his action for negligence against Mann because,
in now familiar terms, Mann had the "last clear chance" to

prevent harm yet did not try to do so. Use of this doctrine
to defeat a defense of contributory negligence is often
noted to have two opposing effects on accident avoidance:
parties like Mann will be induced to avoid running down

fettered animals;9 but because parties like Davies would be
expected to anticipate such behavior, they will not be
properly motivated to fetter their animals safely in the
first place)0 The suggestion, therefore, is that the
relative strengths of these two opposing effects will determine
                              3



whether it is desirable to make the defense of contributory

negligence unavailable.

     In the model, however, availability of the defense of
contributory negligence in cases where the victim acts first
is generally desirable. To see why, notice that given
the availability of the defense, victims like Davies would
realize that if they acted in a contributorily negligent way

and exposed their animals to risk, injurers like Mann would
not fear liability for negligence and would therefore have
no motive to avoid running the animals down. In conse-
quence, victims like Davies would find it best to take

appropriate care; and given their non-negligent behavior,
injurers like Mann would be liable for harm negligently done
and would therefore have a motive not to run down such
animals as were still exposed to risk. In other words, both
victims and injurers would be induced to act appropriately
if a defense of contributory negligence were available.

(The more general point is that optimal behavior will result
under a liability rule provided that it leads the second
party to take care if and only if the first party took
care.)
     Yet it is plain that the argument leading to this
conclusion could not necessarily be made if for some reason
such as failure to perceive risk certain victims might not
take care whatever the liability rule. Specifically, availabil-

ity of the defense of contributory negligence might then
induce certain injurers too not to take care; for whenever
                                4



victims would not take care, injurers would decide not to
take care. Thus, availability of the defense of contributory
negligence might turn out to be undesirable. (The more
general point here is that a liability rule which induces
the second party to take care regardless of whether the
first party took care might turn out to be desirable.) This
possibility is briefly examined in an extension of the

model.

     Before proceeding, it should be remarked that although
the analysis in the next section will be informal and will

rely primarily on numerical examples, the claims made will

be proved in general in the subsequent section.11


II. Informal Analysis of the Model


A.   Description of the model
     As Figure 1 shows, in one case of the model, the victim
first decIdes whether to take care so as to reduce the

likelihood of occurrence of a dangerous condition; and if
such a condition arises, the injurer then decides whether to
take care in order to reduce the risk of an accident)2

(The case of the model where the injurer acts first is
analogous and will not be separately described.)
     The victim will take care if the cost of doing so plus

the probability-discounted or "expected" losses13 he would
then bear is less than the expected losses he would bear If
he does not take care. To make this comparison, the victim
must determine whether, given the liability rule, the
                                     L4,

injurer will take care if a dangerous condition arises, for
this would affect the likelihood of loss and, possibly,
liability for loss.
      The injurer will take care when a dangerous condition

arises if his cost of care plus his expected liability given
the liability rule is less than his expected liability if he

does not take care. In making this decision, the injurer is
assumed to be aware of whether or not the victim took care)-4


B.     Ideal solution to the accident problem
       It will be assumed that the ideal solution to the
accident problem is to minimize total costs, that is, to
minimize the expected sum of accident losses and the victim's
and injurer's costs of care. The actions of the victim and
of the injurer that minimize total costs will be referred to
as   "optimal."
       Let us now   consider the determination of the parties'

optimal actions using as an example the situation shown in
Table i) In doing this it will be convenient to refer also
to the derived Table 2, the first row which is explained as

follows. Since both parties take care, .10 is the probability
of a dangerous condition, 0 is the probability of an accident,
given occurrence of a dangerous condition, .10 x 0 = 0 is
the likelihood of an accident, and 0 x 1000 = 0 are expected
losses; the victim's cost of care is 10 and the injurer's

expected cost of care is .10 x 200 = 20 (the injurer takes
care only when a dangerous condition arises), so the sum of

their expected costs of care is 30; hence expected total

costs are 30. The other rows are explained similarly.
     Given the tabulation of expected total costs in Table 2,
we can see that what minimizes these costs is for both the
victim and the injurer to take care.'6 To understand why
this should be so, observe first that it is best for the

injurer to take care if a dangerous condition arises, since
the cost of care of 200 is less than the associated reduction
in expected accident costs given occurrence of the dangerous
condition of .50 x 1000 = 500.       And to see why it is best
for the victim to take care, notice that the cost of creating

a dangerous condition given that the injurer responds optimally
by taking care is the injurer's cost of care, namely, 200.
Hence, by taking care and incurring a cost of 10, the victim
reduces the injurer's expected costs of care from .20 x 200
= 40 to .10 x 200 = 20, and thus lowers expected total costs

by 20.
     This numerical example may also be used to illustrate
the case where injurers act first, by reversing the roles of
injurer and of victim (so the victim's cost of care if a

dangerous condition arises becomes 200, etc.).


C.   Solution to the accident problem under liability rules
1.   case where victims act first
     Let us now determine how the victim and the injurer
will act under the various liability rules. This will be
done using the numerical example that was just discussed.
                                7



     First, let us consider the negligence rule with a

defense of contributory negligence. According to this rule,
the injurer is liable for losses if and only if he failed to
take care (i.e., was negligent) and the victim took care
(i.e., was not negligent). We wish to demonstrate that

under this rule an optimal outcome will result; both the
victim and the injurer will take care. To do this, observe
that if the victim does not take care, then the injurer will
escape liability for an accident whether or not he takes

care, so he will clearly decide against taking care if a
dangerous condition arises. However, if the victim takes
care, then if a dangerous condition arises and the injurer
fails to take care, he will face expected liability of .50 x
1000 = 500.   Thus, as the cost of care to him is only 200,

the injurer will choose to escape liability by taking care.
     With this in mind, the victim's decision may be determined.
If the victim does not take care, he will bear his losses,
and since he knows that the injurer will not take care if a
dangerous condition arises, the victim's expected losses
will be .20 x .50 x 1000 = 100.     But since the injurer will

take care if the victim takes care, his costs will be only
his costs of care, 10. Hence the victim will take care,

which completes the argument.
     The reasoning used in this demonstration, it should be
noted, was indeed that indicated in the introduction.
Namely, the victim is induced to take care for fear of the
losses he would bear if he were negligent-â€”since then the
                                    8



injurer would not take care; and as the victim decides to

take care, the injurer will in fact be induced to take care
if a dangerous condition arises.
           Let us next consider the negligence rule without a

defense of contributory negligence. Under this rule, according
to which the injurer is liable if and only if he failed to
take care, an optimal outcome will not occur; the victim
will not take care, although the injurer will take care if a
dangerous condition arises.17'18 To show this, note that if
a dangerous condition arises and the injurer does not take
care, he will be liable for losses, independent of whether
the victim took care. Accordingly, the injurer's expected
liability will be .50 x 1000 = 500.       As this exceeds his
cost of care of 200, the injurer will decide to take care.
           With regard to the victim's situation, observe that he
knows by the above reasoning that the injurer will take care
if a dangerous condition arises and thus that the possibility
of an accident will be eliminated. Hence the victim will
have no reason to incur costs of care of 10 and will not do
      19
so.

       The victim's negligence may be explained slightly
differently by noting the difference between his private
problem--minimizing his own costs under the liability rule--
and his problem from the social viewpoint--minimizing expected
total costs. From the victim's private perspective, the
occurrence of dangerous conditions is costless and thus need
not be prevented, whereas from the social perspective they
                                  9




are costly,   as   they result in the injurer's exercise of

care, and hence should be prevented.20
     Let us now summarize the situation in respect to the

other two liability rules. According to the comparative
negligence rule the injurer pays full damages for losses if
he alone failed to take care, but pays only a fraction f of
damages if the victim too did not take care. Under this
rule an optimal outcome may not result. The reason is that

if f is not small, the injurer might find it worthwhile to
take care if a dangerous condition arises whether or not the
victim took care. And if this is the case, then the victim

might decide not to take care.21
     Finally, under strict liability with a defense of
contributory negligence, the injurer is liable unless the

victim did not take care. Under this rule an optimal outcome
will occur, and for essentially the reasons applying under
the negligence rule with a defense of contributory negligence.
In particular, the victim will take care, since if he
did not, the injurer would fail to take care; and as the
victim takes care, the injurer is also motivated to take
care if a dangerous condition arises so as to avoid liability.22


     In conclusion, let us state what may be taken to be the
general principle underlying the results that have been

presented: a liability rule results in optimal behavior
provided that it induces the party who acts second to take
care when a dangerous condition arises if and only if the
                                 10



first party took care; for this will induce the first and,
therefore, the second party to take care.


2. case where injurers act first
     Here it will be seen that although the conclusions

about the liability rules are different, they are neverthe-
less consistent with the general principle just mentioned.
     Consider for instance the first result to be shown,

that under the negligence rule without the defense of contributory

negligence, an optimal outcome will result. This result is
indeed consistent with the general principle, for not allowing
the defense of contributory negligence will mean that the
victim--now the party who acts second--will take care if and
only if the injurer took care.

     Let us demonstrate the result using the numerical

example (with the roles of injurer and of victim reversed).
To do this, consider first the victim's position when a

dangerous condition arises. If the injurer took care, then
if the victim fails to take care, he will bear his own
expected losses of .50 x 1000 = 500, whereas if he takes

care, he bears only his costs of care of 200. Thus, the
victim will take care. On the other hand, if the injurer
did not take care, then the victim will.have no motive to
take care, there being no defense of contributory negligence
available to the injurer. In consequence, the injurer (and
thus the victim) will choose to take care: if the injurer
does not take care, his expected liability will be .20 x .50
                                11



x 1000 = 100 since the victim will not take care; and if the
injurer does take care, he will not be liable and thus bear

only his costs of care of 10.
     Let us now briefly explain the conclusions about the
other liability rules. Under the negligence rule with a
defense of contributory negligence, an optimal outcome will
not result. This is true because, when dangerous conditions
arise, victims will always be induced to take care so as to

avoid bearing losses. And since the injurer knows this to
be true, he will find it worthwhile not to take care.23

     For similar reasons, under the comparative negligence
rule, an optimal outcome might not be achieved; and under
strict liability with a defense of contributory negligence,
an optimal outcome will not be achieved.



D.   An Extension of the Model
     We now wish to consider a modification of the model
towards greater realism. As indicated in the introduction,
this may reverse the general conclusion of the last subsection

that it is best to employ liability rules which give the
party who acts second a motive to take care if and only if

the first party exercised care.
     The modification concerns the possibility that the

party who acts first might be "inevitably" negligent--fail
to take care regardless of the liability rule--because he
overlooks the risk of an accident. It will be sufficient
for us to examine the possibility of such inevitable negligence
                              12



only in the case where the victim acts first and only in
relation to the negligence rule (our analysis will carry
over in an- obvious way to the other case and in relation to

the other liability rules).
     To understand the importance of possible inevitable
negligence in this case, recall that the advantage in the
basic model of allowing the defense of contributory negli-
gence was to give victims a motive to take care.   If, however,
a number of victims will inevitably act negligently, then in
respect to affecting the behavior of these victims, allowing

the defense of contributory negligence will by assumption
fail to secure an advantage. Moreover, because these victims
will act negligently, allowing the defense will lead injurers
to fail to take care (a problem which, note, did not exist
in the basic model simply because there were no negligent
victims). Therefore, it may turn out to be desirable not to
allow the defense of contributory negligence.24
     To illustrate this, let us reexamine the numerical

example assuming, say, .2 of victims mistakenly ignore all
chance of loss and thus will fail to take care whatever the
liability rule. Then, from Table 3 and Table 2 it can be
seen that if there is a defense of contributory negligence,
the total expected costs will be .2 x 100 + .8 x 30 = 44
(taking the average over situations involving both types of
victim); and from Table 4 and Table 2 it is clear that these
costs will be 40 if there is not a defense. Hence, it is
better that there not be a defense of contributory negligence.25

 Notice, as expected, that the figures show that the result
 came about because when victims ignore the risk, the defense

 of contributory negligence results in higher costs (100)
than does absence of the defense (40).

     Finally, let us remark that this example did not allow
for the possibility that injurers too might inevitably act
negligently, a possibility which would lead to a qualifica-
tion of the point of the present subsection. The main
reason for the qualification is of course that the advantage
of not employing the defense of contributory negligence--inducing
injurers to take care when victims have not--can hardly be

enjoyed when injurers will inevitably act negligently.26
But the qualification will not be very important if the

probability of inevitable negligence on the part of injurers
is much less than it is on the part of victims. And this

might be thought the case, for the nature of the situation
facing the party who acts second is typically such that the
danger is obvious and thus not likely to be overlooked,

whereas the situation facing the party who acts first is
often such that the danger is not clear or is remote.


III. Formal Analysis of the Model27


A.   Description of the model
     As the model has been discussed informally, we can be
brief here. There are two types of risk-neutral parties,
victims and injurers. In one of the cases that is examined,
                                  14



the victim first decides whether to take care; if a dangerous

condition then arises, the injurer decides whether to take
care, and an accident either occurs or fails to occur. (See
Figure 1.) In the other case, the injurer acts before the
victim. In each case, the first-best or expected total cost
minimizing levels of care of the parties are determined; and
the effects of liability rules on parties' behavior are also
determined, assuming that the party who acts second can
observe whether the first party took care.


A.   Case where victims act first
     Define the following notation.
     x = cost    of care for a victim; x>O;
        =   probability   of a dangerous condition if victim
            takes care;

     p probability of a dangerous condition if victim
          does not take care; p >     0;
                                       PC
     y = cost    of care for an injurer; y>0;

        -
        â€”   probability   of an accident given that there is a
            dangerous condition if the injurer takes Care;
     q = probability    of an accident given that there is a
            dangerous condition if the injurer does not take
            care; q>qO.
     Â£ = loss    if an accident occurs; 2 >   0.
The variables x, y, and Â£ are assumed to be monetary. The
measure of social welfare is (the negative of) expected

total costs--the expected costs of care plus expected accident

losses. Thus, if both parties take care, total costs are
     (1) x +        + fl;
                             15



if the victim alone takes care, total costs are

     (2) X   + P'a;
if the injurer alone takes care, total costs are

     (3)

and if neither party takes care, total costs are

     (4)

We will be interested mainly in the situation where it is
strictly optimal for both parties to take care (i.e., where

(1) is the unique minimum among (l)-(4)) but we will also
consider the situations where it is strictly optimal for the

injurer alone to take care (where (3) is the unique minimum)
and where it is strictly optimal for the victim alone to

take care (where (2) is the unique minimum). (Henceforth,
by "optimal", we shall mean strictly optimal.)
     Let us now define the liability rules using (as is
customary) so called due care levels for victims and for
injurers. specifically, define the rules as follows.       Under

the negligence rule with the defense of contributory negligence,

an injurer is liable for loss if and only if he took less
than due care and the victim took at least due care. Under
the negligence rule without the defense of contributory
negligence, an injurer is liable for loss if and only if he

took less than due care. Under the comparative negligence
rule, an injurer is liable for (the entire) loss if and only
if he took less than due care and the victim took at least

due care; and an injurer is partially liable--for a fraction
f where O<f<1 of loss--if and only if both he    and   the victim
                                  16



took less than due care. (This is the only rule under which

the injurer is partially liable.) And, under strict liability
with a defense of contributory negligence, an injurer is
liable for loss if and only if the victim took at least due
care.

        Let us now assume that it is optimal for victims and
for injurers to take care and that what constitutes due care
for each is to take care. We then have


Proposition 1. Under the negligence rule with a defense of
contributory negligence, an optimal outcome will be achieved;
both the victim and the injurer will take care.
Proof: If the victim does not take care and a dangerous
condition arises, the injurer will not take care because he
will never be liable. Thus the victim's expected cost will

be pq2.
      If the victim does take care and a dangerous condition
arises, the injurer will take care in order to avoid liability:
if the injurer takes care, his costs will be y; if he does
not, they will be q; and since it is optimal for both to
take care, we know in particular that x +
                                             p(y+q2)   <   x   +

         which implies that y +        q,   which implies that
          As the injurer will take care, the victim's expected
costs will be x+pq.
      Thus the victim will decide to take care: since it is
optimal for both to take care, we know in particular that x
+
    P(Y+.)    <        so certainly x +       <
                               17



This completes the demonstration, since we showed that if

the victim takes care, so will the injurer should a danger-
ous condition arise. QE.D.


Proposition 2. Under the negligence rule without the defense
of contributory negligence, an optimal result may not be
achieved; the victim might fail to take care although the
injurer will take care if a dangerous condition arises.28
Proof: If the victim does not take care and a dangerous
condition arises, then the injurer will take care and avoid
liability: if the injurer takes care, his costs will be y;
if he does not, they will be q; but y <        (as was shown

in the proof to Proposition 1). Thus the victim's expected
costs will be
     If the victim does take care and a dangerous condition
arises, the injurer will by the same logic take care so as
to avoid liability. Hence the victim's expected costs will
be
     It is possible that x +        > pq   even though x +

          minimizes total costs; this was true in the numerical
p(y+q2)
example of the previous section, and, indeed, will always be
true if         Thus, the victim might not take care, although
the injurer will do so if a dangerous condition arises.

Q.E.D.



Proposition 3. Under the comparative negligence rule, an
optimal result may not be achieved; the victim alone or
                               18



 the victim and the injurer both may fail to take care,

 although the injurer alone will never fail to take care if a
dangerous condition arises.

Proof: The numerical example of the last section with f.5
is such that the injurer will take care but the victim will
not. (See in particular note 21 supra).

     An example where neither party takes care is the following:

x35; 2; câ€¢1 y190; q.4;                    lOOO; f.4. To
verify this, note that if the victim does not take care, the
injurer will not (for 190>(.4)(.4)(l000)), so the victim's
expected costs will be (.2)(.4)(600)=48. And if the victim
does take care, the injurer will as well (for l90<(.4)(1000)),
so that the victim's expected costs will be 35+(.1)(.2)(l000)=55,
which exceeds 48.

     Finally, if the victim takes care, so will the injurer,
since y<q. (as was shown in the proof to Proposition 1).
Q.E.D.



Proposition 4. Under strict liability with a defense of
contributory negligence, an optimal outcome will be achieved;
both the victim and the injurer will take care.

Proof. If the victim does not take care and a dangerous
condition arises, the injurer will not take care since he
will not be liable. Hence the victim's expected costs will
be

     If the victim does take care and a dangerous condition

arises, the injurer will take care; since he will be liable
                              19



for losses, his costs will be y+q. if he takes care and

if not; but y+q1 <       (as was shown in the proof to Proposition 1).
Hence the victim?s costs will be x.
     Since it is optimal for both the injurer and the victim
to take care, we know that x +   p(y+q94   <
                                               pq;   thus

certainly x <         Hence the victim will take care, and

if a dangerous condition arises, so will the injurer.

Q.E.D.
     Let us now briefly consider the situation where it is
optimal for only one of the parties to take care. If it is
optimal for the injurer alone to take care, let us assume
that what constitutes due care for him is to take care, but
that due care for the victim is zero. Hence both versions
of the negligence rule and the comparative negligence rule
will all be identical: the injurer will be liable for
losses if and only if he fails to take care. Also, under
the strict liability rule with the defense of contributory

negligence, the injurer will always be liable. Similarly,
if it is optimal for the victim alone to take care and we

assume that due care levels reflect this, then all versions
of the negligence rule will be identical--the victim will
always be liable. With this in mind let us state


Remark 5.   In the situations where it is optimal for the
injurer alone to take care or for the victim alone to take

care, an optimal outcome will result under any of the liability

rules.
                                    20



 Proof: Consider first the situation where it is optimal for
 injurers alone to take care. Then under (any of the three
versions of) the negligence rule, if a dangerous condition
arises, the injurer will avoid liability and take care:
since P(Y+fl minimizes total costs, P(YÃ·q2) <                    so
                                                         p1g2
that y<q2. Thus, if the victim does not take care, his
expected costs will be P2; if he does take care, they
will be x +
               Pa;     and since Pn(Y+%2) < x   +
                                                    P(Y+fl   and
>
    c'   we have        <
                            x+pq.    Hence the victim will not
take care.

         Under strict liability with the defense of contributory
negligence, as the injurer will always be liable, he will
take care if a dangerous condition arises: since we know
that P(Y+) <        pq       we have y+q2 <
the victim will not take care.
                                              q2.   And, clearly,


     Now consider the situation where it is optimal for the
victim alone to take care. Then under (any of the three
versions of) the negligence rule, the injurer will never be
liable and so will not take care. Hence, if the victim does
not take care, his expected costs will be pq; if he does,
they will be x+pq.; but the latter is less than the former
since x+pg2 minimizes total costs.
     Under strict liability with the defense of contributory
negligence, if the victim fails to take care, he will be
liable, so the injurer will not take care. Hence the victim's
expected costs will be              If the victim takes care,
then the injurer will be liable, so the victim's expected
                                 21



costs will be x. And as we know that x+pq. minimizes
total costs,          <          so x <
                                          pqâ€¢   Thus the victim
will take care. But the injurer will not do so if a dangerous
condition arises: since x+pq2 minimizes total costs,

X+PC%2 <   x+p(y+qfl#     implying that g11 <          Q.E.D.



B.   Case where injurers act first
     In this case the notation will be defined as in the
last case, but the formulas for total costs will be different:
If both parties take care, then total costs are

     (5) y +
if the injurer alone takes care, they are
     (6) y +   qp2;
if the victim alone takes care, they are

     (7)

and if neither party takes care they are

     (8)

Let us now consider the liability rules assuming that it is
optimal for injurers and for victims to take care and that
what constitutes due care for each is the exercise of care.

(Since the proofs are analogous to those of Propositions 1-4
and Remark 5, we will supply as a pattern for the reader the

proof to the next Proposition only).


Proposition 6. Under the negligence rule with a defense of

contributory negligence, an optimal outcome may not be
achieved; the injurer might fail to take care although the
victim will take care if a dangerous condition arises.
                                22



Proof: If the injurer does not take care and a dangerous
condition arises, then the victim will take care to avoid

bearing his losses: if the victim takes care, his costs
will be x; if he does not, they will be P; and since it is
optimal for both parties to take care, we know that y +

            <y   +      implying that x +        p,     so that

x <
      p1.   Thus the injurer's expected costs will be
      If the injurer does take care and a dangerous condition
arises, then the victim will again take care: if he takes
care, his expected costs will be x+p2; if he does not, they
will be        and as shown above, x+p < p12.    The injurer's

costs in this case will be y.
      It is possible that y >        even though y +   q(x+p2)
minimizes total costs; indeed, y >          will necessarily be

true if
      Hence, we have shown that the injurer might not take
care but that the victim will if a dangerous condition

arises. Q.E.D.
      (The proof was analogous to that of Proposition 2).


Proposition 7. Under the negligence rule without a defense
of contributory negligence, an optimal outcome will be
achieved; both the injurer and the victim will take care.

      (The proof is analogous to that of Proposition 1).


Proposition 8. Under the comparative negligence rule, an
optimal result may not be achieved; the injurer alone or the
                                23



injurer and the victim both may not take care, although the
victim will do so if the injurer takes care and a dangerous
condition arises.
     (The proof is analogous to that of Proposition 3).


Proposition 9. Under strict liability with a defense of

contributory   negligence, an optimal outcome may not be
achieved; the injurer may fail to take care, although the
victim   will do so if a dangerous condition arises.
     (The proof is similar to that of Proposition 2).


Remark 10. In the situations where it is optimal for the
injurer alone or for the victim alone to take care, an
optimal outcome will result under any of the liability

rules.

     (The proof is analogous to that of Remark 5).



C.   Extension of the model
     As explained in Section II, the extension of the model

to be considered concerns the possibility that parties would
ignore the risk of an accident. It will suffice to examine
the effect of overlooking risk in only one case; this case
will supply the necessary insight for analysis of the other
cases, which would be tedious. The case of interest is that

where victims act first; where it is optimal for both parties
to take care; and where in the absence of ignorance of risk,

the negligence rule with the defense of contributory negligence
                                    24



 would be superior to the negligence rule without the defense,
 because under the latter rule victims would fail to take

 care (see Propositions 1 and 2). We wish now to determine
 which of these two rules is superior as a function of a and
 ,   where
      a       fraction of victims who ignore risk, believing it
              to be zero; 0    a    1;

          =   fraction   of injurers who ignore risk, believing it
              to be zero; 0        1.

We will assume that the events that a victim ignores risk
and that an injurer who finds a victim in a dangerous situation
ignores risk are probabilistically independent.

      Let us observe first that Tables 5 and 6 below describe
the behavior of parties under the two rules, and independent
of the values of a and 3. Let us explain several of the

entries in Table 5, leaving the verification of the remainder
of the entries in the tables to the reader. As a party who

thinks the risk of a dangerous condition or an accident is
zero will not take care, many of the entries in the tables

are immediately explained. Thus, the first row of Table 5
is explained, as is the first entry in the second row of

Table 5. The second entry in the second row is then clear:
as the victim does not take care, he will bear his losses,
so the injurer will not take care.

      The first entries in the third and fourth rows of Table

5 are explained as follows: If a victim takes care and a
dangerous condition arises, then the injurer will not take

care (and will bear liability) if he ignores the risk, but
he will take care if he perceives it (as was demonstrated in

the proof to Proposition 1). Hence the victim's expected
position will be x +                           On the other hand, if the

victim does not take care and a dangerous condition arises,
then the injurer will not take care if he correctly perceives

the risk (as was shown in the proof to Proposition 1) or if
he ignores it. Hence the victim's expected position will be
pqâ€¢ But x + p(l_13)q<x             Ã·                          so that the

victim will take care.
     Using the tables, we may write the formulas for expected
total costs. Under the negligence rule with the defense of
contributory negligence, the expected total costs are

     (9) aPP2 +        a(l-)pq2            +
                                               (l_ci)(x+pq2)      +

          (lâ€”x)(l- )(x+p(Y+q2))                =                              +

                               +
          (l_cY)(lâ€”)pg)            (l_a)x+(lâ€”a)(lâ€”I3)py.
Under the negligence rule without the defense, expected
total costs are

     (10) cpq2 +       c(l_)p(y+q2)                Ã· (lâ€”a)pq2 +
                                       =                              +
          (l_a)(l_)p(y+q.Q)
Hence, the negligence rule with the defense of contributory
negligence will be superior or inferior to the rule without
the defense according as (9) is less than or greater than

(10), or as

     (11) Â£((aâ€”)pq + (l_cY)Pca +                    (l_a)(l_I3)pq         â€”
                                                                              (lâ€”)P)
          +   (l-c)x   +
                           ((l-a)(l-)p -            (l-))    >   0.
                                26



It follows from this formula that for any <l, there exists
an      sufficiently high that the negligence rule without the
defense of contributory negligence is superior to the rule
with the defense. (The sense behind this result was explained
in the previous section.) To see this, observe that if
<l and a=l, the left-hand-side of (11) is
        (12) Â£((l-)pq -   (l-)P) (lâ€”)     â€”

                                 >   0,

care.

                                 Appendix


     The model analyzed above will be reconsidered here
assuming that victims and injurers choose continuously
variable levels of care. This version of the model is of
interest for two reasons: it sometimes provides a better
description of reality, as many aspects of care do seem
continuously variable (e.g., in Davies, the distance between
the fettered donkey and the shoulder of the road); and it is
in conformity with most of the literature studying microeconomic
models of accidents and liability.29 It will be seen that
although the analysis of the continuous version of the model
is more complicated than that of the model considered above,30
the results will be essentially unaltered.


A.   Case where victims act first
     Let the variables Â£,x, and y be defined as before (but
now x and y are continuously variable)31 and let

     p(x)   =   probability       of a dangerous condition;
                1 >   p   >   0; p' < 0; p" > o;32
     q(y,x) =   probability       of an accident given that a
                dangerous condition has arisen and given y
                and x; 1 >      q   >   0;
                                              q,
                                                   <
                                                         yy >0;   0;



The measure of social welfare will be (the negative of)

expected total costs,

     (13) T(x,y) = x +        p(x)(y    +    q(y,x)fl.
                                  28



Let x* and y* denote the values of x and y which minimize T,
and let y*(x) denote the value of y that minimizes

      (14) y +   q(y,x)2.
(Note, therefore, that y*=y(x*).) These optimal values will
be assumed to be positive and unique. Additionally, we will
assume in certain of the proofs that various functions are

convex, although somewhat weaker assumptions would suffice.
     Let us now determine the behavior of parties under

liability rules. In doing so, let us define
     y(x) =   injurer's   choice of y given the victim's
              choice of x and the liability rule;

in other words, y(x) minimizes the injurer's cost of care y

plus his expected liability given x (which, recall, the
injurer observes) and given the liability rule. With y(x),
the victim's choice of x can be determined; he minimizes his

cost of care x plus his expected losses given the injurer's
response y(x) and the liability rule.34
     Let us assume that the due care levels are the optimal
levels of care: the due care level for victims is x*, and
for injurers it is y*(x). We may now consider the liability
rules. (The definitions of the rules given in Section III
will serve here.)



Proposition 11. Under the negligence rule with the defense
of contributory negligence, an optimal outcome will be
achieved; both the victim and the injurer will choose optimal
levels of care.
                                              29



Proof. We wish to show that xx and y=y. Let us first
determine y(x) under the liabi'.ity rule. To do this, note on
the one hand that x <             x implies y(x) = 0,               for if x <     x,
the injurer will not be liable. On the other hand, x                                x'

implies y(x) =           y*(x).       This may be shown by a standard

argument. Namely, if the injurer chooses y                              y*(x),   as he

will not be liable, his costs will be y; thus he will certainly
choose y =         y*(x).      And if he chooses y <           y*(x),       as he will

be liable, his problem will be to minimize y +                           q(y,x)2   over

y <   y*(x);       but, by definition of y*(x),

       (15) y +         q(y,x)2   >   y*(x)   +   q(y*(x),x)2       >   y*(x)
for y y*(x), and in particular for y <                         y*(x).       Hence the

injurer will choose y*(x).
       Let us now prove that the victim will choose x. Since
y(x) =   y*(x)       for x x*, the victim will always bear his
losses. Thus his problem is


       (16) mm x +          p(x)q(y(x),x)          =   inin(min x +     p(x)q(0,x),
            x                                                x<x*
               mm x +       p(x)q(y*(x),x)fl.
               x x *

However,
       (17) mm x +          p(x)q(O,x)        =   mm  x +     p(x)(0    +   q(O,x)fl
               x<x*                               x<x*
               >   mm    x +   p(x)(y    +q(y,x)) =          x + p(x*)(y* +
                   x,y
               >   x + p(x*)q(y*,x*) = x                 +   p(x*)q(y*(x*),x*)2
               ? mm x +        p(x)q(y*(x),x).
                   xx*
                                      30



Hence the x that solves (16) must be greater than or equal

to x. Thus, to prove that the solution is x, it will clearly
suffice to show that the derivative of x +           p(x)q(y*(x),x)2
is positive for xx*. But this will be seen to follow from
an assumption that the problem of minimizing T(x,y*(x)) = x
+   p(x)(y*(x)   +   q(y*(x),x)fl   is strictly convex in x.36 Now
the optiinality of x and the assumption of strict convexity

imply

        (18) dT(x,y*(x))      0 at x*
             dx

                            >0 forx> x*.
But

        (19) T(x,y*(x)) _(x+p(x)q(y*(x),x)2) =       p(x)y*(x),
   37
and

        (20) d(p(x)y*(x)) <    0.
            dx
Thus, the derivative of x +         p(x)q(y*(x),x)   exceeds that of
T(x,y*(x)), and this fact and (18) give the result. Q.E.D.


Proposition 12. Under the negligence rule without the
defense of contributory negligence, an optimal result will
not be achieved; the victim will take too little care,

although if a dangerous condition arises, the injurer will
act optimally given the victim's behavior.
Proof: We wish to show that x <            x* and y y*(x). Let us
first note that y(x) =      y*(x)   for all x. This can be proved
in exactly the way the same fact was shown for x x in the
proof to the previous proposition.
                                 31



       Since the injurer will always act non-negligently, the
victim will bear his losses and thus will choose x to minimize
x +   p(x)g(y*(x),x)2.   But it was shown at the end of the
last proof that this expression has a positive derivative
for x x', so that it must be minimized at an x less than
x*. Q.E.D.


Proposition 13. Under the comparative negligence rule, an
optimal result may not be achieved.
       (This is obvious from the discrete version of the

model.)


Proposition 14. Under strict liability with the defense of
contributory negligence, an optimal outcome will be achieved;
both the victim and the injurer will choose optimal levels
of care.

Proof. We wish to show that x =       x and y = y*.     In regard first
to y(x), it is clear that if x <      x*,   then y(x) = 0.   On the
other hand, if x x, then since the injurer will be liable,
his problem is to minimize y +   q(y,x)2.      Hence y(x) =   y*(x)
for x x.
      The victim's problem is accordingly

      (21) min(min x +   p(x)q(O,x),    mm x),
                 x<x                    xx*
and from (17), it is clear that the solution to this problem
is   x. Q.E.D.
                                          32


 B.      Case where injurers act first

         In this case, q(y) and p(x,y) will be defined analoÃ§ously
to p(x) and q(y,x). Moreover, expected total costs will now
be

         (22) T(x,y)       y +   q(y)(x   +   p(x,y)fl;
and x*(y) will be the optimal x given y; it will minimize
         (23) x +   p(x,y).
Let us now briefly reexamine the functioning of the liability
rules.



Proposition 15. Under the negligence rule with the defense
of contributory negligence, an optimal outcome may not be
achieved; the injurer may take too little care, although the
victim will act optimally given the injurer's behavior.
Proof. We wish to show that y <                y is possible and that
x = x*(y). The latter is true since by now familiar               logic,
x(y) = x*(y). Hence, the injurer's problem is

     (24) min(min y + q(y)p(x*(y),y)z, mm y),
                    y<y*                            yy*
and it is clear that the solution to this problem might be y
<   y*    (This would be so if p(x*(y),y) were sufficiently

low.) Otherwise, of course, the solution is y*, in which
case an optimal outcome results. Q.E.D.


Proposition 16. Under the negligence rule without the
defense of contributory negligence, an optimal outcome will
be achieved; both the injurer and the victim will choose
optimal levels of care.
                                  33



Proof: We wish to show that y =        y and x = x.        Now if y <   y,
then x(y) = 0; and if y y*, the victim will choose x to

minimize x +   p(x,y)2,   so that x(y) =     x*(y).    Hence, the

injurer's problem is

     (25) min(min y +     g(y)p(0,y)2, mm y*).
              y<y*                     yy*
By an argument analogous to that used in respect to the
problem (21), the solution to (25) is seen to be y. Thus,
the victim will choose x*(y*) =    x.        Q.E.D.


Proposition 17. Under the comparative negligence rule, an
optimal outcome may not be achieved.

     (As before, this is obvious from the discrete version
of the model.)



Proposition 18. Under strict liability with the defense of
contributory negligence, an optimal outcome will not be
achieved; the injurer will take too little care, although
the victim will act optimally given the injurer's behavior.
Proof. We wish to show that y <        y*   and x     x*(y). The latter
is true since by familiar logic, x(y) =         x*(y).   Hence the

injurer's problem is
     (26) mm y +    q(y)p(x*(y),y)2..
          y
But the derivative of this expression exceeds that of T(x*(y),y)

by the argument used in respect to (19) and (20). Thus,
                             34



assuming T(x*(y),y) to be strictly convex in y, the y that
solves (26) must be less than y. Q.E.D.


     We omit discussion of the extension of the model in the
continuous version.

*    Professor     of Law and Economics, Harvard Law School.    I


     wish to thank Lucian Bebchuk, Mark Klamer, William
     Landes, A. Mitchell Polinsky, Richard Posner, David
     Rosenberg, Hal Scott, and Donald Wittman for comments

     and the National Science Foundation (Grant No. SES-8014208)
     for financial support.

1.   Attention will be limited to the issue of accident
     avoidance--in particular, no consideration will be
     given to sharing of risk or to notions of fairness--and
     conclusions reached about the comparison of liability
     rules should be interpreted accordingly.

2.   The words "victim" and "injurer" will be used in place
     of the more cumbersome "potential victim" and "potential

     injurer" hereafter.
3.   10 M. & W. 546 (1842).

4.   66 Ont. L. R. 618 (App. Div. 1931).
5.   In cases involving "last clear chance," it is frequently
     true that the victim acted first; consider Tuff V. Warman,

     5 C.B. (N.S.) 573 (1858), involving a collision of
     ships, where defendant vessel saw but still ran down

     plaintiff vessel, which failed to post a lookout;
     Radley v. London & Northwestern Railway, 1 App. Cas.

     754 (1876), where plaintiff colliery placed one coal-
     carrying container on top of another on defendant
     railroad's flat-bed car and where defendant's locomotive

     engineer, noticing resistance when attempting to pass
                               36



      under plaintiff's bridge, failed to investigate and
      increased his power, doing damage to the bridge; Clark v.
     Boston & Maine R.R., 87 N.H. 434, 182 A. 175 (1935),

     where plaintiff standing on a railway crossing was
     struck by defendant's train coming from a direction in
     which he was not looking; Wall v. King, 280 Mass. 577,
     182 N.E. 855 (1932), where plaintiff driver attempted
     to pass in the middle lane of a three lane road when it
     was difficult for him to then pull back to the right
     and where defendant coming in the opposite direction
     thereafter also entered the middle lane despite plaintiff's
     sounding his horn and collided with plaintiff.
6.   In some situations involving last clear chance, and in

     many involving "assumption of risk," the injurer acted
     first; suppose that defendant failed to clear ice from

     his sidewalk and plaintiff, observing the condition of
     the sidewalk, nevertheless proceeded to walk on it,
     fell, and suffered injury; that defendant failed to
     keep his stone wall in good repair and plaintiff still
     chose to park his car by the wall, from which several

     stones were dislodged, fell, and damaged the car.
7.   The only other articles of which I am aware which consider

     sequential situations using the approach of micro-economics

     are Donald Wittrnan, Optimal Pricing of Sequential Inputs:
     Last Clear Chance, Mitigation of Damages, and Related
     Doctrines in the Law, 10 J. Legal Stud. 65 (1981) and
                              37



     (in a section) William M. Landes and Richard A. Posner,

     The Positive Economic Theory of Tort Law, 15 Georgia L.
     Rev. 851 (1981), at 889-891. Reference to these two
     articles, to which the reader is encouraged to turn,

     will be made below (see notes 16, 20, 24, 27). These
     articles, however, do not contain the principle results

     shown here (as illustrated by the next two paragraphs
     on Davies and as precisely stated in the Propositions),
     do not examine situations where the injurer acts first
     and the victim second, and do not formally analyze a
     general model where parties act sequentially. (But see
     note 27 infra, on Wittman, and see also William M. Landes

     and Richard A. Posner, Joint and Multiple Tortfeasors,

     9 J. Legal Stud. 517 (1980), at 543-547, which dis-
     cusses and formally analyzes a particular (and compli-
     cated) type of sequential situation where an injurer
     acts first, harms a victim, and then another injurer

     harms the victim.)
8.   Herein lies the analytically distinguishing feature of
     the sequential context. In the simultaneous context,

     by contrast, each type of party takes as given the
     actions of the other; each victim assumes that his own
     action will not affect the actions of injurers, and
     conversely. See also notes 17 and 28 infra on the
     difference between the sequential and the simultaneous

     contexts.
                                38


 9.    In Davies the court said that were Mann not bound to

       take care, "a man might justify the driving over goods
       left on a public highway, or even over a man lying

       asleep there, or the purposely running against a carriage
       going on the wrong side of the road."
10. This is a point of emphasis in Wittman note 7 supra, it
       is well recognized in Landes and Posner note 7 supra,
       and it is the implication of remarks in William L.

      Prosser, Comparative Negligence, 51 Mich.L.Rev. 465
       (1958), at 468.

11. There is also a brief Appendix analyzing formally a

      version of the model in which care is assumed to be

      continuously variable rather than (as in the body of
      the article) discrete.
12. The cost of care and possible accident losses are
      assumed to be monetary or to have monetary equivalents.

13. If for example the likelihood of a loss of 1000 is .10,
      then expected losses are 100. The assumption that
      parties evaluate uncertain amounts in terms of expected
      values (the technical assumption of risk neutrality) is
      made for simplicity; it will be clear that nothing of
      substance will turn on the assumption.

14. This assumption seems the reasonable one to make even
      though there will often be a measure of uncertainty in
      the injurer's mind about the negligence of the victim.

      (Could a party like Mann have wondered whether a party
      like Davies had been forced to leave his donkey fettered
      on the road owing to some emergency?)
                              39



15. The reduction to zero of the probability of an accident
     accomplished by the injurer's exercise of care is an

     aspect of the example that will simplify calculations
     and explanations of results but is not necessary to the
     results; see Section III.
16. This aspect of the example should be thought typical if
     one believes that it will generally be true that both
     the victim and the injurer ought to take some degree of
     care. However, for an alternative viewpoint, see
     Landes and Posner, note 7 supra. They suggest that in
    many situations of interest, it is optimal for the
     injurer alone to take care.

17. In the simultaneous context, however, the negligence
     rule will lead to an optimal outcome when there is no
    defense of contributory negligence (as it will if the
    defense is allowed). See note 28 infra.
18. In the general case of the model studied in the next
     section, an optimal outcome might occur under this rule
     if the probability of an accident is not reduced to

    zero by the injurer's taking care. See Proposition 2.
     In the version of the model with care continuously
    variable, however, an optimal outcome would never
    occur; the victim will always take too little care.
     See Proposition 12 of the Appendix. (Comments similar
    to this will apply to other results of this section
    where a party fails to take care, but we will not

    bother to make them.)
                                   40


19.    In the general case, it is not that the victim will
      have no incentive to take care--he may after all suffer

       a loss despite the injurer's taking due care. Rather,
      it is that he will have an inadequate incentive to take
      care.

20. This observation leads Wittman, note 7 supra, to examine
      a family of liability rules according to some of which
      the victim would pay the injurer his cost of care--thereby

      apparently giving the victim an appropriate incentive
      to reduce the risk of dangerous conditions.

21. Suppose that under a comparative negligence rule the
      injurer would be liable for half the victim's losses if
      both failed to take care. Then if a dangerous condition
      arose and the victim did not take care, the injurer

      would prefer to spend 200 on care than to fail to take
      care and bear an expected liability of .50 x 500 = 250.
      Knowing   this,   the victim would decide not to take care.
           On the other hand, it is also possible that the

      injurer would decide against taking care if the victim
      did not and that an optimal outcome would result. This

      would be the case, for instance, if the injurer would
      be liable for only one fifth the victim's losses if
      both did not take care, for then the injurer's expected

      liability if he and the victim failed to take care
      would be only .50 x 200 = 100.     Hence, if the victim
      does not take care, his expected losses will be .20 x
      .50 x 800 = 80; and if he takes care, his only costs
                              41



     will be his cost of care of 10, as the injurer will
     then be induced to take care if a dangerous condition
     arises. Thus, both the victim and the injurer will be
     led to take care.

22. In the numerical example, the injurer will not take
     care if a dangerous condition arises and the victim did
     not take care. But the injurer will take care if the
     victim did take care; for in that event, the injurer
     would be liable and would prefer to spend 200 on care
     than to bear expected liability of .5 x 1000 = 500.
     Consequently, if the victim does not take care, his
     expected losses will be .20 x .50 x 1000 = 100; and if
     he does take care at a cost of 10, he will not bear any
     losses. Thus, the victim will take care, and so then
    will the injurer.
23. In the example, if a dangerous condition arises, the
    victim will always spend 200 on care to avoid an expected
     loss of 500. Hence the injurer will have no reason to
    take care.

24. Thus, the modification might be seen as rationalizing
     such doctrines as last clear chance. However, Landes
     and Posner notes 7 and 16, supra, suggest a different
    rationalization of last clear chance: that it is
    employed to defeat a defense of contributory negligence
    precisely when such a defense would have been inappro-
    priate ab initlo--when it would not have been optimal
     for the victim to have taken any care to avoid creating
                                 42



     a dangerous condition on account of the ease with which

     potential injurers could subsequently prevent accidents.
25. More generally, let a be the probability that victims

     will ignore the risk in the example. Then it will be
     desirable not to apply the defense of contributory
     negligence when l00 +     (l-x)30    >   40, which is to say,
     when   >   1/7.   See Section III.

26. See (11) of Section III for a general formula showing
     how the chance that a victim or that an injurer would

     be inevitably negligent will determine the desirability
     of use of the defense of contributory negligence.

27. This section presents the first formal analysis of the
     usual rules of liability in the sequential context.

     (Although Wittman, note 7 supra, contains formal analysis
     of the usual liability rules in the simultaneous context,

     the only rule that Wittman formally analyzes in the
     sequential context (at 69-71) is a special one (but
    with interesting and desirable properties) that he
     calls "marginal cost liability.")
28. In the simultaneous context, this rule can be shown to
    lead to an optimal outcome. The reason, in essence, is
    that the victim and the injurer are envisioned each to

    take care with probability one; thus the victim's level
    of care does not affect the probability that injurers

    will take care. By contrast, in the sequential context,
    the victim's level of care does of course affect whether

    the injurer will take care, and the victim does not
    take this into account under the negligence rule without
                               43



     the defense of contributory negligence. (Similar
     remarks explain why comparative negligence leads to an
     optimal outcome in the simultaneous context but may not

     in the sequential context.)
29. See for example John P. Brown, Toward an Economic
     Theory of Liability, 2 J. Legal Stud. 323 (1973); Peter

    A. Diamond, Single Activity Accidents, 3 J. Legal Stud.
     107 (1974); and Steven Shavell, Strict Liability versus
    Negligence, 9 J. Legal Stud. 1 (1980).
30. This is primarily because the behavior of the second
    party may depend on the particular level of care exercised

    by the first party.
31. Although Â£ is taken to be fixed, the results to be
     shown do not depend on this assumption; and the proofs
    would remain virtually the same were the loss instead

    variable, determined by a probability distribution
     (dependent on x and y).

32. Here and occasionally elsewhere, functions or their
    derivatives are for convenience written without their

    arguments.
33. The interpretation of           is that if the victim

    increases his level of care, then, if a dangerous
    condition arises, the effect of an increase in the

    injurer's care on the likelihood of loss is unchanged
    or reduced. This corresponds to the notion that the
    nature of the dangerous condition (as opposed to its
    probability) is either unaffected by the victim's care
    or, if affected, becomes less serious.
                                44



34. It will be assumed that the minimization problems of
      the injurer and of the victim have unique solutions.

35. The proof of this result will be seen to be different
      from and more complicated than the proof of the same
      result in the simultaneous context; for the latter, see
      John P. Brown, note 29 supra.
36.   I know of no simple assumption about T(x,y) that guarantees

      convexity.
37.                                            *                *
      To establish (20), note that d(p(x)y (x))/dx=p'(x)y (x)+
                                   *
      p(x)y*'(x)   and that p'(x)y (x) is negative. Thus, we
      need only show that y*I(x)        0. But y*(x) is implicitly
      determined by the first-order condition from (14),
      namely l+qy(y*(x),x)2 = 0.       Differentiating this with
      respect to x we get y* (x) =
                                          yx   (y*(x),x) /   q(y*(x),x)
