                The Effects of Social Security Reforms on
                  Retirement Ages and Retirement Incomes
                                 ABSTRACT


        Recent changes legislated in the U.S. Social Security system are

changing the economic incentives to work and retire. Some older workers

will respond to these new incentives by retiring at different ages.       This


paper evaluates the signs and magnitudes of these responses. Using a repre—

sentative sample of male workers, we investigate the pre—reform earnings,

private pensions, and Social Security profiles available at alternative

retirement ages. Then we examine four specific changes in the structure of

Social Security benefits: raising the normal retirement age, delaying the

cost—of—living adjustment, lowering early retirement benefits, and

increasing late retirement payments. Behavioral parameters are estimated

using an ordered logit model of retirement ages; these are than used to eval-

uate how retirement behavior might respond to each of the four reforms.

The largest retirement age response is observed for the policy change which

cuts benefits at the earliest ages and offers larger rewards for continued

work. This change would delay the average retirement age by about three

months. The other reforms generate even smaller responses. Changes in

 retirement ages of this magnitude will be   to   small to compensate retirees

 for reductions in benefit formulas. Thus the Social Security's financial

 burden will be eased but retiree's incomes will fall on average.

Introduction
     In the last decade many countries have come to recognize that people are

devoting ever—shorter portions of
                                         imply growing financial pressure on both

                                            giving rise to heated policy debate
yrivate sector and governmental pensions,

over what is to be done. The United States Congress recently moved beyond

debate by legislating a series of changes in Social Security, the U.S. govern-

                                              an overview of the determinants of
such reforms. In so doing, we also provide

retirement ages and retirement incomes,
                                          which should prove useful to economic

    Regarding preferences, earlier research on retirement has shown that

workers are heterogeneous (Mitchell and Fields, l984a; Gustman and Steinmeier,

l983a). Same are work—lovers and some leisure—lovers. Our estimation method,

ordered logit, allows for correlation of preferences across retirement ages for

the same worker. The estimated parameters are presented in Section III.

     The core results appear in Sections IV and V, predicting changes in retire-

ment ages and retirement incomes respectively. Of the specific reforms

examined, we find that lowering early retirement benefits has the largest impact

on retirement ages, while delaying cost of living adjustments or raising late

retirement credits have little effect. Increasing the normal retirement age has

an intermediate impact. Retirement incomes are affected most by increasing the

normal retirement age, next most by lowering early retirement benefits, and

least by delaying cost of living adjustments or raising late retirement credits.

The model is partial equilibrium in spirit, examining changes in Social Security

holding constant pension and wage structures.

     Conclusions appear in Section VI.



I. Retirement Incentives Prior To The Reforms

     In order to understand how Social Security reforms will affect retirement

incomes and retirement behavior, it is first necessary to construct the inter—

temporal budget set facing older workers prior to the reforms. Unfortunately,

there are no publicly available data which can be used to determine income

streams or retirement patterns for the current cohort of older workers.

Instead, we draw on an earlier data file of workers known as the Longitudinal

Retirement History survey (LRIfS) and update this file to reflect the positions

of workers currently reaching retirement age.
                                                                                 3



     The LRHS file is a longitudinal data set first fielded by the U.S. govern-

ment in 1969, covering several thousand older individuals and their spouses.

From the group originally surveyed we selected a sample of 1024 white married

male employees between the ages of 59 and 61 in 1969. The age group restriction

ensures that retirement patterns can actually be observed during the ensuing

waves of the survey; data were collected on these individuals through 1979. The

sample is also limited to employees since the concept of retirement is poorly

defined for self—employed persons. The bedridden and seriously ill are excluded

since economic incentives will probably play a rather different role for this

group as compared to the reasonably healthy group of older male employees.

Finally, we focus on a sample of private sector workers since we have no data

on occupational pensions for government workers.

     The LRHS is extremely valuable for analysis of older workers' retirement

patterns since it provides a great deal of detailed information on income and

work patterns. Retirement is defined here as the age at which a worker left his

1969 job, computed by comparing each individual's job in later years with that

held in 1969.1 Earnings histories are provided in the survey from 1951 on-

ward; these were used to estimate what each individual could have earned if he

worked between ages 60 and 68.2 Earnings histories are also the basis for

calculating Social Security benefits, as described in Section II below. Private

pension benefits are somewhat more difficult to obtain, since the LRHS reports

only imperfect measures of benefits workers anticipate receiving upon retire-

ment. The survey did indicate when a worker would be eligible for such a

pension; this allowed us to proxy benefit amounts for retirement at age 65 using

industry—level benefits reported by Kotlikoff and Smith (1983). For retirement

at other ages, benefit amounts were adjusted using quasi—actuarial factors

reported by Schulz and Leavitt (reported in Burkhauser and Quinn, 1980).
                                                                                  4


    To estimate the effects of Social Security reforms in the 1980s, the LRHS

data must be brought up to date. This is accomplished in three simple steps.

(1) Earnings: Pre—tax earnings are adjusted upward by assuming that older

workers' wage profiles grew at the same pace as did the average worker's wage

between the l970s and 1982. Post—tax earnings for the synthetic cohort are

computed using federal income tax formulas and Social Security payroll taxes in

effect in l982. (2) Social Security: Social Security benefits are up-

dated by using the 1982 rules relating benefits to earnings during the worker's

lifetime.4 During the 19?Os, Social Security benefits rose more rapidly than

inflation due to inadvertent double—indexing. However, this has been corrected

so that real Social Security payments using the 1982 rules rise in proportion to

increases in the consumer price index. (3) Private pensions: Private pension

benefits relevant to workers retiring during the l980s are updated by computing

their value in 1982 dollars assuming no real growth. Since the earlier pension

profile showed that benefits fell in real terms after retirement, so too does

the updated pension profile. Net pension benefits are obtained by reducing each

worker's pension amounts by the federal income tax rate relevant to him using

the 1982 tax tables.

     In all of these computations we develop the intertetnporal budget set in a

certainty framework. The empirical computations thus answer the question: what

income alternatives would the worker anticipate receiving in the future, as

viewed from the vantage point of age 60? This approach is consistent with

virtually all theoretical studieB of the retirement decision, and with all

previous empirical work. We are aware that such stochastic events as the onset

of ill health or unanticipated inflation render the environment uncertain.

Although retirement plans may change in reaction to such an unexpected event,

these changes have not been incorporated in the development of the intertemporal
                                                                                  5



budget set. To analyze them in a more comprehensive framework would require

stochastic dynamic programming, a task beyond the scope of the current liter-

ature and the present paper.

     The components of the 1982 budget set thus devised appear in the top panel

of Table 1. Here are displayed the annual real income amounts that a worker

with average characteristics (the "illustrative worker") would have anticipated

receiving if he retired at the alternative retirement dates depicted.   All

figures are given in 1982 dollars. Retirement ages between 60 and 68 are the

focus of empirical attention since our earlier analysis demonstrated that the

overwhelming majority of workers retire between these dates; in fact the average

retirement age for our sample is around age 63, with very few retiring earlier

than 60 or later than 68.

      These calculations assume that the covered worker may receive a private

pension if he retires at ages 60 or 61, but consistent with Social Security

rules, he must wait to file for governmental pension benefits until the age of

62. For other ages, benefits are computed assuming the worker files for Social

Security and private pensions in the year he retires.   A married woman is

assumed to file for spouse's Social Security benefits when he retires, or when

 she turns age 62 if she were younger than that.

      The bottom panel of Table 1 provides the corresponding present discounted

 values associated with the flow given in the top panel. They are computed

 incorporating the probability of not surviving to the ace in question, and in

 addition imposing a 2% real discount rate. Total lifetime income amounts net of

 taxes are displayed in the last row of the Table, indicating the real value of

 working until a specific age, and then accepting the coibpany and Social Security

 pension after that.

    The individual-level data underlying Table 1 are used in three ways in what

follows. First, they are used as a standard against which several Social

Security reforms may be compared. Second, they are used to derive predicted

retirement ages using behavioral estimates. Last, they are employed to predict

changes in income streams and retirement ages under the various reforms. We

take these up in   turn.


II. Retirement Incentives In Four Reform Scenarios

     Four specific reforms are simulated in this paper: Increasing the normal

retirement age, delaying the cost—of—living adjustment, raising the late

retirement credit, and changing the early retirement reduction factor.6 In

order to evaluate how each alters retirement incentives, a bit of explanation is

needed on how Social Security benefits in the United States are determined.

     A first step in computing benefits is to find each worker's Average Indexed

Monthly Earnings (AIME). The AIME is found by: indexing earnings up to the

Social Security taxable maximum in each year between 1951 and age 60; comparing

these to nominal earnings, if any, after that age; selecting the highest (for

example, a worker turning age 60 in 1982 would have his highest 28 years of

earnings included); converting to a monthly basis; and averaging.

     The second step in calculating Social Security benefits is to determine the

worker's Primary Insurance Amount (PIA). In 1982, PIA was determined from AIME

according to the following formula:

          9O of AIME up to "BEND POINT 1"

          plus
          32% of AIME between "BEND POINT 1" and "BEND POINT 2"

          plus

          15% of AIME above "BEND POINT 2."
                                                                               8


In real 1982 dollars, "BEND POINT 1" — $230 and "BEND POINT 2"   $1388, both in

monthly terms; in future years, the bend points will increase with the Consumer

Price Index (thus remaining the same in real terms).

     The third step is to compute the worker's Social Security benefit as a

multiple of the PIA:

          Worker's benefit   PIA *   multiple.
This multiple equals 1.00 if the worker is age 65 when he begins to collect

benefits; this is the "age of retirement" from the point of the view of the

Social Security system. Early retirement reduction factors are applied to

workers commencing benefits before age 65, and delayed retirement credits

awarded to workers waiting until after age 65 to retire. The multiples for

retirement ages other than 65 are determined from these early retirement

reduction factors and delayed retirement credits.

     The final step is to add in spouse's benefits, if any. The wife is

eligible to receive benefits based on the worker's PIA. At age 65, she receives

a benefit equal to 50% of her husband's PIA, regardless of whether he retired at

age 65, earlier, or later. If the wife is 62 or over but not yet 65, she may

receive a reduced benefit; the reduction is at the rate of 8 1/3% per year.

     The four Social Security reforms examined here operate primarily by

affecting the multiples. The 1982 rules and the reforms simulated are explained

with the aid of Figure 1. Here 1982 rules are depicted in the top panel and for

ease of comparison, are redrawn as lighter lines in each of the remaining

panels.

     Under the 1982 rules, the early retirement reduction factor was 6 2/3 per

year and the delayed retirement credit 3% per year, both figured to the nearest

month. So for example, a worker retiring at age 62 would receive a Social

Security benefit that is 20% less than his PIA (6 2/3% reduction per year times

3 years under age 65); his multiple at age 62 is thus .80. That same worker, if

he waited to retire until age 68, would receive a Social Security benefit that

is 9% greater than his PIA (3% credit per year times three years); his multiple

at age 68 is thus 1.09.

     The four Social Security reforms actually simulated can now be described:

     Experiment A. Increasing the normal retirement age means that the indi-

vidual no longer receives his full PIA if he retires at age 65. We simulated

the effect of raising this age to age 68, as was widely proposed. (What in fact

was legislated was a change to age 66 by the year 2009 and to age 67 by the year

2027.) Under the simulated reform, the multiple becomes 1.00 at age 68 and the

early retirement reduction factor remains at 6 2/3% per year. Thus, the mul

tiples under this experiment are .60 for retirement at age 62 and .80 for

retirement at age 65, with corresponding reductions at other ages. (The 1983

legislation set a minimum multiple of 70%.)

     Experiment B. Delaying the cost—of—living adjustment.

     Rules in effect in 1982 specified that cost—of—living adjustments would

take place each July 1, reflecting increases in the Consumer Price Index during

the preceding calendar year. The 1983 Social Security amendments delayed these

increases by an additional six months. This six month delay reduces real

benefits by half the rate of inflation, or 2.3%. This reduction imposes new

multiples as shown in Figure 1.

     Experiment C. Raising the late retirement credit means that benefits

are increased faster than 3% if retirement is postponed beyond age 65. We simu-

lated a 6 2/3% per year late retirement credit the same as the early retirement

reduction factor. The multiple for retirement at age 68 would have risen from

1.09 to 1.20. (As it turned out, in 1983, Congress mandated a gradual increase

in the late retirement credit, eventually reaching 8% per year as of the year

2009.)
                                                                                 11



    Experiment D. Changing the early retirement reduction factor simulates

a proposal tentatively put forth by the Reagan Administration in 1981. This was

to reduce early benefits by 15% per year, rather than by 6 2/3%. The multiple

for retirement at age 62 would therefore have been .55 rather than .80 as at

present. This proposal was initially rejected as politically unpopular and as of

this writing, has not been resurrected. Still, it is interesting to predict

what might have happened had it been enacted.

     Table 2 presents the effects of the four policy experiments on the Social

Security benefits of the illustrative LRHS worker described above, while Table 3

reports their effects on total income (PDVY). In these computations the

earnings and private pension elements of the underlying budget set are assumed

to be unaffected by the simulated changes in Social Security structures. Hence,

the estimated impacts of the various reforms on retirement ages should be

thought of as partial equilibrium estimates, leaving aside possible responses of

pension plans and e2rnings profiles to changes in Social Security.

     Increasing the normal retirement age to 68 (Experiment A) lowers retirement

benefits substantially as compared to the pre—reform scenario. Annual payments

fall by $1,000 or more regardless of when the worker retires. This translates

into PDVY streams which are lower by about $17,000 for people retiring in their

early 60s; the reduction is only somewhat smaller for workers deferring retire-

ment until age 65. Another effect of Experiment A is to tilt the Social Security

benefit structure. The system becomes actuarially more advantageous until age

65, such that delaying retirement from age 62 to age 65 actually increases the

present value of benefits by some $4,000. The experimental benefit structure is

also roughly neutral after age 65, in stark contrast to the pre—reform penalty.

In overview, then, increasing the normal retirement age as outlined here lower8

benefits at any given retirement age and provides new financial incentives to

remain on the job longer.

    Experiment B, in which the cost—of—living adjustment has been postponed six

months, has a relatively small effect. Annual benefits are reduced by $lOO—200,

which translates into falls in present discounted values of at most $1,600.

Since the income amounts involved are small, this reform does not appreciably

alter the pattern of discounted benefit gains obtained by deferring retirement.

     Experiment C raises the late retirement credit to match the early retire-

ment reduction factor. Benefits are increased after age 65, raising annual

benefits by as much as $800 at age 68. Present value at age 68 increases by

$6,000—--still not enough to achieve actuarial neutrality, but substantially

reducing the penalty (in PDV terms) for continuing to work beyond age 65.

     Experiment D would have lowered early Social Security benefits, holding

benefits beyond age 65 the same. For a worker retiring at age 62 or before,

the annual benefit would have fallen by $1,700 and present discounted value by

some $21,000. The gain in present discounted value of Social Security benefits

for an extra year o work before age 65 would have been $6,000—9,000. This

reform would have created a powerful penalty for retiring early and a powerful

incentive for continued work. Yet, as we shall see, even those forces would not

change retirement ages very much.



III. Preferences for Income and Leisure

     The next step is to evaluate how workers would be likely to respond to the

changes brought by Social Security reforms such as those described above. To do

this, it is necessary to obtain behavioral parameters indicating how older

 individuals weigh income and leisure. An econometric approach that proved

 fruitful in our earlier study (Mitchell and Fields, 1984a) is to model retire—

ment in a discrete choice framework. Following McFadden (1974), we posit that

 the utility of the ith worker if he retired at age j is:
                                                                                 15




         —   [a in PDVYjJ + B in RET1j)   + eij.7

The term in square brackets is the "strict utility" component for the average

person, varying of course with values of income and leisure at different ages.

The disturbance term eij is independent across people; this assumption is

quite conventional in labor supply models. In other contexts, it is also con-

ventional to require ejj to be uncorrelated across different choice alter-

natives for a given person, as for instance would be the case if the discret

choice model were estimated using a logit technology. However, in the retir—

inent setting, there is strong reason to believe that correlation between

unobserved tastes for nearby retirement ages may be important——particularly if

individuals are "workaholics" or "leisure lovers".

     Allowing for this sort of correlation is feasible within a conditional

ordered logit (OL) setup, where the probability of choosing one specific

retirement age is allowed to depend on the attractiveness of immediately

adjacent retirement ages.8 Using that model we obtain estimates of a and

which are significantly nonzero by conventional levels, and of the anticipated

signs: both income and leisure are shown to be important determinants in-

creasing older workers' utility. In relative terms, the estimated coefficients

(a/B— 1.4/2.3 —   .61) suggest that a percentage increase in leisure would be
weighed relatively more heavily than the same percentage increase in income.

We note in passing that the ordered logit model proves to be sensible on sta-

tistical grounds, since the data reject the hypothesis that the disturbance

terms are uncorrelated across individuals.9 Thus all policy evaluations

reported below utilize the theoretically and statistically preferable coef-

ficients from the ordered logit model.
                                                                                 16




IV. Effects of Social Security Reforms on Retirement Ages

     Predicting the effects of the Social Security reforms on retirement ages

requires three steps. First the OL coefficients are used to predict each sample

individual's probability of selecting all available retirement ages, under the

pre—reform budget set. Next we predict retirement ages under all four experi-

mental budget sets. Finally we average over individuals. Thus the results

appearing in the first column of Table 4 refer to averages over the sample as a

whole, not just to the illustrative worker described above.

     We find that the estimated retirement age responses vary depending on the

experiment performed:

     1. The largest retirement age response is observed for the experi-

     ment which cuts benefits at the earliest retirement age while offering

     a larger reward to continued work before, age 65 (Experiment D). The

     likely response to this reform would be about a three month delay in

     the retirement age, on average.

     2. Intermediate retirement responses are observed for the experiment

     which lowers benefits by approximately the same dollar amount at

     every age but leaves unchanged the incentive to remain working an

     additional year. This Is accomplished by changing the normal retire-

     ment age (Experiment A). This would be predicted to delay retirement

     by about one and a half months, on average.

     3. The smallest responses are obtained in cases where income

     incentives for early retirement are altered the least. This is true

     for delaying cost—of—living adjustments (Experiment B), in which bene-

     fits at each retirement age are reduced somewhat. It is also true of

     the experiment to raise the late retirement credit (Experiment C),

    since barly retirement benefits are unaffected and most workers retire

    prior to age 65. Each of these reforms would be predicted to delay

     retirement by less than a week, on average.

    Overall, the four policies simulated here generate only very small

changes in retirement behavior———changes in lifetime income of as much as

twenty to thirty percent at some ages would result in at most a three month

deferral.1°

     Our   findings   are generically similar to those generated from

other empirical models of older workers' labor supply. Burtless and Moffitt's

(1982) results are of the same order of magnitude as ours; their model indicates

that changing Social Security benefits by ten percent would affect retirement

ages by about one month. Hausman and Wise (1983) evaluate how retirement ages

would differ if Social Security primary insurance amounts (PIA) had remained

constant front 1969 onwards instead of increasing as they did until 1975. This

counterfactual simulation indicates that retirement at age 62 would not have

been affected at all; only 3% fewer people would have retired at age 65 and

about 4% fewer at age 66. Since the actual PIA increase was on the order of 50%

over that period, these estimated responses prove to be quite small indeed.

Finally, Gustman and Steinmeier (1983) estimate the effects of raising the

normal retirement age for Social Security benefits from 65 to 67. This reduces

early benefits by 10 to 13 1/3 percentage points in each year. They estimate

that the two year increase in the normal retirement age would increase actual

retirement by about two months; this is somewhat larger than our prediction that

a three—year increase in the normal retirement age would increase actual

retirement by about 1.6 months, but both are very small. Likewise, they find as

we do that the cost—of—living adjustment deferral is expected to raise actual

retirement by less than one month.
                                                                                 19



    In sum; the numbers that emerge from our study are very close to others

estimates. We all find very small elasticities of retirement age with respect

to changes in Social Security benefits: on the order of 0.1 or less.   All of

these behavioral estimates are an order of magnitude smaller than actuarial

assumptions made by functionaries of the Social Security system.   Schieber

(1982) is particularly clear on the assumptions made by Social Security ac-

tuaries. Regarding the reform in which the normal retirement age is raised from

65 to 68 he says: "The average age at retirement for men is assumed to rise

to 65.6 years at the end of the transition, which contrasts with an average

retirement age of 63.2 years at the beginning of the simulation." p. 190

[Emphasis added.] Thus, the Social Security actuaries were assuming a 2.3 year

response to a three year increase in the normal retirement age. Our behavioral

evidence suggests that this assumption is unwarranted and that the probable

response is no more than a tenth of that.

     The small retirement age responses predicted from behavioral models have

implications for the financial viability of the Social Security system and of

workers. First, looking at the Social Security system, the average worker is

 predicted to make only a marginal change in respo.ise to a downward shift in

 benefit formulas. This means that the Social Security system will have to pay

 out less to the worker over his lifetime. Furthermore, during the weeks or

 months of extra work, the system gains additional revenues.   The system

 therefore comes out ahead from these reforms.

      Does the financial gain to the Social Security system necessarily imply a

 corresponding financial loss to Social Security recipients?   Not necessarily, if

 workers respond as the actuaries assume and extend their worklives by enough to

 retain their old benefit levels. However, the behavioral evidence from several

 models including ours suggests otherwise. Older workers will not give up much
                                                                                20


leisure. Consequently, the models predict that workers will be rendered poorer.

We turn now to estimates of the changes in incomes of retirees.



V. Effects of Social Security Reforms on Retirement Incomes

     Table 4 also indicates how each of the four experiments would alter a

retiree's Social Security benefits (PDVSS) and total income (PDVY). Two sets of

calculations are presented: one assumes the worker is employed until the

average retirement age prior to the reforms, and the other allows the retirement

age to respond to benefit changes.

    At the mean retirement age we find that the present value of Social

Security benefits would be reduced by as much as 22%. A reduction in PDVSS of

this magnitude occurs in Experiment A, which increases the normal retirement

age, leaves the early retirement age unchanged, and maintains the gain for

working an extra year (hereafter, the "tilt") at 6 2/3% per annum.

    At the mean retirement age, the present value of remaining lifetime income

would be reduced by as much as 10%. Once again, the largest reduction is found

for Experiment A. The PDVY reductions are smaller than the corresponding PDVSS

reductions because PDVSS is just one component of PDVY.

    After allowing for the average retirement age to respond to changes in the

Social Security benefit structure, PDVSS would still fall by as much as 22% and

PDVY by 9% under Experiment A. The effects are largest under this experiment

for two reasons: (i) Experiment A reduces early retirement benefits a great

deal, and (ii) Experiment A retains a small incentive for prolonged work.

     For the experiment which lowers early retirement benefits while keeping

normal benefits the same (Experiment C) the percentage reduction in PDVY is less

after allowing for retirement age endogeneity than when retirement ages are held

constant. This experiment increases the tilt in the benefit structure as well
                                                                                21



as reducing Social Security benefits at any given age. The consequent labor

supply response would offset about half of the lifetime income reduction that

would otherwise take place.

     In the other experiments, retirement ages do not change appreciably 80 that

the effects on PDVSS and PDVY are the same when the retirement age is allowed to

vary as when it is taken as exogenously determined.



VI. Conclusions

     This paper evaluated the likely responses of older workers to four reforms

in the Social Security benefit formulas: 'increasing the normal retirement age,

delaying the cost—of—living adjustment, raising the late retirement credit, and

changing the early retirement reduction factor. We first developed workers'

intertemporal budget sets prior to and after the reforms. Next, we evaluated

how retirement behavior might respond to these new economic incentives.

Finally, new retirement ages and retirement incomes were compared with pre—

reform levels. Clearly this approach is readily adaptable to other reform

proposals and even other retirement income systems.

     For the particular reforms examined here, the largest response is observed

for the experiment which cuts benefits at the earliest ages, while offering

larger rewards to continued work. The likely response for this change would be

about a three month delay in the average retirement age. An intermediate

change, of about one and a half months, was predicted in response to increasing

the normal retirement age. Very small responses, of less than one week, were

obtained for delays in the cost—of—living adjustment or raising the late retire-

ment credit, both of which altered income incentives the least.
                                                                               22



    Responses of these magnitudes will be too small to compensate retirees for

reductions in benefit formulas. Thus, smaller Social Security benefits will be

paid to workers. The cut is largest for increases in the normal retirement age,

next largest for decreases in early retirement benefits. The Social Security

system's financial burden will be eased, but retirees' incomes will fall on

average.

1. Our analysis with other data sets has indicated that this definition of

    retirement produces estimates of behavioral responses that are virtually

    identical to those generated from other definitions of retirement; see

    Fields and Mitchell (l984b).

2. Reported earnings up to the Social Security taxable earnings maximum were

    converted to estimated earnings using a procedure reported in Fields and

   Mitchell (1984a).

3. The income tax computations assume that each married worker files jointly

    with his spouse. Actual taxes paid are not reported in the data file.

    Data on private pension contributions are likewise not reported. However,

    most workers do not contribute directly to their company—sponsored pension

    plan, implying that this omission is not serious.

4. These rules appear In the Social Security Administration's Social Security

   Handbook.

5. Again it was assumed that the married retiree filed jointly with his spouse.

6. In these calculations, the earnings and private pension elements of the

   underlying budget set are assumed to be unaffected by changes in Social

    Security legislation. Accordingly, the estimated effects of the various

   policy reforms on retirement ages should be thought of as first—round

   estimates. Future research should consider the responses of pension

   plans and earnings profiles to Social Security reforms.

7. This form for the utility function is consistent with evidence indicating

    that the substitution elasticity for older workers is very close to —1; see

   Gustman and Steinmeier (1983).

8. This model, due to Small (1982), is described in more detail in Mitchell and

   Fields (l984a). Essentially the probability of selecting retirement age j

   from among several ordered alternatives is described as:


               exp(a in PDVYJ   + b in RET + N3)
        Pj =   K
               E exp(a in PDVYk + b in RETk +



   where Nk        —l/2[in (1/2) +   in   (1 +     + in   (1 +

    and P° the probability of selecting retirement age k in a conven-

    tional inuitinomial iogit model. As is always the case in logit models, the

    coefficients are identified up to a factor of proportionality only (e.g. the

    utility of alternative states relative to one particular state used as the

    standard of comparison).

9. Both the Small (1981) test and the Hausman—NcFadden test (1981) described in

   Mitchell and Fields (1984a) reject the hypothesis that the ordered logit

    coefficients are identical to those that would be obtained using an ordinary

   multinomial logit model.

10. Simulations using coefficients from a conventional niultinomial logit (MNL)

   model were also evaluated for three of the four experiments. The two sets

    of results differed by less than one month in all cases: Experiment A, +1.6

   months in OL versus +2.0 in MNL; Experiment C, +0.2 months in OL versus +0.3

   months in MNL; Experiment D, +2.9 months in OL versus +3.6 months in MNL.
