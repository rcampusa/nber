                                         ABSTRACT

Prior literature has established a link between changes in market size and pharmaceutical
innovation; whether a link exists with scientific research remains an open question. If upstream
research is not responsive to these changes, the kinds of scientific discoveries that flow into
future drug development could be disconnected from downstream demand. We explore this
question by exploiting the effects of quasi-experimental variation in market size introduced by
Medicare Part D. We find no causal relationship between market size and biomedical research in
the decade following the implementation of Medicare Part D. While many factors have been
shown to motivate scientists to conduct research, this result suggests that changes in market size
provide no such incentive. We do find, however, limited support for a response by corporate
scientists conducting applied research. Implications for pharmaceutical innovation policy are
discussed.

1     Introduction
    "Progress in combating disease depends upon an expanding body of new scientific knowledge."
                                                                                              Vannevar Bush, 1945

    What factors drive innovation? This question has actively engaged scholars dating back to
Schumpeter (1939). While the importance of this question is obvious for firms and policymak-
ers, the answer is neither singular nor simple. Among others, Mowery and Rosenberg (1979)
suggested that both supply-side (`technology push') and demand-side (`demand pull') factors
may impact the innovation process. In general, the technology push view suggests that accu-
mulated knowledge from research and development (R&D) activities drives the introduction of
new products. In contrast, the demand pull view relies on the notion that demand character-
istics (e.g., population, disposable income, and preferences) shape the pattern of investments
in innovation and in research (Kyle, 2020).
    Focusing on demand-side factors, early work by Griliches (1957) and Schmookler (1966)
recognized the importance of profit incentives and market size as drivers of innovation. This
recognition has been carried forward into more recent work. Two seminal papers have estab-
lished a causal link between market size and pharmaceutical innovation (Acemoglu and Linn,
2004; Finkelstein, 2004). Since then, a steady stream of empirical studies has examined how
demand affects drug development (e.g., Agarwal and Gaule, 2021; Blume-Kohout and Sood,
2013; Dranove et al., 2020; Dubois et al., 2015; Garthwaite et al., 2021; Kyle and McGahan,
2012; Lichtenberg and Waldfogel, 2009).1
    These studies, however, focus on the `D' as opposed to the `R' in pharmaceutical R&D. They
consider molecules entering (pre-)clinical trials, new drug approvals, or various other defini-
tions that generally fall within the traditional rubric of `development' as opposed to `research'.
Heretofore, efforts to establish a link between downstream demand and upstream research
have been met with limited success. Acemoglu and Linn (2004) and Finkelstein (2004), for
example, were unable to find a relationship between patenting and demographic-driven expan-
sions or policy-induced expansions in market size, respectively.2,3 In contrast, Bhattacharya

  A few studies confirm these results on innovation responses following market size shocks outside the pharma-
    ceutical industry (e.g., Aghion et al., 2018).
2
  They provide a variety of reasons for this result. First, they highlight the imperfection of their patent match.
    Second, they describe attenuation issues resulting from the delay in the research process. Third, they point
    towards companies being more responsive to profit incentives in later development stages.
3
  In her paper, Finkelstein (2004) argues that "[..] the quick initial response in development suggests the existence
    of a substantial reservoir of technologically feasible products `on the shelf'. The decision to begin clinical trials
    is responsive, on the margin, to increases in the expected economic return to the clinical trial."


                                                           1
and Packalen (2011) use a similar identification strategy as Acemoglu and Linn (2004) and
identify a positive relationship between disease prevalence and upstream research, but cannot
disentangle the increase in societal importance from pure profit incentives. Their finding was
driven by applied research and argued to be conducted at academic medical centers.4 This is
precisely where one would expect clinical studies to occur and the corresponding results to be
published. Hence, the broader link, if it exists, between downstream market size and upstream
(basic) scientific research remains elusive.
       In this paper, we fill this gap and use the introduction of Medicare Part D to examine the
effects of market size on science. For this purpose, we use novel data on scientific publications,
patent-paper links, and drug development efforts mapped to disease categories. Moreover,
while we use similar measures of disease exposure to Medicare Part D (i.e., Medicare market
share) as the extant literature, the use of scientific publications necessitates a categorization
of research at the disease level, as opposed to the therapeutic class level.5 To demonstrate
that our data construction choice does not bias the results, we start by replicating the main
findings of the prior literature exploring the impact of the introduction of Medicare Part D on
drug development (e.g., Blume-Kohout and Sood, 2013; Dranove et al., 2020).
       We make several important contributions to the literature. First, over the decade following
the implementation of Medicare Part D, we find no evidence for a causal relationship between
market size and research. An increase of one standard deviation in the exposure to Medicare
Part D leads to an insignificant increase in scientific publications by only 6.9%. This is sub-
stantially smaller than any effect on drug `development' activities found in the prior literature
and in our replication (+20.2%). These findings support Finkelstein's (2004) assertion that
the link between market size and increases in drug development is driven by a reordering of
products already `on the shelf'. This is also consistent with Dranove et al. (2020), who show
that the upsurge in development is driven by clinical trials of less scientifically novel drugs.
       Second, there exists extensive literature on scientist motivations. For example, scientists
respond to external funding or rewards (e.g., Cohen et al., 2020; Foray and Lissoni, 2010;
Hvide and Jones, 2018; Thursby and Thursby, 2011), altruism and prestige (Stern, 2004),
recognition by the scientific community (Stephan, 2012), research opportunities and academic
freedom (Aghion et al., 2008), public funding (Azoulay et al., 2019; Myers, 2020), and the
desire to work on topics useful for society (Merton, 1973). It also appears that some scientists
are motivated by monetary incentives (Levin and Stephan, 1991; Stephan, 1996), incentivizing
4
    Academic medical centers are hospitals that are linked to medical schools and engage in clinical trials.
5
    In the course of the analysis, we account for demographic changes, public research funding, and new research
      opportunities.


                                                        2
them to engage in patenting (Lach and Schankerman, 2008; Owen-Smith and Powell, 2001;
Thursby et al., 2001). Our findings suggest that these upstream motivations are disconnected
from the direct link to the opportunities created by shifts in downstream demand in the form
of market size changes.
   Third, the degree of product market orientation depends on the type of research affiliation.
For example, on one end of the spectrum, the objectives of corporate scientists will be aligned
with their firms, while on the other end of the spectrum, scientists at the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) may be more interested in basic science research. To explore this variation,
we categorize research activities by four different types of affiliation: the NIH, universities,
academic medical centers, and corporations. Consistent with our core findings, we illustrate
substantial differences in semi-elasticities. A statistically significant increase can only be found
in corporate research (+22.7% in the tenth year after the Medicare Part-D introduction) and
decreases in magnitude by distance to the market (e.g., universities show an insignificant de-
mand response of only +5.8%).
   Fourth, we further refine our analysis by also focusing on the type of research (e.g., applied
or basic). With this refinement, we find that Medicare Part D primarily caused an increase
in corporate affiliated publications linked to both clinical trials and pharmaceutical products,
which are residuals from drug development activities (i.e., applied research). The increase
disappears for corporate affiliated publications that are more basic, which is broadly consistent
with Arora et al. (2018). Similarly, we do not find any causal relationship between the type of
research and market size for universities or academic medical centers. The divergence between
our results and those of Bhattacharya and Packalen (2011) suggests that the differences in the
types of downstream demand matter. In their case, research appears to respond to disease
prevalence, while in our case, it does not respond to changes in disposable income within
those diseases.
   Fifth, not all publications are equal so we generate three different measures of impact. Our
first measure are publications weighted by journal impact factors. Second, we map publications
to patents to approximate whether scientific research was referenced in commercially relevant
applications (Marx and Fuegi, 2020). Finally, we weight the number of publications by the
patent family size associated with the publication. Overall, results remain robust with our core
findings ­ changes in downstream demand have no impact on upstream research.
   Interestingly, there is one exception. In the years directly following the enactment of Medi-
care Part D, a one standard deviation increase in the exposure to Medicare Part D caused an
immediate but transitory 15.8 percent increase in corporate-affiliated patent-weighted research.


                                                 3
This is consistent with the idea that corporate publishing is used strategically in commercial-
ization activities such as patenting (Della Malva and Hussinger, 2012). Finally, we conclude
with a series of robustness tests that redefine the dependent variable, use alternative calcula-
tions of Medicare market size, alternative controls, alternative specifications, alternative event
windows, and different aggregation levels. In all cases, our core results hold.
    Our work has important implications for firms and policymakers. The pharmaceutical in-
dustry is highly dependent upon external technology markets (Higgins and Rodriguez, 2006),
with much of that research emanating from universities (Cockburn and Henderson, 2000).
While drug development (i.e., drugs in clinical trials) appears to respond to downstream shifts
in market demand, our results suggest that upstream research fails to do so. Firms face the
prospect that the flow of research may not meet the kinds of development needs they may
require. This problem is even more significant given the slow decline in corporate-level basic
science research (Arora et al., 2018). This disconnect suggests that a more active role for poli-
cymakers may be needed. For example, in their recent work analyzing the innovation response
to COVID-19, Agarwal and Gaule (2021) argue that policymakers may want to complement a
market expansion with early-stage research incentives.



2     Medicare Modernization Act
In the United States, Medicare is the national health insurance program for the elderly. Prior
to 2006, it only covered drugs administered during in-patient hospital stays or at doctor of-
fices, but it did not cover out-patient prescription drugs. In December 2003, Congress passed
the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA), which imple-
mented the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit as of January 2006.6 This coverage is
available for U.S. residents age 65 and older who fulfill the eligibility criteria of Medicare Part
A and B. In contrast to other Medicare programs, Part D contracts with private companies that
are authorized to sell insurance coverage. It is both regulated and subsidized, especially for
low-income individuals.7
    Medicare Part D covers all drugs that are also covered under Medicaid, which is a federal
program that assists with medical costs for people with limited income, and that fulfill the
following criteria. First, the drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration

(FDA). Second, it must be available only by prescription. Third, the drug is medically necessary
for on-label indications (i.e., this limits off-label usage). Finally, Medicare Part D also covers
biological drugs, insulin, smoking cessation drugs, and vaccines. While insurance plans do not
have to cover all drugs mentioned above, there are certain `protected classes' for which most
drugs are required to be included (e.g., anti-cancer, anti-convulsant, anti-depressants, anti-
psychotic, immuno-suppressant, HIV and AIDS drugs). The program excludes, for example,
drugs that may be covered under Medicare Part A or B and over-the-counter drugs.8
    The implementation of Medicare Part D was one of the most significant recent changes in
the U.S. healthcare system. It was projected to benefit 29 million people in 2006 and 44 million
people by 2015. The expected total public expenditures in the first 10 years were estimated
to be $800 billion.9 This expenditure corresponded to approximately 0.42% of GDP in 2006,
increasing to 0.76% in 2015.10 The program can be categorized as a demand subsidy.
    As expected, Medicare Part D considerably increased prescription drug use by elderly pa-
tients. In Figure 1 we illustrate this development. At the extensive margin, drug use by
Medicare-insured patients increased substantially after 2006, especially in the quartile of dis-
eases most likely to afflict older patients. This implies that previously uninsured elderly are
now able to purchase prescription drugs. The same applies when looking at prescription quan-
tities for both existing and newly insured patients (Appendix Figure A-4). Thus, we can see
that the MMA differentially increased the market size for drugs that are developed to treat
diseases more prevalent among older individuals. This will be a fundamental aspect of our
empirical strategy, which we outline in the next section.



3    Data and Methodology
We are interested in the causal effect of Medicare Part D (i.e., changes in downstream market
demand) on upstream research. If upstream research responded to demand pull effects in the
same way as downstream drug development, we would expect to find an increase in the number
of scientific publications, all else equal. Further, we would also expect to see an increase in
patent-paper links, which can be viewed as an output of basic science research.

Notes: The figures show the evolution of patient counts of each ICD-9 group aggregated by Medicare market
share quartiles. These are patients who received a prescription drug designated to a ICD-9 group disease at least
once in a given year. Our exposure measure to Medicare Part D is described in Section 3.3. The grey bars display
the number of Medicare patients, the blue bars display the non-Medicare patients. Patients are counted multiple
times if they appear in more than one ICD-9 group. MMS quartiles are based on the pre-2004 weighted average of
patient-based MMS. The red line represents the relative increase in the number of Medicare patients with respect
to the baseline year 2003. The figures depict a discrete increase in Medicare patients after 2006 in the highest
age quartile.



3.1       Sample Selection
To create a link between Medicare Part D and R&D activities, we combine data on biomedical
scientific publications from the NIH's MEDLINE/PubMed database and Web of Science (WoS),
patent information from Patstat, and drug development activities from the Clarivate Analyt-
ics' Cortellis Investigational Drugs database by ICD-9 disease categories and their exposure to
Medicare Part D based on the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).
      However, matching publications to disease categories is not straight forward because the
keywords in biomedical publication databases do not correspond one-to-one to standard in-
ternational disease classifications. We take advantage of an existing crosswalk introduced by
Bhattacharya and Packalen (2011), which we update and present in Table A-1. This cross-
walk provides a mapping of Medical Subject Headings (MESH) terms with a range of ICD-9
three-digit codes.11 Since some MeSH terms relate to multiple ICD-9 three-digit codes and

11
     MeSH is a hierarchical medical vocabulary administered by the NLM and consists of approximately


                                                                                                               6
vice versa, MeSH and ICD-9 three-digit codes are grouped at the level of mutually exclusive
ICD-9 groups that comprise similar diseases.12 The crosswalk is not exhaustive. It excludes the
majority of ICD-9 three-digit categories that comprise the words `other' or `unspecified' since
those categories typically include various very distinct diseases.13
    Our final sample includes 129 separate matches at the ICD-9 group level, which corresponds
to 272 unique ICD-9 three-digit codes and 192 high-level MeSH terms.14 We take advantage of
the stringent MeSH hierarchy to extend the initial set of MeSH terms to all synonyms and lower-
level terms. Ultimately, our sample contains 1,563 MeSH terms. Our independent variables
are calculated based on the selected mutually exclusive ICD-9 groups.


3.2     Empirical Strategy
We illustrate our empirical strategy through a case study (Figure 2). We select two disease
categories from our panel, one with a very high Medicare market share (MMS), Alzheimer's
disease, and one with a very low MMS, inflammatory skin diseases. We show that the trends in
the number of scientific publications and number of preclinical trials (drug discoveries) related
to either Alzheimer's or inflammatory skin diseases are parallel before the passage of Medicare
Part D in 2003. While the low-MMS inflammatory skin diseases seem to be uncorrelated with
the MMA in the science and technology sphere, the high-MMS Alzheimer's disease increases
disproportionately from 20 to 60 drug candidates (i.e., drug development). This, however,
does not occur with publications (i.e., research), where the trends remain parallel after 2003.
    In our multivariate analyses, we exploit the passage of the MMA by using the variation
in exposure measured by the 1997-2003 MMS. To this end, we use a panel data model that


    30.000 different terms in 2020 (https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/search) [last accessed on March 8, 2021].
    The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) is adminis-
    tered by the World Health Organization. The 9th version (ICD-9) comprises around 13,000 codes
    (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9cm.htm) [last accessed on March 8, 2021].
12
   There exists no official publicly administrated crosswalk between ICD-9 and MeSH terms. NIH resources like
    the UMLS Metathesaurus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9684/ [last accessed on March 8, 2021])
    only include selected 1-to-1 matches. The usage of the PubMed search algorithm, which searches for terms
    in titles and abstracts, is infeasible because it requires the user to search for all possible synonyms. Further-
    more, identifying appropriate MeSH terms for each ICD-9 category using the MeSH on demand algorithm
    (https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/MeSHonDemand [last accessed on March 8, 2021]) requires an expert assess-
    ment in case of multiple results.
13
   The match is further limited to ICD-9 codes that appear more than 100 times in the MEPS data from 2007.
    It excludes the following ICD-9 categories: pregnancy (class 11), congenital (class 14), perinatal (class 15),
    symptoms (class 16), injuries (class 17), and services (class V).
14
   In addition to the 127 disease categories in Bhattacharya and Packalen (2011), we include two major diseases
    that they excluded: HIV and Alzheimer's disease. Our results are not sensitive to their inclusion.

observes each disease-related MeSH term by year. The MeSH terms m are nested within ICD-
9 disease groups i(m) (defined as i in the following), which in turn constitute the level of
treatment exposure. To capture the dynamics of the effect, we amend the standard Difference-
in-Differences framework by replacing the post-period dummy with three-year binned sets of
leads from 2004 onward. Hence, we compare research-related outcome variables before and
after the introduction of Medicare Part D between more and less affected MeSH terms. Our
empirical model can be written as follows:

                                                            2016

where Nmt represents the dependent variable (e.g., the number of publications per MeSH term
in year t ). The interaction terms MMSi × 1{ t = t } indicate the exposure to the MMA and whether
we are in the pre- or in the post-MMA periods (i.e., t  2004). Consistent with prior literature
on market size and R&D, our empirical model includes controls for the future demographic
driven market size, Mit , past public research funding, NIHit , and research opportunities, Kit .
Given the differences in the level of R&D activities between diseases, we include MeSH term
fixed effects, m . The inclusion of this large set of fixed effects (>1,500) reduces our sample of


                                                                                                      8
analysis: 29 MeSH terms are dropped from our main specification due to lack of variation in the
dependent variable.15 We show the robustness of our results to the full sample by substituting
the MeSH term fixed effects with the smaller set of ICD-9 group fixed effects, i . Furthermore,
we control for time trends using calendar year effects,  t . In alternative specifications, we
                                                                               2016
interact the MMS with a full set of two-year binned leads and lags,            t =1997
                                                                                          t MMSi × 1{ t = t } .16
In this setting, we normalize the coefficient  t=2002/3 to zero and express the dynamic treatment
effects relative to this pre-treatment year. This will also allow us to examine whether the
parallel trends assumption holds.
     We estimate the relative change of R&D activity using Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood
regressions. Since our dependent variables are count data, Poisson is the preferred econometric
model in panels (Hausman et al., 1984). Under our identification assumption,  t gives us
the average causal effect of the MMA in year t . The coefficients can be interpreted as semi-
elasticities and we cluster standard errors at the MeSH term level.17
     When replicating prior findings relating the effect of Part D on drug development, we turn
to an analysis at the ICD-9 three-digit code level, Nct . This is the most fine-grained level of
observation for our clinical trial data. ICD-9 three-digit codes, c, are again nested in ICD-9
groups i(c). In these specifications, we include ICD-9 three-digit code fixed effects, c (as a
robustness check: ICD-9 group fixed effects, i ), while all other parts of Equation 1 remain the
same.18
     Lastly, we investigate other variation by splitting the dependent variable along several cat-
egories, such as affiliation, journal type, clinical relevance, and funding source. We use this
battery of dependent variables to explore treatment effects along the entire scientific and in-
novation value chain.


3.3     Medicare Market Share
We exploit variation across disease categories in their pre-Medicare Part D market share (MMS),
expecting larger increases in scientific research in disease categories with higher MMS. Follow-
ing prior studies on Medicare Part D (e.g., Blume-Kohout and Sood, 2013; Dranove et al., 2020;
15
   When investigating sub-samples of the outcome variable, in some cases a larger number of MeSH terms are
    dropped due to lack of variation.
16
   Our post-treatment period overlaps with the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010. However, this
    is not a concern because ACA involved only low reimbursement for pharmaceuticals and, thus, small revenue
    increases and incentives from market size (Garthwaite et al., 2021).
17
   A one percentage point higher MMSi leads to a change of the dependent variable Nmt of  t × 100 percent.
18
   Again, some ICD-9 three-digit codes are dropped from our main specification due to lack of variation in the
    dependent variable.


                                                      9
Duggan and Scott Morton, 2010; Hermosilla and Wu, 2018; Krieger et al., 2018), we build a
measure of a disease category's exposure to Medicare Part D based on MEPS.19 Unlike most of
these studies, we use ICD-9 disease categories as our level of observations and not therapeutic
classes because scientific articles are typically indexed by keywords corresponding to diseases.
In MEPS, each patient-level drug prescription is associated with a designated disease, an in-
dicator of whether the beneficiary was insured by Medicare, and the patient's age. Using this
data we calculate the MMS for each disease at the ICD-9 three-digit level and the more aggre-
gated ICD-9 group level. The latter corresponds with the level of our match between ICD-9
and MeSH terms, and, thus, with the level of our empirical analysis on biomedical science.
     It is plausible that researchers could anticipate the market size increase since the authoriza-
tion of the MMA in December 2003. Thus, we calculate the fraction of patient counts, prescrip-
tion counts, and quantity weighted prescription counts filed by Medicare-covered individuals
compared to all individuals for each disease category as a weighted-average between 1997
and 2003.20 The categories with the highest MMS are Alzheimer, Retinal Diseases, Cataract,
and Angina Pectoris. Among the diseases with the lowest MMS are Hyperkinetic Syndrome of
Childhood, Scarlet Fever, Infantile Cerebral Palsy, and Inflammatory Skin Diseases. The distribu-
tion of our MMS at the ICD-9 group level is presented in Figure 3, has a mean of 32%, and is in
line with other studies (e.g., Dranove et al., 2020; Hermosilla and Wu, 2018). Critically, it does
not vary with the ICD-9 level, sample selection, or the use of (quantity weighted) prescription
counts (Appendix Figure A-3). We are confident in our sample of 129 ICD-9 disease groups as
our level of analysis since we are able to replicate the main results of the prior literature.21

   We weight each survey respondent in MEPS by their representativeness, thereby creating a person-level sampling

   Our disease level data allows us to replicate the development of quantities, drug prices, and revenues. We
    document the positive effect of Medicare Part D on drug consumption (Appendix Figure A-4). Moreover, in
    line with Duggan and Scott Morton (2010) and Duggan and Scott Morton (2011), drug prices decrease between
    2006 and 2009 since patients were able to switch to cheaper insurance plans. However, prices increased after
    2009 (holding the 2003-2005 drug basket for each disease constant). Despite the initial price declines, by
    2006 revenues increased disproportionately for high MMS diseases. This suggests that the quantity increase
    outweighs the initial price decline (Appendix Figure A-5).

Notes: The figure presents the distribution of MMS scores among ICD-9 groups that are included in the MeSH-
ICD-9 crosswalk by Bhattacharya and Packalen (2011). We use the patient-weighted average of each year between
1997-2003. The annual MMS are calculated using the total number of patients in Medicare relative to all patients
for each ICD-9 group.



tions (also referred to as PMIDs) with at least one of the 1,563 MeSH terms linked to the 129
ICD-9 groups. We then restrict our sample to U.S. publications. Next, we match these publi-
cations with bibliographic data from Web of Science (WoS) to take advantage of WoS's proper
author name and affiliation disambiguation. The WoS data enables us to look at various splits
in the publication data, such as the affiliation type (i.e., NIH, university, corporate, academic
medical centers),22 and appliedness of the journal.23 Moreover, the WoS bibliographic infor-
mation allows us to add information regarding forward citations and journal impact factors.
     The coverage of PMIDs in WoS is high, which gives confidence in capturing all relevant
papers related to medical science. Moreover, we extract for each paper all indexed MeSH
terms from the Pubmed database to classify whether a publication is related to disease terms
that are not in our sample. Since we do not know the exposure of these additional disease-
related MeSH to the MMA, we treat them as potentially confounding and cautiously drop them
from the sample. Beyond that, we use all indexed MeSH terms to classify whether a publication

22
   We infer the affiliation type from the disambiguated Web of Science publication data based on the string name
    of each affiliation. Academic medical center are identified using the string `hospital'. Corporate affiliations are
    identified using legal forms like `Corp.' or `Inc.'.
23
   We use a classification of journals based on the proportion of published research coming from a general hospital
    and industry using the publicly available data set provided by Tijssen (2010). For more information, see:
    https://www.vosviewer.com/journal-application-domain-map [last accessed on March 8, 2021].


                                                                                                                                     11
is related to clinical trials or pharmaceutical products.24,25
     Next, we measure the extent of the research efforts related to a disease group by counting
the number of matched scientific publications at the MeSH term level. Publications might be
associated with more than one ICD-9 group, so that we account for this in two alternative
ways: we treat them either as simple counts for each disease group separately or weight them
by the inverse number of linked diseases that sum up to one across all disease groups. The
resulting final data set spans from 1997 to 2016 and includes 449,996 unique publications.


Patents

We use references in patents to the scientific non-patent literature (SNPL) to identify knowledge
diffusion between upstream research and more downstream innovation activities, like patent-
ing (e.g., Ahmadpoor and Jones, 2017; Marx and Fuegi, 2020; Poege et al., 2019; Watzinger
and Schnitzer, 2019).26 We locate publications that are directly cited in a patent by matching
the Pubmed-patent link constructed by Marx and Fuegi (2020) to our sample of scientific pub-
lications. Thus, we weight U.S. scientific publications by an indicator variable that specifies
whether a publication was cited as a SNPL within a 5-year window.27 This applies to 19,891
biomedical scientific publications.28


Clinical Drug Development

To measure the impact of Medicare Part D on drug development activities, we use time-series
data from Cortellis on all clinical drug development events by disease categories at each stage
in the pharmaceutical development process. We link the Cortellis targeted conditions to ICD-9

24
   The category `clinical trials' includes all MeSH terms that are related to the MeSH ID `D016430' (Clinical Trial)
    and the entire set of MeSH terms at the hierarchy levels below, such as `Adaptive', `Phase I', `Phase II', `Phase
    III', `Phase IV', `Controlled Clinical Trial' or `Randomized Controlled Trial'.
25
   The category `pharmaceutical products' includes all MeSH terms that are related to the MeSH ID `D004364'
    (Pharmaceutical Preparations) and the entire set of MeSH terms at the hierarchy levels below, such as `Dosage
    Forms', `Drug Combinations', `Drugs, Generic', `Drugs, Investigational', `Pharmaceutic Aids' or `Prescription
    Drugs'.
26
   Patents reference various types of documents that relate to the protected invention by either determining novelty
    (prior art) or explaining the content of the underlying invention. A subset of these references relates to scientific
    articles, called SNPL references (Poege et al., 2019).
27
   We aggregate all citing patent applications at the DOCDB family level and calculate the 5-year window from
    the year of the scientific publication to the year of the priority year of the patent family.
28
   The publication-patent link may suffer from attrition because late publications have not yet been cited in patents.
    However, we have little reason to expect that the time to patent varies systematically by MMS. This is supported
    by our finding that the minimum time lag between a scientific article's publication year and a patent's priority
    year is uncorrelated with the MMS (i.e., the pairwise correlation is -0.0365).

codes using the crosswalk by Dranove et al. (2020) and identify unique new molecular entities
(NME) entering Phase I, Phase II, or Phase III clinical testing, as well as being submitted to the
FDA for approval.29 The data comprises 201 ICD-9 three-digit codes and 121 ICD-9 groups. We
then limit the sample to NMEs that are discovered/tested/approved in the U.S., and include
information on the target-based action and at least one designated disease. If a clinical trial
occurs more than once for a NME-disease link, we use the first event. To be consistent with our
science level analysis, we count the number of NMEs at the more fine-grained ICD-9 three-digit
code level, which is nested within our ICD-9 groups. In total, we identify 9,943 NMEs entering
at least one phase of the drug development process.


3.5     Control Variables
The empirical model includes a set of additional determinants of R&D: projected market size,
public research funding, and research opportunities. A detailed description of the control vari-
ables construction can be found in the Appendix A. First, we control for the projected mar-
ket size due to U.S. population growth (Acemoglu and Linn, 2004; Blume-Kohout and Sood,
2013). For this purpose, we use demographic (projection) data from the UN World Population
Prospects. Figure 4a illustrates the average development of the population-growth driven pro-
jected market size before and after the introduction of Medicare Part D. While market size will
increase in all disease categories, diseases in the highest quartile of MMS exhibit the sharpest
growth due to an aging population.30
     Second, we control for previous years' public research funding related to each disease cat-
egory. Therefore, we calculate for each of our 129 ICD-9 groups the exposure to the NIH
budget over time by linking each group to the relevant NIH Institute/Center (e.g., ICD-9 162
malignant neoplasm of trachea, bronchus, and lung to the National Cancer Institute).31 Figure
4b presents the normalized average NIH spending by ICD-9 groups in each MMS quartile. It
becomes apparent that diseases in the lowest quartile of MMS are associated with the largest
relative increase of NIH funding. However, high MMS diseases receive a substantially higher
level of NIH funding.32
29
   Dranove et al. (2020) had two expert medical coders independently code the concordance between Cortellis
    indications and ICD-9 codes.
30
   We also calculate projected market size at the OECD level. Figure A-1 illustrates the evolution.
31
   Since grants are distributed within Institutes primarily by scientific merit (see discussion on NIH funding rules
    by Azoulay et al. (2019)) and not by allocation to narrower disease categories, we attribute the full Institute's
    budget to each ICD-9 group. We retrieve NIH spending data (Mechanism Detail by IC, FY 1983-2019) from
    https://officeofbudget.od.nih.gov/spending_hist.html [downloaded on February 17, 2020].
32
   In an alternative approach we attribute budgets based on the share of all publications in a disease category that

Notes: The three figures present the normalized annual control variables by MMS quartiles over time. In Figure
4a, we aggregate the U.S. population-growth driven market size (in 2003 values) of each ICD-9 group. In Figure
4b, we average the NIH spending (in 2003 values) of all Institutes/Centers, which are related to our ICD-9 groups.
In Figure 4c, we accumulate the number of new MESH terms associated with our ICD-9 groups.


                                       Third, we account for the availability of research opportunities.33 We develop a direct mea-
sure of new research opportunities in a disease area based on the introduction of new terms in
the respective branch of the MeSH tree. New terms are added for emerging diseases, break-
downs of existing diseases, and additional terminology to reflect topical areas that are not well
represented in MeSH. Figure 4c shows substantial heterogeneity in new research opportunities
across ICD-9 groups. High MMS diseases exhibit greater increases in research opportunities
around 2000.

33
              In similar fashion, Bhattacharya and Packalen (2011) construct a measure of research opportunities based on
               the content of research inputs and the first appearance of the idea in a scientific publication. The disadvantage
               of the approach is that it relies on a very narrow set of research inputs that relate primarily to drug-related
               medical research but not basic science.

4     Descriptive Analysis
Our final data set consists of 129 disease groups from 1997 to 2016. This allows us to investi-
gate the possible effects of Medicare Part D on scientific research over a period of 13 post-MMA
years. Each of the 129 ICD-9 groups in our sample is associated with, on average, 12.1 disease
MeSH terms. For 121 of these ICD-9 groups, we find drug development activities in around
1.7 ICD-9 three-digit codes per group.
     Table 1 provides summary statistics for the full set of independent and dependent vari-
ables in the year 2003. The average MeSH term has 16.86 scientific publications, which totals
around 204 per ICD-9 group. The majority of publications (77.8%) have at least one author
with a university affiliation, 13.6% have at least one author with an academic medical center
affiliation, 5.4% have a corporate affiliation, and 4.9% are published with NIH participation.
Moreover, 6.2% of these publications are cited in patent applications. This share, however, is
substantially larger for corporate publications (14.3%). At the same time, 2.03 NMEs enter
pre-clinical trials per ICD-9 three-digit code. This number decreases throughout the clinical
trial process resulting in 0.09 new drug approvals per ICD-9 group in 2003.
     A simple comparison between ICD-9 groups split at the MMS median illustrates that both
groups are very similar regarding the pre-MMA levels in the majority of dependent variables
(Appendix Table A-2). This also applies to the distribution of dependent variables (Appendix
Figure A-6). An important exception is that diseases prevalent among the elderly are more
related to clinically relevant journals and patents. This is not surprising since the overall market
size is larger, in levels, before the MMA. Moreover, the MMS is positively correlated with the
level of all independent variables. This supports our decision to control for these factors in our
multivariate analysis.
     Descriptively, the total yearly log-transformed number of scientific publications in low or
high MMS ICD-9 disease groups develops in a parallel fashion until 2003. This provides visual
support for our parallel trends assumption of our Difference-in-Differences framework (see
Figure 5a).34 These trends also hold across other dependent variables, like corporate publica-
tions (see Figure 5b).35 After 2004, the log number of publications associated with high-MMS
diseases increase disproportionately, but only to a small degree. This divergence is more pro-
nounced for publications from corporate affiliates.
     Parallel trends are also supported by the annual count of drug discoveries and approvals

34
   Formal tests for parallel trends, e.g., by splitting the pre-period and testing whether there are differential changes
    in the slope, are employed and found supportive (Appendix Tables A-3 and A-7).
35
   Further univariate graphs with other dependent variables can be found in Appendix Figure A-7.

Notes: This table presents summary statistics linked to the 129 ICD-9 groups in 2003. The unit of observation
is at the ICD-9 group level for both the treatment and control variables; at the MeSH term level for the depen-
dent publication variables; and at the ICD-9 three-digit code level for dependent drug development variables.
Some MeSH terms and ICD-9 three-digit codes lack variation in the dependent variable so that the corresponding
observations are dropped from the estimations.



in Figures 5c and 5d, which evolve in a similar fashion for low- and high-MMS diseases until
2003. The number of drug discoveries and drug approvals increases after 2003. As such,
we can replicate the prior literature (Blume-Kohout and Sood, 2013; Dranove et al., 2020)
descriptively within our sample of ICD-9 groups.

                                  This descriptive analysis suggests that the introduction of Medicare Part D and, thus, the
sudden insurance-induced increase of market size for diseases more prevalent among the el-
derly, has led to more commercial drug development activities. Upstream research activities,
in general, seem to be more resilient to these changes in downstream market size. However,
upstream research conducted by corporations appears more elastic in high MMS disease cate-
gories after the MMA.
                                  The following multivariate analysis will investigate this pattern in more detail, accounting

for other factors like demographic trends, public funding, and new research opportunities that
may have an impact on R&D outcomes besides Medicare Part D.



5                            Empirical Results ­ Clinical Drug Development
We start by replicating prior results showing the effect of the MMA on clinical drug develop-
ment. This replication exercise provides validation for our sample selection and variable con-
struction. Moreover, the results of this analysis will enable us to compare the effects among
scientific research and drug development activities within our sample. Figure 6 shows the
event study results similar to Equation 1. The dependent variables are the number of newly
discovered NMEs and the number of drug approvals, respectively.

Notes: The figures show the event study estimates and the 90 percent confidence bands of Poisson pseudo-
maximum likelihood regressions with high-dimensional fixed effects following Equation 1. The unit of observation
is the ICD-9 three-digit code level, with MMS being calculated based on patient counts at the ICD-9 group level.
The sample includes all ICD-9 groups appearing in the Bhattacharya and Packalen (2011) crosswalk. Standard
errors are clustered at the ICD-9 three-digit code level.



                         In line with our descriptive analysis, the number of new drug discoveries and the number
of drug approvals display broadly similar patterns independent of the pre-MMA MMS. This
suggests the absence of confounding pre-trends. After the passage of the MMA in 2003, dis-
ease categories with higher exposure to Medicare Part D exhibit a relative increase in drug
discoveries. The effect becomes larger over time and is statistically significant. The same holds
true for drug approvals. However, there is a significant up-tick directly after the introduction
of Medicare Part D in 2004 and 2005.36

            We show the event study results of other drug related outcome variables in Appendix Figure A-8.


                                                                                                                   18
    Next, Table 2 presents the dynamic treatment effect of our Difference-in-Differences esti-
mation in the post-period. Columns 1 and 2 present the results on drug discoveries with and
without control variables. In Columns 3 and 4 we present NMEs in all stages of the clinical
development process. Finally, Columns 5 and 6 present clinical trials in Phase I-III and drug
approvals separately. We find a positive and significant effect of a higher MMS on early drug
development, accelerating over time. In our preferred specification, in which we control for
the future market size, past NIH funding, and research opportunities, the effect becomes sig-
nificant after 2011. This is consistent with the long discovery process in the pharmaceutical
industry. The point estimate in 2015-2016 has a magnitude of 0.87%. This implies that one
standard deviation (23.2 percentage points) increase in MMS leads to 20.2% more drug dis-
coveries. These effects are similar in magnitude compared to Dranove et al. (2020) and slightly
smaller than the results of Blume-Kohout and Sood (2013).
    The effects are smaller and occur later when looking at drug development in all stages
of clinical development or NMEs in Phase I-III clinical trials. However, this is not surprising
given the staggered fashion of drug development (from preclinical to clinical trials to approval)
and supported by other studies on drug development (Blume-Kohout and Sood, 2013). An
exception are drug approvals, which show a positive significant increase immediately after the
introduction of the MMA in 2004-2005 by 2.5% per additional percentage point of MMS. These
results strongly support Finkelstein (2004) and suggest that pharmaceutical companies reacted
by pushing forward advanced drug candidates already in their development pipeline.



6     Empirical Results ­ Biomedical Research
In this section, we evaluate whether Medicare Part D affected scientific research (measured by
publications) for disease categories with higher MMS. Importantly, we differentiate by the type
of affiliation as well as type of research and investigate the (commercial) impact.


6.1    Main Effect
First, we evaluate whether Medicare Part D differentially affected scientific research in MeSH
categories associated with high MMS ICD-9 disease groups from all types of affiliations. Our
event study results in Figure 7 are based on a Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regression
with the full set of control variables, MeSH term and calendar year fixed effects (adapting
Equation 1). Overall, we see no pre-MMA effect on scientific publications suggesting the ab-

sence of confounding pre-trends. After the passage of Medicare Part D, we observe only a slight
divergence for the average MeSH category, which is neither significantly different from zero
nor large in magnitude.
    We quantify the changes in scientific research in response to the Part D demand shock in
Table 3. In Columns 1 and 2, we report the results from a simple Difference-in-Differences
regression. The post-treatment period is defined to start in 2004 and to last until the end
of our sample's observation period in 2016. Again, there is no significant effect on scientific
publications, independent of the usage of control variables.
    In Columns 3 to 6, we estimate the dynamic changes in science. The first time period shows
the transitional effect between the passage and the implementation of Medicare Part D. The

Notes: The figure shows the event study estimates and the 90 percent confidence bands of Poisson pseudo-
maximum likelihood regressions with high-dimensional fixed effects following Equation 1. The unit of observation
is the MeSH term level, with MMS being calculated based on patient counts at the ICD-9 group level. Standard
errors are clustered at the MeSH term level.



post-implementation effects are divided in three-year bins. Column 3 presents the effect of the
MMA on MeSH categories related to high MMS diseases without controls. Results are close to
zero and insignificant. Adding control variables in Columns 4 to 6 increases the coefficients
but not the interpretation of the results. Our preferred specification (Equation 1) in Column 6
includes the full set of controls and serves as the baseline for the further analysis.
       Under the assumption that there was no relationship between MMS and scientific activity
prior to 2003, positive coefficients would indicate that the Part D demand shock led to an
increased number of scientific publications in a given time period. This does not seem to be
the case. Ten years from the passage of Medicare Part D, the point estimate can be interpreted
as one additional percentage point in MMS resulting in 0.3% additional publications. This
is considerably below the effect size on drug discoveries.37 Taking the point estimate at face
value, a MMS increase of one standard deviation (23.2 percentage points) leads to only 6.9%
additional scientific publications compared to 20.2% additional drug discoveries. This can be
considered as fairly inelastic.

     The 95th percentile confidence interval rules out an increase greater than 0.9%, which is approximately the
      effect of drug discoveries in Table 2.

6.2     Type of Affiliation
We expect the relationship between market size and scientific research to depend on prod-
uct market orientation. Biomedical scientists with corporate affiliations have direct financial
ties to the market for prescription drugs. Their objectives should be aligned with those of the
pharmaceutical industry (Henderson and Cockburn, 1996). Moreover, corporate scientists par-
ticipate in the publication of the results of clinical trials in scientific journals. The latter also
applies to scientists and practitioners at academic medical centers, who play an intermediary
role between industry and academia (Lander and Atkinson-Grosjean, 2011; Lander, 2013).
For scientists at universities is the relationship more subtle since market orientation differs
across scientists and depends on a variety of factors (elaborated in Foray and Lissoni, 2010),
but should be overall less pronounced compared to corporate scientists.

Notes: The figures show the event study estimates and the 90 percent confidence bands of Poisson pseudo-
maximum likelihood regressions with high-dimensional fixed effects following Equation 1. The unit of observation
is the MeSH term level. The dependent variable is the annual number of scientific publications split by at least
one author's affiliation. Standard errors are clustered at the MeSH term level.



                         In the following analysis, we split our dependent variable by whether the publication was
coauthored by at least one scientist who was affiliated with the NIH, a university, an academic
medical center, or a corporation. Figure 8 shows the event study results, displaying the yearly
excess publications in high MMS relative to low MMS MeSH categories. The effects go along
with our predictions: the increase is least pronounced in the public research sphere at the NIH
and most pronounced in the private research sphere at corporations. This is consistent with
the idea that the market orientation of scientists matters.
                         Table 4 quantifies the Medicare Part D demand responses by affiliation subgroup. We find
a statistically significant positive effect only among scientific publications with at least one
corporate affiliation following the introduction of Medicare Part D, which increases gradually
over time. The timing of the effect is consistent with the results of Blume-Kohout and Sood
(2013), where the response magnifies through 2009 and appears to stabilize after 2012. In
contrast, scientific publications with at least one university scientist have substantially smaller


                                                                                                                    23
coefficients.38 The demand response from academic medical centers sits plausibly in-between
universities and industry.
       The point estimates of our analysis suggest that scientific research at non-corporate affili-
ations is less responsive to changes in market size compared to drug development within the
same sample of ICD-9 groups. For instance, a MMS increase of one standard deviation (23.2
percentage points) leads to only 5.8% (7.9%) of additional scientific publications from univer-
sity (academic medical center) scientists. The effect on scientific research directly conducted
at the NIH is essentially zero. However, the same market size expansion leads to an increase
of scientific publications coming from industry by 22.7%. This resembles the magnitude of our
findings on drug development from Section 5. In the following sections, we will investigate
which type of research drives this effect.
       As outlined in Section 2, private insurance plans, which fall under the scope of Medicare
Part D, do not have to cover all approved drugs. However, there are certain `protected drug
classes' for which most drugs are required to be included (e.g., anti-cancer, anti-convulsant,
anti-depressants, anti-psychotic, immuno-suppressant, HIV and AIDS drugs). Hence, we dis-
tinguish between ICD-9 groups that correspond to `unprotected' or `protected' drug classes. Our
results in Appendix Figure A-12 correspond with our expectations and the previous literature
(Blume-Kohout and Sood, 2013; Dranove et al., 2020): the only specification that contains
statistically significant effects is the model focused on corporate affiliated scientists publishing
in `protected' ICD-9 groups.


6.3        Type of Research
Given the rise of corporate science in response to Medicare Part D, we investigate the vertical
orientation of these research publications. To this end, we differentiate between scientific
publications that are related to the development of drugs (i.e., more applied in nature) and
more basic science. We add the full set of MeSH terms to each publications and identify those
MeSH terms that are related to clinical trials and those that are related to pharmaceutical
products. We interpret the residual as fairly basic research. Finally, we split the dependent
variable by the appliedness of the journal.
       We show in Table 5 that the increases in corporate scientific publishing are more articulated
among publications that relate to clinical trials and pharmaceutical products but less so in basic

38
     These results are quantitatively similar but less precise for publications from only corporate affiliations. This is
      consistent with the idea that pharmaceutical industry and university research are interlinked (Henderson and
      Cockburn, 1996).

science. The latter is supported by the fact that there is no increase in publications, for which
the scientists received a NIH grant, a good proxy for the basicness of research. There is also
no demand response on clinical trial and pharmaceutical product-related scientific research at
universities or academic medical centers (Appendix Table A-17).39 These results are supported
by our event study analyses (Appendix Figure A-13) indicating that the disproportionate in-
creases in clinical trials and pharmaceutical product publications for corporation are not driven
by pre-existing trends but by the introduction of Medicare Part D. The magnitudes of the effects
on corporate applied science are substantially larger compared to all (other) types of research.
39
     If at all, there is evidence for crowding out in those areas with the strongest increase among corporate publica-
      tions: pharmaceutical products related publications.

Notes: Columns (1) to (6) show the estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions with high-
dimensional fixed effects. The unit of observation is the MeSH term by year. In Columns (1) to (3), the dependent
variable is the number of university scientific publications and in Column (4)-(6) the number of corporate scientific
publications, both split by the type of research. Columns (2) and (5) include only publications that are associated
with MeSH terms related to clinical trials, and Columns (3) and (6) with MeSH terms related to pharmaceutical
products. Column (1) and (4) include the residual. The control variables are log-transformed. Standard errors
are clustered at the MeSH term level and shown in parentheses. Significance levels: * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, ***

    These results are consistent with our findings on the appliedness of journals. The demand
response is most pronounced for research published in clinical practice, industry practice, and
clinical-industrial journals driven by corporate research activity (Appendix Table A-16) and not
by universities (Appendix Table A-15). We view our findings as evidence for the interpretation
that a majority of corporate scientific publications, which result from the increase in market
size, are related to actual drug development activities (e.g., published clinical trial results) and
do not constitute basic research. It supports the notion that demand pull effects are not strong
enough to encourage true basic science ­ not even within industry.

6.4        Research Impact
In the last part of the analysis, we explore the impact of scientific research both within the
scientific domain and beyond. As outlined in Section 3.4 we trace scientific publications to
patents. These patent-paper linkages approximate whether scientific research got referenced
in commercially relevant applications (Marx and Fuegi, 2020), in our context pharmaceutical
and biomedical patents. Thus, we weight scientific publications by the journal impact factor
(which is less affected by truncation compared to forward citations), by the 5-year availability
of patents, and by the patent family size.
       Our impact-weighted results in Table 6 show a similar but more noisy pattern with smaller
magnitudes than the overall unweighted publication counts. Within the science domain, there
is a disproportionate increase in corporate JIF-weighted publications (although not significant),
which is substantially smaller for university publications. The magnitude of the corporate effect
is around 50% of the effect on simple counts. This suggests that the effects on corporate science
are more pronounced at the extensive (quantity) margin and less so when quality-weighted.
       Patent-weighted publications increase primarily among corporate affiliations. The strongest
effect is found initially after the passage of Medicare Part D. Corporate scientific research that
ends up cited in a patent, increases by 0.68% in the years 2004-2005. This corresponds to an
increase of 15.8% given a MMS increase of one standard deviation. The effect size decreases
in the following years but reaches similar levels after 2011. The quick initial response suggests
the existence of a reservoir of scientific research `on the shelf' available for commercialization.
This is consistent with prior literature, which suggests that publishing corporate science is
used strategically in the patenting process (Della Malva and Hussinger, 2012). An alternative
explanation is that industry became more likely to patent ideas from scientific publications as
a reaction to the discrete increase in market size.40



7        Robustness Checks
We conduct a variety of robustness checks, which can be found in the Appendix. The demand
response of corporate scientific research to the increase in market size is robust across a va-
riety of changes, unless otherwise stated. The same applies to the inelastic response of all
publications, across all other types of affiliation.


40
     Family-size weighted publications show a similar pattern, except for an arbitrary decrease in 2015-2016. All
      results are more pronounced when looking at event studies (Appendix Figure A-14).

Notes: Columns (1) to (6) show the estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions with high-
dimensional fixed effects. The unit of observation is the MeSH term by year. In Columns (1) to (2), the dependent
variable is the journal impact factor-weighted number of university/corporate scientific publications. In Columns
(3) to (4), the dependent variable is the number of university/corporate scientific publications that are associated
with at least one patent application (patent-weighted). In Columns (5) to (6), we weight the number of scientific
publications by the size of the average patent family associated with the publication. A patent/family size-weight is
calculated based on the patent family's first application being filed within five years from the scientific publication.
The control variables are log-transformed. Standard errors are clustered at the MeSH term level and shown in
parentheses. Significance levels: * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.



    First, we redefine the dependent variable as a count of the annual number of scientific pub-
lications weighted by the inverse number of linked diseases (fractional counts) to account for
multiple disease MeSH terms per publication. We also winsorize the dependent variable to
deal with outliers (Figure A-10, Table A-8 and A-12).
    Second, we calculate different exposure variables, for example, MMS based on prescription
counts/quantity, binary indicators, and MMS based on 2003 values only (Figure A-11).
    Third, we use alternative control variables such as the OECD market size or NIH funding
calculated as a share of all publications in a disease category that acknowledge a specific Insti-
tute. Moreover, we include control variables that do not accumulate future/past periods but


                                                          28
only consider year t (Table A-9 for all publications, Table A-13 for university publications, and
Table A-14 for corporate publications).
   Fourth, we estimate our model with different specifications, e.g., using ICD-9 group fixed
effects and cluster standard errors at the ICD-9 group level as elaborated in Section 3.2. Addi-
tionally, we employ linear regression with count dependent variables. In the latter specification,
we find a significant increase in overall scientific publications, which suggests that MeSH terms
with a high number of pre-MMA publications profit from a larger market in absolute counts
but not relatively (Table A-9). The magnitude of this effect is substantially lower for university
publications (Table A-13) than for corporate publications (Table A-14) when comparing the
coefficients to the pre-MMA sample mean.
   Fifth, we restrict our dependent variable to publications in which all authors are affiliated
with universities or firms, respectively. While the effect sizes remain quantitatively similar,
the estimation becomes less precise (Figure A-10) since we lose variation in the dependent
variables. We also restrict the sample to publications in which all authors have a U.S. affiliation.
This does not change the results (Table A-11).
   Sixth, we re-investigate the effects including the year of the MMA implementation (2005)
into our baseline period. This does not change the results regarding the type of affiliations or
the type of research. The effects on patent-weighted publications disappear. This, however, is
not surprising given that our initial findings showed primarily a disproportionate increase in
2004-2005 (Table A-18).
   Seventh, we include all publications in our sample regardless of whether they include addi-
tional disease-related MeSH terms with unknown MMS. In our default specifications, we cau-
tiously drop these publications since we do not know the exposure of these additional disease-
related MeSH terms to the MMA (potentially confounding). Including them does not change
the results (Table A-19).
   Lastly, we chose different aggregation levels for our analysis. In Table A-20, we aggregate
the dependent variable to the ICD-9 group level. Our results are robust to this aggregation.
   Our results on drug development are robust to estimations using all ICD-9 three-digit codes
available instead of the subset mentioned in Bhattacharya and Packalen (2011), ICD-9 group
level fixed effects instead of ICD-9 three-digit code level fixed effects (both in Table A-4), al-
ternative controls (Table A-5), alternative MMS calculations (Figure A-9), and including the
MMA implementation in 2005 into our baseline period (Table A-6).

8        Thought Experiment ­ Incentivizing Upstream Research
We conclude with a thought experiment. For this example and the ensuing back-of-the-
envelope calculation, we will take our results at face value. The goal is to explore the magnitude
of the linkage between changes in downstream demand and upstream research. We start by
assuming that scientific publications are mutually exclusive, meaning they are either catego-
rized as a university, academic medical center, or corporate publication. From our preferred
specification, a MMS increase of one standard deviation (23.2 percentage points) in exposure
to Medicare Part D, leads to around 1,830 additional publications per year.41 These additional
publications break down broadly as follows: 1,200 authored by scientists with university af-
filiations, 250 with academic medical center affiliations, and 320 with corporate affiliations.
Although the quantitative majority of these publications are focused in the subcategories where
one would expect basic science to occur, it remains open whether this response is meaningful.
       The direct costs of Medicare Part D, paid as subsidies to private insurances, during the
program's first ten years was expected to be $80 billion annually (Medicare Trustees Report,
2006). When comparing our estimates to these direct costs, our results suggest that a subsidy-
driven expansion of market size by $43 million would only lead to one additional scientific
publication. This is substantially lower than, for example, the direct benefits of public funding,
for which Myers (2020) reports that the average cost per publication is between $344,000 and
$665,000 depending on the grant regime. At the midpoint of this range, this suggests that
direct public funding of research would generate about 85 publications for each additional
publication from our findings.
       In the pre-MMA period, only about 5.4% of publications were authored by scientists af-
filiated with corporations. This rises to about 17.6% in the post-MMA period. If the whole
scientific domain was as responsive as corporations, the `cost' of one additional publication
would fall from $43 million to $13.4 million. Direct public funding of research would still gen-
erate about 26 publications for every one from our findings. Thus, even considering the most
responsive case, it does not appear that changes in downstream demand serve as sufficient
incentives for upstream research.
       Putting the results from this thought experiment into a broader context, Finkelstein's (2004)
assertion appears to be correct ­ the post-MMA change in development was driven by a reorder-
ing of technology already in the development pipeline. Even in the context of our thought
experiment, the impact on research seems insufficient, especially compared to public funding.
41
     We take the point estimate of our preferred specification and multiply it with the standard deviation in MMS
      and the 2003 number of scientific publications from Table 1.


                                                        30
9    Conclusion
R&D consists of two separate, but equally important components: research and development.
The extant literature has conclusively found a link between changes in downstream market
size and drug development ­ i.e., `D' ­ (e.g., Acemoglu and Linn, 2004; Blume-Kohout and
Sood, 2013; Dranove et al., 2020; Finkelstein, 2004). Heretofore, however, efforts to extend
this linkage back to research ­ i.e., `R' ­ have been met with limited success. Acemoglu and
Linn (2004), for example, were unable to find a relationship between demographic-driven
expansions in market size and patenting. Using a similar identification strategy, Bhattacharya
and Packalen (2011) find a positive relationship between disease prevalence and upstream
research, but do not explicitly account for profit incentives. By exploiting the effects of quasi-
experimental variation in market size introduced by Medicare Part D, we do not find a causal
relationship between market size and research. We identify one limited exception to our core
findings, however, and that involves corporate scientists conducting applied research.
    Why does it appear that scientists are not incentivized by these changes in downstream
market size? We can only conjecture as to what might explain the inelastic response. First,
this type of demand pull incentive may attenuate by market distance so that it never reaches
scientists (e.g., Acemoglu and Linn, 2004). For example, if firms respond to demand shocks
with `off the shelf' projects (Finkelstein, 2004), new scientific discoveries may not be necessary
to fuel the clinical pipeline. Similarly, the existing knowledge stock may be large enough to
accommodate (for some time) the industry's higher demand for scientific discoveries. Our
findings, however, suggest no response from university science even more than a decade later.
Thus, a disconnect appears to exist between the kind of research industry uses as knowledge
inputs and the kind of research upstream scientists conduct. Such exploration of this disconnect
is left for future work.
    Second, scientists may react to market size changes only if these changes affect the sci-
entists' incentives through indirect channels, such as altruism, funding, or prestige. This is
perhaps more likely the case if the market size increase is due to disease prevalence (e.g.,
epidemics) as opposed to insurance coverage (e.g., Medicare Part D).
    Third, scientists may respond to demand pull differently, for example, by providing tacit
knowledge through training (junior) scientists for industry (Roach and Sauermann, 2010).
Unfortunately, we are unable to explore the above mechanisms with our data. Future research
is necessary to understand the inelastic response of scientists. Survey evidence would be most
helpful and may shed light on the mechanisms driving the disconnect between research and
market size.

                                               31
   Finally, our study has important implications for policymakers. To the extent that there is
a disconnect between the direction of academic research and the requirements of downstream
markets, additional incentives may be needed to close this gap. NIH grants and public sector
funding would appear to be the obvious choice as they are effective tools in fostering scientific
research (Azoulay et al., 2019). It may also be the case that an expansion of R&D tax credits
could be used to help incentivize companies to re-engage in and reverse the trend away from
basic science research (Arora et al., 2018). These issues are left for future research.

A     Data Construction

A.1     Control Variables
This data appendix describes the construction of our control variables: projected market size,
NIH funding, and research opportunities.


Projected Market Size

We build a measure of the exogenous components of U.S. market size (Acemoglu and Linn,
2004; Blume-Kohout and Sood, 2013). Each disease group has a different age profile and,
hence, is differently affected by both domestic and global demographic trends. Therefore, we
use demographic (projection) data from the UN World Population Prospects42 for the United
States between 1997 and 2040 in order to calculate how the potential future market size would
develop if only population growth mattered.
     To this end, we keep the age profile of each disease constant and calculate the average
expenditure share of drugs associated with each five-year age bin for each ICD-9 group in the
pre-MMA period. Drug expenditures are measured in real-terms (base year of 2003) based on
the MEPS data. We then attribute the US population growth to each age bin until 2040. Hence,
our measure for projected US market size Mit displays the annual expected drug expenditures
in each ICD-9 group i in year t. In concordance with Blume-Kohout and Sood (2013), we
accumulate the projected market size Mit over a period of 12 lead years as of year t. This
reflects the average market exclusivity term of new drugs (Adams and Brantner, 2006).
     Since pharmaceutical markets are typically considered as global (Acemoglu and Linn,
2004), we build the same measure for the potential market size in all OECD countries.


NIH Funding

We control for previous years' public research funding related to each disease category. Many
scholars have shown the importance of public research funding, e.g., from the NIH, for progress
in biomedical research and pharmaceutical innovation.43,44 Since Congress doubled the NIH
budget in the five years preceding the MMA from $13.6 billion in 1998 to $27.1 billion in

   See Azoulay et al. (2019) on patenting and Blume-Kohout and Sood (2013) on NMEs entering clinical trials,
    and Toole (2012) on new drugs approved.

2003, it becomes an especially important determinant of R&D in any analysis of Part D (Smith,
2006). The NIH consists of twenty-seven Institutes and Centers, where each receives its own
Congressional appropriation (Azoulay et al., 2019). However, the historical doubling of re-
search funding was distributed unequally between these Institutes. In order to control for any
disproportionate increase in funding correlated with the MMA, we calculate for each of our
129 ICD-9 groups the exposure to the NIH budget over time.45
     To this end, we assign each ICD-9 group to one of these Institutes (e.g., ICD-9 162 malignant
neoplasm of trachea, bronchus, and lung to the NCI National Cancer Institute). Since research
grants are distributed within Institutes primarily by scientific merit (see discussion on NIH
funding rules by Azoulay et al. (2019)) and not by allocation to narrower disease categories, we
attribute the full annual Institute's budget to each ICD-9 group.46 In an alternative approach we
attribute budgets based on the share of all publications in a disease category that acknowledge
a specific Institute. According to aforementioned studies, the effect of funding on research
typically materializes within the first years from the grant. Therefore, we accumulate the NIHit
funding over a period of 12 lagged years until year t.47


Research Opportunities

Scientists may switch research projects to take advantage of greater research opportunities.
We therefore account for the availability of research opportunities.48
     We develop a direct measure of new research opportunities taking advantage of the de-
velopment of the MeSH hierarchy over time.49 The MeSH vocabulary in its current form was
introduced in 1963 (Rogers, 1963) and was intended as a dynamic list that incorporates new
concepts in the medical field.50 The NLM introduces annually hundred new MeSH terms based
45
   We retrieve NIH spending data (Mechanism Detail by IC, FY 1983-2019) from https://officeofbudget.od.nih.
    gov/spending_hist.html [downloaded on February 17, 2020].
46
   In rare cases we assign more then one Institute or Center to an ICD-9 group. In these cases we attribute both
    budgets to the disease category.
47
   We use the Biomedical Research and Development Price Index in order to calculate real values with the base
    year of 2003. The data can be found here: https://officeofbudget.od.nih.gov/gbipriceindexes.html.
48
   Bhattacharya and Packalen (2011) construct a measures of research opportunities based on the content of
    research inputs and the first appearance of the idea in a scientific publication. Using the set of approved active
    ingredients as an input factor for future scientific research, they estimate structural productivity parameters,
    which takes into account diffusion and exhaustion of knowledge, in order to infer the quality of associated
    opportunities. The disadvantage of the approach is that it relies on a very narrow set of research inputs that
    relate primarily to drug-related medical research but not basic science.
49
   MeSH terms are organised into a hierarchy called the MeSH tree. Disease groups are first defined very broadly,
    but become more narrow with every sub-type of a disorder. The bulk data can be found here: https://www.
    nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/mesh.html.

on the need to appropriately describe concepts being discussed in the literature. New terms are
added for emerging diseases, breakdowns of existing diseases, and additional terminology to
reflect topical areas that are not well represented in MeSH.51 We interpret the introduction of a
new MeSH term as an emerging research opportunity since NLM employees collect new terms
that begin to appear in the scientific literature, for example in emerging areas of research.52 In
2003, the NLM added, for instance, the following MeSH terms to the vocabulary: Retinoschisis
reflects a more detailed conceptualisation of an existing disease (Retinal Degeneration) and
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome describes a newly occurring disease related to the 2000s
outbreaks of the SARS-Coronavirus. All together, the introduction of each term approximates
the beginning of a new research field.
     We measure new research opportunities Kit that are associated with an ICD-9 group by
calculating the number of new MeSH terms that occur below the hierarchy level of our ICD-
9-MeSH crosswalk, introduced in a given year t.53 Since new research opportunities likely
become obsolete over time, we add a discount factor of 0.8.54 This approach is novel to the
literature, which typically uses MeSH terms statically as keywords to understand shifts in the
direction of science, but not the dynamic development of opportunities.

   See for more information: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/mesh.html.
53
   We use the date of establishment since this is not sensitive to the transformation of the analogue MeSH vocabu-
    lary to the digital vocabulary in 1999. For more details on the variables, see: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/

   Estimated depreciation rates of knowledge capital vary in the literature. Common values lie between 15%
    (Griliches, 1981; Hall and Mairesse, 1995) and 25% (Pakes and Schankerman, 1984). Our results are robust
    to applying different depreciation rates.

Notes: The figures in the top row present the distribution of MMS scores among ICD-9 three-digit codes. Figure
(a) shows all 272 ICD-9 three-digit codes, which are included in the MeSH-ICD-9 crosswalk by Bhattacharya and
Packalen (2011). Figure (b) shows all 752 ICD-9 three-digit codes in the 1997-2003 MEPS. We use the patient-
weighted average of each year between 1997-2003. The annual MMS are calculated using the total number
of patients in Medicare relative to all patients for each ICD-9 three-digit code. Both figures in the bottom row
present the distribution of MMS scores among the 129 ICD-9 groups, which are included in the MeSH-ICD-9
crosswalk by Bhattacharya and Packalen (2011). In Figure (c) we use the prescription count-weighted average of
each year between 1997-2003. The annual MMS are calculated using the total number of prescriptions financed
by Medicare relative to all prescriptions for each ICD-9 group. In Figure (d) we use the prescription quantity-
weighted average of each year between 1997-2003. The annual MMS are calculated using the quantity-weighted
prescriptions financed by Medicare relative to all quantity-weighted prescriptions for each ICD-9 group.

Medicare prescription quantities. Prescriptions are counted multiple times if they appear in more than one ICD-9
group. The red line represents the relative increase in the quantity of Medicare prescriptions with respect to the
baseline year 2003.

Notes: The top figure presents the evolution of a price index by MMS quartile. It is calculated based on a prescrip-
tion quantity-weighted basket of drugs (1000 most sold drugs in total) following the procedure outlined in Duggan
and Scott Morton (2010). Drug-level prices are inferred from the MEPS, winsorized, and imputed/extrapolated
if missing. We drop a drug-form-disease combination if it does not appear in at least 2/3 of the sample periods, in
3 consecutive years, and exhibits price growth in the top 1% of the distribution. The index is set to one by using a
1997-2003 divisor. The bottom left figure presents the composition of total drug revenues by MMS quartile over
time. Revenues are calculated based on the total payment of all drugs which are prescribed for a certain ICD-9
group. The bottom right figure shows the normalized evolution of total revenues. 2003 serves as the baseline
year.

Notes: Figures (a)-(c) present the log-transformed average number of annual publication counts (a) with NIH
participation, (b) with university participation, and (c) with academic medical center participation. Figure (d)
presents the log-transformed average number of patent-weighted publications from all affiliations. Figures (e)-(f)
present the log-transformed average number of annual NME (e) in phase I-III clinical trials and (f) in all drug
development stages (preclinical, phase I-III clinial trials, registration, approval). For reasons of comparability, the
unit of observation is the unique ICD-9 group level in all graphs.

Notes: The figures show the event study estimates and the 90 percent confidence bands of Poisson pseudo-
maximum likelihood regressions with high-dimensional fixed effects following Equation 1. The unit of observation
is the ICD-9 three-digit code level, with MMS being calculated based on patient counts at the ICD-9 group level.
Standard errors are clustered at the ICD-9 three-digit code level.

Notes: The figures show the event study estimates and the 90 percent confidence bands of Poisson pseudo-
maximum likelihood regressions with high-dimensional fixed effects following Equation 1. The unit of observation
is the ICD-9 three-digit code level. In the top figures, the MMS is calculated based on the number of prescriptions,
in the bottom figures the MMS is calculated based on prescription quantity (Rx-quantity), both at the ICD-9 group
level. Standard errors are clustered at the ICD-9 three-digit code level.

Notes: The figures show the event study estimates and the 90 percent confidence bands of Poisson pseudo-
maximum likelihood regressions with high-dimensional fixed effects following Equation 1. The unit of observation
is the MeSH term level. In the left figures, the dependent variable is the annual number of scientific publications
weighted by the number of distinct ICD-9 per publications (thus, counted fractional). In the right figures, the
number of scientific publications is winsozired at the annual 99th percentile. Standard errors are clustered at the
MeSH term level.

Notes: The figures show the event study estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions. The
dependent variable is the annual number of scientific publications. In the top figures, the MMS is calculated based
on 2003 patients counts. In the middle figures, the MMS is calculated based on prescription counts/quantity. In
the bottom figures, the treatment variable is binary based on patients counts. Standard errors are clustered at the
MeSH term level.

Notes: The figures show the event study estimates and the 90 percent confidence bands of Poisson pseudo-
maximum likelihood regressions with high-dimensional fixed effects following Equation 1. The unit of observation
is the MeSH term level. The dependent variable is the annual number of scientific publications. In the top figures,
we exclude all ICD-9 groups related to protected drug classes. In the bottom figures, we include only ICD-9 groups
related to protected drug classes. Standard errors are clustered at the MeSH term level.

Notes: The figures show the event study estimates and the 90 percent confidence bands of Poisson pseudo-
maximum likelihood regressions with high-dimensional fixed effects following Equation 1. The unit of observation
is the MeSH term level. In the top figures, the dependent variable is the annual number of scientific publications,
which are associated with a MeSH term related to `clinical trials'. In the middle figure, the dependent variable is
the annual number of scientific publications, which are associated with a MeSH term related to `pharmaceutical
products'. In the bottom figures, the dependent variables is the residual, thus scientific publications neither related
to clinical trials nor pharmaceutical products. Standard errors are clustered at the MeSH term level.

Notes: The figures show the event study estimates and the 90 percent confidence bands of Poisson pseudo-
maximum likelihood regressions with high-dimensional fixed effects following Equation 1. The unit of observation
is the MeSH term level. In the top figures, the dependent variable is the journal impact factor-weighted number of
university/corporate scientific publications. In the middle figure, the dependent variable is the number of univer-
sity/corporate scientific publications that are associated with at least one patent application (patent-weighted).
In the bottom figures, we weight the number scientific publications by the size of the average patent family associ-
ated with the publication. A patent/family size-weight is calculated based on the patent family's first application
being filed within 5 years from the scientific publication. Standard errors are clustered at the MeSH term level.

Notes: Columns (1) to (4) show the estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions with high-
dimensional fixed effects. The time period of these regressions is the pre-MMA period 1997-2002. We employ
placebo tests (2000-2002 x MMS with 1997-1999 as the baseline period) in order to test the parallel trends
assumption. The dependent variable is the annual number of newly discovered NME in Column (1), NME in all
development stages in Column (2), NME in phase I-III clinical trials in Column (3), and the annual number of
approved drugs in Column (4). The unit of observation is the ICD-9 three-digit level by year. Standard errors are
clustered at the ICD-9 three-digit code level and shown in parentheses. Significance levels: * p<0.1, ** p<0.05,

Notes: Columns (1) to (6) show the estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions with high-
dimensional fixed effects. Columns with odd numbers include a broader set of ICD-9 codes, namely all ICD-9
three-digit codes available in Cortellis (>300). Here the MMS is calculated at the ICD-9 three-digit code level
and controls are excluded for data availability reasons. Columns with even numbers are at the ICD-9 group level
again and include ICD-9 group level fixed effects instead of ICD-9 three-digit code level fixed effects. Here
the MMS is calculated at the ICD-9 group level and log-transformed ICD-9 group level controls are included.
The dependent variable is the annual number of newly discovered NME in Columns (1) and (2), NME in all
development stages (preclinicals, clinical trials, registrations, approvals) in Columns (3) and (4), and approved
NME in Column (5) and (6). In Columns with odd numbers standard errors are clustered at the ICD-9 three-digit
code level, in Columns with even numbers at the ICD-9 group level. They are shown in parentheses. Significance
levels: * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.

Notes: Columns (1) to (6) show the estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions with high-
dimensional fixed effects. Column (1), (3), and (5) include alternative control variables such as OECD market
size and NIH funding calculated as a share of all publications in a disease category that acknowledge a specific
Institute/Center. Column (2), (4), and (6) include control variables that do not accumulate future/past periods
but only consider year t. In both cases, control variables are log-transformed and the MMS is calculated at the
ICD-9 group level. The unit of observation of the dependent variable is the ICD-9 three-digit code by year. It is
the annual number of newly discovered NME in Columns (1) and (2), NME in all development stages (preclini-
cals, clinical trials, registrations, approvals) in Columns (3) and (4), and approved NME in Column (5) and (6).

Notes: Columns (1) to (4) show the estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions with high-
dimensional fixed effects. The pre-MMA period includes the years 1997-2005 (until the implementation of the
MMA). The dependent variable is the annual number of newly discovered NME in Column (1), NME in all develop-
ment stages in Column (2), NME in phase I-III clinical trials in Column (3), and the annual number of approved
drugs in Column (4). The unit of observation is the ICD-9 three-digit level by year. The control variables are
log-transformed. Standard errors are clustered at the ICD-9 three-digit code level and shown in parentheses.
Significance levels: * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.

Notes: Columns (1) to (6) show the estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions with high-
dimensional fixed effects. The time period of these regressions is the pre-MMA period 1997-2002. We employ
placebo tests (2000-2002 x MMS with 1997-1999 as the baseline period) in order to test the parallel trends
assumption. The dependent variable is the annual number of scientific publications from all affiliations (1)-
(2), disease weighted (fractional) number of scientific publications from all affiliations (3), number of scientific
publications from at least one author affiliated with an university (4), affiliated with a corporation (5), and patent-
weighted number of scientific publications (6). A patent-weight is calculated based on the patent family's first
application being filed within 5 years from the scientific publication. The unit of observation is the MeSH term
by year. Standard errors are clustered at the MeSH level and shown in parentheses. Significance levels: * p<0.1,
** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.

Notes: Columns (1) to (3) show the estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions with high-
dimensional fixed effects. The unit of observation is the MeSH term by year. The dependent variable is the annual
number of scientific publications. In Column (1), we use ICD-9 group level fixed effects instead of MeSH level
fixed effects and cluster standard errors at the ICD-9 group level instead of the MeSH level. Column (2) includes
alternative control variables such as OECD market size and NIH funding calculated as a share of all publications
in a disease category that acknowledge a specific Institute/Center. Column (3) includes control variables that
do not accumulate future/past periods but only consider year t. In Column (4), we show the estimates of linear
regressions with high-dimensional fixed effects. The control variables are always log-transformed. Standard
errors are shown in parentheses. Significance levels: * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.

Notes: Columns (1) to (3) show the estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions with high-
dimensional fixed effects. The unit of observation is the MeSH term by year. The dependent variable is the
annual number of scientific publications with at least one author affiliated with an university. In Column (1), we
use ICD-9 group level fixed effects instead of MeSH level fixed effects and cluster standard errors at the ICD-9
group level instead of the MeSH level. Column (2) includes alternative control variables such as OECD market
size and NIH funding calculated as a share of all publications in a disease category that acknowledge a specific
Institute/Center. Column (3) includes control variables that do not accumulate future/past periods but only
consider year t. In Column (4), we show the estimates of linear regressions with high-dimensional fixed effects.
The control variables are always log-transformed. Standard errors are shown in parentheses. Significance levels:
* p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.

Notes: Columns (1) to (6) show the estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions with high-
dimensional fixed effects. The unit of observation is the MeSH term by year. The dependent variable is the number
of scientific publications with at least one author affiliated with an university in academic journals in Column
(1), in clinically relevant journals in Column (2), in clinical practice journals in Column (3), in industry-clinical
journals in Column (4), in industrial journals in Column (5), and in industry practice journals in Column (6).
Journal classification is based on the proportion of published research coming from general hospitals and industry
using the publicly available data set provided by Tijssen (2010). The control variables are log-transformed.
Standard errors are clustered at the MeSH level and shown in parentheses. Significance levels: * p<0.1, **
p<0.05, *** p<0.01.

Notes: Columns (1) to (6) show the estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions with high-
dimensional fixed effects. The unit of observation is the MeSH term by year. The dependent variable is the number
of scientific publications with at least one author affiliated with a corporation in academic journals in Column
(1), in clinically relevant journals in Column (2), in clinical practice journals in Column (3), in industry-clinical
journals in Column (4), in industrial journals in Column (5), and in industry practice journals in Column (6).
Journal classification is based on the proportion of published research coming from general hospitals and industry
using the publicly available data set provided by Tijssen (2010). The control variables are log-transformed.
Standard errors are clustered at the MeSH level and shown in parentheses. Significance levels: * p<0.1, **
p<0.05, *** p<0.01.

Notes: Columns (1) to (6) show the estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions with high-
dimensional fixed effects. The unit of observation is the MeSH term by year. The dependent variable is the number
of scientific publications from at least one author affiliated with an academic medical center that are associated
with MeSH terms related to clinical trials in Column (2) and pharmaceutical products in Column (3). In Column
(1), we include the residual academic medical center publications (non CT/non pharmaceutical products). In
Columns (4), the dependent variable is the journal impact factor-weighted number of scientific publications from
at least one author affiliated with an academic medical center. In Column (5), the dependent variable is the
number of academic medical center publications that are associated with at least one patent application (patent-
weighted). In Column (6), we weight the number of academic medical center publications by the size of the
average patent family associated with the publication. A patent/family size-weight is calculated based on the
patent family's first application being filed within 5 years from the scientific publication. The control variables are
log-transformed. Standard errors are clustered at the MeSH level and shown in parentheses. Significance levels:

Notes: Columns (1) to (6) show the estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions with high-
dimensional fixed effects. The unit of observation is the MeSH term by year. The pre-period lasts until 2005,
which is the year before the implementation of the MMA. The dependent variable is the annual number of scientific
publications from all affiliation types in Column (1), weighted by the inverse number of linked diseases in Column
(2), with at least one author being affiliated with an university in Column (3), and with a corporation in Column
(4). In Columns (5) and (6), the dependent variable is the number of university/corporate scientific publications
that are associated with at least one patent application (patent-weighted). A patent-weight is calculated based on
the patent family's first application being filed within 5 years from the scientific publication. The control variables
are log-transformed. Standard errors are clustered at the MeSH level and shown in parentheses. Significance

Notes: Columns (1) to (6) show the estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions with high-
dimensional fixed effects. The unit of observation is the MeSH term by year. The dependent variable is the
annual number of scientific publications including PMID, which are associated with a disease MeSH term with
unknown MMS (confounded). It includes publications from all affiliation types in Column (1), weighted by the
inverse number of linked diseases in Column (2), with at least one author being affiliated with an university in
Column (3), and with a corporation in Column (4). In Columns (5) and (6), the dependent variable is the number
of university/corporate scientific publications (including confounded PMID) that are associated with at least one
patent application (patent-weighted). A patent-weight is calculated based on the patent family's first application
being filed within 5 years from the scientific publication. The control variables are log-transformed. Standard
errors are clustered at the MeSH level and shown in parentheses. Significance levels: * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, ***

Notes: Columns (1) to (6) show the estimates of Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions with high-
dimensional fixed effects. The unit of observation is the ICD-9 group level (MeSH terms aggregated to the ICD-9
group in the Bhattacharya and Packalen (2011) ICD-9-MeSH crosswalk presented in Table A-1). The dependent
variable is the annual number of scientific publications from all affiliation types in Column (1), weighted by the
inverse number of linked diseases in Column (2), with at least one author being affiliated with an university
in Column (3), and with a corporation in Column (4). In Columns (5) and (6), the dependent variable is the
number of university/corporate scientific publications that are associated with at least one patent application
(patent-weighted). A patent-weight is calculated based on the patent family's first application being filed within
5 years from the scientific publication. The control variables are log-transformed. Standard errors are clustered
at the ICD-9 group level and shown in parentheses. Significance levels: * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.
