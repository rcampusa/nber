1. Introduction


      Over the past few decades, tax policy has been an important instrument of the

government to influence both fluctuations and growth in the economy. Initially,
economists emphasized the link between taxes and demand as the channel through
which tax policy affected the cyclical variability and secular trend of output and

thereby employment and capiI accumulation. Now, however, we have come to
recognize   that there are also significant direct influences of tax policy on production.
Tax rates, credits and allowances affect the costs incurred by firms in hiring labour,

investing in equipment and structure, using energy, and undertaking research and de-

velopment.   The purpose of this paper is to analyze the models used to evaluate the
effects of tax policy on the structure of production and to discuss the substantive

results arising from the empirical application of these models.
     The predominant focus in studies of production has been related to the degree to
which factors of production are substitutable and to the biases associated with tech-

nological change. Substitution possibilities characterize the manner in which firms
alter their input demands in the face of changing relative factor prices.      As   a con-
sequence, since   tax policy operates through factor prices, the knowledge of the sub-
stitutability or complementarity of inputs permits us to determine how factor propor-
tions change as tax policy initiatives are introduced.

      Technological change generates new structures of production.      In general,   tech-
nological change is biased toward some factors of production and away from others, in
the sense that the new production processes tilt relative input demands. However,
technological change does not occur in     a vacuum, but rather it is influenced by the
same determinants as factor demands, namely product and factor prices.         Hence, tax

policy can affect technological change.   For example, assume a credit is introduced on



                                            —1-—
 investment which lnwsrs the effective factnr price of capital.      if   ecnnoingical change is
 of the variety which is biased towards capital. then the cost of unde"ak'ng tech-

 nological change fails with the invesfment credit, cansing the rate of technoingical

 progress to advance.
          The ability of tax policy to influence factor demands and       tfe rate of technolog'—
cal charge may be severely hampered in the short—run because subtantial costs of

adjustment may have to be incurred in order to change factor demands. The                 quc.si—

fixity of certain inputs (for example, skilled lnbo'r, equipment and structures, research
and development) limits substitution pnsibiLtics and teoh:xlogical biases in the short—
run       This implies   har adjustment in the   quasi—fixed facrrs ncc;rs gradually and       i:
not immed1ate

          in the short run, the effects of changes   ifl tax policy on   factor demands may    be

quite different from the effects occurring in the long—run. For example, a decrease in
the corporate income tax rate can lower the effective cost of production, therefore

causing output to expand.       if there are   some factors which are qoasi—fixed, then      in-
creases in short—run output production occur more int'nsely, osing           the variable factors
of production. However, as the adjustment costs are incurred (the lower tax rate
could also help in this regard) and investment takes place, the quasi—fixed factors are

substituted for the variable factors in the long—run. The existence of adjustment
costs changes the manner in which taxes affect production and the effectiveness of the

policy.

      Adjustment costs fix the level of the quasi—fixed factors in the short—run and
cause the gradual adjustment to their long—run magnitudes. However, the rate at
which the quasi—fixed factors are utilized in the short—run may also vary.            If utiliza-
tion of the quasi—fixed factors is not costless (for example, due to overtime and shift

wage premiums or greater depreciation costs), then firms may find it desirable to leave



                                               —2—
idle portions of the quasi—fixed factors in order to meet future production require—

ments.   The rates of utilization of the quasi—fixed factors are determined in the
short—run in conjunction with the demands for the variable factors of production.
Hence, utilization rates depend on product and factor prices and therefore on tax

policy. For example,   a decrease in the corporate income tax rate which causes output
to expand can generate increases in the demand for variable factors and increases in

the rates of quasi—fixed factor 'tilization.   Since the latter   is now costly, resources
will be redirected from investment and the future expansion of the quasi—fixed factors

towards the greater utilization of the current stocks.
       Corporate tax rates, credits and allowances influence the long—run substitution of
all factors of production, the short—run utilization and the dynamic adjustment of the

quasi—fixed factors.   This survey is based upon these themes.      We develop   a general

intertemporal model of production, emphasizing the role of present and expected future
corporate income taxes, credits and allowances along with costly adjustment and
utilization of the quasi—fixed factors We then proceed to specialize the general model

in order to highlight each of the three themes and their interaction with tax policy.

We also discuss the various ways in which empirical implementation of the theoretical

models has been undertaken, along with the relevant results from the empirical inves-

tigations.  The empirical studies are restricted to those which include the array of

corporate tax, credit and allowance rates, have emphasized the role of tax policy on
production structure, and are explicitly based on an optimization model of firm pro-
duction decisions. The latter criterion enables us to establish a clear link between the
theoretical and empirical models, and to see the problems in empirical implementation.

The survey is organized along the following lines. In section 2 we develop the general
theoretical model. Section 3 focuses on the issues of tax policy, long—run factor sub-

stitution and the rate of technological change.     In the fourth section we specifically



                                           —3—
discuss the issues of taxes and quasi—fixed factors adjustment costs, while in section 5

the topic centers on the short—run utilization   of the   quasi—fixed   factors, Lastly, we
discuss some policy implications which emerge from the analysis and empirical results.

2. A Model of Production, Investment and Taxation


      There are two objectives of this section. First a model is developed in which
the effect of taxes on production and investment can be analyzed within the general
themes of factor substitution, adjustment and utilization, output expansion and           tech-

nological change. The second objective is to provide a framework in which to organize
and evaluate the empirical      reseah of this topic.
      We begin by characterizing production and investment decisions.                We assume

that a firm produces         outputs using n non—capital inputs and m capital inputs. The
technology is represented by


                   T(y1,   v, K, K, 1    A1)   =0

where   T   is the transformation function,     y is an   .2    dimensional vector of output

quantities,   v1   is a n—dimensional vector of non—capital input quantities,       K   is an m

dimensional vector of 'new' capital (or beginning of period capital) input quantities,

K is a      m dimensional vector of       'old' capital (or end of period capital) input
quantities,   I is a m dimensional vector of investment        quantities and   A1 represents   an

indicator of autonomous technological change.1 (The subscript t represents the time

period.) The transformation function is twice continuously differentiable, increasing in

y, K,   I and decreasing in v,, K.        Generally the transformation function is decreas-

ing in A1 (in other words, technological progress).     The transformation function is also
concave in y1,     K, K,    v and It,.
      The specification of the technology is flexible enough to include the costs associ-
ated with installation and utilization of capital. The costs associated with capital
utilization are introduced in manner similar to the general approach developed by
Hicks (1946), Malinvaud (1953), Bliss (1975), and Diewert (1980).                Each time, the



                                               —5—
firm combines the beginning of period capital inputs        (K)   with the non—capital inputs
to produce output and the capital inputs to be used for future production (K°j.
Thus, the firm produces two kinds of output: one type for current sale (y4 and one

type for future production       (K).   Utilization is captured through the selection of capi—
tal for future production. The choice of the end of period capital reflects decisions on
the using and repairing of the capital inputs which are available at the beginning of
the period. The specific process of capital utilization is embedded or internal to the

production process and      is captured by the tranformation function.
      Capital adjustment or installation is costly.        This is reflected hy the vector of
investment flows     (ij   in the transformation function. The installation costs are   inter-
nal to the production process since the specific process of capital installations is cap-
tured by the transformation function, Resources devoted to installing capital must be
directed away from producing current output and repairing existing capital.          The cost
of installing additional capital is the opportunity cost of foregone current output and

foregone capital repairs. The existence of installation costs for certain types of inputs

implies that there is      an adjustment process associated with these inputs, and so they
are referred to as quasi—fixed factors. The other inputs are called variable facturs.
     In the present context, there are essentially two kinds of investment undertaken

by the firm: one type arises through capital purchases and one type results from

maintaining the existing capital stocks.        Thus, there are two ways in which capital
becomes available for future production: internal investment (repair) and external in-
vestment (purchase). This implies that the vector of capital inputs used in production
accumulates by

be re—written       as        = I, + (I. 6jK, where

Clearly, if   &,    is time invariant and exogenous, then equation (2) becomes the usual formula
of depreciation by evaporation.

      The distinction between stock and flow decisions can be noted from equations (1) and
                                                                                 Thus there

capital available to the firm. The firm selects the flow nf services from each

       to                      or to       install additional capital stocks.      The choice on the rates of
puts        produce output
utilization are captured through the decisions on the end of period capital stocks. These
end of period stocks along with the newly installed capital represent the capital stocks
available to the firm        at the   beginning of period     t+l.
          The firm generates revenue, hires variable inputs, utilizes its capital stocks, invests
and finances its operations such that the flow of funds is

       The flow of funds can be further decomposed by considering the nature of the corpo-

 rate income taxes. These taxes are defined by a tax rate of 0 <

        Governments generally offer incentives to undertake investment,                   These incentives ace
often in the form of tax credits such that at time                 t with a credit rate      of   0   oc   u,. < I,

Moreover, the investment           tax credit can   reduce the depreciation bass for tax purposes of
the capital stocks.         This means that the depreciation deductions for tax purposes or the
capital cost allowances ass reduced by the investment tax credit. Hence the capital cost
allowance   at   time   t   is


(5)     CCA =         E_sqj5_,1j5_(1—dj5ujjDj,         i=l     m

where        is the proportion of the investment tax credit which reduces the depreciation
base for   tax purposes.         In Canada,       =1   and the U.S.          =   •5,4

       Besides   the capital cost allowance and investment tax credit,              a third type of invest-
ment incentive relates to additions to the rate of investment,                   For example, incentives of
thin nature have been introduced to stimulate R&D expenditures.                    In Canada, from 1978 to




                                                  —8—
1984, there was          a tax     allowance of 50 per cent on current R&D expenditures in excess of

the   average     of the previous three years. In the U.S., a tax credit of 25 per cent exists
since 1981,       on current R&D expendituresin excessover the average expenditures Un—

dertaken during the previous three years. An allowance at time                         t based on incremental
investment can be defined as


(6)    I1A =                                            i=1,...,m

wherep5=1, p=j<O,                               r-s,   r,s>Oand

                                    > 0 if                          >   0,
                  _lit =   I
                               0   otherwise.


To    see   the   magnitude of the incremental allowance, suppose                 that in order to obtain the
allowance, current investment expenditure must exceed the average                      of the past three    years.

Thus,         =     1,         = —.33,       t=1,2,3. In addition, suppose current expenditures are $1.00,
while expenditures for the previous three years are $.75, $.50 and $25, respectively.                       Thus,

the incremental expenditures upon which the                 allowance is based is $1.00    —   $.50   =   $.50. If

the   allowance rate is .5, then          the firm obtains an       allowance   of 8.25.

        Combining equations (4), (5), and (6) yields corporate income taxes at time                   t to be

where 8, =       B/V.        The rate of return on financial capital can be defined as Pt                =
r/(l±8,)       - r(1—u48,/(l±e,).                   Thus, equation (9) implies that the flow of funds to
the shareholders and bondholders pios any capital gains equals the return on financial cap--
itah

       The objective of the firm is to operate in the interest of its shareholders by maxi-
mizing the expected present value of the flow of funds to the sharehoMers.     In the present

context, because  the rates of return on bonds and shares are exogenous to the firm, and
therefore cannot be influenced by shareholder behavior, the objective is equivalent to maxi-

mizing the expected present value of financial capital (or in other words, the expected
present value of the flow of funds to shareholders and bondholders). The objective function
which can be obtained from equation (9) by solving for the present value of financial capi-
tal and apppiying expectations, can be writtso as

lowances and    the incremental investment           allowances arising from past investment             expendi-
tures. In deriving equation (10), we have made use of the fact that capital purchase prices
are modified by       the investment tax credit, the capital cost allowance (which may he
reduced in part by the credit) ann the incremental investment allowance.                         In addition, we

have separated each type of investment expenditure               into the portion at any time t which
relates to the present and the portion which             is a legacy of the past (given by the matrix

M,). Clearly,    at any time        t the latter   does not figure         into the firm's maximizing program

because, from   the vantage point          of the present,   it   is   predetermined.
      The post—tax purchase prices contain the allowance on incremental investment. To

see how the latter affects the post—tax purchase prices and reduces taxes, assume that the
corporate income tax rate is fixed and equal to u,, the allowance rate is fixed and equal to

-y,   and the discount rate is constant and equal to p.                     In addition, assume      that the al-
lowance is based on current investment expenditures in excess of the average of the past

three years.    Suppose there is one type of capital and                     a firm incurs an investment     ex—

penditure in year      1   of $1 (q1   =   $1).    This expenditure will add $1 to the incremental al-

lowance    in year   1.    Thus, the tax reduction from the allowance is u0-y$I. In year 2, how-

ever, the Si expenditure will decrease taxes through the allowance by one—third of u,-ySl.
Discounting the latter magnitude back to year                1    yields   u-y$1(.33)/(i±p).    In year 3 and 4,

the discounted tax reductions from the allowance are u0-y$i(.33)/(i+p)2 and
u0-y$1(.33)/(l±p) respectively. The Si expenditure increases the incremental allowance in
the year the expenditure was increased and then reduces the allowance over the next three
years.     Thus the present value of the tax reduction due to the incremental allowance                         is




                                                    —ii—

the present value of the tax reduction                from     the investment ailowance generated by the $1

expenditure.
         The firm maximizes the right side of equation (10) by selecting the vectors of                     out-
puts, variable inputs, levels of investment and used (or end of period) capital stocks,                     sub-
ject to the technology (equation (1)) and the generation of new (or beginning of period)
capitai stocks (equation (2)). This program can be undertaken in two stages. First, con—
ditional on the beginning of period capital stocks and the technology, the firm determines
its output supplies, variable factor demands and end of period capital stncks, This                        is   the
set of short—run decisions.               With this solution, the           firm   proceeds to the intertemporai
problem in order to determihe the beginning of period rapitai stocks.
         The short—run problem is defined by

where       is the Lagrangian multiplier and             vT1   represent the first order partial derivatives of
outputs (i=y), variable inputs                (iv),   end    of period capital stocks (1=0) and investment
levels (1=1).    Equation sets (12.1) and (12,2) are standard.                     They imply that relative pro-
duct prices equal the respective rates of product transformation and relative variable factor




                                                        —12—
prices equal the respective          rates   of factor substitution.        Equation (12.3) implies that rela-
tive net of tax capital stock purchase prices equal the respective relative marginal values of

capital utilization    (T0)   net of the marginal costs of capital installation (T1).

      It is clear from equation set (12.1) and (12.2) that tax policy influences output
supplies and variable factor demands through its effect on the quasi—fixed factors. There
are two reasons for this result.              First, the corporate income rate does not               effect output

supplies and variable factor der,              nds   directly because          it is based on revenues net of
variable input costs or variable profits. The corporate income tax is                       a variable profits tax
and as such       it is based   on   a residual    of the   firm's      income stream, given capital utilization,

installation and accumulation.               The second reason is that all allowances and credits are

actually based on the quasi—fixed factors.                  As a consequence, output supplies and variable

factor demands are affected by tax policy through their link with the intertemporal
decisions governing the quasi—fixed factors.5

        In this   model there are three ways in which quasi—fixed factor decisions interact with

output supplies and variable factor demands. First, there is the traditional route through
factor substitution and output expansion.                   This   is   the link between   y    and   v on the one
hand and    K on the other.            Second, there is       the interrelationship through capital installa-
tion which is the link between decisions on                 y and v and decisions          on   1. Third, there is
the interaction between capital utilization,                K      and output supply,      y,   and variable factor

demand,    v, decisions.        To see the role of each of these interrelationships, let us assume for

the moment   that the costs of capital utilization and installation are separable from the
production technology. In other words, vT0 = vT1= vT = vT1 = 0. This means that
changes in    the corporate      income      tax, credit and allowance rates only           affect output supplies

and variable factor demands through changes in the beginnings of period quasi—fixed fac-
tors.    The channel is as follows.            A   change in       tax   policy in period   t elicits a change in
capital utilization and installation in period t. This causes the quasi—fixed factors at the



                                                     —13---
beginning of period            t+I to     change, 'which in turn generates changes in period t±1 output

supplies and variable factor demands. This channel may be termed the production channel.
There is no direct link between capital utilization or installation and variable input
demaods and output supplies.

         The other two channels arise from capital utilization and iostaiiation.               if utilization
and installation decisions are not separable from production decisions then from equation
set   (12)    a change in tax        policy generates contemporaneous effects on output supplies and

variable factor demands.                 In addition, the effects oo utilization and iostaiiatioo alter the
quasi—fixed factors available for production in the succeeding period which in tuco affects

output supplies and factor demands in this later period.
         The solution to the short—run program given by equation set (12) can be substituted
into   (11) to       defoe the post tax variable profit function       (see Diewert (1973)):


(13.1)                      = m(P, W, Qr, K, K÷,           Ar)

where    rt    is    a   twice continuously differentiable function which is increasing in     P. = pJI—
u04, and       Q,                  K and decreasing in W. = w(1—uJ and K.. convex and
                         increasing in
homogeneous          of degree I in the prices P., Q and W, concave io iC and iC÷, . The
post—tax variable profit function is defined such                that differentiating it with respect to the
post tax prices                    and Q,) yields,


(13.2)        vii =

(13.3)        vrt, =

(13.4)       -VIIQ
                     = K.

This result, known as Hotelling's Lemma, implies that the short—run equilibrium can be
better characterized by equation set (12) and the transformation function (defined by the



                                                      —14—
constraint in (11)) or by equation set (13).     The attractive feature of the latter approach

is that reduced form output supply, variable factor demand, and quasi—fixed factor utiliza-
tion functions are readily obtainable from the variable profit function.
       The second stage of the firm a program involves the intertemporal determination of

the beginning of period   quasi—fixed factor demands.       This can be obtained by substituting

the post tax variable profit function into the   expected present value of the   firm's      financial

capital (which is the right side of equation (10)).   Thus the firm desires to

                                                        —
(14)    max     E_o(t,s)                                    QK+1I.

Equation set (15) implies that the present value of marginal variable profit of a quasi—
fixed factor available for production must be balanced against      the marginal cost   of   obtain-

ing this input.7 The marginal cost contains the post tax purchase price of additional           cap-
ital and the decline in variable profits due to installing and maintaining the quasi—fixed
factor for future production. This is the classic trade—off between higher future post—tax

profits due to larger capital stocks versus lower present post tax—profits in order to obtain
the larger capital stocks.
       There are some interesting features contained in equation set (15). First, not only

contemporaneoue but all future tax, credit and allowance rates enter each equation through
the post—tax purchase price of additional capital stocks. Second, embedded in the               post—

tax variable profit function is the manner in which the         quasi—fixed factors interact with

each other and with the variable input demands in determining output supplies. Third,




                                           —15—
utilization of the quasi—fixed factors is endogenous and governed by the poet tax variable

profit function.       In other words, the specification of the    poet tax variable profit function

implies   a   specification   of quasi—fixed factor utilization.
      The complete model consists of equation sets (13) and (15). We can see that
empirical models which do not consider the potentially important influences of changes in
present and future tax credit and allowance rates on output expansion, factor substitution,
and quasi—fixed factor utilization and installation may be assuming away significant effects
of tax    policy on the structure     of production.

3. Taxes, Factor           Substitution and Productivity Growth

       The theoretical model previously developed is complex in that         it involves the   analysis

of corporate taxes and the structure of production in a dynamic context. The empirical
literature on taxation and the structure of production has, in recent times, moved towards
the implementation    of   a general    model    of production in order to address the   issues related

to the influence of taxes on factor substitution, adjustment, and utilization as well as out-
put expansion and technological ch&ige, The purpose of this and the following sections of
this paper is to analyse, within the context of the general theoretical model, the empirical
work on the interaction between taxes and production decisions. We undertake this task

by discussing the substantive empirical findings along with the nature of the models used
to obtain these results.
       The first issue we discuss pertains to the effects of taxes on factor substitution.          We

can address this issue by assuming that utilization and installation are costless and current

prices and tax policy are always expected to persist. Thus the determination of production
decisions can be simplified to the following two stage procedure.         First, the problem defined
by (11)   is simplified to

(16)   max.      (py — wTv.j(l     —
                                            u)
        (y,v)
       s.t.      T(y,v,K,A) =          0.


This leads to equations similar to (12.1) and (12.2). In addition, a post—tax variable
profit function can be defined in a similar fashion for equation (13.1) with the derived
conditions similar to equations (13.2) and (13.3).            In this simpler context,    the variable

profit and derived conditions (with respect to the post—tax prices) are

                  = n(P, W, K, A)


                                                  —17—
(17.2)                       = yt
(17.3)               —=         Vt,


Although the properties of the post—tax variable profit function are similar to those for the
function given by the right side of (13.1), there are some differences,                    First, in the case
defined by equation (17.1), post—tax variable profits are defined as revenue minus variable

input costs. The value of the unutilized quasi—fixed factors does not have to be added to
revenue, as in the general model, because utilization is costless and thereby exogenous.
Moreover, this implies that the post tax purchase prices of the quasi—fixed factors do not
enter the variable profit function.               Second, because there    are no installation costs, future
quasi—fixed factors are not             part   of the domain   of tbe variable profit function.
         The second stage of the production problem is to

         (K÷j
The fact that quasi—fixed factor utilization is costless means that these factors are fully
utilized and any depreciation can simply be defined to be exogenous and cnnstant over

We have defined the present value of capital cost allowances as                  d5 and the present value
of incremental investment allowances               as d15.   Clearly equation (19) is just a special case of
equation (15). The equilibrium of the firm consists of equation set (17) and equation (19).



                                                      —18—
         In this model, the emphasis is on how output supplies and factor demand8 are                in-
fluenced     by tax policy. This can be described geometrically by assuming there is a simple
output     (2   =    1)   and two inputs (n=m=I    —   there is no distinction here between variable

and quasi—fixed factor). The analysis of an increase in the investment tax credit or capi-
tal cost allowance is straightforward.          An increase in either of these policy instruments
lowers     the relative factor price   of capital. The firm chooses a new cost minimizing mix of

inputs for the given output.         Th" mix is   relatively more capital intensive. In addition,       at
the given output level, the marginal cost of production declines and therefore output supply

expands.
         The analysis is somewhat different when the incremental investment allowance in-
creases.       The reason is that the firm can only take advantage of the incremental allowance

if current investment expenditure exceeds an average         of past expenditures. In      the   following

Figure, the firm produces output defined by the isoquant           y'. The minimum cost equi-
librium in the absence of        any taxes or tax incentives is denoted by E', with relative factor

prices reflected by the isocost line AB.          Suppose an incremental allowance on capital           is
introduced.         This has the effect of lowering the rental rate such that the new isocost line

CD reflects the relative factor prices inclusive of the allowance.          Thus the isocost line CD
is steeper than AB. In addition, CD has been drawn so that             it   is   tangent to the isoquant

y' at    E2.     The point E2 represents the minimum cost equilibrium to produce            y    inclusive

of the incremental allowance. Next, let us assume that the capital stock upon which the
incremental allowance is based is        K, where by construction the isocost lines AB and            CD

intersect.In this situation, with capital stock levels greater than K, the relevant isocost
line is AB. Thus the effective isocost curve is CB'B, Moreover, this isocost curve

represents the seine production costs as those given by the isocost line AB (measuring cost
in labour units). Hence, the firm is indifferent between the equilibria given by E1 and F2
as each represents the identical minimum cost to produce y'. The

firm produces yt with the same cost with or without the incremental allowance.                   Suppose
now    that the base for the allowance declines to            K.    In this case,   the effective isocost
curve is CB2F, which represents lower production costs relative to CB'B.                 Thus, the firm
produces y'       at a   minimum cost by using     the incremental allowance. The      equilibrium point
is   P.    With a base of K, the effective isocost curve is CB3C. The firm produces yt              at a
minimum cost given by the isocost line AD and so the equilibrium point is                 P.    The firm
does not use the incremental allowance.            Notice that if   the   base quantities of capital are

always less than the undistorted coBb minimizing level, then the firm will always utilize the
incremental allowance.
          The empirical implementation of the model defined by equations (17) and (19)
necessitates     a   functional form for the post—tax variable profit function.       Moreover, because
the post—tax rental rates of capital are time invariant, we can combine the two stages of

production decisions and correspondingly define           a   post—tax profit function.     In addition,

empirical implementation is often mainly concerned with factor substitution, and so                 it is
generally assumed that output levels are predetermined. In this instance, only the cost
function needs to        be specified.   Many different functional forms for the cost function have
been introduced over the years (see Berndt            and Khaled    [1979}). Probably     the   one most
often used in this context is the translog (see Christensen, Jorgenson and Lau [1973]), Fuss
and McFadden [1978] and Diewert [1980]),

1 in the factor prices.8         In addition, the cost       function is concave and nondecreasing in the

factor prices and nondecreasing in output. Applying the equivalent of Hoteffing ' s Lemma,
known     as Shepherd's       Lemma,    to the cost     function, the conditional factor demands (condi-
tional since outputs are exogenous) are derived by differentiating the cost function with

respect to the factor prices.          Thus,

where s,        = Wvjc is        the     input cost share. Stochastic disturbances have been              ap-
pended to equatioos (20) and (21).                 These disturbances reflect errors of optimization and
errors in the data.          The disturbance in the cost function ran aiso reflect stocnastc shocks

(for example, productivity shocks) to the technology.8
         The model consists of equations (20) and (21). However, in estimating the unknown
parameters, only n of the          n±l equations are         used because one   of the errors can always     he

written as a linear combination of the others and therefore one of the equations adds no
new information,         The easiest way to see this is to use equation eet (21).            The cost    fuoc-
tioo is C(y,W) and

dIn C(y,W)/ain W. are the terms on the right sids of (21), not including the stochastic
error.    Thus, from (21), Z4s.         =                                              j.=1 ,...,n.   Since the

cost shares sum to unity          Es = I        and since the cost function is homogeneous of degree          1

in the factor prices, EWdC(y,W)/3W4= C(y,W), then it must be true that Eu,                            = 0.
         There has been        a great deal of empirical work over the years estimating the cost
structure for firms and industries. To various degrees, tax rates, credits, and allowances
have been included in the factor prices.                However, few studies have explicitly investigated

the effect of changes in tax policy on variable factor demands.                  An exception is the paper




                                                      —22—
by Kesselman, Williamson and Berndt (1977).         In this study,      a single output,        three—factor

translog cost function is estimated in the absence of technological change and for                  a tech-
nology which exhibits constant returns   to scale. Thus,         in terms of the cost function given

by the right side of equation (20), 2    =   1 (single   output and so let          a = a,,),       = 1,     a
=0    =a   = n, j=1,...,n—i      by constant returns to scale,          n    =         =        =        =   0,

j=1   n—i by the absence of technological change, and n            =   3    (three inputs). The inputs
are blue—collar workers, white collar workers and capital. The effects of an investment tax
credit along with two types of ea.doyment tax credits on factor demand were simulated.
One employment tax incentive was an employment tax credit and the other was                                  a
marginal (or incremental) employment tax credit.

      The results from the elimination of the investment tax credit for the period 1962 to
1971 for U.S. manufacturing were that total labour demand would have been around .7%

higher over the period. Employment of blue—collar workers would have been about 1.1%

higher, while employment of white—collar workers would have fallen about .3 percent.
These results reflect the findings that white and blue—collar workers are mildly                         sub-
stitutable, capital and   blue—collar workers are substitutes          and capital and white—collar
workers are complements.     Also, average costs and thereby product price costs would have

been about .8 percent higher.

      Next, Kesselman, Williamson and Berndt considered the effects of the imposition of
an employment tax credit. First, the imposition was         on   a per man—hour basis and            second

on the wage bill. In each simulation, the cost of the employment tax credit was set equal
to the revenue gain   from eliminating the investment      tax credit.        In both cases, the effects

were quite small and the tax credit on          a per man—hour basis was relatively more
favourable to blue—collar workers compared to white—collar workers.                  The converse is true

for the credit based on the wage bill.       The greatest influence of the employment tax                 in-
centives arose from the incremental tax credit.      A base of .5          of the    previous   year'a   wage




                                             —23—
bill doubles the impact on factor demands relative to the effects of an employment tax
credit based on a percentage of the wage bill.                 This result occurs because the incremental

employment—tax credit channels subsidies to the firm for additional emplnyment beyond a

base magnitude. Hence, the same policy cost can generate a larger percentage change in
the    price   of subsidized units   of labour through       an   incremental credit.     Provided, of course,
that the firm utilizes the incremental tax credit.
        The previous empirical analysis focused on the effects of tax incentives on factor
demands.        However, in the ioog—run equilibrium framework (defined by equations (20) and

(21)), which admit multiple ootpute, ooo—coostaot returns                       to scale and non—neutral
technological change,       it is also         possible to loveetigate the effects of     tax   policy on scale
economies, ecope economies, and the rate                of productivity growth. There has not         been   an
empirical analysis       of the   effects of tax policy on scale and scope ecocomiee, but Fraumeni

and Jorgenson (1980) and Jorgenson (f981) have studied the depeodeocy of productivity

growth on tax rates aod incentives,
        To see how productivity growth can be affected by tax policy, refer to equation (20).
Since   the rate of productivity growth              is defined as   the proportional   decline in production

costs over time, this rate can            be    obtained by differeotiatiog eqoatioo (20) with respect to




(22)    —afnc/Bt =       —[on      cert   + Z5o1Jny5
We can observe then that the rate of productivity growth is                     a function of the govern-
ment ' s   tax policy.     Tax policy operates through the factor prices which, io turn, influence
the rate of productivity growth.
        The coefficients, in equation (22), relating to the factor prices characterize how the
rate of productivity growth responds to changes in the tax, credit and allowances rates.
For example, suppose a credit is offered to the                jth input   which causes    its factor price to



                                                      —24—
decline by 1 percent. The effect on           the rate of productivity growth is        found by differen-

tiating (22) with respect to 2nw. Thus, in the case                a
                                                          characterizes the manner in which
the rate of technological change is influenced by an increase in the tax credit on the jth
factor of production. If              then the rate of productivity growth increases as the tax
credit increases, while if   n<O, the converse          arises.

        The    n   coefficients show the biases of technological change.           They indicate the effect
of changes in technology on the input cost shares.                 For example, technological change for
the jth input gives the change in        tu   cost share of the jth input in response to changes in

technology represented by time.        This can be seen from equation set (21).              If we differen-
tiate the     jtb share by time, the     effect is determined by        o.    Hence the factor biases of

technological change characterize how the rate of productivity growth is influenced by tax

policy.

        Generally, we define technological change as factor—using if the bias of technological
change for the factor is positive (that          is    for the
                                                           jth input a>O). In other words, if
changes in technology result in en        increase in the cost share of the jtb input, then tech-

nological change is     jth factor —using.    Conversely,     if   changes in the technology result in a
decrease in the cost share of the     jth input, then        technological change is   jth   factor—reducing

(or saving).
       The biases of technological change express the dependence of factor cost shares on the

technology and also characterize the dependence             of the rate   of productivity growth on the

input prices and thereby on tax policy.               For example, technological change, which is the
jth   factor—using, means that    an increase in the factor price         of the   jth input   decreases the

rate of productivity growth. Similarly, technological change which is the jth factor—
reducing means that an increase in the factor price of the jth input increases the rate of

productivity growth. The lesson to be learned from this analysis is that                it ie not   sufficient

for the government to provide      tax   incentives in order to improve productivity performance.

porate income are inversely carrelated wi'h           tre ra'es of          prnductH   ry growth. This result
arises from the fact that        tax   policy has reduced the rental rate on capital which has                  in-
creased the rate of productivity growth because the latter is capital using. They found
that   effective   tax rate    declined sharply between 1960 and 1965 while the rate                  of produc-
tivity growth attained the postwar peak of 2.11 percent during this period. From                            1965—

1969, effective tax rates rose substantiaily while the rate                 of productivity growth     declined to

0.05 percent.      Effective   tax   rates declined from 1969       to   1972 nod have remained relatively

constant since that time hut productivity growth increased slightly from '969 to 1972 and
fell dramatically from 1973          They attribute the latter oecline to 'he energy price increases.
In light    of this cnncluson. which        has been the subject of much debate (see Nadiri and

Schankerman 1i981J, Belly         i98lJ and Clark [1982j), they recommend that tax                   pnlicy should
be introduced to decrease        the factor prices of capital and labour.
      In Canada, little work has been done on investigating the effects of tax. credit and
allowance rates on factor substitution and prnductivity growth.'0 In genera!, much more

empirical work needs to be done, even in the context of long—run equilibrium. First, little



                                                   —26—
is known    about the effects of tax policy on scale and scope economies. In order to capture
these effects,   it is necessary to estimate cost (or profit) functions which do not incorporate
the maintained hypotheses of constant return to scale (or for that matter hoinotheticity)
and of a single output.      Second, the treatment of technological change is quite simplistic.

Technological development does not usually occur autonomously; it is also part       of produc-
tion and investment decisions.      Indeed, the demand   for   research and development capital,

which is an important element of technological change, is itself      a function of the array   of

factor prices and the quantities of uutputs.1' Thus, as is the case of the other factors of

production, the demand for R&D capital depends on the various taxes, credits and            al—

lowances.

4, Taxes and Factor Adjustment


     In the previous section we considered the effects of taxes oo factor substitutioo aod

productivity growth io the context of our geoeral model by aasoming that factors of pro-
duction could be costlessly adjusted and utilized, Suppose now it is assumed that a subset
of factors of production can he coetiessly adjosted while for the remaining inputs, inetalia—

tion cost must be incorred and so the latter are quasi—fixed factors

      Generaiiy. two types of models have been deveioped which relate to factor adjust-
ment, The first typa emphasizes the trade—off between futors increases in the quasi—fixed
factors (and thereby futore increases in output ievee) and higher present costs associated
with increasing adjustments speeds. The higher costs appear either as higher purchase

prices of the quasi—fixed factors   or    as higher costs of financing the accomuiation of these

fectore, The former costs have been considered by Lucas             [19671, Gould 119681   and Musea

                     latter costs have   been considered by Steigum [1983].       These mudeis are
[1977], while the
sale to capture the positive correlation between èapital cnete and :nveetment and the mag-
nitude of adjuetment speeds easociated with the quasi—fixed factors.
      The short—run determination of investment in the quasi —fixed factors is the              me—

chanism by which the adjustment process of these intote are 4ictercoined. There is, how-

ever, no relationship between the veriahie factor deosands and investment             n    the quasi—

fixed factors,   Thus the coets of faster adjustment are nut          reflected in tue inwer current

production ievels.
      The second type of model of factor adjustment recognizes that changes in the quasi—
fixed factor investments alters variable factor demands and thereby current output supplies.

In this context, the costs of adjustment are reflected in lower current output levels.          Thus,

in adjusting quasi—fixed factors, the benefits of increased future output supplies are
balanced by   the costs of decreased     present output supplies.    This type of modei emphasizes




                                              —28---
internal costs of adjustment through the technology and                               is represented   by foregone current

output. The other model type emphasizes external adjustment costs, re                                      . nted either by

       The equilibrium of the firm consists of equation sets (23) and (25). The empirical

implementation of the model is generally quits complex and                    a number      of procedures have

been introduced in the literature. The complexity           nf the     model relates      to equation set   (25)
aod the first procedure confronts this difficulty by placing enough structure on the technol—

ogy and expectations      of the firms in order for equation set               (25)     to have a   closed form

solution.   We shall deem this procedure the direct approach. The direct approach restricts
the technology represented by the variable profit function (or variable cost fuoctioo if                    out-
put is exogenous) to     a quadratic specification and adjustment costs depend only                     on the

first order changes in the quasi—fixed levels.'2           Jo addition,       the expectations process must
be specified in    the model.Berndt, Fuss and Waverman [1979], Denny, Fuss and
Waverman [l981[ and Berndt and Morrison 11981[ impose static expectations. Sargent
]1978], Meese [1980] and Hansen and Sargent ]1980] have imposed rational expectatioos.
Static expectations are to be understood in the context of continuously revising plans and

always expecting   that current   prices, tax credit and allowance rates are to persist. Current

period plans are the only ones     that are actuaily carried out. Rational expectations are to
be understood in the context of generating forecasts of prices, taxes, credit and allowance

rates which are the ones that best fit the actual time series.                 In   this case, restrictions are
imposed on the model (in other words, cross—equation restrictions on parameters) which
reflect the maintained expectations processes.13

       The direct approach can be presented in the following context. Assume that there is

           The model which can be estimated consists of equations (26), (27) and (29) with
stochastic error terms appended to equations (26) and (29).                           The disturbance terms in
these latter two equations can reflect optimization or measurement errors. In addition, the
disturbance in the production function, (26), can also reflect shocks to the techooiogyl0

Berndt, Fuss and Waverman (1977) developed a special case of the above model which                                     in-
corporated the corporate income tax credit, the physical investment tax credit and the
physical capital cost allowance.                 They assumed that there was          a    single quasi—fixed factor
and static price expectations. Under the assumption of exogenous output, the first of the
two stages relating to the production decisions can be determined by the specification of a

variable cost function (as opposed to                 a variable profit function when output                   supplies are

endogenous).          Assuming a quadratic variable cost function which                   is normalized        by the first

phenomena as described for the errors              of equations (20) and               (21).    Equations (30) and (31)
represent the first stage of the production decisions or the short—run equilibrium.
         The determination of investment is gnverned by                         a   flexible accelerator because this

model is        a special   case of (26).    The investment equation is

is the long—run equilibrium demand for the quasi—fixed factor, and W5 = Q(pi5)
is the after—tax rental rate on this factor, and a stochastic disturbance has been added to
the investment equation.t7
         The model consists of equations (30), (31) and (32). Moreover, because the variable
cost function is normalized, the errors in equations (30), (31) and (32) are linearly                              inde—

pendent.   The first variable factor conditional demand function has already been eliminated.

Thus equations (30), (31) and (32) can be used to estimate the unknown parameters.
     Berndt, Fuss and Waverman estimated this model for U.S. manufacturing for the
period 1947—1974 and incorporated the corporate income tax rate, investment tax credit
and capital cost allowance into the post—tax rental rate on capital. From our point of

view,   the most   significant result   of this paper is that the   long—run price elasticities on the

conditional factor demands (both variable and quasi—fixed) are considerably smaller than
their counterparts obtained in models with no adjustment costs. This means that, for U.S.

manufacturing, the influence of tax policy on long—run factor demands is significantly
smaller than previous empirical evidence showed,          The misspecification caused by assuming

all factors can be costlessly adjusted caused an upward bias in the influences of factor

prices, and thereby tax policy, on input demands.
     The second approach to the empirical implementation of the intertemporal production
model is the dual approach developed by Rockafeller (1970), Benveniste and Schienkman

(1979), McLaren and Cooper (1980) and Epstein (1981).               The focus of this approach is not

the variable profit function defined by (23.1) (or the variable cost function) but rather the
value function defined by equation (10).          Unlike the direct approach, dynamic duality can

handle much more general specifications of the technology, including the quasi—fixed factor

adjustment mechanisms. However, the treatment of expectations formation processes                    is

much more limited using the dual approach.
        The dual approach can be presented in the following context. Assume that there               is

a single output (.2=1) and the technology is represented by the general production function


(33)        = F(v,K, K1         —
                                    (I, — 8)K,A).

Jo addition, assume that there are          static expectations on the    prices, tax, credit and   al-
lowance rates and the     firm's discount rate is constant.

Nadiri (1985) have estimated the spillovers that are associated with R&D investment for
U.S. firms, and Bernstein (1986) has estimated the effects of physical aod R&D investment

tax incentives for Canadian firms using dynamic duality. In all cases, an intertemporal
cost minimizing approach was used, because the stream of output was assumed to be ex-

                               A], where A is an m dimensional matrix and                        Im   is the m
dimensional identity matrix.      This functional form for the value function is linear in output

and the quasi—fixed factors and quadratic in the post—tax factor prices.'9
       The results from the empirical work based on              a   sample   of about    30 firms over the

period 1975—1980 are that physical and R&D capital are complements both in the short
and long—runs, while each type of capital is a substitue for labour, Both types of capital

respond to changes in their own post—tax purchase prices.                     However, the demands for

capital are quite price inelastic. Even in the long—run, the own price elasticities of the
cpaital inputs are less than .4.     Labour demand is relatively more price responsive in both
the short and long—runs.        The adjustment process for physical capital              is   shorter than for



                                            —36—
R&D capital. The latter takes about six years to adjust while the former takes about four

years.     Moreover, the capital stocks are complementary to each other along the adjustment

path.      In other words, increases io    the stock of physical capital shorten the adjustment
period of R&D capital.

         Changes in three types of tax incentives are considered in this study.           First, a I
percent increase in the physical investment tax credit generates increases in the demand fnr

physical capital of .022 percent in the short—run and .055 percent in the long run.
Similarly, the demand for R&D rapital increases by .010 percent in the short—run and .029

percent in    the long—run.    Moreover, when the output effects of the physical investment tax
credit increase are considered, the demands for all the inputs increase.

         Second,   an increase in the   R&D investment tax credit also affects   the structure    of

production.        However, these effects are smaller relative to an equivalent increase in the

physical investment      tax credit. The third incentive is the    R&D incremental investment
allowance,     An increase in this allowance affects the structure   of production, but    generates
the smallest effects of all thres incentives.
         The fact that the empirical results are based on   a dynamic model permits the inves-
tigation of short— and long—run effects on factor demands.         In addition, the speed    nf the
adjustment process is estimated.    Bernstein determines the annual adjustment from the
short to the long—run effect of any tax policy initiative. In the study, this type of
                                                                                      analy-
sis is conducted for R&D expenditures, because of its focus on policies influencing R&D
investment. However, the analysis applies equally to the other factor demands.

         Changes in tax credit and allowance rates decrease post—tax factor prices and thereby
decrease production and adjustment costs.             Using an intertemporal application of
Shepherd's Lemma based on the value function permits the determination of the cost to
the government, in terms of foregone tax revenues, of increases in the tax credit and           al—

Inwance rates. However, this analysis does not necessarily capture changes in efficiency as—




                                             —37—.
sociated with changes in tax policy (see Diewert (1985(a))), and Jorgenson and stoker

(1985). Bernstein investigates the relative effectiveness of alternative tax policies on the
structure of production when the cost to the government across tax policy changes                      is

equalized. In additon, a calculation is made of the actual coet to the government                     of

alternative tax policy initiatives. The calculations show that changes in tax credit and             al-
lowance   rates directed towards     R&D investment generate about         $82      of R&D expenditure

per dollar of lost tax revenue at the existing level of output. Moreover, an increase in the
physical investment tax credit generates around $06 of R&D expenditure per dollar of lost
tax revenue. This figure increases to around $.i5 when output effects are considered.
Hence, there may be important cross effects arising from government tax policy changes

directed towards    a particular factor of production or type of investment.            Excluding these

cross effects biases the cost estimates and the influence of tax policy on production and
investment.
      The third approach to the implementation of the model given by equations (23) and

(25) is   to treat the first order   conditions for   the   quasi—fixed factors as implicit equations

and not obtain closed form solutions. This is the approach developed and implemented by
Kennan [1979], Hansen and Singleton [1982], Pindyck and Rotemberg [1983], and Bernstein
and Nadiri [1986].        This approach, which may be reffered to as the implicit approach,

specifies a functional form for the variable profit (or variable cost function) which is jointly
estimated with the reduced form variable factor demand equations and the implicit equa-
tions for the quasi—fixed factors. This approach permits           a great   deal   of flexibility in the
specifications   of the   technology and the expectations generating processes because the first
order conditions for the quasi—fixed factors do not have to he solved.
      There are two difficulties with this implicit approach. First, because closed                 form

solutions are not obtained for the quasi—fixed factors, there are no conditions in the model

guaranteeing the optimality (existence and uniqueness) of the factor demands for any set of



                                             —38—
price trajectories. In other words the terminal or transversality conditions are ignored, as
only the first order conditions are used.        In terms   of the estimation of    th' mode!, since     the
estimator ignores the information contained in the transversality conditions it must not be

asymptotically efficient. However, the direct and dual approaches require the choice of
particular expectation generating processes (as well as the choice of              a   technology).     This

necessitates   that these processes      he incorporated Into        the restrictions imposed in the
estimation. An incorrect choice leads to inconsistent, as well as asymptotically xefficient
estimates (see Gourieroux, Laffont ann Monfort 1979).
      The second difficult) with the implic.t approact is chat because             the quasi—fixed fac-
tor demands are not determined,          we    ce:not charac,erize the properties       of these demand

functions through time. We can only investigate the lung—run properties of the                        quasi—

fixed factor demands, Wickens          1982]   has suggested   a   solution to this difficulty.   Replace
all expected values   of   future variables with their realizations      to   produce an observable but

incomplete system  of equations. The system is then completed by adding equations char-
acterizing the determinants of future values of the variables in terms of any variables
known in toe current period. Estimation of the complete syscem will be consistent but not

asymptotically efficient. Mornuver, rhrough this augmented system of equations we can
determine the short as well as the long—run properties of the quasi—fixed factor demands.
This method has not        as   yet been used to estimate models of production structure and              to
determine the effects of tax policy on this structure.

5, Taxez and Factor Utilization


        It   has long been recognized that although adjustment costs cause the quasi—fixity of
factors of production, the rates        at which these factors are utilized are variable in the
short—run.      Indeed, these rates are part of the   firm's production plan which are dependent
on the stocks of quasi—fixed factors and post—tax product and factor prices.         Thus, in the
short—run changes in tax policy do not affect the stocks of quasi—fixed factors, they do
influence the rates     at which these stocks are accumulated and utilized. This       is precisely

the model      developed in section 2   of this paper and is represented by equation sets   (13) and

(15).

        Generally, there have been two types of models relating to the factor utilization.
The first type due to Lucas [1970], Winston and McCoy [1974], Abel [1981] and Bernstein

[1983] emphasize      the   trade—off between increased output and higher labour costs          that
utilization generates. The increase in costs manifest themselves in terms of overtime and
shift wage premiums. These models are able to capture the positive correlation between
real wages and labour utilization and the positive correlation between capital utilization and

capital stock (see Foss [1981]).
        The short—run interrelationship between utilization and investment is the mechanism
in these models by which utilization affects the accumulation of the quasi—fixed factor.
There is no connection between capital utlization and depreciation rates or between labour
utilization and quit rates. Thus the costs of higher utilization rates are not reflected in
the lifetime of the quasi—fixed factors.
        The second type of model of factor utilization recognizes that changes in the rate of
utilization alter the lifetime of a quasi—fixed factor. In this case, the benefits of increased
current output are balanced by the costs of decreased future output,           The cost of factor
utilization is foregone future output.        The cost of factor utilization are analogous to the



                                               —40—
two types of models pertaining to factor adjustment. One emphasize                            xternal costs
represented by rising wage rates or capital porchase prices, the other nohasizes internal
costs through tbe technology represented by foregone output.                   In the . see   of installation
costs, it is current output which is forrgone, while in the case of utilization costs it is               fu-
ture output.       The models incorporating internal utilization costs have been developed by
Smith (1970), Taubman          an    Wiikinsou (1970), Diewsrt (1980), Epstein and Denny (1980),

Evsrson (1982), Schworm (1983) and Bernctein and Nadiri (1984).
       It is   generally difficult   to   empirically implement models with variable factor         utiliza-
tion because measures of utilization rates (eipecially for capital) are usually not available.
in practice, different approaches have been used to overcome the lack of capital utilization
data.ti The first      approach is to develop        a   measure   of the potential' capital (or   capital—
output ratio).      This is   a statistical construct      based on   a trend through   cyclical variations
in actual capital (or capital—output ratio).             This type of measure has been used in many
macroec000metric models, and by Klein and Preston (1967), Nadiri and Rosen (1969), Coen
and   Hickman (1970), and Brechling (1975).                Ths difficulty with this is approach      is   that
the trend itself is a function of relative prices and the magnitudes of the quasi—fixed fac-
tors. As these variables change, the trend varies and must be revised. However, the revi-
sions to tbe trend occur extraneously to the model which is in fact supposed to explain

utilization variation.
      A second approach recognizes             that inventories (or at least departures from some
long—run level) are linked to the rate          at   which capital (and other quasi—fixed factors) is

utilized. For example, an increase in inventories relative to the long—run level signifies a
fall in product demand and decrease in factor utilization. This method has been explored

recently by Helliwell and Chung (1985). The integration of the theory of optimal                          in-
ventory holdings with the theory of factor utilization and investment offers the potential of
an important avenue in which to investigate the role of tax                   policy on the    structure of



                                                 —41—
production. At the present time, the application          is   limited to postulating the existence of

a partial adjustment   process characterizing inventory accumulation, rather than the explicit

integration (in an optimizing framework) of inventory and factor utilization decisions.
      The third approach is due to Epstein and Denny (1980) and it can he discussed
within the context of the general theoretical model already developed.                   Because the focus is

on utilization decisions which are determined in the short—run, we shall concentrate on the

first stage production decisions of the the firm. Thus we return to equation set (13) and
recall that in the short—run, given the beginning of period quasi—fixed factors, output
                                                                            and end of period
prices and variable factor prices, output supplies, variable factor demands
quasi—fixed  factors (or the implied utilization rates) are determined. Once a functional
form is specified for the post—tax variable profit function, the short—run supply and
demand functions can be determined. Suppose the variable profit function is given as a
Generalized Leontieff so     that

(38) ,r   =   K[2a1p;5 W;5          2a2p5   W + 2n3W W + pp + W1+ $3W                                +

where a,, i=1,2,3,4,    fi,   i=1,2,3,4, and     ,, i=1,2 are the unknownparameters.The                    post—

 tax variable profit denoted by equation (38), incorporates the assumption of constant
 returns to scale, with a single output, single quasi—fixed factor and two variable factors.
 There is also   a stochastic disturbance, u,       appended   to the   variable profit function. Using

 equation (38) and by Hotelling's Lemma, equation set (13) becomes

 (39.1)   y = K{a,p5 Wj + a2p5 Wj + ,8 ap5 Q5}                                +   u7.

Equation set (39) defines the short—run equilibrium. Let us focus on equatinn (39.3) which
captures the determinants of            cod period capital services and thereb                   cnplicitly) the

factor.    Moreover, embodied in (39.3) is            a   generalization of the traditional model with a

constant exogenous geometric depreciation rate.                Tf   o,           —

As discussed in section 2 of the paper.         1     fi is the depreciation rate.           Although deprecia

tion is price independent and constant, it is stilt             to   ne determined within the mode:               lf.

however,    a   value of    fl   is exogenous,y given, then eqoatinn (39.3) coliapsea to the tradi
tional model.

        The model to be estimated in order to detscmoe the unkn..wn parameters consists of

equation set (39).         Equation (38) can he eliminated sioce the error in this equaton is a
linear combinatton of the errors in equation set (3d). However, the empirical implementa-
tion is not straightforward because there        is   no data on          H   and   K.    This pcob'en, is solved

by assuming that equation (39.3( is non—stochastic                       whtch   i in line wth the ccadi'ionai
assumption that depreciatioo          is exogenous    and no.—stochastic, and that the intiai capital
stock    at the start of the sample period is             equai to the measured capital stock.                  Thus

using the estimated parameters based on the technology, along with equation (39.3, the
accumulation equation (2) and the initial capital stock, Epstein and Denny are abla to
construct both beginning and end of period capital stocks and the implied depreciation rate

(K   —
          K)/K.         Thus equations (39.1) and (39.2) are to be estimated.
        In order   to   implement this approach       it is   necessary that there is only       a single   quasi—

fixed factor,   the technology exhibits constant returns to scale and there is either static ex-
pectations or perfect foresight with respect to the prices, tax, credit and allowance rates
The fact that beginning and end of period capital stocks are unobservable variables means
that the system of equations is underidentified.               The existence nf only        a single   quasi—fixed
factor along with constant returns to scale technology implies that the firm                      is   really   cnn—




                                                 —43—.
cerned only with the ratio of end to beginning period capital or the depreciation rate.
This rate only depends on observable variables and the parameters characterizing the tech-

nology, and hence if the equation is non—stochastic then the system becomes identified
(using the capital accumulation equation and given the initial stock). If there was more
than   a    single quasi—fixed factor with variable utilization then either the technology would
have   to   be specified with sufficient parameter restrictions in order to identify the system of

equations or estimation methods allowing for errors in variables would have to be adopted.
      The importance of this model is that it explicitly captures the manner in which
prices and thereby tax policy affect capital utilization. It is of interest to note that Ep-

stein and     Denny use   the corporate    income tax rate, the investment   tax credit rate, and
capital cost allowance in computing the post—tax purchase price of capital                  They
estimated their model for U.S. manufacturing for the period 1947—1971. The most sig-
nificant result from our point of view of this survey is that price elasticities on factor
demands and output supply with variable capital utilization are substantially smaller than
those found using the standard model of            exogenous depreciation.   In addition, capital
utilization is price sensitive, although the elasticities are highly inelastic. This means (at
least fnr U.S. manufacturing) that the influence of tax policy on short—run factor demands
in significantly smaller than previous evidence led us to believe. The potential            mis—

specification arising from assuming capital utilization is exogenous causes factor price      in-
fluences to he borne by      the variable inputs. Indeed, capital utilization    does respond to

changes in     tax policy in the   short—run.

8. Tax Policy Implications


          Corporate tax, credit and          allowance rates can influence factor dec ir. is, output sop—

plies and the rate of technological change.                  These policies affect production decisions     be-
cause the prices firms pay            for their factors and     charge for    their products are modified. In

order to evaluate the effectiveness of tax policy in               ths   context, the aothorVes should have

knowledge of how these prices are altered by                 their tax policies.

          Firms respond to price changes initiated through tax policy and these tesponses are

defined by the various product and factor (own and cross) price elasticities. This irnpliev

that      the hehaiioral response of firms            m.st    be known       by the tax authorities so as to
determine         'ax   poliry effectiveness,     However, obtainng estimates of the relevant elasticities

is by no means a simple task.                   Indeed we have etr"ssed the problems       of interaction   and

adjiietmtot             production decisions for the esthoatior' refiect'ng inpot demands and output

suppliec.

          'F be   interaction   of factor   demands and produ.'t sopphes is a crucial element in cap-

turing the Impact of tax policy.                Tax policy initiatives levied upon a particular production

activity in       general cause cross effects on other activities.           For example, an investment tax
credit on equipment and stroctores generates effects not only on the demand for cspitai but

also fo: the dernandr for laLoor and intermediate inputs.                      This result, in fact, has been

obtained in empirical stodies. The evaluation of any particular tax policy initiative must

reflect the contemporaneous interaction between inputs and outputs.

          Current changes in tax, credit and allowance rates alan cause future production plans

to be altered.           We have discussed and        seen   bow the long—run effects of tax changes are

quite distinct from the short—run influences; both the magnitude and nature of the effects

differ.      In the short—run variable factor demands, the utilization and accumulation                of   the

quasi—fixed factors interact           in light of tax policy     changes.     However, nnly in the long—run




                                                      —45—
are firms able to vary the stocks' relating to the quasi—fixed factors. In addition, the
distinction between the short— and long—run implies that there exists adjustment processes,
These processes capture the expansion   (or contraction) in the   quasi—fixed factors and are
also influenced by tax policy.   Empirical results have highlighted the distinction between
the short— and long—run effects and the biases involved in ignoring adjustment processes.
The evidence seems to be that tax policy evaluation must explicitly recognize the important
features of interaction and adjustment governing production activities.

tions oo this paper. They gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Kristofer Hogg of the

1.  All variables in the transformation are measured as flows of services, The term capi—
tal inputs' is meant tu suggest factors of production obtained from stocks which can be
accumulated. These stocks can represent the traditional equipment, structures and land
and also pertain to research and development and various types of skilled labour.
2. In this paper, vntages of capital stocks are not distinguished.  The reasons are first
that the empirical work in this area has focused on the putty—clay type of vintage model
(see Bischoif (1971), King (1972), Sumner (1974), and Malcomson (1982)). In other words,
once installed factor proportions are fixed This implies that changes in tax rates and in-
centives cannot affect the rate of factor substitution of installed capital. Second, these
studies assume that the service life uf capital is constant, which means that tax policy does
not affect the rate of capital utilization. The model in the text could be modified to allow
for alternative vintages of capital. The transformation function in this case would depend
on the vector of all past investment flows for all types of investment rather than on the
vectors of beginning— and end—period capital. (See Diewert (1985)).
3.  The focus is not on the financial decisions of the firm and so it is assumed that the
firm issues one kind of bond and one kind of share.
4. Under the Long Amendment in the U.S., which was repealed in 1964, the depreciation
base was reduced by the amount of the 1TC11 so that        = 1. We can introduce without
any difficulty allowances or credits fur the variable as well as the quasi—fixed factors in
this model. However, the complexity of the tax issues relates to intertemporal resource
allocation decisions. In Canada,        1 and the U.S.
                                                           0
                                                           = .5.
5.   In tbe finite horizon model, we would have     to    specify terminal values   of the capital
stocks. See Diewert (1985(b)).
6. If tax credits or allowances are defined on the variable factors of production then these
instruments of tax policy would directly affect output supplies and variable factor demands.
7. We also assume that lim cs(t,s)Q3K3     =   0,   i=1    m.

8.  Since tbere are no adjustment costs, all inputs are variable. Also, time (t) designates
tbe rate of autonomous technological change. The time subscript is deleted from each of
tbe variables.
9.  The disturbances in the share equations could also reflect technology shocks. However,
in this case, the disturbance in the cost equation must be contemporaneously correlated
with each of the factor prices in order for technology shocks to appear in each of the share

equations.    This does not pose any theoretical difficulties but adds to the estimation prob—
lems.

10. Recently Rao and Preston (1983), using the same framework as Fraumeni and
Jorgenson (1980) have investigated the effects of factor prices on factor demands and the
rate of productivity growth for 9 Canadian manufacturing industries and 8 non—
manufacturing Canadian industries for the period 1957—1979. They did not investigate the
effects of tax policy on the structure of production. Surprisingly, their results were quite
different than obtained by Fraumeni and Jorgenson. In particular, technological change
generally appears to be capital—reducing.
11. An excellent survey on the role of R&D capital in production activities is by Criliches
(1979).
12. Hansen and Sargent (1981) have developed a model where adjustment costs do not
have to depend on first order differences in the quasi—fixed factors. Their procedure has
not as yet been implemented.
13. In a recent paper, Epstein and Yatchew (1985) develop and estimate a model which
assumes that the technology is quadratic with adjustment costs based on first order dii—
ferences and expectations are based on autoregressive processes. Because they estimate the
quadratic production function and autoregressive expectations equations along with the
derived factor demand equations, they could test all of the cross equation restrictions im—
plied by the firm's programming plan and expectations processes.
14.   The specification of adjustment costs, which depend on net rather than
in the quasi—fixed factors and separable from the production technology, isgross       changes
                                                                                   not a sig-
nificant difference, provided that aggregation over firms need not be theoretically justifiable.
If firm aggregation is to be rigorously treated, then parameter restrictions must be imposed
on the technology. However, as Blackorby and Schworm (1983) have shown, these restric-
tions are inconsistent with flexible accelerator factor demands when both positive and neg-
ative changes in the Qs occur. This inconsistency can be avoided by the use of gross in-
vestment.
15.   Here both stages   of the production decisions are  combined into a single stage. In ad—
ditinn,   a production function is  specified because there is only a single output. We could
just as   easily have tackled this special case of the general model in two stages.
16. The disturbances in the factor demand equations (29) can also reflect technology
shocks. However, by a similar argument to that presented in footnote 9, estimation prob-
lems arise. The error in the production function, from which the factor demands are
derived, must be contemporaneously correlated with each of the factors in order for tech-
nology shocks to appear in each of the factor demand functions.
17. W is also defined in the discussion after equation (19). It is an outcome of the
static price and tax expectations assumption. The disturbance in the investment equation
represents optimizing or measurement errors. If the disturbance reflects technology shocks,
then the error in the normalized variable cost function is contemporaneously correlated with
the quasi—fixed factor.

18.  Epstein and Denny (1983) estimate models with both static expectatns and expecta—
tions generated by first order autoregressive processes. However, in     iatcer case the
processes were estimated independently of the productioo decisione.
19.  In addition, this functional form is consistent with aggregation to' c.tions guaranteeing
the existence of a representative firm (see Diewert 1980), Epstein and Denny (1983) anC
Blackorby and Schworm (1983)).
20.   Usually average hours worked is the measure of ;aoour utilization.
21.   The stochastic disturbances in equations (38; and (39) represent optimization an
measurement errors. The disturbance in the variable profit function can also represen:
technology shocks, However, if the disturbauces iu equation (39) represent technolog
shocks, then the error in the variable profit function is contemporaneously correlated wit.
the factor and product prices.
