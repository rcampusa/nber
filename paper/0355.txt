   INTERNATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN SOCIAL SECURITY AND SAVING

                      Martin Feldstein

                           SUMMARY

            The U.S. Social Security Administration, in cooperation
with similar agencies in other countries, recently developed estimates
of social security benefits for twelve major industrial countries. More
specifically, these estimates provide information on the ratio of social
security pension to preretirement earnings for a newly retired couple in
which the man had the average earnings in manufacturing industry.
            The present paper uses these new data to estimate the
effects of social security benefits on saving and retirement in an
extended life cycle model. The parameter estimates indicate that, with
retirement behavior given, social security significantly reduces private
saving; an increase of the benefit-to-earnings ratio by 10 percentage
points reduces the saving rate by approximately 3 percentage points. The
reduced form parameter indicates that allowing for the effect on saving
of induced retirement lowers this implied decrease in saving from 3
percentage points to about 2 percentage points.

           International Differences in Social Security and Saving

                                 Martin Feldstein*


     The traditional life cycle theory of saving implies that an individual

who expects to receive social security benefits will reduce his personal

saving by a corresponding amount.    In a more general theoretical framework,

the effect of social security on saving is ambiguous:     by inducing changes

in retirement behavior or intergenerational transfers, social security can

either increase or decrease aggregate private saving. l    Only empirical ana-

lysis can determine the actual net effect of social security.

     The retirement benefits that are provided by public social security

programs differ significantly among the major industrial countries.     These dif-

ferences provide a potentially useful basis for measuring the impact of social

security on aggregate savings.    In a previous study (Feldstein, 1977), I esti-

mated the average level of social security benefits for 15 countries and used

these estimates to examine how benefits affected aggregate private saving.       The

results of that study indicate that social security benefits did depress saving

by a substantial amount.

     A fundamental problem in any study of the effect of social security is

estimating the level of benefits that individuals anticipate that they will

receive when they retire.     In my earlier international study, I used the ratio

of the average benefit currently received per retiree to the average per capita

income in the country.   This "average replacement ratio" is appropriate if the

individuals who are working base their estimates of the benefits that they will

eventually receive on the experience of those who are currently retired.      There

are two problems with this approach.     The first is conceptual:   if the social

security program has changed substantially in recent years, the current workers

rnay correctly perceive that the experience of the older individuals who retired

many years ago is less relevant than the experience of those who are just

retiring.   The second is practical:   the average level of social security bene-

fits is difficult to calculate in practice for several countries because the

data on aggregate benefits do not distinguish retirement benefits from benefits

paid to survivors and to the disabled.     Dividing total benefits by the number of

older persons or the number of retirees produces a value that is very much

influenced by the treatment of survivors and the disabled and by their impor-

tance relative to retirees.    It is frankly surprising that the study based on

the "average replacement ratio" permitted parameter estimates that were as

plausible, preciseÂ·and robust as they appeared to be.

     rfhe present paper was stimulated by the publication of anew, and I believe

more reliable, source of data on social security benefits.     The U.S. Social

Security Administration, in cooperation with similar agencies in other

countries, recently developed estimates of social security benefits for twelve

major industrial countries (Haanes-Olsen, 1978).     More specifically, the Social

Security Administration estimated the ratio of the social security retirement
                                         -3-
pension of a newly retired aged couple to the average earnings of a worker in

manufac turing employment.    This "new retiree replacement ratio" has the advan-

tage that it is not distorted by the experience of individuals who retired many

years ago.     Because it is based on a careful analysis of statutory provisions,

it is also not subj ect to the measurement errors in the "average replacement

ratio."

     Although the "new retiree replacement ratio" should permit more reliable

estimates of the effect of social security on saving, this ratio also has signi-

ficant problems.     First, since the benefit schedules are generally progressive

and manufacturing workers better paid than average, the Social Security

Administration calculation will understate the benefit replacement ratio of the

average retiree; the extent of this understatement will differ among countries.

Second, no allowance is made for taxes; the effective replacement rate will be

understated to the extent that earnings are taxed and social security benefits

are not.     This discrepancy will also differ among countries, depending on tax

rules and on the relative reliance on value added taxes.      Third, the "new

retiree replacement ratio" contains no information on inflation indexing, a

feature that clearly affects the lifetime value of benefits.      Finally, we have

data only on public retirement pensions.       Private pensions have become

increasingly important and also differ significantly among countries. 1       All of

these shortcomings can introduce substantial error into the measurement of

expected social security benefits.


Dl'he f)~cial Security Administration study does contain information on private
pensions in 5 countries in 1975 that emphasize these differences. For example,
while 45 percent of the U.K. working population is covered by private pensions
and these average 23 percent of earnings, in the Netherlands 80 percent are
covered and benefits average between 7 and 11 percent.
                                        -4-
These problems should be borne in mind in considering the results presented

in this paper.

     'rhe current study focuses on the estimates based on the "new retiree

replacement ratio."    'I'he statistical estimates indicate that savings behavior

in the first half of the 1910's in the twelve sample countries is quite

consistent with the implications of the extended life cycle model and that

higher levels of anticipated benefits do significantly reduce private saving.

For comparison, the study also presents estimates based on the "average

replacement ratio. "   Although this variable showed an important effect of

social security on saving in the previous study using data for the 1950's,

the current study finds no statistically significant effect.     It is not clear

whether this difference reflects the shift in time, measurement problems in

the average replacement ratio, or other factors. 1

     The next section of this paper reviews the theory ahd specification of

the "extended life cycle model."    The data are described in section 2.     The

estimated parameter values are then presented in section 3.     There is a

brief concluding section.


1. The Specification of Saving Behavior

     The net saving in an economy is the difference between the gross saving of

the savers and the dissaving of the dissavers.     The traditional life cycle model

of saving emphasizes that the working population are the savers while the

retirees are the dissavers.    This implies that the net saving rate will be


IBarra [1919) also studied the experience of the 1950's based on this
variable. He used a mix of time series and cross-sections (rather than
averaging the data for all sample years) and found a significant social
security effect only when he included individual country constant terms.

higher when the income of the generation of workers is high relative to the

income that the retirees had when they were working and saving.   A key conclu-

sion of the traditional life cycle model is therefore that an economy with a

faster rate of growth of total private income will have a higher private saving

rate. l

      The life cycle theory also suggests that an economy's saving rate will be

higher when the working age population is large relative to the numbers of

retirees and of younger dependents.   When the population grows at a constant

rate for a long period of time, the demographic composition is also stable

and is itself a function of the growth rate.   Under these conditions, the

effect of the demographic structure might be subsumed in the effect of the

growth of total income.   A more realistic disequilibrium view of population

growth must recognize that the population growth rates have been changing

substantially.   This in turn implies that the demographic composition of

the population should be recognized explicitly in any empirical model of

intercountry differences in saving rates.

      Previous empirical research by Houthakker (1961, 1965) and Modigliani

(1970) confirm that the traditional life cycle model is a useful framework for
explaining differences in saving rates among countries.   In a crosssection of

countries, higher saving rates are associated with faster rates of growth of

private income and with smaller fractions of the population who are before or

beyond the working age.


IThis implication was recognized by Harrod (1948) and later developed and quan-
tified by Modigliani and his collaborators (1954, 1966, 1970).
                                        -6-
     This life-cycle model of intercountry differences in saving rates can

be extended to include the expected effect of social security benefits.      A

high level of benefits relative to previous earnings can substitute for

private wealth accumulation and should cause individuals to save less for

their retirement.   This reduces both the gross saving of the working pop-

ulation and the subsequent dissaving of the retirees.     In equilibrium, the net

saving rate is reduced.     The current paper, like Feldstein (1977), therefore

adds the social security benefit replacement ratio to the growth and

demographic variables of the Houthakker-Modigliani specification.

     A weakness of the traditional life cycle model is that it treats the

retirement period as fixed.     In fact, the fraction of men over age 65 that is

working has been falling over time and varies among countries.     Men who expect

to continue working beyond age 65 will have a smaller incentive to save for

retirement.   The extended life cycle model with endogenous retirement is deve-

loped explicitly in Feldstein (1974, 1977) and will not be repeated here.        It

suggests that international differences in saving rates depend in a complex way

on the labor force participation of older persons, the extent to which benefits

are reduced by a "retirement test," the life expectancy of individuals at age

65, and the ways in which the social security program has changed in recent
years.   It is clearly impossible to capture all of these effects in an analysis

with only 12 country observations.    The current study does however explicitly

include the labor force participation of the aged in order to test this aspect

of the extended life cycle model and to distinguish the direct effects of

.changes in social security benefits with retirement given from the total changes

when retirement can also vary.

     The specification of the basic savings function that I have estimated

can therefore be written:
                                         -7-

Where S/Y is the private saving rate, G is the growth rate of total private

income, AGE is the ratio of the number of retirees over the age of 65 to the

population age 20 to 65, DEP is the ratio of the number of younger dependents

to the working age population, B/E is the benefit-earnings replacement ratio,

and LPAGED is the labor force participation rate of older men.

       Although the extended life cycle theory predicts unambiguously that    S4

is negative, i.e., that higher social security benefits reduce the saving

rate when the retirement bahavior is held constant, there are other economists

who have asserted that social security may not depress savings.     Thus Katona

(1965) and Pechman et ale (1968) have argued that individual savers are
not rational and that such individuals may ignore social security benefits

or may even Save   mo~e   because they perceive that the goal of a more comfor-

table retirement is brought "within reach" by social security.      Barro (1974)

also reached the conclusion that social security benefits may not affect

aggregate saving (even with fixed retirement rates) because individuals

Save more in order to increase their bequests to compensate their children

for the extra social security taxes that they will bear in the future.       The

estimate of S4 provides a direct test of the "irrationality" view of Pechman,

et. al as well as of the "offsetting private transfers" view of Barro. l

       A complete characterization of the relation between social security

and saving requires specifying how the benefit replacement ratio affects the

labor force participation rate of older men.      A higher benefit replacement

ratio provides a greater incentive to retire l and the lower labor force par-

ticipation of the aged in turn encourages more saving.    The net effect of

social security on saving depends on the relative strength of the traditional

wealth substitution effect (S4 in equation 1) and the indirect effect of

benefits on induced retirement. 2

     Of course, the relative strengths of these two effects may differ from

time to time and country to country.    It is noteworthy that the average rate

of labor force participation among older men dropped from 41 percent in my

previous study (based on the experience of 1954 to 1960) to only 17 percent

in the current sample. 3   Moreover, while the labor force participation of

older men ranged between 25 percent and 74 percent in the data for the 1950's,

by the 1970's the range was reduced to 8 percent to 32 percent; the standard

deviation was also more than halved (from 9.6 percentage points to 4.9 per-

centage points).   This suggests both that there is much less information

on the effects of the labor force participation in the current sample and

that further increases in the social security benefit replacement ratio can

no longer have as powerful effect on retirement as they previously did.

     Intercountry differences in the labor force participation rate of the

aged will also reflect a number of other factors, only some of which can be

quantified.   My previous study, building on earlier work by others, identified

the level of income as a significant influence on retirement behavior.


Iprevious international evidence by Aaron (1967), and Feldstein (1977) confirms
this effect, as does more detailed microeconomic evidence for the United States
(Boskin, 1911 and Pellechio, 1978).

2As well as the. irrational effects, induced changes ~n private intergenera-
tional transfers, etc.

3The sample of countries is of course slightly different but this accounts for
very little of the change.
                                       -9-
Because of offsetting income and substitution effects, a higher level of

earnings can either increase or decrease the demand for leisure after age

65.   A nonlinear specification indicated that the income effect dominated

for the typical country in the sample for the 1950's while the substitution

effect dominated for the high income countries in that sample (Feldstein,

1977, pp. 197-98).   The same nonlinear specification will be examined in

the current study.

      The decision to retire should also depend in an important way on whether

the payment of social security benefits is contingent on retirement.

Unfortunately, there is usually considerable ambiguity about the structure

of the retirement test in each country.    That ambiguity may explain why a

dummy variable representing the retirement test was almost always insignificant

in the previous study.   A similar variable will nevertheless be included in

the current analysis.

      The specification of the labor force participation equation is thus:




         LPAGED




where y* is the average per capita income in the country measured in 1970

U. S. dollars and RET indicates the presence of an earnings test.    The specifi-

cation of linear and inverse terms in income parallels the earlier analysis.

      In the notation of equations 1 and 2, the total effect of the benefit

                                       This can be calculated from the esti-

mated structural parameters of equations 1 and 2 or it can be obtained directly

by estimating the reduced form equation:

              + 8S o.4 RET
Estimating the separate structural equations is asymptotically more efficient

than estimating the reduced form, a property that may be of little significance

with the current sample of only 12 observations.                  More relevant is the fact

that a direct estimate of equation 3 would inevitably result in very wide

confidence intervals because collinearity would raise the standard errors

while the very small number of residual degrees of freedom would imply

proportionately wider confidence intervals.                Both types of estimates are

discussed below.       It is worth reiterating that while the composite reduced

form coefficient      f\ + 8So. 1   measures the total effect of benefits on saving

in the sample, it is the structural coefficient 84 that tests the proposition of

Pechman and Barro that, even with no change in retirement behavior, social

security does not decrease private saving.


2.   The Data and Estimation Method

      The present analysis is based on data for the twelve countries l for

which the Social Security Administration estimated the "new retiree replacement

ratio."   To reduce the effects of cyclical fluctuations, the income, saving and

benefit variables are averaged over the period 1969 through 1975.                  National

income account data were obtained from National Accounts of OECD Countries, 1974

(OECD, 1976) and The 1976 Yearbook of National Account Statistics (United


IAustria, Canada, benmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States. Equations involving "life
expectancy at age 65" exclude Austria for which data on this variable are not
available.

Nations, 1977a).1     Demographic data were obtained from the Demographic Yearbook,

1976 (United Nations, 1977b) and The 1977 Year Book of Labor Statistics

(International Labor Organization, 1977).

     More specifically, private saving (S) is defined as total private saving

and includes the savings of households, private institutions serving households,

and corporations. 2    Unfortunately, the savings figures are all based on nominal

accounting definitions; the result of this is to understate depreciation and

overstate saving.     !1oreover, the extent of this overstatement will differ among

the sample countries.

     Private national income (Y) is the difference between total national

income and personal and corporate tax receipts net of tranfers.     The growth rate

(G) is the implicit constant annual percentage rate of growth of real private

national income for the 15 year period from 1960 through 1975.

     The variable AGE is the ratio of the number of retired persons age 65

and over to the number of persons between 20 and 65 years old.      Similarly,

DEP is defined as the ratio of the number of persons under 20 to the number

between 20 and 65.     The labor force participation of the aged (LPAGED) is the

percent of men aged 65 and older who are economically active.

     The basic benefit replacement ratio (B/E) is the "new retiree replacement

ratio" (based on the benefits for a couple and the average earnings of a worker

in manufacturing industry) as calculated by the Social Security Administration.

The alternative "average replacement ratio" used in my earlier research is

defined as the relative "benefits per aged person adjusted for the retirement

test" (BPARA/y) and calculated by dividing the total amount of benefits received

by the aged, survivors, and the disabled by the number of persons over age 65

or, in those countries with a retirement test, by the number of retired persons

over age 65.   The data on social s~curity benefits is from International

Labor Organization (1976).

     The average per capita income in 1970 U. S. dollars (y*) is calculated

by converting domestic currency values to U. S. dollars at official exchange

rates.

     The retirement test indicator (RET) is a binary variable equal t~ one

if the country imposes an earnings test as a condition of benefits for those

beyond the normal retirement age for that country.    The classification of

tion (1978).    In some specifications, we examined the implications of

including the life expectancy of males at age 65 (LE65) and of a variable

indicating the year in which the nation's social security system was started

(START).

     Because the savings function contains an endogenous variable as one of

the regressors (LPAGED), ordinary least squares is not appropriate.    Although

two stage least squares has only asymptotic consistency, it still seems better

to use this method even with the current small sample.    The variables in

equation 2 (plus LE65 and START) are included in the set of exogenous var-

iables.    Equation 2 can of course be estimated by ordinary least squares.

The parameters of the reduced form equation can then be calculated from the

estimated structural coefficients.

     I have followed the procedure of Houthakker (1961, 1965), Modigliani

(1970) and Feldstein (1977) by weighting each observation to reflect the

size of the country's population.    The estimation program adjusts the degrees
                                       -13-
of freedom, standard errors, etc. for these weights. l

     Table 1 represents the values of the key variables for the 12 countries.




IWhen the principal equations were re-estimated without weights, none of the
basic implications were altered.

3.    The Parameter Estimates

        The estimated parameter values are generaily consistent with the extended

life cycle model described in section 1 and with the qualitative properties

implied by the parameter estimates in Feldstein (1977).            In particular, the

coefficient of the social security variable in the saving function supports

the conclusion that a high level of social security benefits depresses private

saving when retirement behavior is fixed.            Although the labor force partici-

pation equation confirms that high benefits also induce earlier retirement,

the reduced form parameter implied by the structural coefficients indicates

that, on balance, higher social security benefits reduce private saving.

        Equation 4 presents the estimated parameter values of the savings

function specified in equation 1:

           S
(4)        y   = 0.92 + 5.24 G - 1.21 AGE - 0.77 DEP

                                                                  R         0.90
                (0.13)            (0.27)                          SEE   =   0.0182

Note first that the five coefficients are all statistically significant l and

correspond to the qualitative predictions of the extended life cycle model. 2

A high rate of growth of total real income (G) raises the saving rate while

more of the population over 65 (AGE) or under 20 (DEP) decreases the saving

rate.     These findings replicate the earlier Houthakker-Modigliani-Feldstein

confirmation of the implications of the traditional life cycle theory.               A

higher fraction of older men who are working (LPAGED) implies less need for

retirement assets and therefore a lower saving rate, a key feature of the

a two tailed test) is 1.94 and the 5 percent significance level is 2.45.

2The coefficients are qualitatively similar to the estimates for 1954-60
presented in Feldstein (1977) but indicate that the sensitivity of saving
to each of the variables has increased. This may however reflect the substi-
tution of the new benefit replacement ratio for the previous average replacement
ratio.

0.21 implies quite substantial sensitivity of saving to this measure of retire-

ment behavior; a one standard deviation increase in the retirement ratio (i.e., a

move of LPAGED by 0.049) reduces the saving rate by 0.02 or half of one standard

deviation of the saving rate in the 12 country samp1e. 2

     The coefficient of the social security benefit variable (B/E) is - 0.31

with a standard error of 0.15.      This is clearly incompatible with the proposi-

tion that social security is ignored by savers or that it induces greater

savings for retirement.      It is also incompatible with the view that a shift in

private intergenerational transfers negates any other effect of social security

on private saving.    The magnitude of the coefficient implies that a 10 percen-

tage point increase in the benefit replacement ratio would, ceteris paribus,

lower the saving rate by 3.1 percentage points or approximately one standard

deviation. 1

     A number of other secondary variables that might cause intercountry dif-

ferences in saving. were tried as additions to the variables in equation 4 but

their coefficients   ~ere   always insignificant.   For example, when the variable

measuring life expectancy at age 65 (LE65) was added to equation 4 its coef-

ficient was positive as expected but completely insignificant (a t-statistic

of less than 0.5).    The coefficients of the other variables remained essentially

unchanged but their standard errors increased as a result of the col1inearity

among the regressors.     The other variables that were tried include the retire-

ment test (RET), the starting date (START) and the level of income (100/y*).

lIt might of course be argued that when the saving rate is low for other
reasons individuals cannot "afford" to retire, implying that the direction of
causation is reversed or at least simultaneous. I have not explored that possi-
bility.

2For the 12 countries, Sly has a mean of 0.12 and a standard deviation of 0.04.

3According to the calculations by the Social Security Administration, the U.S.
new retiree replacement ratio rose 13 percentage points between 1969 and 1915.

Equations with these additional variables are presented in appendix table A-1.

     Equation 4 and the related equations with additional variables were reesti-

mated using the "average replacement ratio" ca1u1ated from social security type

benefit payments (BPARA!y).          The overall fit of the equation was substantially

worse; the standard error of the estimate rose from 0.0135 in equation                   4 to
0.0273 when B!E was replace by BPARA!y.                All of the standard errors became

larger and no variable had a coefficient with a t-statistic as large as 2.0.

The replacement rate variable itself was completely insignificant.                 The addition

of other explanatory variables did not change the general character of this

result and left the standard error of the estimate substantially larger than in

equation   4.   It seems reasonable to conclude that saving decisions are being

influenced more by the benefits being paid to new retirees than by the average

benefit being paid to retirees of all ages. l               It is not clear why the average

benefit variable no longer appears to influence saving in the way that it did in

the earlier sample.       The difference in coefficients may reflect an increased

discrepancy between average benefits and new retiree benefits, greater measure-

ment error is the calculation of average benefits, or the possibility that

either the current or the previous estimates were merely the result of chance.

     Equation 5 presents the estimated coefficients of the basic labor force

participation function:

1 Individual households and pension planners may also be basing their saving
decisions on more accurate knowledge of future benefit rules which are better
approximated by B!E than by BPARA!y. Alternatively, the poor statistical per-
formance of BPARA!y may only reflect measurement problems with this variable.

The coefficient of primary interest, that of the benefit replacement ratio,

confirms that higher benefits do induce earlier retirement.    An increase in the

benefit ratio of 10 percentage points reduces the labor force participation by

2.9 percentage points; for comparison, the labor force participation rates in

the sample had a mean of 17.5 percent and a standard deviation of 4.9 percent.

     Although the coefficients of the two income variables are subject to

substantial uncertainty, it is interesting to note that the combined effect of

the two coefficients is similar to the behavior implied by the coefficients for

1954 to 1960 in Feldstein (1977):    for the lower income countrie~, the income

effect dominates the substitution effect and increasing income lowers LPAGED

while for higher income countries the opposite is true.    Because the mean real

income is much higher in the current sample than it was in the 1950's, the

substitution effect now dominates at the mean income.

     The coefficient of the retirement test variable (RET) has the correct sign

but is not significantly different from zero, a result that characterized the

earlier study as well.   This may reflect the inadequacy of this binary variable

as a measure of the complex earnings tests, the .oversimplicity of the linear

specification, or even the unlikely possibility that it is the availability of

benefits rather than the earnings test that is the crucial determinant of retir-

ment behavior.

     Equation 5 was also estimated with the addition of life expectancy at age 65

(LE65) and the maturity of the social security program (START) but neither of

these variables was significant.    Substituting the average benefit replacement

ratio (BPARA/y) for the new retiree replacement ratio (B/E) leaves the estimated

effect of social security on retirement essentially unchanged l but makes all

of the other variables completely insignificant (i.e., their coefficients have

than B/E.

t-statistics of less than 0.5).1

      The parameters of the reduced form savings function (equation 3) can in

principle be estimated directly by ordinary least squares.               Unfortunately, esti-

mating the 8 parameters with only 12 observations leaves all of the coefficients

with relatively large standard errors (no coefficient is as large as 1.5 times

its standard error).    For example, the coefficient of B/E is - 0.16 with a stan-

dard error of 0.27.    There is too little information in the sample to obtain

useful estimates of reduced form parameters in this way.

      Alternatively, the estimated coefficients of equations 4 and 5 can be com-

bined to calculate the reduced form parameters.              The resulting equation is:




         ~ = 1.32 + 5.24 G - 1.21 AGE - 0.77 DEP

The net effect of higher social security benefits is thus to reduce the saving

rate; the wealth replacement effect outweighs the induced retirement effect.

on the assumption that the parameter estimates of equation 4 and 5 are uncorre-

lated.   The error variance of this nonlinear function of the parameter estimates

is then approximated in the usual way by the expected value of the square of the

first order terms in the expansion of this function.              The standard error esti-

mated in this way is 0.16, indicating that the probability is less than 0.15 that


lIt is of course possible that BPARA/Y is the relevant variable for determining
retirement since that behavior depends on the benefits available to the current
population over age 65 while B/E is relevant for the more forward-looking saving
decisions among the population of working age.

the estimated effect of social security benefits of 0.21 could be obtained by

chance ifÂ· the true value were zero or negative. l


4.   Conclusion

      The results of this study should be evaluated in conjunction with all of

the other evidence on private saving and social security.   By itself, the pre-

sent sample is too small and the problems of measurement are too great to

warrant reliance on the specific parameter values.   But the new estimates do

support and reinforce the conclusions of earlier studies that indicate the

appropriateness of the extended life cycle model of saving behavior in general

and the negative impact of social security benefits on private saving in par-

ticular.




lIn an earlier stage of the analysis, the sample was restricted to the eleven
countries (excluding Austria) for which data on LE65 were available. For this
sample, the total effect of social security is estimated to be -0.33 (instead of
-0.21) and its approximate standard error "is 0.11.
