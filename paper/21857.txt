                                                 ABSTRACT

Two types of political conflicts of interest pervade many of the world’s societies. A horizontal conflict
of interest arises when different constituencies support different policies, while a vertical conflict of
interest emerges when those in charge of running the government acquire and retain rents in the process
of doing so. We experimentally explore the connections between the two. We identify two sets of
models that incorporate both types of conflicts: electoral models with endogenous rents, and common-agency
models. We adapt these models to a laboratory setting and test their main theoretical predictions using
two experiments. In both cases we find support for the proposition that more intense horizontal conflict
leads to higher rents, which is one of the theoretical predictions of the parametrized electoral and common-agency
models that we have used.

1. Introduction

The relationship between horizontal conflicts of interest (different groups support different
policies) and vertical conflicts of interest (those in charge of implementing policies acquire
and retain rents in the process of doing so) is one of the fundamental issues in political
economy. Although a great deal of progress has been made by focusing on one or the other
of these dimensions, the exact nature of the connections between the two is still one of the
hardest nuts that, both empirically and theoretically, has yet to be cracked in the realm of
political economy. Consider, for example, the relationship between inequality (a variable
commonly associated with horizontal conflict) and corruption (a variable usually associated
with vertical conflict). Corruption tends to be more widespread in more unequal societies.
Indeed, as Figure 11 shows, there is a positive correlation between inequality and corruption.
However, it could be misleading to read this correlation as evidence of a positive causal
relationship between income inequality and corruption. It is possible that very corrupt
practices are selectively affecting vulnerable groups and, hence, corruption is causing
inequality. Alternatively –and more likely– countries with good institutions are probably
better able to control government actions and induce a more egalitarian society. We
therefore need a theoretical framework in order to arrive at a better understanding of the
mechanisms underlying this correlation. We also need an exogenous source of variation in
one type of conflict in order to be able to estimate its effect on the other type of conflict.

                                Figure 1: Inequality and Corruption

Most models in political economy either emphasize one dimension of conflict or the other.
Electoral models typically stress horizontal conflict. Voters have heterogeneous preferences
regarding collective decisions, and candidates compete to attract their votes. Electoral
competition admits multiple variations depending on the assumptions made about the
number of issues on the ballot, the distribution of voters’ preferences, electoral rules, the
number of candidates, candidates’ preferences and the extent of uncertainty about voters’
preferences (see, for example, Roemer, 2001). Yet a common feature of most of these models

1 We use a database that includes 91 countries. The data on corruption was obtained from The World Justice
Project (Rule of Law Index, Factor 2) while the data on inequality was obtained from The World Bank (Gini
Index).
                                                                                                         2
is that there is no tension between voters and candidates. In some sense, electoral models
set aside the representation problem as it relates to voters and politicians in order to
concentrate on the issue of how voters’ heterogeneous preferences are aggregated into a
collective decision.

Principal-agent models typically stress vertical conflict. Voters may have heterogeneous
preferences over collective decisions, but they all share a common interest in controlling the
persons and institutions in charge of implementing those collective decisions. From this
perspective, the key problem is that those who implement policies or supervise their
implementation have better information than the voters do and are therefore able to hold on
to informational rents. The principal-agent model as applied to politics accepts multiple
versions depending on the information structure, the existence or not of supervisors and the
incentives they have to collude (see, for example, Laffont 2000). In most of these models,
however, voters are treated as homogenous, or they are modeled as an uninformed welfare-
maximizing principal that is seeking to design the optimal configuration of the society in
question.

Few formal models include horizontal and vertical issues simultaneously in order to study
the connections between the two. Polo (1997) extends Downs’ electoral competition model
to incorporate endogenous rents. Candidates compete by offering platforms, each of which
includes a tax rate and a specified level of a given public good. Since the proposed tax receipts
could be higher than the amounts required to finance the provision of the public good, the
elected candidate can obtain rents. Voters do not like the idea of government rents because,
from their point of view, they are simply excessive taxation. This suggests that electoral
competition will tend to eliminate political rents. However, if voting is probabilistic and the
competitive pressures on candidates are therefore lessened, then, in equilibrium, both
candidates’ proposals will render positive rents. Moreover, in some specifications of the
model, as income inequality increases, candidates are able to retain more rents in
equilibrium. Thus, this model can be used to produce a relationship between a measure of
horizontal heterogeneity, i.e., income inequality, and a measure of vertical conflict, i.e.,
political rents.


                                                                                                3
Dixit, Grossman and Helpman (1997) extend the principal-agent model by introducing
multiple principals who try to influence a common agent. In a political context, the various
principals are usually interpreted as being special interest groups, and the common agent as
the government. This model is also capable of producing a relationship between horizontal
conflict and political rents. The idea is that as special interest groups have more conflicting
policy preferences, they are more willing to pay the government to move the chosen policy
in their preferred direction.

Summing up, there are two sets of formal models that incorporate both types of conflicts:
electoral models with endogenous rents, and common-agency models. Although they focus
on different channels (voting and lobbying, respectively), both models predict an increase in
rents as the intensity of horizontal conflict rises. We adapt these models to a laboratory
setting and test their theoretical predictions using two randomized experiments. In both
cases, we find support for the proposition that more intense horizontal conflict leads to
higher rents. The experiments also point to interesting directions for the refinement of these
models.

For our first experiment, we used a simple version of the electoral model with endogenous
rents presented in Polo (1997). The setup is as follows: There are 8 voters, each with an
initial endowment. There is a public good that is paid for by a proportional tax on voters’
endowments. Two candidates simultaneously propose a tax rate and a level of the public
good in question. The difference between tax receipts and the amount required to pay for
the public good is a political rent that will be collected by the candidate who wins the
election. Each voter receives extra points if a particular candidate wins the election. The
candidates only know the probability distribution of these extra points. We study four
treatments. In treatments 1 and 2, all voters have the same endowment, while in treatments
3 and 4, some voters have a larger endowment. In treatments 1 and 3, the variance of the
distribution of extra points is low, while in treatments 2 and 4, it is high. According to the
theoretical predictions of this model, we expect that, ceteris paribus, in those scenarios
where there is a higher level of inequality (treatments 3 and 4) or a higher level of electoral
uncertainty (treatments 2 and 4), the elected candidate obtains more rents.


                                                                                              4
We find evidence that supports the electoral model’s prediction that higher inequality leads
to higher political rents. We obtain a positive and significant effect on the rents of the elected
candidate when we compare treatment 1 with treatment 3 and when we compare treatment
2 with treatment 4. As is common in laboratory experiments (see, among others, Galiani,
Torrens and Yanguas 2014 for a discussion of this issue), the effects do not fit the model’s
predictions perfectly in quantitative terms. Indeed, the estimated effects of inequality on
rents are smaller than what our baseline model predicts. However, once we enrich the model
with more general risk preferences for the candidates, this gap narrows significantly.
Regarding electoral uncertainty, we do not find evidence that higher electoral uncertainty
induces higher rents. We also show that the candidates’ risk preferences are probably not
the reason of this result. It is more likely that some subjects did not fully understand how
electoral uncertainty affects electoral outcomes. Indeed, we show that, if we focus on
subjects who have a better understanding of the game (measured by the score in a quiz
administered before they play), we estimate a positive effect of electoral uncertainty on
rents.

For our second experiment, we used a simple version of the common-agency model as
outlined in Dixit, Grossman and Helpman (1997). There are two principals and one agent,
each with an initial endowment. As in our first experiment, there is a public good that is paid
for with the receipts from a proportional tax on endowments. The principals simultaneously
offer a schedule of contributions to the agent, who then selects an alternative. We consider
three treatments. In treatment 1, all players have the same initial endowment. In treatments
2 and 3, one of the principals has a higher endowment than the other, while the common
agent has an endowment equal to the average of the two principals’ endowments, but in
treatment 3, the difference between the endowments of the two principals is greater than it
is in treatment 2. Thus, treatment 1 captures a scenario of no horizontal conflict, while
treatments 2 and 3 successively increase horizontal conflict between the principals.
According to the theoretical predictions of this model, we expect that, in those scenarios
where there is greater inequality and, therefore, more intense horizontal conflict between
the two principals, the rents for the agent are higher. In other words, we expect higher rents


                                                                                                 5
for the agent in treatment 2 than for the agent in treatment 1 and higher rents for the agent
in treatment 3 than for the agent in treatment 2.

We find a positive effect for inequality on rents and payoffs when we compare treatment 1
with treatment 2 and treatment 2 with treatment 3. The effects, however, are smaller than
we would expect on the basis of the model’s predictions. The gap between observed and
predicted rents diminishes, but it does not disappear, when we focus on the group of subjects
who had a better understanding of the game, as measured by a quiz that we administered
before subjects began playing the rounds. We also show that the risk preferences of the
principals are probably not the underlying cause of these gaps.

Three areas of experimental studies are related to our work. First, there is a vast body of
experimental literature on electoral games. Second, there are many experimental works that
deal with principal-agent games, although not many focus on common-agency games.
Finally, there are several experiments that focus on contests and all-pay auctions.

Electoral Games. Our first experiment is related to the existing experimental literature on
electoral competition. McKelvey and Ordeshook (1990) surveyed experiments that examine
the hypothesis of platform convergence to the median preferred policy in the Downsian
model with purely office-motivated candidates. They considered different scenarios and
found that platforms converge even when voters are not fully informed. Morton (1993)
supplemented those studies by conducting a laboratory experiment to assess the hypothesis
that platforms diverge when candidates have policy preferences and there is uncertainty
about voters’ preferences. He found that platforms do indeed diverge but that, on average,
candidate positions are more convergent than the theory predicts, suggesting that the
subjects value winning independently of the expected payment. As in the works surveyed by
McKelvey and Ordeshook (1990), in our experiment, candidates do not have policy
preferences and, hence, their platforms are expected to converge. Analogous to the model in
Morton (1993), candidates are uncertain about voter’s preferences, which leads to positive
political rents in equilibrium. The reason, as discussed in Polo (1997), is that electoral
uncertainty lessens candidates’ incentives to reduce rents in order to capture more votes.



                                                                                             6
Other studies have experimented with variations of the standard electoral models. For
example, Aragones and Palfrey (2004) reported experimental results concerning the effects
of exogenous quality differences in the candidates (i.e., valence asymmetries) on the location
of the equilibrium policies in a one-dimensional policy space. In general, they found support
for theoretical predictions (e.g., the better candidate adopts more centrist policies than the
worse candidate does). Drouvelis, Saporiti and Vriend (2013) conducted a theoretical and
experimental study on the set of Nash equilibria of a classical one-dimensional electoral
game with two candidates who are interested in power and ideology, but who place values
on these two factors that are not necessarily identical. They also found that experimental
evidence supports the theoretical predictions. One difference between Aragones and Palfrey
(2004) and our experiment is that political rents in Polo (1997) work as endogenous quality
differences between the candidates. In Drouvelis, Saporiti and Vriend (2013), there is a more
opportunistic candidate who places more weight on winning the election. However, this is
not equivalent to vertical conflict between the candidates and the voters. More importantly,
none of these works provides predictions on the connection between horizontal
heterogeneity in voters’ preferences and candidates’ rents.

Principal-Agent Games. Our second experiment is related to several studies which have
experimented with principal-agent games. Many authors have conducted experiments with
principal-agent games in which there is a single principal. For example, Güth, Klose,
Königstein, and Schwalbach (1998) conducted an experiment with a multi-period principal-
agent game in which the principal has to offer linear profit-sharing contracts to the agent.
Ferh and Schmidt (2004) experimented with a two-task principal-agent game in which only
one task can be contracted out. Keser and Willinger (2007) conducted a laboratory
experiment with a principal–agent game involving moral hazard. Unfortunately, these
studies focus entirely on vertical conflict and cannot be used to gain an understanding of the
connections between horizontal and vertical conflicts.

The study conducted by Kirchsteiger and Prat (2001), who considered a common-agency
game, is closer to our work. The standard equilibrium concept for common-agency games is
a truthful equilibrium (Dixit, Grossman and Helpman, 1997). Kirchsteiger and Prat identify
a new class of equilibria, which they called “natural equilibria”. In their scenario, each
                                                                                             7
principal offers a positive contribution on at most one collective decision. They conducted a
laboratory experiment using a common-agency game for which the two notions of equilibria
predict a different equilibrium outcome. They found that the natural equilibrium is chosen
in 65% of the matches, while the truthful equilibrium is chosen in less than 5% of the
matches. This is not an issue in our experiment, since the existence of different types of
equilibria does not affect the comparative static predictions of the common-agency model,
which is the focus of our work.

Contests and All-Pay Auctions. Our experiments are also related to the literature on
contests and all-pay auctions. Hillman and Riley (1989) developed a model of politically
contestable rents and transfers in which all players make payments in order to exert political
influence, regardless of the final outcome. When players’ valuations are asymmetric, these
authors show that only the two players with the highest valuations enter the contest and
total expected payments are lower than the value of the politically allocated prize. Moreover,
as the ratio of the highest to the second-highest valuations increases, total expected
payments decrease (Corollary 1 in Hillman and Riley, 1989). Thus, in contrast to our
experiments, in the all-pay auction model of political influence, horizontal heterogeneity
reduces political rents. Several experimental studies with all-pay auction models have been
conducted. For example, Shogren and Baik (1991) reported on experimental behavior in
Tullock’s efficient rent-seeking game and found outcomes consistent with predicted
behavior and rent dissipation. Davis and Reilly (1994) reported the result of an experiment
with an all-pay auction game with four players. Potters, de Vries, and van Winden (1998)
reported on experiments that used both the Tullock probabilistic and highest-bid
(discriminating or all-pay auction) contest success functions. Gneezy and Smorodinsky
(2006) experimented with a repeated all-pay auction game with complete information,
perfect recall and common values. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no
experimental study employing all-pay auction models that has tested the hypothesis that
expected political rents are lower when asymmetry in the two highest valuations increases.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we focus on electoral games with
endogenous rents. We adapt a model developed by Polo (1997) to the laboratory setting and
test its main predictions. In section 3, we focus on common-agency games. We adapt a model
                                                                                             8
developed by Dixit, Grossman and Helpman (1997) to the laboratory setting and test its main
predictions. In section 4, we present our conclusions.

2.   Electoral Competition with Endogenous Rents

In this section we study the connections between income inequality and political rents in the
context of electoral competition. In section 2.1, we briefly describe a model of electoral
competition with endogenous rents due to Polo (1997). In section 2.2, we use this model to
derive experimental treatments. In section 2.3, we describe the laboratory experiment. In
section 2.4, we show that subjects understood the electoral competition game and that the
randomization was balanced. In section 2.5, we present descriptive statistics and, in section
2.6, we formally test theoretical predictions using regression analyses and then discuss the
results.

Electoral Model with Endogenous Rents

Polo (1997) developed a model of electoral competition with endogenous rents. In the
model, there are 𝐼 citizens indexed by 𝑖 and two candidates who simultaneously decide on
their platforms. Let (𝜏 𝑗 , 𝑔 𝑗 ) be the platform proposed by candidate 𝑗 = 1,2 . A platform
consists of an income tax rate 𝜏 𝑗 ∈ [0,1] and a per capita level of public goods 𝑔 𝑗 ≥ 0. The
government budget constraint is given by:

                                                              𝑟𝑗
                                               𝜏𝑗 𝑦 = 𝑔𝑗 +       .
                                                              𝐼

            ∑𝐼𝑖=1 𝑦 𝑖
where 𝑦 =               is the average income in the society and 𝑟 𝑗 ≥ 0 are the rents that candidate
               𝐼

𝑗 will obtain if s/he is elected. If candidate 𝑗 wins the election, his/her payoff is given by:

                                                  𝑣 𝐶,𝑗 = 𝑟 𝑗 .

After the candidates select their platforms, all voters consider them and then vote for one of
the two candidates. The payoff for voter 𝑖 from the platform of candidate 𝑗 is given by:

                                    𝑣 𝑉,𝑖 = (1 − 𝜏 𝑗 )𝑦 𝑖 + 𝐻 (𝑔 𝑗 ) + 𝛽 𝑗 ,



                                                                                                    9
where 𝑦 𝑖 is the income of voter 𝑖 and 𝐻 is a strictly increasing, strictly concave, twice
continuously differentiable function. 𝛽 𝑗 is a valence or competence term. Assume that the
cumulative distribution of 𝛽 = 𝛽 2 − 𝛽1 is 𝐹. Thus, voter 𝑖 votes for candidate 1 if and only if:

                                    (𝜏 2 − 𝜏 1 )𝑦 𝑖 + 𝐻 (𝑔1 ) − 𝐻 (𝑔2 ) > 𝛽.

The candidates know 𝐹, but they don’t observe the realization of 𝛽. In this case, candidate 1
wins the election with a probability given by:

                                    𝐹(𝐻 (𝑔1 ) − 𝐻 (𝑔2 ) − (𝜏 1 − 𝜏 2 )𝑦 𝑚 ),

where 𝑦 𝑚 is the median income. Hence, when the platforms are (𝜏 1 , 𝑔1 ) and (𝜏 2 , 𝑔2 ), the
expected payoff for candidates 1 and 2 are:

                        𝐄[𝑣 𝐶,1 ] = 𝐼(𝜏 1 𝑦 − 𝑔1 )𝐹(𝐻 (𝑔1 ) − 𝐻 (𝑔2 ) − (𝜏 1 − 𝜏 2 )𝑦 𝑚 ),

                     𝐄[𝑣 𝐶,2 ] = 𝐼(𝜏 2 𝑦 − 𝑔2 )[1 − 𝐹(𝐻 (𝑔1 ) − 𝐻 (𝑔2 ) − (𝜏 1 − 𝜏 2 )𝑦 𝑚 )],

respectively. Polo (1999) provided conditions for 𝐹 under which this electoral game has a
unique symmetric Nash equilibrium. The following proposition summarizes the results.

Proposition 1. Suppose that 𝐹 satisfies all the conditions in assumption 1 in Polo (1997) and
     1          𝑔𝑚
2𝑦 𝑚 𝐹′ (0)
            +        < 1 . Then, the electoral competition game has a unique symmetric Nash
                𝑦

                                                                               1      𝑔𝑚
equilibrium characterized by 𝑔1 = 𝑔2 = 𝑔𝑚 and 𝜏 1 = 𝜏 2 = 2𝑦 𝑚 𝐹′ (0) +                    , where 𝐻′(𝑔𝑚 ) =
                                                                                      𝑦

𝑦𝑚
     . In equilibrium, each candidate wins with a probability of 1/2 and equilibrium rents are
𝑦
                        𝑦
given by 𝑟 = 𝐼 2𝑦 𝑚 𝐹′ (0).

From Proposition 1 we can deduce a relationship between income distribution, electoral
uncertainty and political rents. Next, we develop a simple laboratory setting to test these
implications.

2.1. Treatments and Expected Outcomes

To implement the electoral competition game in the laboratory, we further specify 𝐻, 𝐹, 𝐼
and 𝑦 𝑖 . First, we impose that 𝐻(𝑔) = 2√𝑔 and 𝐹 is the normal distribution with mean 0 and

                                                                                                          10
standard deviation 𝜎. Then, from Proposition 1, the equilibrium is given by 𝑔1 = 𝑔2 = 𝑔𝑚 =
    𝑦                          1+2√2𝜋𝜎                                                    √2𝜋𝜎𝑦
        and 𝜏 1 = 𝜏 2 =                   and equilibrium rents are given by 𝑟 = 𝐼              .   Note that rents
𝑦𝑚                             2√2𝜋𝜎𝑦 𝑚                                                    2𝑦 𝑚

increase with the uncertainty on the difference in candidate valance (higher 𝜎 ) and
                                𝑦
inequality (higher 𝑦 𝑚 ). Second, supposing that there are eight voters and two candidates,

                 ∑8𝑖=1 𝑦 𝑖
then, 𝑦 =                    . Third, keeping 𝑦 fixed, we induce a change in 𝑦 𝑚 as follows. Let 𝑦 𝑖 =
                    8
          𝜃 4𝑦                                            4𝜃𝑦
(1 − )           for 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , and 𝑦 𝑖 =           for 𝑖 = 7,8. Then, selecting higher values of
    3        3                                             3

𝜃, we produce more inequality, i.e., a reduction in 𝑦 𝑚 with 𝑦 fixed. 2

For the experiment we set 𝑦 = 6 and consider four different treatments (see Table 1). Each
treatment differs in the level of inequality (a change in 𝜃 ) and/or the level of electoral
uncertainty (a change in 𝜎). Note that the theoretical predictions imply more rents before
higher levels of 𝜃 and/or 𝜎 . For our parametrizations, predicted rents triple when we
increase inequality (from T1 to T3 and from T2 to T4) and double when we increase electoral
uncertainty (from T1 to T2 and from T3 to T4).

2.2. The Laboratory Experiment

The experiment was conducted between February and May 2015 at Xiamen University,
China. We recruited undergraduate and graduate students from any field of study and
conducted 10 sessions with 20 subjects each, for a total of 200 participants. Subjects were
allowed to participate in only one session. In each treatment, subjects played the electoral


                                                           1+√2𝜋

    In order to avoid corner solutions we need 𝑦 > 3 [             ] ≈ 4.20.
                                                            √2𝜋
                                                                                                                  11
competition game with the values of 𝜃 and 𝜎 in Table 1. The experiment was programmed
and conducted using z-Tree software (Fischbacher, 2007). Each session lasted
approximately 105 minutes. The experiment proceeded as follows:

Assignment to Computer Terminals. Before each session began, the subjects were
randomly assigned to computer terminals.

Instructions. After the subjects were at their terminals, they received the instructions,
which were also explained by the organizers. Subjects then had time to read the instructions
on their own and ask questions. Appendix A.1 contains an English translation of the
instructions. This was the last opportunity that subjects had to pose any questions.

Quiz. In order to check whether participants understood the rules of the game, we asked
them to take a five-question quiz. The quiz was administered after we had given the
instructions, but before the rounds began. Subjects were paid approximately US$ 0.10 per
correct answer, but we never informed them which ones they had answered correctly. An
English translation of the quiz questions can be found in Appendix A.2.

Rounds. After the subjects finished the quiz, they began playing rounds, during which they
interacted only through a computer network using z-Tree software. Subjects played 20
rounds of the game. The first 4 rounds were for practice, and the last 16 rounds were for pay.
At the end of each round, the subjects received a summary of the decisions taken by both
themselves and their partners, including payoffs per round, their own accumulated payoffs
for paid rounds and nature’s decision.

Matching. There were 20 participants in each session. In each round, players were randomly
divided into two groups of 10 players. In odd rounds, one group played treatment 1 (𝑇1 ) and
the second group played treatment 3 (𝑇3 ). In even rounds, one group played treatment 2 (𝑇2 )
and the other, treatment 4 (𝑇4 ). In each round, two players in each group were randomly
chosen to play the role of candidates. The rest played the role of voters. After roles were
assigned, each player was informed of his/her role.

Questionnaire. Finally, just before leaving the laboratory, all the subjects were asked to
complete a questionnaire, which was designed to enable us to test the balance across

                                                                                            12
experimental groups and to control for their characteristics in the econometric analysis.
Appendix A.3 contains an English translation of the questionnaire.

Payments. All subjects were paid privately, in cash. After the experiment was completed, a
password appeared on each subject’s screen. The subjects then had to present this password
to the person who was running the experiment in order to receive their payoffs. Subjects
earned, on average, US$ 8.87, which included a US$ 1.61 show-up fee, US$ 0.10 per correct
answer on the quiz and US$ 0.10 for each point they received during the paid rounds of the
experiment.

2.3. Understanding of the Game and Randomization Balance

Table 2 shows that, on average, the subjects had a satisfactory understanding of the rules of
the game. In fact, 43% of the subjects answered all 5 questions correctly; 32.5% of them
answered 4 questions correctly; 15% got 3 questions right; 6% were able to answer only 2
questions correctly; 2.5% obtained a correct score on just 1 question; and, finally, 1% of the
subjects did not answer any of the questions correctly. In all, question 1 was answered
correctly by 88% of the subjects, question 2 by 94%, question 3 by 83%, question 4 by 56%
and question 5 by 83%. It therefore appears that the subjects found question 4 to be the most
difficult.

Table 2 also shows the randomization balance across player roles (candidates vs. voters).
Note that all characteristics and the understanding of the rules of the game are well balanced
across roles, as the mean difference between candidates and voters is not significantly
different from zero either for subject characteristics or for their understanding of the game.
The only exception is the variable that indicates if the subjects have studied game theory in
the past. However, this does not affect the average understanding of the game between
groups.

                              Table 2: Balance across Players

Tables 3 and 4, which compare the four treatments, show that all characteristics and levels
of understanding of the game were perfectly balanced between T1 and T3. In other cases,
there is a slight imbalance in some covariates such as gender, age, number of years at

                                                                                            13
university, whether the subjects have studied game theory or not, or whether they have a
religion. However, this did not affect the average understanding of the game between groups.

                    Tables 3 and 4: Balance Across Treatments I and II



2.4. Descriptive Analysis

Table 5 shows descriptive statistics for the main decisions taken by the subjects. For each
treatment, Table 5 indicates the total number of observations, the sample mean and the
standard deviation for the corresponding variable in each column. Column (1) reports the
income tax rate 𝜏; column (2) gives the per capita level of public goods 𝑔; column (3) shows
the payoff or rent of the elected candidate; column (4) lists the payoffs for the voters.

               Table 5: Decisions across Treatments (Descriptive Statistics)

As predicted by the theory, tax rates and the level of public goods increase with inequality.
The average tax rates are 0.40 and 0.42 for T1 and T2 (the treatments with low levels of
inequality), while they are 0.81 and 0.73 points for T3 and T4 (the treatments with high
levels of inequality). On average, the levels of the public good are 1.63 and 1.77 points for T1
and T2 and 3.69 and 3.32 for T3 and T4. With higher taxes and more public goods when
inequality is high, what happens with rents is not exactly, clear, but, as the model predicts,
rents do increase with inequality. Column 3 in Table 5 shows that, on average, the elected
candidates obtained 6.79 points in T1 and 6.42 points in T2, while they got 9.40 and 8.67
points in T3 and T4, respectively. Contrary to theoretical predictions, on average, elected
candidates obtained less for treatments with higher levels of electoral uncertainty. Average
rents were lower in T2 than in T1 and in T4 than in T3.

2.5. Results

In order to formally test the hypothesis that higher levels of inequality and/or electoral
uncertainty lead to higher rents, we estimate the following regression model:

                                                          10

                    𝑅𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑠 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝐷𝑇 + 𝛽2 𝑋𝑖𝑝𝑠 + ∑ 𝛽3 𝐷𝛩𝑠 + 𝜀𝑖𝑝𝑠 ,
                                                          𝑠=1
                                                                                              14
where 𝑖 indexes subjects, 𝑝 = 1,2,3, … ,16 indexes experimental rounds, and 𝑠 =
1,2,3, … ,10 indexes experimental sessions. 𝑅𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑠 is the dependent variable and indicates
the rents of the elected candidate 𝑖. The explanatory variable of interest is 𝐷𝑇, a dummy
variable indicating treatment status (𝑇𝑗 for 𝑗 = 1, 2, 3, 4). In some specifications, we also
include control variables. We control for individual characteristics 𝑋𝑖𝑝𝑠 (gender, age,
number of years at university, whether his or her major is in economics, whether s/he has
taken a course in game theory, whether s/he has a religion, the income of the father, the
income of the mother, whether his or her father has gone to university, whether his or her
mother has gone to university and the number of correct answers on the quiz) and for
session fixed effects (𝐷𝜃𝑠). According to our theoretical predictions, we should expect β̂ 1 to
be positive when comparing T1 with T2 and T3 with T4 (more electoral uncertainty in T2
and T4, respectively), T1 with T3 and T2 with T4 (more inequality in T3 and T4,
respectively), T1 with T4 (more electoral uncertainty and more inequality) and T2 with T3,
since there is an increase in inequality and a decrease in electoral uncertainty, but the effect
of inequality should be dominant. Table 6 shows the empirical results.

                                    Table 6: Regressions

Economic Inequality and Rents. As expected, an increase in inequality leads to higher
rents. By comparing T1 with T3 and T2 with T4, we find a positive and statistically significant
estimate for all the specifications. The estimated increase in rents from T1 to T3 is 2.618
points (2.532 points when we include controls), while from T2 to T4 it is 2.256 points (2.239
points when we include controls). These estimations are consistent with the qualitative
comparative static predictions in Table 1.

Quantitatively, the estimations are lower than expected. Based on the data shown in Table 1,
we would expect that a move from no inequality to a Gini coefficient of ½ when the standard
deviation of valence is 1/2 (i.e., going from T1 to T3) induces an increase in rents of 4√2𝜋 ≈
10 points. The same variation in inequality when the standard deviation of valence is 1 (i.e.,
going from T2 to T4) should lead to an increase in rents of 8√2𝜋 ≈ 20 points. This suggests
that candidates are offering platforms that entail lower rents than predicted by the model.
One possible explanation is that the model assumes risk-neutral candidates. If candidates
                                                                                              15
are risk-averse, then we would expect them to be more willing to have a greater chance of
obtaining a low rent than a smaller chance of obtaining a high rent, which prompts them to
propose relatively lower rents. In order to see this, suppose that candidates have constant
relative risk aversion. Then, the expected payoff for candidate 1 is (an analogous expression
applies to candidate 2):

                                 [𝐼(𝜏 1 𝑦 − 𝑔1 )]1−𝛾
                   𝐄[𝑣 𝐶,1 ] =                       𝐹(𝐻 (𝑔1 ) − 𝐻 (𝑔2 ) − (𝜏 1 − 𝜏 2 )𝑦 𝑚 ),
                                         1−𝛾

where 𝛾 is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. The first order conditions for candidate 1
become:

                                                           𝜏 1 𝑦 − 𝑔1
 𝑦𝐹(𝐻 (𝑔1 ) − 𝐻 (𝑔2 ) − (𝜏 1 − 𝜏 2 )𝑦 𝑚 ) = 𝑦 𝑚                       𝐹′(𝐻 (𝑔1 ) − 𝐻 (𝑔2 ) − (𝜏 1 − 𝜏 2 )𝑦 𝑚 ),
                                                              1−𝛾

                                                     𝜏 1 𝑦 − 𝑔1
𝐹(𝐻 (𝑔1 ) − 𝐻 (𝑔2 ) − (𝜏 1 − 𝜏 2 )𝑦 𝑚 ) =                       𝐹′(𝐻 (𝑔1 ) − 𝐻 (𝑔2 ) − (𝜏 1 − 𝜏 2 )𝑦 𝑚 )𝐻′(𝑔1 ).
                                                        1−𝛾

If, in equilibrium, candidates converge to the same platform, we have 𝑔1 = 𝑔2 = 𝑔𝑚 , where
            𝑦𝑚                         (1−𝛾)𝑦𝐹(0)                                                 (1−𝛾)√2𝜋𝜎𝑦
𝐻′(𝑔𝑚 ) =         and 𝑟 1 = 𝑟 2 = 𝐼                  . Thus, for our experiment 𝑟 1 = 𝑟 2 = 𝐼                     =
             𝑦                          𝑦 𝑚 𝐹′ (0)                                                   2𝑦 𝑚

          3√2𝜋𝜎
(1 − 𝛾)      𝜃    , which implies that going from T1 to T3 should induce an increase in rents of
          (1− )
             3

(1 − 𝛾)4√2𝜋 ≈ (1 − 𝛾)10 points, while going from T2 to T4 should lead to an increase in
rents of (1 − 𝛾)8√2𝜋 ≈ (1 − 𝛾)20 points. There is a vast body of literature on the estimation
of coefficients of risk aversion. Holt and Laury (2002) employed a simple lottery choice
laboratory experiment that measures the degree of risk aversion. For low payoffs, they found
that the median 𝛾 is between 0.15 and 0.41 while, for higher payoffs, it is between 0.41 and
0.68. Many studies have estimated macro-finance models (see, for example, Byun el al.,
2007). Kim and Lee (2012) have reported a micro-econometric estimate of risk aversion
using survey responses to hypothetical lottery questions. They found that the constant
relative risk aversion parameter ranges from 0.6 to 0.8. In our model, if we consider 𝛾 ∈
[0.4,0.8], the predicted change in rents from T1 to T3 (T2 to T4) is between approximately 2
and 6 (4 and 12) points. Thus, introducing risk aversion significantly reduces the gap
between quantitative theoretical predictions and estimated effects.
                                                                                                                  16
It is also possible that candidates value winning the election independently of the expected
utility of rents. This, however, reduces predicted rents by a fixed amount in all treatments
and, hence, has no effect on the differences between two treatments. In order to see this,
suppose that candidates value the expected utility of endogenous and exogenous rents. Then,
the expected payoff of candidate 1 is given by:

                      [𝜆𝐼(𝜏 1 𝑦 − 𝑔1 ) + (1 − 𝜆)𝑅]1−𝛾
        𝐄[𝑣 𝐶,1 ] =                                   𝐹(𝐻 (𝑔1 ) − 𝐻 (𝑔2 ) − (𝜏 1 − 𝜏 2 )𝑦 𝑚 ).
                                   1−𝛾

where 𝜆 ∈ [0,1] is the weight placed on endogenous rents and 𝑅 > 0 is exogenous rents, i.e.,
the utility of winning the election per se. Then, assuming that, in equilibrium, both candidates
                                                      (1−𝛾)𝑦𝐹(0)          1−𝜆
offer the same platform, we have 𝑟 1 = 𝑟 2 = 𝐼                       −(           ) 𝑅 . Thus, the quantitative
                                                        𝑦 𝑚 𝐹′ (0)          𝜆
                                     𝑦𝐹(0)
predicted effect of a change in 𝑦 𝑚 𝐹′ (0) on rents is not affected by the existence of candidates

who care about winning the election in and of itself.

Electoral Uncertainty and Rents. We did not find that an increase in electoral uncertainty
had any effect on rents. In both cases, when we compare T1 with T2 and T3 with T4, the
estimates are negative and not statistically significant. Thus, keeping inequality constant, an
increase in the standard deviation of valence from ½ to 1 does not produce any effect on
equilibrium rents. Note that neither risk preferences nor candidates who value winning the
election per se could be the explanation for this. Indeed, for any nonnegative and concave
utility function, if in equilibrium candidates converge to the same platforms, rents must be
increasing in electoral uncertainty. In order to see this, suppose that candidates have a
nonnegative and concave utility function 𝑣. Then, the expected payoff for candidate 1 is:

                𝐄[𝑣 𝐶,1 ] = 𝑣(𝐼(𝜏 1 𝑦 − 𝑔1 ))𝐹(𝐻 (𝑔1 ) − 𝐻 (𝑔2 ) − (𝜏 1 − 𝜏 2 )𝑦 𝑚 ).

                                                                     𝑦 𝑚 𝐹′ (0)        2𝑦 𝑚
In equilibrium, the first-order condition becomes 𝑣 ′ = 𝑣                         = 𝑣 𝑦√2𝜋𝜎, which implies:
                                                                      𝑦𝐹(0)


                                  𝑑𝑟        −2𝑦 𝑚
                                     =                         > 0.
                                  𝑑𝜎 𝑦√2𝜋𝜎 2 (𝑣 ′′ 𝑣 − (𝑣′)2 )

A more plausible explanation is that subjects did not fully understand how electoral
uncertainty affects their electoral chances. In fact, if we focus on candidates who correctly
                                                                                                              17
answered all the quiz questions, we obtain a positive, though nonsignificant, estimation
when we compare T1 with T2 (in all specification) and T3 with T4 (only for the specification
with no controls). Specifically, after restricting the sample to those candidates who scored
100% on the quiz, the estimated change in rents from T1 to T2 is 0.444 points (0.692 points
when we include controls), while from T3 to T4 it is 0.077 points (-0.229 points when we
include controls).

Inequality, Electoral Uncertainty and Rents. Finally, if we compare T1 with T4 (a scenario
with more inequality and more electoral uncertainty), we obtain the predicted outcome,
namely, a positive and statistically significant effect on rents, while, when we compare T2
with T3 (more inequality but less electoral uncertainty), we also obtain the positive
predicted effect on rents.

Summing up, we find evidence that supports the prediction of the electoral model with
endogenous rents that higher inequality leads to higher political rents. Quantitatively, the
effects are smaller than expected. The risk preferences of the candidates may be one of the
reasons for this gap. For the whole sample, we do not find evidence that higher electoral
uncertainty induces higher rents. However, when we restrict the analysis to subjects who
scored 100% on the quiz, we obtain a positive effect for electoral uncertainty on rents.

3. Common-Agency Game

In this section we study the connections between inequality and political rents in the context
of special interest politics. In section 3.1, we briefly describe a common-agency model
employed by Dixit, Grossman and Helpman (1997). In section 3.2, we use this model to
derive experimental treatments. In section 3.3, we describe the laboratory experiment. This
general description covers the experiment’s monetary payoffs, the number of sessions and
rounds, the matching procedure and the instructions received by the subjects. In section 3.4,
we show that subjects understood the common-agency game and that the randomization
was balanced. In section 3.5, we present descriptive statistics. Finally, in section 3.6, we
formally test theoretical predictions using regression analyses and discuss the results.

3.1.     Common-Agency Model

Dixit, Grossman and Helpman (1997) developed a model in which several principals try to
influence a single agent. The principals are interpreted as special interest groups and the
agent as the government or a government agency in charge of selecting a policy. In particular,
suppose that the payoff for principal 𝑖 is given by:

                                    𝑣 𝑃,𝑖 = (1 − 𝜏)𝑦 𝑃,𝑖 + 𝐻(𝑔) − 𝐶 𝑖 ,

where 𝜏 ∈ [0,1] is the income tax rate; 𝑔 ≥ 0 is the level of per capita public goods; 𝑦 𝑃,𝑖 is
the income of principal 𝑖 ; 𝐻 is a strictly increasing, strictly concave, twice continuously
differentiable function; and 𝐶 𝑖 is the contribution that principal 𝑖 pays to the agent. The
government budget constraint is given by:

                                                   𝜏𝑦 = 𝑔,

where 𝑦 is the average income in the society concerned. The payoff for the agent is given by:

                                   𝑣 𝐴 = (1 − 𝜏)𝑦 𝐴 + 𝐻(𝑔) + ∑ 𝐶 𝑖 ,
                                                                         𝑖


where 𝑦 𝐴 is the income of the agent and ∑𝑖 𝐶 𝑖 is the contributions received by the agent.

The timing of events is as follows: first, the principals simultaneously announce a schedule
of contributions, i.e., a menu in which each principal specifies how much s/he pledges to pay
the agent if the policy that is implemented is 𝑔;3 then the agent selects a policy 𝑔.

Dixit, Grossman and Helpman (1997) showed that the game has a truthful equilibrium and
characterized this equilibrium. Proposition 2 summarizes the results.

Proposition 2. Suppose a common-agency game with only two principals. Then, the game
has a truthful equilibrium, which is characterized by:

    i.   The agent will implement 𝑔∗ given by 𝐻′(𝑔∗ ) = 1;

 A contribution schedule can also be seen as a take-it-or-leave-it offer whereby, if the agent implements 𝑔, then
the principal pays a contribution of 𝐶.
                                                                                                              19
                                                                                    𝑦 𝑃,2 +𝑦𝐴
   ii. Principal 1 will pay the agent 𝐶 1 = 3(𝑔∗ − 𝑔∗,2 ) (𝑦 𝑃,1 +𝑦 𝑃,2 +𝑦 𝐴) − 2[𝐻(𝑔∗ ) − 𝐻(𝑔∗,2 )],

   where 𝑔∗,2 is given by:

                                               ′(𝑔∗,2 )
                                                                   𝑦 𝑃,2 + 𝑦 𝐴
                                          2𝐻              = 3 ( 𝑃,1            );
                                                               𝑦 + 𝑦 𝑃,2 + 𝑦 𝐴

                                                                                    𝑦 𝑃,1 +𝑦 𝐴
   iii. Principal 2 will pay the agent 𝐶 2 = 3(𝑔∗ − 𝑔∗,1 ) (𝑦 𝑃,1 +𝑦 𝑃,2 +𝑦 𝐴) − 2[𝐻(𝑔∗ ) − 𝐻(𝑔∗,1 )],

   where 𝑔∗,1 is given by:

                                                                       𝑦 𝑃,1 +𝑦 𝐴
                                              2𝐻′(𝑔∗,1 ) = 3 (𝑦 𝑃,1 +𝑦 𝑃,2+𝑦 𝐴).

From Proposition 2 we can deduce a relationship between income inequality and the
contributions received by the agent. Intuitively, as income inequality increases, the tension
between the principals amplifies and, as a consequence, each principal is more willing to pay
contributions in order to influence the agent’s decision. Next, we develop a simple setting to
test this implication in the laboratory.

3.2.       Treatments and Predicted Outcomes

To implement the common-agency game in the laboratory, we impose that 𝐻(𝑔) = 2√𝑔.
Then, the equilibrium is given by:

   i.      𝑔∗ = 1;
                                                                                                           2
                     3(𝑦 𝑃,2 +𝑦𝐴 )    4(−2𝑦 𝑃,2 −2𝑦 𝐴 +𝑦 𝑃,1 )                      4 𝑦 𝑃,1 +𝑦 𝑃,2 +𝑦 𝐴
   ii. 𝐶 1 =                      +                              , where 𝑔∗,1 = 9 (                       ) ;
                 𝑦 𝑃,1 +𝑦𝑃,2 +𝑦 𝐴          3(𝑦 𝑃,2 +𝑦𝐴 )                                   𝑦 𝑃,1 +𝑦𝐴
                                                                                                           2
                     3(𝑦 𝑃,1 +𝑦𝐴 )    4(−2𝑦 𝑃,1 −2𝑦 𝐴 +𝑦 𝑃,2 )                      4 𝑦 𝑃,1 +𝑦 𝑃,2 +𝑦 𝐴
   iii. 𝐶 2 =                     +                              , where 𝑔∗,2 = 9 (                       ) .
                 𝑦 𝑃,1 +𝑦𝑃,2 +𝑦 𝐴          3(𝑦 𝑃,1 +𝑦𝐴 )                                   𝑦 𝑃,2 +𝑦𝐴


Therefore, the contributions collected by the agent are:

       1
          3(𝑦 𝑃,1 + 𝑦 𝑃,2 + 2𝑦 𝐴 ) 4(−2𝑦 𝑃,2 − 2𝑦 𝐴 + 𝑦 𝑃,1 ) 4(−2𝑦 𝑃,1 − 2𝑦 𝐴 + 𝑦 𝑃,2 )
             2
   𝐶 +𝐶 =                         +                          +                           .
            𝑦 𝑃,1 + 𝑦 𝑃,2 + 𝑦 𝐴        3(𝑦 𝑃,2 + 𝑦 𝐴 )            3(𝑦 𝑃,1 + 𝑦 𝐴 )

Second, we impose that 2𝑦 = 𝑦 𝑃,1 + 𝑦 𝑃,2 . Let 𝑦 𝐴 = 𝑦, 𝑦 𝑃,1 = 2(1 − 𝜃)𝑦 and 𝑦 𝑃,2 = 2𝜃𝑦, with
𝜃 ≥ 1/2. Thus, the agent has an intermediate position between the two principals. Moreover,


                                                                                                                20
a change in 𝜃 modifies income inequality, keeping average income fixed. Equilibrium
contributions are given by:

                                                                 8𝜃
                                           𝐶 1 = (2𝜃 + 1) −            ,
                                                              (2𝜃 + 1)

                                                                8(1 − 𝜃)
                                     𝐶 2 = 2(1 − 𝜃) + 1 −                  ,
                                                              2(1 − 𝜃) + 1

                                                         8𝜃      8(1 − 𝜃)
                                     𝐶1 + 𝐶 2 = 4 −            −          .
                                                      (2𝜃 + 1)    3 − 2𝜃

            𝜕(𝐶 1 +𝐶 2 )
Note that                  > 0 if 𝜃 > 1/2, i.e, when there is a higher level of inequality (higher 𝜃), the
                 𝜕𝜃

agent gets more contributions. In other words, as the conflict between the two principals
heightens, the agent collects more rents. Moreover, in equilibrium, it is always the case that
                                                                                                            𝜕𝑣 𝐴
𝑔∗ = 1. Then, the payoff for the agent also increases with income inequality. Formally,                            >
                                                                                                            𝜕𝜃

0 if 𝜃 > 1/2. For the experiment, we set 𝑦 = 2 and consider three different treatments,
which are summarized in Table 7.

            Table 7: Treatments and Predicted Outcomes (Common-Agency Game)
     Treatments                   Inequality                       Theoretical Predictions
                                     (1)                                      (2)

            T2             𝜃 = 3/4 (Low) 𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖 = 1/4   Intermediate Rents for the Agent (𝐶 1 + 𝐶 2 = 4/15)

Finally, to implement the common-agency game in the laboratory, we restrict the
contribution schedules that the principals can use to influence the agent. In particular, each
principal is allowed to select one contribution for each of the following tax rates 𝜏 =
0.25, 0.5, 0.75. Note that 𝜏 = 0.50 is the tax rate associated with the truthful equilibrium
(since, for the experiment, 𝑦 = 2, 𝜏 = 0.50 leads to 𝑔 = 1). Thus, we allow the principals to
select contributions for 𝜏 = 0.50 and two other tax rates symmetrically located to the left
and to the right of 𝜏 = 0.50. One key advantage of this formulation is that the agent can
collect contributions from both principals when selecting one policy. This is crucial in the
                                                                                                                   21
common-agency model, but it can be easily violated in the laboratory if more general
contribution schedules are permitted. Consider, for example, the biases that can emerge if
principals use any contribution schedule. Suppose that one principal plays the equilibrium
strategy, i.e., a positive contribution for 𝜏 = 0.50 and 0 otherwise, while the other principal
makes a slight calculation error and offers a positive contribution for 𝜏 = 0.49 and 0,
otherwise. In this case, the agent cannot collect both contributions. Another advantage of this
formulation is that the agent’s calculations are simpler. In particular, in order to evaluate his
or her options, the agent only needs to add up the two contributions for three possible tax
rates.

3.3.     The Laboratory Experiment

The experiment was conducted between February and May 2015 at Xiamen University,
China. We recruited undergraduate and graduate students from any field of study. We
conducted 5 sessions with 18 subjects each, for a total of 90 participants. Subjects were
allowed to participate in only one session. In each treatment, subjects were asked to play a
common-agency game. The experiment was programmed and conducted using z-Tree
software (Fischbacher, 2007). Each session lasted approximately 90 minutes. The
experiment proceeded as follows:

Assignment to Computer Terminals. Before each session began, the subjects were
randomly assigned to computer terminals.

Instructions. After the subjects were at their terminals, they received the instructions. The
organizers then read out the instructions aloud, while the subjects read along. They were
instructed to ask questions throughout this period. Appendix B.1 contains an English
translation of the instructions. This was the last opportunity that subjects had to pose any
questions.

Quiz. In order to check whether participants understood the rules of the game, we asked
them to take a five-question quiz. The quiz was administered after we had given the
instructions, but before the rounds began. Subjects were paid approximately US$ 0.10 per
correct answer, but we never informed them which ones they had answered correctly. An
English translation of the quiz questions can be found in Appendix B.2.
                                                                                               22
Rounds. After the subjects finished the quiz, they began playing rounds, during which they
interacted only through a computer network using z-Tree software. Subjects played 20
rounds of the game. The first 4 rounds were for practice, and the last 16 rounds were for pay.
At the end of each round, the subjects received a summary of the decisions taken by both
themselves and their partners, including payoffs per round and their own accumulated
payoffs for paid rounds.

Matching. In each round players were randomly divided into three groups of three players.
Each group played a common-agency game (with one group playing treatment 1, one group
treatment 2 and one group treatment 3). In each round and group, players were randomly
chosen to play the role of agent, principal 1 and principal 2. After roles were assigned, each
player was informed of his/her role.

Questionnaire. Finally, just before leaving the laboratory, all the subjects were asked to
complete a questionnaire, which was designed to enable us to test the balance across
experimental groups and to control for their characteristics in the econometric analysis.
Appendix B.3 contains an English translation of the questionnaire.

Payments. All subjects were paid privately, in cash. After the experiment was completed, a
password appeared on each subject’s screen. The subjects then had to present this password
to the person who was running the experiment in order to receive their payoffs. Subjects
earned, on average, US$ 8.07, which included a US$ 1.61 show-up fee, US$ 0.10 per correct
answer on the quiz and US$ 0.10 for each point they received during the paid rounds of the
experiment.

3.4.   Understanding of the Game and Randomization Balance

Table 8 shows that, on average, the subjects had a satisfactory understanding of the rules of
the game. In fact, 56.67% of the subjects answered all 5 questions correctly; 24.44% of them
answered 4 questions correctly; 11.11% of them got 3 questions right; 5.56% were able to
answer only 2 questions correctly; 1.11% obtained a correct score on just 1 question; and,
finally, 1.11% of the subjects did not answer any of the questions correctly. In all, question 1
was answered correctly by 76% of the subjects, question 2 by 74%, question 3 by 94%,
question 4 by 91% and question 5 by 91%.
                                                                                              23
Table 8 also shows the randomization balance across player roles (agent vs. principals). Note
that all characteristics and the understanding of the rules of the game are very well balanced
across roles, as the mean difference between agents and principals is not significantly
different from zero either for subject characteristics or for their understanding of the game.
The only exceptions are the variable that indicates if the subjects have studied game theory
in the past and the understating of question 1, but both of them are significant only at the
10% level.

                                Table 8: Balance across Players

Tables 9 and 10, which compare the three treatments, show that all characteristics and levels
of understanding of the game were perfectly balanced between T2 and T3. When we
compare T1 and T3, the only variable that is not balanced is a dummy that indicates whether
a subject lives in a town or in a rural area. The same thing happens when we compare T1 and
T3 but, in this case, the income of the father is not balanced either. However, this does not
affect the understanding of the game, for which there is no difference across the three
treatments.

                     Tables 9 and 10: Balance across Treatments I and II

3.5    Descriptive Analysis

Table 11 shows descriptive statistics for the main decisions taken by the subjects. For each
treatment, Table 11 indicates the total number of observations, the sample mean and the
standard deviation for the corresponding variable in each column. Column (1) reports the
income tax rate, τ ; column (2) gives the per capita level of public goods, g; column (3) shows
the rents of the agent, 𝐶1 + 𝐶2 ; column (4) lists the payoff for the agent, 𝑣𝐴 ; and column (5)
gives the payoff for the principals, 𝑣𝑃,1 and 𝑣𝑃,2 .

               Table 11: Decisions across Treatments (Descriptive Statistics)

As predicted by the theory, the tax rate and the level of public goods are very similar in all
the treatments. Indeed, the average tax rates are 0.48 in T1, 0.50 in T2 and 0.48 in T3, while
the average levels of the public good are 0.97, 0.99 and 0.96, respectively. Also, in line with
theoretical predictions, the rents collected by the agent increase with inequality. On average,
                                                                                              24
rents are 0.56 in T1, 0.59 in T2 and 0.78 in T3. The average payoff for the agent is also higher
in T3 (3.72) than in T1 (3.53) and T2 (3.54).

3.6.   Results

We now formally test the theoretical predictions using regression analyses. In the context of
perfect experimental data, the identification of the effects of interest does not require the
inclusion of control variables. Moreover, the analysis is completely non-parametric, and we
therefore need only to compare the mean outcome differences across treatment groups.
Inferences could also be made non-parametric. Clustered standard errors are computed by
session.

In order to formally test the hypothesis that more inequality leads to higher rents, we
estimate the following regression models:

                                                             5

                      𝑅𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖𝑝𝑠 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝐷𝑇 + 𝛽2 𝑋𝑖𝑝𝑠 + ∑ 𝛽3 𝐷𝛩𝑠 + 𝜀𝑖𝑝𝑠 ,
                                                            𝑠=1
                                                                 5

                                                             𝑠=1


where 𝑖 indexes subjects, 𝑝 = 1, 2, 3 … 16 indexes experimental rounds, and 𝑠 = 1,2 … 5
indexes experimental sessions. 𝑅𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖𝑝𝑠 indicates the rents collected by the agent, while
𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑎𝑔𝑖𝑝𝑠 is the payoff for the agent. The explanatory variable of interest is 𝐷𝑇, a dummy
variable indicating treatment status ( 𝑇𝑗 for 𝑗 = 1, 2, 3 ). In some specifications, we also
include control variables. We control for individual characteristics 𝑋𝑖𝑝𝑠 (gender, age,
number of years at university, whether his or her major is in economics, whether s/he has
taken a course in game theory, whether s/he has a religion, the income of the father, the
income of the mother, whether his or her father has gone to university, whether his or her
mother has gone to university and the number of correct answers on the quiz) and for
session fixed effects (𝐷𝜃𝑠). According to our theoretical predictions, we should expect a
positive effect when comparing T1 with T2 and T2 with T3. Table 12 shows the estimations.

                                                                                              25
In all cases we estimate a positive effect for inequality on rents and payoffs. When we
compare T1 with T2, we obtain a positive but not statistically significant β̂ 1 . A move from no
inequality to an income distribution with a Gini coefficient of ¼ (i.e., going from T1 to T2)
induces an estimated increase in the rents collected by the agent of 0.034 points (0.0588
when we include controls). When we compare T2 with T3, we obtain a positive and
statistically significant effect. A move from an income distribution with a Gini coefficient of
¼ to another with ½ (i.e., going from T2 to T3) leads to an estimated increase in the rents of
0.185 points (0.152 if we include controls). Finally, when we compare T1 and T3, we obtain
a positive effect which is statistically significant only for the specification without controls.
A move from no inequality to an income distribution with a Gini coefficient of ½ (i.e., going
from T1 to T3) induces an estimated increase in the rents of 0.219 points (0.235 if we include
controls).

Quantitatively, these effects are smaller than the theoretical predictions. Indeed, as shown
in Table 7, we should expect an increase in rents of 4/15 ≈ 0.266 when we compare T1 with
T2, 4/3 − 4/15 ≈ 1.06 points when we compare T2 with T3 and 4/3 points when we
compare T1 with T3. Risk preferences do not seem to be the reason of these differences.
First, note that the agent does not face a risky choice. Once the principals have decided on
their contribution schedules, the agent selects one of three certain payoff options. Second,
the principals are faced with strategic uncertainty because when they decide on their
contributions, they do not know what contribution schedule has been selected by the other
principal. It is not clear how this should affect the quantitative theoretical predictions for T2
and T3. Nevertheless, it should definitely not affect our prediction for T1. When there is no
inequality, there is no conflict of interest and, hence, principals should not pay the agent to
implement a policy that s/he will pick anyway. However, as Table 11 shows, in T1, on
average, the agent collected 0.56 points.

One possible explanation for the gap between theoretical predictions and estimated effects
is that some subjects found the common-agency game to be too complicated. And, in fact, if
we focus on subjects who correctly answered all the quiz questions, the results are closer to
the theoretical predictions. As shown in columns (5)-(8) of Table 12, the estimated effects
are significantly bigger for all specifications. Specifically, estimated rents are 0.1318 points
                                                                                               26
higher in T2 than in T1 (0.179 points when we include controls), 0.297 points higher in T3
than in T2 (0.26 points when we include controls) and 0.435 points higher in T3 than in T1
(0.458 points when we include controls). Thus, focusing on subjects with the highest level of
understanding of the game reduces, but does not eliminate, the gap between the observed
behavior and theoretical predictions.

Summing up, we find evidence that supports the prediction of the common-agency model
that higher inequality leads to higher contributions. Quantitatively, the effects are smaller
than expected, but the gap narrows significantly when we focus on the subjects who had
perfect scores on the quiz.

4. Conclusions

The relationship between horizontal conflicts of interest and vertical conflicts of interest is
one of the fundamental questions in political economy. We have identified two sets of models
that incorporate both types of conflicts (electoral models with endogenous rents and
common-agency models), adapted them to a laboratory setting and used an experiment to
test their main theoretical predictions. For both models we have found evidence that
supports the prediction that higher inequality leads to higher political rents. We have also
extensively discussed different possible explanations for the quantitative differences
between the estimated effects and the models’ predictions.

Formal theory, cross-country correlations and laboratory evidence all suggest that we
should take the connections between horizontal and vertical conflicts seriously because they
have several important implications. At the macro level, they could help to account for the
persistence of corruption in some countries. Many developing countries are very unequal
societies with intense horizontal conflicts (see, among others, Lichbach, 1989; Cederman et
al., 2011; and Lupu and Pontusson, 2011). It should not be surprising that corruption and
other forms of political rents are ubiquitous in these countries. Some economic structures
are more likely to induce higher levels of heterogeneity in citizens’ preferences over
globalization and trade liberalization (see, for example, Galiani, Schofield and Torrens, 2014;
and Galiani and Torrens, 2014), and we can expect to observe more corruption and higher
political rents in countries with those economic structures. The intensity of horizontal
                                                                                             27
conflict tends to be higher in ethnolinguistically heterogeneous societies (see, for example,
Cederman et al., 2011). We should also expect higher political rents in countries troubled by
ethnic conflicts.

At the micro level, taking into account the relationship between horizontal and vertical
conflicts may help to improve the design of anti-corruption policies. Our impression is that
most of the recent literature on corruption has largely ignored this relationship (see, among
others, Warren, 2004; Tavits, 2007; and Chang and Golden, 2010). The emphasis is on
payment schemes, controls and audits, which are definitely good instruments for
discouraging corruption, but, in some cases, mitigating horizontal conflicts could be an
additional tool. Moreover, our findings indicate that we should assign scarce anti-corruption
resources, such as inspectors and auditors, to areas in which there are intense horizontal
conflicts.

We would like to close with a brief comment on the history of economic and political thought.
One simple way of classifying social theories –and even, perhaps, political philosophies– is
to gauge how much importance they place on horizontal and vertical conflict. At one extreme,
we have theories that emphasize horizontal conflict. For example, in Marxist thought, the
class struggle between workers and capitalists is the crucial social force, while the
government is just an instrument that is used by one class to impose its will on the others.
At the other extreme, we have theories that emphasize vertical conflict. For example, the
liberal school of thought tends to stress the importance of a limited government, the
separation of powers, and checks and balances. The weight that a social theory gives to
horizontal versus vertical issues can also influence the evaluation of public policies. For
example, a progressive social agenda that requires substantial political concentration to be
successful will probably receive the support of those that place more importance on
horizontal issues and be opposed by those who are more concerned with vertical problems.
Moreover, the surrounding political discourse will probably reflect the tension between
these perspectives. Groups that support the reform will argue that the opposition is trying
to protect the interests of privileged groups with the specter of a terrible leviathan. The
opposition will most certainly reply that the hidden agenda of the progressive reform is to
create such a leviathan, which will end up devouring even the well-intentioned features of
                                                                                           28
the reform. It would therefore seem that there is much to be gained from a better
understanding of the relationship between horizontal and vertical conflicts and the
associated trade-offs for society.

Online Appendix A: Electoral Competition Game

In this appendix we describe the experimental design of the electoral competition game.

We used the following procedure.

Assignment to Computer Terminals. Before each session began, subjects were randomly
assigned to computer terminals.

Instructions. After the subjects were at their terminals, they received the instructions. The
organizers then read out the instructions aloud, while the subjects read along. They were
instructed to ask questions throughout. Appendix A.1 contains an English translation of the
instructions. This was the last opportunity that subjects had to pose questions.

Quiz. In order to check whether participants understood the rules of the game, we asked
them to take a five-question quiz. The quiz was administered after we had given the
instructions, but before the rounds began. Subjects were paid per correct answer, but we
never informed them which ones they had correctly answered. An English translation of the
quiz questions can be found in Appendix A.2.

Rounds. After the subjects finished the quiz, they began playing rounds, during which they
interacted only through a computer network using z-Tree software. Subjects played 20
rounds of the game. The first 4 rounds were for practice, and the last 16 rounds were for pay.
At the end of each round, subjects received a summary of the decisions taken by both
themselves and their partners, including payoffs per round, their own accumulated payoffs
for paid rounds and nature’s decision.

Matching. There were 20 participants in each session. In each round players were randomly
divided in two groups of 10 players. In odd rounds, one group played treatment 1 (𝑇1 ) and
the second group played treatment 3 (𝑇3 ). In even rounds, one group played treatment 2 (𝑇2 )
and the other treatment 4 (𝑇4 ). In each round, two players in each group were randomly
chosen to play the role of candidates. The rest played the role of voters. After roles were
assigned, each player was informed of his/her role.

Questionnaire. Finally, just before leaving the laboratory, all the subjects were asked to
complete a questionnaire, which was designed to enable us to test the balance across
                                                                                            45
experimental groups and to control for their characteristics in the econometric analysis.
Appendix A.3 contains an English translation of the questionnaire.

Payments. All subjects were paid privately, in cash. After the experiment was completed, a
password appeared on each subject’s screen. The subjects then had to present this password
to the person who was running the experiment in order to receive their payoffs. Subjects
earned, on average, US$ 8.87, which included a US$1.61 show-up fee, US$0.10 per correct
answer on the quiz, and US$ 0.10 for each point they received during the paid rounds of the
experiment.

A.1. Script for Instructions (Electoral Competition)

We would like to welcome everyone to this experiment. This is an experiment in decision-
making, and you will be paid, in cash, for your participation at the end of the experiment.
Different subjects may earn different amounts. What you earn depends partly on your
decisions, partly on the decisions of others and partly on chance.

The entire experiment and all interactions between participants will be conducted through
the computer terminals. It is very important for you not to talk or to try to communicate with
other subjects in any way during the experiment.

At your workstation, you will find a pencil, a sheet of paper with instructions and scratch
paper. During the experiment you can use the scratch paper to make calculations.

We will now start with a brief instruction period. During the instruction period, you will be
given a complete description of the experiment. If you have any questions during this period,
please raise your hand and your question will be answered so that everyone can hear it. If
any difficulties arise after the experiment has begun, raise your hand, and one of the persons
conducting the experiment will come to assist you.

You are one of 20 students who have been invited to take part in this experiment. In each
round you will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, consisting of 10 persons each.
You will then play the computer game, which will appear on the screen, with the members
of your group. At the beginning of each round, the parameters of the game will appear on the
screen, as will the time allotted for the game. At the end of the round, you will be informed

                                                                                            46
of the result of the game, the points you have earned during that round and the points you
have accumulated so far. In the next round, all players will again be randomly assigned to
one of the two new groups of 10 people each.

The experiment you are participating in is broken down into four unpaid practice rounds
and twelve paid rounds. At the end of the last round, you will be paid the total amount that
you have accumulated during the course of the last twelve rounds. Your profit is
denominated in POINTS. Your RMB profit is determined by multiplying your earnings in
points by a conversion rate. In this experiment, the conversion rate is RMB 0.6 to 1 point.
Everyone will be paid in private and you are under no obligation to tell others how much you
earned.

Please read the instructions that you will find by your desktop carefully. You have 10
minutes. Please, remember that if you have any questions, you should ask them aloud.

Instructions (Electoral Competition)

You will be playing in a group with 9 other participants. The computer will randomly select
the players that will be in each group in every round.

In each round the computer will also randomly assign you a role. You may be either one of
the two “proposers” or one of the eight “electors” who must choose between the two
proposals. All participants have the same chance of playing each role.

                                    𝜃 4𝑦                                                     4𝜃𝑦
Six of the electors get 𝑦 𝑖 = (1 − 3)       points, while the other two electors get 𝑦 𝑖 =
                                        3                                                     3

points. Everybody knows this. That is, you will be informed of your role and the points that
each elector got.

If you are one of the proposers, you will be asked to make a proposal. A proposal consists of
two decisions. First, you have to decide what fraction of the electors’ points that you propose
to take from them. Second, you must decide what you’re going to do with these points. You
can keep them, you can use them to benefit electors or you can choose any other option in
between those alternatives. For example, if you propose to take a fraction 𝜏 of the points and
transfer 𝑔 points to each elector, you will get 𝑟 = 𝜏 ∑8𝑖=1 𝑦 𝑖 − 8𝑔 points and each elector will

                                                                                               47
get (1 − 𝜏)𝑦 𝑖 + 2√𝑔 points (only, of course, if your proposal is the one that is selected). The
other proposer will also make a proposal at the same time. You have 90 seconds to make
your decision. When you select an option, please press the "Next" button. If, after 90 seconds,
you have not selected an option, the computer will do it for you at random.

After both proposers make their proposals, the computer will randomly select the extra
points that an elector gets when a proposer wins. Every elector gets 𝛽1 extra points if
proposer 1 wins the election and 𝛽 2 extra points if proposer 2 wins the election. The
expected extra points that each elector gets is the same for both proposers. In particular,
𝛽1 − 𝛽 2 = 𝛽𝑘̅ > 0 with probability 𝑝𝑘 , 𝛽1 − 𝛽 2 = −𝛽𝑘̅ with probability 𝑝𝑘 and 𝛽1 − 𝛽 2 = 0
with probability 1 − 2 ∑𝑘 𝑝𝑘 . Note: this extra point cannot be taken from the electors.

The two proposals and the extra points obtained by the eight electors will then be shown on
the computer screen. If you are one of electors, you will then be asked to vote for one of the
proposals. You will have 90 seconds to make your decision. When you select an option, please
press the "Next" button. If, after 90 seconds, you have not selected an option, the computer
will do it for you at random.

The proposal that gets a majority of the votes will be selected. If four electors vote for one
proposal and the other four vote for the other proposal, the computer will randomly select
one of the proposals. In this case, each proposal will have a 50-50 chance of being selected.

Finally, the computer screen will show everybody which proposal was selected, what was
gained in that round and the total amount of points accumulated since the fifth round. To
end this round, please press the "Next" button.

At the beginning of the next round, you will be randomly assigned to a new group. Pay
attention, because the parameters of the game may have changed.

After the 16th round you will be asked to answer a few questions about yourself. After that,
when you click "Finish", the screen will display a password. It is very important for you to
remember this password because you have to present it to the person who was running the
experiment in order to receive your payoff.

A.2. The Quiz (Electoral Competition) (Correct Answer in Bold)

Question 1: Suppose that the aggregate income of the eight electors is ∑8𝑖=1 𝑦 𝑖 = 20. Suppose
you are one of the proposers. If you select 𝜏 = 1/2 and 𝑔 = 1 and your proposal wins, then
you get: (a) 0 points; (b) 1 point; (c) 2 points; (d) 3 points; (e) 4 points

Question 2: Suppose that the aggregate income of the eight electors is ∑8𝑖=1 𝑦 𝑖 = 20. Suppose
you are one of the proposers. If you select 𝜏 = 1/2 and 𝑔 = 1 and your proposal is not
selected, then you get: (a) 0 points; (b) 1 point; (c) 2 points; (d) 3 points; (e) 4 points

Question 3: Suppose you are proposer 1 and you select 𝜏 = 1/2 and 𝑔 = 1. Proposer 2 also
selects the same proposal. If 𝛽1 > 𝛽 2 , which proposal do you think the electors will favor?:
(a) Proposal 1; (b) Proposal 2; (c) It depends on 𝛽1 − 𝛽 2 ; (d) They are equally likely to favor
1 or 2.

Question 4: Suppose that the aggregate income of the eight electors is ∑8𝑖=1 𝑦 𝑖 = 20. Suppose
you are proposer 1 and you select 𝜏 = 1/2 and 𝑔 = 1. Proposer 2 selects 𝜏 = 1/2 and 𝑔 =
5/4. If 𝛽1 > 𝛽 2 , which proposal do you think the electors will favor?: (a) Proposal 1; (b)
Proposal 2; (c) It depends on 𝜷𝟏 − 𝜷𝟐 ; (d) They are equally likely to favor 1 or 2.

Question 5: Suppose that the aggregate income of the eight electors is ∑8𝑖=1 𝑦 𝑖 = 20. Suppose
you are proposer 1 and you select 𝜏 = 1/2 and 𝑔 = 1. Proposer 2 selects 𝜏 = 1/2 and 𝑔 =
5/4. If 𝛽1 < 𝛽 2 , which proposal do you think the electors will favor?: (a) Proposal 1; (b)
Proposal 2; (c) It depends on 𝛽 2 − 𝛽1 ; (d) They are equally likely to favor 1 or 2.

Online Appendix B: The Common-Agency Experiment

In this appendix we describe the experimental design of the common-agency game. We used
the following procedure.

Assignment to Computer Terminals. Before each session began, subjects were randomly
assigned to computer terminals.

Instructions. After the subjects were at their terminals, they received the instructions. The
organizers then read out the instructions aloud, while the subjects read along. They were
instructed to ask questions throughout this period. Appendix B.1 contains an English
translation of the instructions. This was the last opportunity that the subjects had to pose
questions.

Quiz. In order to check whether participants understood the rules of the game, we asked
them to take a five-question quiz. The quiz was administered after we had given the
instructions, but before the rounds began. Subjects were paid approximately US$ 0.10 per
correct answer, but we never informed them which ones they had correctly answered. An
English translation of the quiz questions can be found in Appendix B.2.

Rounds. After the subjects finished the quiz, they began playing rounds, during which they
interacted only through a computer network using z-Tree software. Subjects played 20
rounds of the game. The first 4 rounds were for practice, and the last 16 rounds were for pay.
At the end of each round, subjects received a summary of the decisions taken by both
themselves and their partners, including payoffs per round, their own accumulated payoffs
for paid rounds and nature’s decision.

Matching. In each round, players were randomly divided into three groups of three players
each. Each group played a common-agency game (one group played treatment 1, one group
played treatment 2 and one group played treatment 3). In each round and group, players
were randomly chosen to play the role of the agent, principal 1 and principal 2. After the
roles were assigned, each player was informed of his/her role.

Questionnaire. Finally, just before leaving the laboratory, all the subjects were asked to
complete a questionnaire, which was designed to enable us to test the balance across

                                                                                            57
experimental groups and to control for their characteristics in the econometric analysis.
Appendix B.3 contains an English translation of the questionnaire.

Payments. All subjects were paid privately, in cash. After the experiment was completed, a
password appeared on each subject’s screen. The subjects then had to present this password
to the person who was running the experiment in order to receive their payoffs. Subjects
earned, on average, US$ 8.07, which included a US$ 1.61 show-up fee, US$ 0.10 per correct
answer on the quiz and US$ 0.10 for each point they received during the paid rounds of the
experiment.

B.1. Script for Instructions (Common Agency)

We would like to welcome everyone to this experiment. This is an experiment in decision-
making, and you will be paid, in cash, for your participation at the end of the experiment.
Different subjects may earn different amounts. What you earn depends partly on your
decisions, partly on the decisions of others and partly on chance.

The entire experiment and all interactions between participants will be conducted through
the computer terminals. It is very important for you not to talk or to try to communicate with
other subjects in any way during the experiment.

At your workstation, you will find a pencil, a sheet of paper with instructions and scratch
paper. During the experiment you can use the scratch paper to make calculations.

We will now start with a brief instruction period. During the instruction period, you will be
given a complete description of the experiment. If you have any questions during this period,
please raise your hand and your question will be answered so that everyone can hear it. If
any difficulties arise after the experiment has begun, raise your hand, and one of the persons
conducting the experiment will come to assist you.

You are one of 9 students who have been invited to take part in this experiment. In each
round you will be randomly assigned to one of three groups, consisting of three persons each.
You will then play the computer game, which will appear on the screen, with the members
of your group. At the beginning of each round, the parameters of the game will appear on the
screen, as will the time allotted for the game. At the end of the round, you will be informed

                                                                                            58
of the result of the game, the points you have earned during that round and the points you
have accumulated so far. In the next round, all players will again be randomly assigned to
one of the three new groups of three people each.

The experiment you are participating in is broken down into four unpaid practice rounds
and twelve paid rounds. At the end of the last round, you will be paid the total amount you
have accumulated during the course of the last sixteen rounds. Your profit is denominated
in POINTS. Your RMB profit is determined by multiplying your earnings in points by a
conversion rate. In this experiment, the conversion rate is RMB 0.6 to 1 point. Everyone will
be paid in private and you are under no obligation to tell others how much you earned.

Please read the instructions that you will find by your desktop carefully. You have 10
minutes. Please, remember that if you have any questions, you should ask them aloud.

Instructions (Common Agency)

You will be playing with two other participants. The computer will randomly select the
players in every round. In each round the computer will also randomly assign your role. You
can either be one of the two petitioners or the implementer. All participants have the same
chance of playing each role. The implementer is in charge of making a decision. If he/she
selects 0 ≤ 𝜏 ≤ 1, then:

               Petitioner 1 gets 𝑣 𝑃,1 = (1 − 𝜏)(1 − 𝜃)2𝑦 + 1 + 2√𝜏𝑦 points,

                   Petitioner 2 gets𝑣 𝑃,2 = (1 − 𝜏)2𝜃𝑦 + 1 + 2√𝜏𝑦points,

                      Implementer gets 𝑣 𝐼 = (1 − 𝜏)𝑦 + 2√𝜏𝑦 points.
Before the implementer decides 𝜏, if you are one of the petitioners, you will be asked to make
a proposal to the implementer. A proposal is an offer that takes the following form.
         If the implementer selects          You    pay    this   amount    to   the
                                             implementer
                                             (a number between 0 and 1)
                           1+𝑦
                     𝜏=
                            2𝑦



                                                                                            59
                            1
                       𝜏=
                            𝑦
                            1
                      𝜏=
                           2𝑦



The other petitioner will also make a proposal in the same way at the same time. You will
have 90 seconds to make your proposal. When you select an option, please press the "Next"
button. If, after 90 seconds, you have not selected an option, the computer will do it for you
at random.

After both petitioners make their proposals, they will be sent to the implementer, who will
decide which 𝜏 s/he wants to implement. If you are the implementer, you will have 90
seconds to make your decision. When you select an option, please press the "Next" button.
If, after 90 seconds, you have not selected an option, the computer will do it for you at
random.

Finally, the computer screen will show everybody which proposal was selected 𝜏, what was
gained in that round and the total amount of points accumulated since the fifth round. To
end this round, please press the "Next" button.

At the beginning of the next round, you will be randomly assigned to a new group. Pay
attention because the parameters of the game may have changed. That is, in each round, 𝑦 𝑖
may vary.

After the 16th round you will be asked to answer a few questions about yourself. After that,
when you click "Finish", the screen will display a password. It is very important for you to
remember this password because you have to present it to the person who was running the
experiment in order to receive your payoff.
