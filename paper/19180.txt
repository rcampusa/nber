Does time-varying business uncertainty/volatility affect the price setting of firms and, if so, in
what way? To address this question, we estimate from the firm-level micro data of the German
ifo Business Climate Survey the impact of idiosyncratic volatility on the extensive margin of the
price setting behavior of firms. We find that heightened business uncertainty increases the
probability of a price change, which suggests that, for price setting, the volatility effect dominates
the “wait-and-see” effect of uncertainty. In a second step, we use structural VAR models to
estimate the effects of time-varying business uncertainty on the intensive pricing margin. We find
that higher business uncertainty leads to both an increase in price dispersion and in the average
size of absolute price changes which is mainly driven by price decreases. Taken together, our
results show that higher business uncertainty causes a rise in both the extensive and intensive
margins of price setting.

1       Introduction
What are the effects of time-varying business (i.e., firm-level) uncertainty/volatility on the
price setting behavior of firms?1 As idiosyncratic volatility shocks have recently been shown
to be important for replicating stylized business cycle facts of U.S. consumer price data
(Vavra, 2014), it is important to know for the modeling of inflation dynamics if and in which
direction volatility shocks affect the probability and size of price adjustments. Furthermore,
a possible change in effective price flexibility due to high volatility, particularly in recessions,
could affect the efficacy of macroeconomic stabilization policy.
    In menu cost price setting models à la Vavra (2014), heightened business volatility can
have (at least) two effects. First, to the extend that volatility also constitutes uncertainty for
firms and adjusting prices is subject to at least some fixed costs, firms may want to “wait
and see”, refrain from adjusting their prices, and, thus, prices might become endogenously
more sticky, when volatility is high. Second, higher volatility makes price adjustment of firms
more likely as firms on average are hit by larger shocks. Hence, the sign of the relationship
between firm-level volatility and the likelihood of price adjustment is an empirical question
which has thus far not been studied in the literature.
    Against this backdrop the contribution of our paper is twofold. First, based on firm-specific
production expectation errors from the micro data of the West German manufacturing part
of the ifo Business Climate Survey, we use their absolute values as well as rolling-window
standard deviations as proxies for idiosyncratic business volatility. We then show empirically
that idiosyncratic firm-level volatility is a statistically significant determinant of a firm’s
decision to reset its price (extensive margin),2 with the volatility effect dominating the “wait-
and-see” effect. This means that in times of high volatility, the price adjustment frequency
in the economy, i.e., the share of firms adjusting their prices in a given period, increases.
    1
      Strictly speaking, volatility is realized uncertainty, that is, “uncertainty” can be thought of as an ex-ante
concept, while “volatility” is an ex-post one. Because of the lack of suitable ex-ante uncertainty data, in this
paper we make use of ex-post forecast errors as proxies, which can be justified by a “stochastic volatility”-view
of the world, where volatility has some persistence, and, thus, volatility in one period means volatility and
uncertainty in close-by periods. Since, empirically, our results appear to be driven by effects coming from
realized uncertainty, i.e., volatility, we will mostly use “volatility” for “uncertainty/volatility” in this paper,
except where the distinction is relevant for the argument.
    2
      We follow Klenow and Kryvtsov (2008) in defining the terms intensive and extensive margin. The
extensive margin equals the frequency of price changes and the intensive margin defines the average size of
(nonzero) price changes. In contrast to this, Caballero and Engel (2007) and Vavra (2014) use a different
definition as they are interested in the change of inflation due to a first-moment aggregate shock. In their
studies, the extensive margin describes the additional inflation coming from the rise in the fraction of agents
adjusting upwards and the fall in the fraction of agents adjusting downwards, both as a result of an inflationary
monetary policy shock. In this case, the extensive margin measures a compositional change in price adjusters.
The intensive margin describes the additional price increase (or reduced price decrease) of those firms that
would adjust their prices anyway.



                                                        2
While we highlight our qualitative result – the volatility effect dominates the “wait-and-
see” effect in pricing –, we also provide a quantitative estimate of the elasticity between
uncertainty/volatility and the frequency of price adjustment: prices are about 0.1 percentage
points more likely to change when volatility increases by one percentage point. As a rough
estimate of the quantitative magnitude of the net effect, this entails that increased business
volatility can explain 0.65 percentage points of the 7 percentage points increase in the price
adjustment frequency of West-German manufacturing firms during the 2008/09-recession.
Second, we provide evidence that heightened firm-level volatility also leads to larger price
adjustments (intensive margin) and to an increase in price dispersion. Perhaps interestingly,
the adjustment along the intensive margin is mainly driven by firms that decrease their prices
after an increase in business volatility. We also see this reflected in the fall in the aggregate
price level following a business volatility shock. Conversely, conditional on an upward price
adjustment after an increase in business volatility, it is mainly the extensive margin that
operates, perhaps suggesting that firms follow a routine pricing rule conditional on upward
adjustment. Conditional on downward price adjustment after an increase in business volatility,
we see, by contrast, both the extensive and the intensive margins of price adjustment active.
    While there have been earlier contributions (e.g., Bernanke, 1983; Brainard, 1967), the
impact of volatility and uncertainty on the macroeconomy and macroeconomic policy-making
has gained renewed attention in macroeconomic research since the beginning of the financial
crisis. Starting with Bloom (2009), a part of this still growing literature has looked at
the interaction of uncertainty and investment decisions of firms, where the propagation
mechanisms discussed are physical adjustment frictions (e.g., Bachmann and Bayer, 2013,
2014; Bloom, 2009; Bloom et al., 2016), financial frictions (e.g., Arellano et al., 2016;
Christiano et al., 2014; Gilchrist et al., 2014), or agency problems within production units
(e.g., Narita, 2011; Panousi and Papanikolaou, 2012). Another part of this literature studies
the macroeconomic effects of interest rate volatility (e.g., Fernández-Villaverde et al., 2011),
fiscal policy volatility (e.g., Baker et al., 2016; Born and Pfeifer, 2014; Fernández-Villaverde
et al., 2015), or general macroeconomic and financial uncertainty (e.g., Basu and Bundick,
2017; Berger et al., 2017; Jurado et al., 2015; Leduc and Liu, 2016; Ludvigson et al., 2015).
    The consequences of heightened volatility for the price setting decisions of firms, however,
have remained largely unexplored. Vavra (2014), matches an Ss price setting model to CPI
micro data and shows that idiosyncratic volatility affects the level of price rigidity and,
through it, leads to time-varying effects of monetary policy.3 Analyzing the importance of
    3
     The focus on idiosyncratic (i.e., firm-specific) rather than aggregate volatility is justified as Boivin et al.
(2009), Golosov and Lucas (2007), as well as Klenow and Kryvtsov (2008) find that idiosyncratic shocks are
the most important factor in explaining price dynamics at the micro-level.



                                                         3
“wait-and-see” and volatility effects, he also shows that, for his model and calibration, the
volatility effect dominates. Vavra (2014), however, shows no direct empirical evidence that
higher volatility leads to increases in the price adjustment frequency and price dispersion.
Moreover, in a recent contribution, Baley and Blanco (2017) build a pricing model where
endogenous uncertainty/volatility is generated by an information friction about productivity
at the firm level and learning. The authors show that an increase in uncertainty makes
firms learn more, makes them more responsive to new (noisy) information, and, hence, leads
them to adjust their prices more frequently.4 Our paper provides empirical support for
the theoretical predictions from Vavra (2014), Baley and Blanco (2017), and the rational
inattention literature.
    The novel contribution of this paper is to use measures of firm-specific volatility to
estimate and quantify directly the impact of heightened firm-level volatility on the firms’ price
setting behavior. These business volatility measures are constructed from the confidential
micro data in the ifo Business Climate Survey. Survey micro data are well-suited for our
research question as they are based on statements from actual decision-makers at the firms
as opposed to, for example, outside analysts. This means that our measures of business
volatility will capture uncertainty at the firm level, and thus allow the “wait-and-see” effect
caused by uncertainty to have a chance to shine through. Survey data are also less likely
to suffer from strategic behavior, such as, e.g., public earnings announcements, as they are
highly confidential and can only be accessed under strict nondisclosure agreements. The
unique feature of the German ifo Business Climate Survey is that it allows us to construct
for the same firms firm-specific volatility measures and use information on their price setting
behavior. It also allows us to use a rich set of firm-level covariates to help us isolate the effect
of volatility on firms’ price setting.
    We use two strategies to construct the firm-specific volatility measures. The first one
follows Bachmann et al. (2013) and Bachmann and Elstner (2015). Bachmann et al. (2013)
construct production expectation errors at the firm level, based on qualitative survey questions
regarding expected and realized production changes at the firm level. We use the absolute
value of these expectation errors as one of our measures of idiosyncratic volatility. The
advantage of this qualitative measure is that it can be constructed for a relatively large
sample of firms. However, qualitative measures only allow us to evaluate the sign of the
relationship between volatility and price setting at the firm level. Therefore, making additional
assumptions, we compute for a subset of firms a quantitative volatility measure in line with
Bachmann and Elstner (2015) from firm statements about capacity utilization.
   4
     This result is also in line with Maćkowiak and Wiederholt (2009, 2015), who find that in “rational
inattention”-environments more volatility leads to more frequent updating of prices.



                                                  4
    The second strategy is based on the same qualitative and quantitative expectation errors
but, instead of the absolute expectation error, relies on a firm-specific rolling window standard
deviation as in Comin and Mulani (2006) and Davis et al. (2006). We show that volatility
measures based on either procedure are highly correlated and that our substantive results
are robust across these different specifications. In order to assess to what extent heightened
firm-level volatility affects the frequency of price adjustment, we then estimate a probit model
on a panel of (on average) 2,500 German firms from January 1980 to December 2015.
    The qualitative price data in the ifo survey, however, do not allow us to analyze whether
uncertain firms change their prices by smaller or larger amounts than less uncertain firms
(intensive margin). To study these effects we use highly confidential quantitative price data
of the German Federal Statistical Office that are underlying the German producer price index
(PPI). Unfortunately, we only have access to this data since 2005 due to institutional reasons.
We also cannot match the PPI micro data to the ifo survey data, so we have no measures of
firm-specific volatility in the PPI data, which makes firm-level regressions infeasible. We thus
base our analysis on structural vector autoregressions (SVARs) that include our measures
of firm-level volatility, aggregated up, and quantitative micro pricing moments, in addition
to a set of variables controlling for forward-looking information as well as demand and cost
developments. Identifying exogenous uncertainty/volatility shocks in the standard recursive
way (Bloom, 2009; Jurado et al., 2015), this empirical framework allows us to analyze the
dynamics of the intensive margin after exogenous changes in firm-level volatility.
    The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section describes the ifo
survey data and the construction of the business volatility measures from it. In Section 3 we
introduce the microeconometric framework and present the effects of changes in idiosyncratic
business volatility on the price setting of firms. We provide a number of robustness checks
in Section 4. Section 5 presents the PPI micro data of the Federal Statistical Office and
discusses the SVAR results. The last section concludes.

Notes: This table provides the translated questions and response possibilities of the ifo survey for manufac-
turing. For the production questions Q1 and Q2, firms are explicitly asked to ignore differences in the length
of months or seasonal fluctuations. For Q8, customary full utilization is defined by 100%. Q11 has been
introduced in 2003 and was posed until November 2008 twice a year in March and August. Afterwards it has
become a regular item of the monthly survey.



   The ifo Business Climate index is a much-followed leading indicator for economic activity
in Germany. It is based on a firm survey which has been conducted since 1949 (see Becker
and Wohlrabe, 2008, for details), and, since then, its survey design has been adopted by other
surveys such as the Confederation of British Industry for the UK manufacturing sector or


                                                                   6
the Tankan survey for Japanese firms. Due to longitudinal consistency problems in other
sectors and the unavailability of micro data in a processable form before 1980 we limit our
analysis to the manufacturing sector from 1980 until 2015 (IBS-IND, 2016). Our analysis
excludes East German firms.
    An attractive feature of the ifo survey is the relatively high number of participants. The
average number of respondents at the beginning of our sample is approximately 5,000 per
wave; towards the end, it declines to 2,000.5 Participation in the survey is voluntary and
there is some fraction of firms that are only one-time participants. However, conditional on
staying two months in the survey, most firms continue to participate each month. The ifo
attempts to maintain a sample that is representative of the German manufacturing sector by
replacing exiting firms with new respondents.
    The ifo survey, at its core, is a monthly qualitative business survey where firms provide
answers that fall into three qualitative categories: Increase, Decrease, and a neutral category.
The monthly part of the survey is supplemented on a quarterly basis with some quantitative
questions, e.g., with respect to firms’ capacity utilization. In our analysis we make use of a
wide range of explanatory variables that might be relevant to the pricing decision of a firm.
Table 1 summarizes these questions.


2.2     Construction of qualitative volatility measures
The construction of ex-post forecast errors combines past responses of the production ex-
pectation question (Q2) with current responses of realized production changes vis-à-vis last
month (Q1). We follow Bachmann et al. (2013). To fix ideas, imagine that the production
expectation question in the ifo survey, Q2, was asked only for the next month instead of the
following three months. In this case, when comparing the expectation in month τ − 1 with
the realization in month τ , nine possibilities arise:6 the company could have predicted an
increase in production and realized one, in which case we would count this as zero forecast
error. It could have realized a no change, in which case, we would quantify the expectation
error as −1 and, finally, it could have realized a decrease, which counts as −2. Table 2
summarizes the possible expectation errors.
    In actuality, the production expectation question in the ifo survey is for three months
ahead. Suppose that a firm stated in month τ − 3 that its production will increase in the
next three months. Suppose further that in the next three months one observes the following
sequence of outcomes: production increased between τ − 3 and τ − 2, remained unchanged
   5
      The ifo survey is technically at the product level, so the number of participants does not exactly conform
to the number of firms, though we will use that terminology throughout the paper.

      In this section, the time index refers to a month and is denoted by τ .

between τ −2 and τ −1, and production decreased between τ −1 and τ . Due to the qualitative
nature of the ifo data we have to make assumptions about the cumulative production change
over three months. As a baseline we adopt the following steps. First, we define for each
month τ a firm-specific activity variable as the sum of the Increase instances minus the sum
of the Decrease instances between τ − 3 and τ from Q1. Denote this variable by REALIZi,τ .
It can obviously range from [−3, 3]. The expectation errors are then computed as described
in Table 3.

   Notice that the procedure in Table 3 is analogous to the one month case. Our final
                      qual
expectation error F Ei,τ   ranges from [−4, 4], where for instance −4 indicates a strongly
negative forecast error: the company expected production to increase over the next three
months, yet every single subsequent month production actually declined. In our study we
                             qual
use the absolute value of F Ei,τ +3 as a measure of idiosyncratic volatility in period τ of firm

With this timing, we assume that firms essentially know the size of their forecast error in
τ + 3, if not its sign, and use this information to make pricing decisions in τ , under this
known level of uncertainty. Independently of what we believe about the realism of this
assumption, we contend that it maximizes the chances of a pure uncertainty “wait-and-see”
effect to shine through, because we do not use (the absolute value of) forecast errors and
thus realized volatility from period τ . For a further discussion of this timing assumption as
regards uncertainty, see Bachmann and Bayer (2013).8
    We also compute a measure of firm-level volatility based on Comin and Mulani (2006) and
Davis et al. (2006). Using a firm i’s expectation errors we can define a symmetric 3-quarter
rolling window standard deviation as

2.3      Construction of quantitative volatility measures
Bachmann and Elstner (2015) argue that the supplementary question about capacity utiliza-
tion (Q8) permits – under certain assumptions – the construction of quantitative production
expectations. To illustrate this, we start from the following production relationship of an
individual firm i:
                                        act         pot
                                       yi,τ = ui,τ yi,τ ,                               (3)
       act                                      pot
where yi,τ denotes the firm’s actual output, yi,τ   its potential output level, and ui,τ the level
of capacity utilization. Only ui,τ is directly observable in the ifo data. Taking the natural
    7
      The use of the absolute forecast error as a volatility proxy is motivated by the stochastic volatility model
(see, e.g., Fernández-Villaverde et al., 2010, 2011; Shephard, 2008). In this model, given the level equation
yt = f (yt−1 , yt−2,... ) + eσt νt , where f (yt−1 , yt−2,... ) is some function of the lags of yt , the time-varying log
standard deviation evolves according to σt = (1 − ρ) σ̄ + ρσt−1 + ηεt , where εt is an i.i.d. volatility innovation,
often distributed as standard normal. The forecast error is then given by eσt νt , where the level shock νt is
independent of εt . The higher the relative importance of volatility shocks εt compared to level shocks νt , the
closer are volatility and absolute forecast error linked. In the extreme case of νt only having realizations −1
or +1, eσt and |eσt νt | coincide.
    8
      We also vary this timing assumption in the robustness checks.

                                         act                       pot
                                  ∆ log yi,τ = ∆ log ui,τ + ∆ log yi,τ .                                   (4)

                                                                             pot
Under the assumption that potential output remains constant, i.e., ∆ log yi,τ    = 0, percentage
changes in actual output can be recovered from percentage changes in capacity utilization.10
To implement this idea, we restrict the analysis to firms for which we can reasonably expect
that they did not change their production capacity in the preceding quarter, making use
of the questions concerning expected technical production capacity (Q9) and employment
expectations (Q10). The existence of non-convex or kinked adjustment costs for capital
and labor adjustment as well as time to build (see Davis and Haltiwanger, 1992, and Doms
and Dunne, 1998) make this a reasonable assumption. To be conservative, we require a
firm to satisfy both criteria in τ − 3 for us to assume that its production capacity has not
changed between τ − 3 and τ . In this case, we use the quarterly percentage change in capacity
utilization in τ as a proxy for the quarterly percentage change in production in τ .
    If the production capacity can be assumed not to have changed in the preceding quarter,
and if, in addition, no change in production was expected three months prior, a change in
capacity utilization, ∆ log ui,τ , is also a production expectation error of firm i in month τ .
We thus consider in the baseline specification only firms which state in period τ − 3 that
their production level (Q2), employment level, and technical production capacity will remain
the same in the next three months.11 We then compute ∆ log ui,τ three months later in
τ . The resulting measure ∆ log ui,τ constitutes our definition of a quantitative production
                                               quan 12
expectation error, which we denote by F Ei,τ       .
    9
       Time intervals are again months. For us to construct an expectation error in τ , we need an observation
for capacity utilization in τ and τ − 3.
    10
       It should be clear that the volatility proxies that we can derive from this procedure refer to any shock
process that affects production, but leaves the potential output of a firm unchanged.
    11
       We also clean our sample from firm-quarter observations with extreme capacity utilization statements,
i.e., those that exceed 150%, and from firm-quarter observations with “potentially inconsistent” production
change statements. To determine the latter we consider the realized production question (Q1) concerning
actual production changes in the months τ , τ − 1, τ − 2. We drop all observations as potentially inconsistent
when firms report a strictly positive (negative) change in ∆ log ui,τ and no positive (negative) change in Q1
in the last 3 months. For firms that report ∆ log ui,τ = 0, we proceed as follows: Unless firms in Q1 either
answer three times in a row that production did not change, or they have at least one “Increase” and one
“Decrease” in their three answers, we drop them as potentially inconsistent. In our sample we have 420,507
firm-level observations for ui,τ . The number of outliers is quite small and corresponds to 245 observations.
With the remaining observations we are able to compute 377,010 changes in capacity utilization, ∆ log ui,τ .
                                                         pot
For 196,929 observations we can assume that their yi,τ       has not changed during the last three months, due
to Q9 and Q10. In the end, we classify 79,027 observations as “potentially inconsistent” and drop them.
                                                             act
Our final sample consists of 117,902 observations for ∆yi,τ      . Bachmann and Elstner (2015) argue that this
sample does not appear to be specifically selected on observables. We also deal with the sample design in our
robustness checks.
    12
       Firms are asked about their capacity utilization in March, June, September, and December, allowing

period τ . Note that we can compute quantitative volatility measures only for firm-level
observations with constant production expectations as the question concerning production
expectations (Q2) is qualitative. The quantitative nature of this measure allows us to give a
quantitative interpretation of the relationship between idiosyncratic volatility and the price
setting of firms, however at the cost of smaller samples and additional assumptions, which
is why we emphasize in particular our qualitative result, namely that the volatility effect
dominates the “wait-and-see” effect in price setting.
                                                                                           quan

2.4     Discussion of volatility measures
How do our measures of idiosyncratic volatility relate to each other and to other such measures
in the literature, e.g., from Bachmann et al. (2013)? The upper panel of Figure 1 plots the
                                  qual
cross-sectional mean of ABSF Ei,τ      , i.e., ABSF E qual
                                                      τ    , and the cross-sectional dispersion of
expectation errors (see Bachmann et al., 2013) defined as
                                                                     
                                                          qual
                                    F EDISPτqual = std F Ei,τ +3 .                                        (6)

Both time series display similar properties:13 they rise in the wake of the fall of the Berlin
Wall – a clear turning point in the evolution of volatility following the calm 1980s, again
around 2001, and at the start of the global financial crisis, where they remain elevated with
the onset of the European debt crisis. Overall, we see a close link between both idiosyncratic
volatility measures. The visual evidence is supported by the high time-series correlation
coefficient of 0.94 between F EDISPτqual and ABSF E qualτ   .
us to compute quantitative forecast errors between March and June, June and September, etc. For the
qualitative forecast errors, we could, in principle, compute a three-month-ahead forecast error every month.
In the baseline regression analysis, however, we only consider forecast errors based on qualitative production
expectations in those same months to be able to better compare the results from both frameworks. As
robustness checks, we also run regressions using the (larger) monthly qualitative sample.
   13
      For comparison with the volatility measures based on the quantitative forecast errors, we only plot the
last month of each quarter for the volatility measures based on the qualitative (three-months-ahead) forecast
errors, which we have at the monthly frequency.

correlated with ST DF E τ        and F EDISPτ          (see Table 4).
    Table 4 also shows that, at an aggregate level, the correlation between our volatility
measures and macroeconomic uncertainty à la Jurado et al. (2015) is positive and statistically
significant.15
    Looking at business cycle properties, all of our volatility measures are countercyclical: their
unconditional pairwise time-series correlation coefficients with quarter-to-quarter growth rates
of real production, total hours worked, and employment in the West-German manufacturing
sector are negative (see Table 4). We also find for all volatility measures that they are larger
in recession times, e.g., ABSF E quan increases by about one percentage point in times of
economic slack. For the last recession, starting in 2008q1 and ending in 2009q2, ABSF E quan
even increased by roughly three percentage points compared to non-recession times.16 For
all qualitative volatility measures, we present in Table 4 the time-series averages as a ratio
to the non-recession mean, implying that for example F EDISP qual rises on average by 3.3
percent in times of recessions.
    Further evidence for the appropriateness of our measures comes from disaggregating
the time series and analyzing the time-series correlation coefficients for 13 manufacturing
   14                                                                                                     quan
      For the quantitative expectation errors, we find a Pearson correlation coefficient between ABSF Ei,τ
              quan
and ST DF Ei,τ of 0.75.
   15
      For the latter series, we use the macroeconomic uncertainty series for Germany provided by Meinen
and Röhe (2017), which is constructed following Jurado et al. (2015). Specifically, we use their series for a
three-month forecast horizon (h=3) which corresponds most closely to the horizon of our measures.
   16
      To get an upper bound of the volatility increase during the Great Recession, we can take the peak of
ABSF E quan in the second half of 2008 and set it in relation to the mean in the last non-recession year 2007,
yielding an increase of 6.5 percentage points.

Notes: Upper panel: pairwise unconditional time-series correlation coefficients of firm-level volatility measures
with West-German economic activity and an aggregate uncertainty measure; lower panel: means of firm-level
volatility measures for non-recession and recession periods and the coefficient of variation of these proxies.
To compute the mean of the qualitative volatility measures, we first standardize the original time series
by their non-recession means. The corresponding means for the non-recessions periods are therefore one.
Monthly qualitative volatility measures are transformed to quarterly frequency by selecting the last month
of each quarter, even for those correlations that only involve qualitative volatility measures. Economic
activity variables are quarter-on-quarter growth of real production (∆ log P roduction), total hours worked
(∆ log Hours), and employment (∆ log Employment). For macroeconomic uncertainty, we use data provided
by Meinen and Röhe (2017) which start in 1996q3 (forecast horizon: h=3). For all other variables, the
sample period is 1980q1 - 2015q4. All variables are seasonally adjusted. Recessions are as dated by GCEE
(see notes to Figure 1). To test for significance of the time-series correlations (in a one-sided test) we use
a nonparametric overlapping bootstrap with a four-quarter window and 10,000 replications. *** denotes

3         Empirical analysis
In this section we analyze the (conditional) effects of heightened idiosyncratic firm volatility
on the frequency of price adjustment. We first specify the empirical model and then present
the results.

Notes: Each column presents the results of a regression of the quarterly share of price changes on a constant,
a general recession dummy, and a 2008/09-recession dummy (with standard errors in parentheses). All
data are seasonally adjusted using quarterly dummies. The manufacturing sample is based on the survey of
West-German manufacturing firms and spans the period 1980q1-2015q4, while the retail sample is based on a
survey of West-German retail firms and is available for the period 1990q1-2015q4. Recessions are as dated by
the GCEE (see notes to Figure 1).



    Although the ifo data include price statements at the monthly frequency, other variables
used in this approach such as capacity utilization are only available on a quarterly basis.
We therefore estimate a quarterly model as the baseline. Thus, we need to transform the
monthly price statements to a quarterly frequency. The quarterly price variable is based on
question Q3 from Table 1. P rice changei,t takes the value one if firm i states at date t that
it changed its price in at least one of the previous three months, and zero otherwise.17
    The manufacturing column of Table 5 provides evidence for the countercyclicality of the
frequency of price changes. Here, we regress the seasonally adjusted share of price changes
in a given quarter on a constant and a recession dummy. On average, the frequency of
price changes is significantly higher in recessions (33.4%) than in normal times (30.3%), and
especially so in the 2008/09 recession. We further find that the frequency of price changes
    17
         From now on, time is measured in quarters and denoted by t.


                                                             15
has a time-series standard deviation of 5.2 percentage points. Both numbers will help us put
our estimation results into perspective.18
    The price statements that underlie our results are conceptually close to the producer price
index (PPI), because they come from manufacturing firms. While the ifo has data for retail
firms that would be conceptually closer to consumer prices, the retail micro data do not allow
us to compute volatility proxies that are comparable to those of the manufacturing part of
the survey. Nonetheless, it is instructive to compare the business cycle properties of the price
setting in the two sectors, because, as it turns out, the frequency of price adjustment is also
countercyclical in the retail sector. Due to data availability in the retail part of the survey,
our sample only starts in 1990 (IBS-TRA, 2016). We find that retail firms have a higher
probability to reset their prices: on average 45.5% of all retail firms adjust their prices each
quarter compared to 31.6% in manufacturing. Even so, the frequency of price adjustment
of the retail sector increases in recessions by 3.8 percentage points on average, an increase
that is similar to the one in the manufacturing sector.19 The countercyclicality of the price
adjustment frequency is also what Vavra (2014) and Berger and Vavra (2016) find for U.S.
CPI data.


3.2     The empirical model
As a baseline, we use a quarterly probit model20

                                      P (yi,t = 1 |xi,t ) = Φ(xi,t b) ,                                    (7)

where yi,t is the dependent variable, the vector xi,t includes all explanatory variables, b is
the coefficient vector, and Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal
distribution.
    Table 6 lists the variables used in the estimation procedure. At the heart of the empirical
analysis are the volatility measures described in Section 2. We use, each in turn, two qualitative
volatility measures (ABSF E qual and ST DF E qual ) and two quantitative ones (ABSF E quan
and ST DF E quan ). Taylor dummies (T aylor1 - T aylor8) account for the fact that some firms
adjust their prices at fixed time intervals. For example, T aylor2 takes a value of one if the
last time a firm adjusted its price was two quarters ago. Industry dummies (Industry1 -
   18
      In Section 5, Table 17, we compare the ifo pricing data to the micro data underlying the overall producer
price index provided by the German Federal Statistical Office and find that, in the aggregate, they correlate
well and have similar business cycle properties.
   19
      At the monthly frequency, we find for the ifo manufacturing (retail) data an average price change
frequency of 17.4% (27.6%). During recessions the monthly frequency of price adjustment is 1.8 percentage
points (3.7 percentage points) higher than in non-recessions.
   20
      We also estimated logit models with essentially the same results.

Industry14) account for unobserved heterogeneity between manufacturing industries. We
also add time dummies for each quarter (Time-fixed effects) to capture aggregate shocks
which influence all firms’ prices in the same way, to control for aggregate variables that might
influence prices and volatility at the same time, and to account for seasonal patterns in the
price setting behavior of firms.

    One of the advantages of the ifo data is that it includes many firm-specific variables that
allow us to control for first-moment effects. Capacity Utilization and Business Situation
comprise information on the current state of a specific firm. To control for confidence and
news aspects (see, e.g., Barsky and Sims, 2012) we include the forward-looking variables
Business Expectation, Technical Capacity, and Expected Employees.21 Orders are important to
account for a possible indirect effect of uncertainty on price setting through demand, insofar
this effect is not already captured by the time-fixed effects in the regression. The idea is that
heightened uncertainty may lead to the postponement of projects in other firms, which would
decrease the demand for certain goods in the economy.
  21
     Note that in the construction of the volatility measures based on quantitative forecast errors, we have to
restrict our sample to firms that report no change in Technical Capacity and Expected Employees. Therefore,
these variables are not included in the regressions when we use the quantitative volatility measures.



                                                              17
    Changes in input costs are included to capture supply shocks. Lein (2010) emphasizes
the important role of intermediate good costs as a determinant of a firm’s price setting. The
ifo dataset contains no direct information about input costs, which is why we construct a
variable that proxies the change in the cost of input goods for each manufacturing industry k
for each time period (∆Costsk,t ) following Schenkelberg (2013). ∆Costsk,t for each industry
is calculated as the weighted average of net price changes of input goods from all industries.
The weights are derived from the relative importance of the industries in the production of
goods in industry k.22
    The qualitative firm-specific variables Business Situation, Business Expectations, Orders,
Technical Capacity, and Expected Employees have three possible response categories (see
Table 1), e.g., firms can appraise their current state of business as good, satisfactory, or
unsatisfactory. To account for possible asymmetric effects we include these variables with
both positive and negative values separately. For example, the variable Business Situation
is divided into two sub-variables. If firm i at time t reports its state as good, the variable
                                              −
Statebus+ i,t is equal to one and Statebusi,t is equal to zero. If the firm answers that its state is
                                                              −
unsatisfactory, Statebus+   i,t is equal to zero and Statebusi,t is equal to one. If the firm believes
                                                                   −
that its state is satisfactory, both Statebus+    i,t and Statebusi,t are equal to zero, which is the
baseline. We proceed analogously with Business Expectations, Orders, Technical Capacity,
and Expected Employees.
    Before the first price change of an individual firm, we do not know how much time elapsed
since the last price change. This poses a problem if time-dependent pricing is important for
price setting. We, therefore, drop all observations of a firm prior to the first price change.
In addition, whenever an observation in the price change variable is missing in the period
between two price changes, the whole period is discarded from the sample as we do not know
whether the missing observation is associated with a price change (see, e.g., Loupias and
Sevestre, 2013).


3.3     Baseline results
The estimation results of the baseline probit models with Price change as the dependent
variable are presented in Table 7. The first four models – Columns (1) to (4) – include a
constant and a set of industry, Taylor, and time-fixed effect dummies. The other four models
– Columns (5) to (8) – contain, in addition, the set of firm-specific variables described in
Table 6.23 Each of the eight models includes one volatility measure. Models (1) and (5) use

of firms’ qualitative expectation errors, ST DF E qual , and (4) and (8) the 3-quarter rolling
window standard deviation of firms’ quantitative expectation errors, ST DF E quan .
    The table reports marginal effects. Quantitative variables (Capacity utiliz., ∆Costs,
ABSF E qual , ABSF E quan , ST DF E qual , and ST DF E quan ) are evaluated at their respective
sample averages. Qualitative variables are evaluated at zero, i.e., “satisfactory” (Statebus+ ,
Statebus− ), “remain about the same” (Expbus+ , Expbus− , Expempl+ , Expempl− ), “roughly
stayed the same” (Orders+ , Orders− ), or “sufficient” (T ech. capacity + , T ech. capacity − ).
Marginal effects for the dummy variables are calculated as the difference in the probability of
a price change as the dummy switches from 0 to 1.
    Perhaps unsurprisingly, costs of intermediate goods are the most important determinant of
firms’ pricing decisions. Both good and unsatisfactory current business situations, increasing
and decreasing business expectations and order levels, as well as a higher capacity utilization
are associated with a higher probability of price change.
    The main takeaway from Table 7 for our research question, however, is the following:
regardless of the way volatility is measured and regardless of whether firm-specific variables
are included, higher volatility increases the probability of a price change, i.e., the volatility
effect prevails over the “wait-and-see” effect. The signs of the marginal effects of ABSF E qual
show that higher volatility increases the probability of a price change in both specifications
(see Columns (1) and (5));24 and the marginal effects for ABSF E quan imply that prices
are about 0.1 percentage points more likely to change when ABSF E quan changes by one
percentage point. Turning to the rolling window proxies, we find that the marginal effects for
ST DF E qual are also positive, as are the marginal effects for ST DF E quan .
    Given that the association between business uncertainty/volatility and the frequency of
price setting is positive, how then can volatility tomorrow induce such a positive volatility
effect today? For the rolling window standard deviation, this can be explained by the fact
that by construction it contains forecast errors from multiple periods, including today’s. As
for ABSFE, a stochastic volatility cum persistence view makes tomorrow’s forecast error a
good proxy of volatility today. We can test this by including lags of the absolute forecast
error proxy in our baseline regression, which should also be good proxies of instantaneous
volatility today. We find that indeed these lags considerably reduce the impact of our baseline
forward-looking uncertainty/volatility proxy, i.e., the one based on tomorrow’s forecast error,
even rendering it statistically insignificant in some cases (see Table 8).
    For a rough estimate of what the 0.1 percentage point marginal effect for ABSF E quan
  24
       There is little meaning in the size of the marginal effects of ABSF E qual .

means, it is helpful to remember two numbers. We have seen in Table 5 that the price
adjustment frequency of West-German manufacturing firms is 3.1 percentage points higher
in recessions compared to non-recession periods. At the same time, in recessions, the cross-
sectional average of ABSF E quan is roughly one percentage point higher than in normal times
(see the lower panel of Table 4). So only a fraction of the increase in the price adjustment
frequency can be explained by an increase in firm-level volatility.25 Even if we take the
difference of 6.5 percentage points between the peak of ABSF E quan in the second half of
2008 and its mean in the last non-recession year 2007 (see footnote 16), we would obtain an
increase in the price adjustment frequency of 0.65 percentage points compared to the actual
increase of seven percentage points during that time period.26
   25
      We also check whether our estimated coefficients differ between recession and non-recession times by
splitting our sample accordingly and running separate regressions. Table 21 in Appendix C.1 shows that
the coefficients are fairly stable. We also run our baseline regression year by year and find mostly positive
marginal effects which show no clear cyclical pattern; results are available on request.
   26
      Of course, this calculation, based on the marginal effect estimated in a microeconometric procedure,

                                                          21
    Summing up, we find that idiosyncratic volatility is a statistically significant, albeit not
economically strong determinant of the price setting behavior of firms and that the volatility
effect dominates the “wait-and-see” effect, i.e., higher volatility leads firms to adjust their
prices more often.
    To understand the anatomy of price changes after changes in business volatility better,
we can make use of additional information in the ifo data, which provides also information
on whether a firm increased or decreased its price.
    While the definition of a price increase and decrease is straightforward at the monthly
frequency, given the monthly frequency of the underlying data set, it is somewhat ambiguous
at the quarterly frequency. We define the dependent variable as 1 (-1) if there is a price
increase (decrease) in at least one of the three months but no decrease (increase). If we
observe both an increase and decrease, we set the observation to missing. The dependent

    The first two columns of Table 9 show the results of estimating multinomial logit models for
the qualitative volatility proxies. Heightened volatility increases significantly the probability
of both price increases and price decreases.27 The results for the quantitative volatility proxies
abstracts from all potential macro effects.
   27
      The results in Table 9 are similar when we use an alternative aggregation scheme where we set observations
to 0 if we observe both a price increase and decrease within a quarter. Furthermore, estimating the multinomial
logit at the monthly frequency using only the qualitative volatility proxies yields very similar results to the


                                                            22
are roughly in line with those for the qualitative volatility proxies, albeit, for the case of
price increases, not at conventional statistical significance levels. That price changes are more
dispersed in times of higher volatility is in line with the results in Vavra (2014).


4      Robustness checks
The results from the baseline estimations show that the probability of price adjustment
increases by about 0.1 percentage points when business volatility rises by one percentage
point as measured by the absolute quantitative production expectation errors (see the sixth
column in Table 7). We now conduct a battery of robustness checks that can be classified
into three blocks: (i) the role of first-moment effects, (ii) potential measurement issues in the
construction of the price and volatility variables, and (iii) the role of financial constraints.


4.1     The role of first-moment effects
In our baseline estimations, we control for various first-moment proxies, as can be seen in
columns (5) to (8) of Table 7. This is potentially important as positive second-moment effects
are often accompanied by negative first-moment effects (Bachmann and Bayer, 2013; Bloom
et al., 2016). Is there, thus, still a possibility that we pick up first-moment effects in our
baseline estimations; especially in those cases, where we use the absolute forecast error as our
uncertainty/volatility proxy? As shown in equation (1), however, we calculate ABSF E qual
and ABSF E quan for period t with the realized expectation error in period t + 1.28 This is
because with our baseline timing assumption – firms are uncertain today because today they
expect a large shock tomorrow – we want to avoid using information on realized forecast errors
today to give a pure uncertainty “wait-and-see” effect the best chance to emerge. At the
same time, we also mitigate the danger that we are just picking up a large first-moment shock
today, that is, one-time wrongness. Similarly, one-time wrongness is less likely to be picked
up in those cases, where we use the rolling window standard deviation approach, ST DF E qual
and ST DF E quan . This is because these measures include multiple close-by forecast errors
and can only be large when these forecast errors are systematically large and of opposite
signs; even though this approach might come at the cost of including information from shocks
that occurred in the period when the prices were set and before.
    But we can do more: first, we redo our analysis regarding price increases and price
quarterly case. Finally, the results are also robust to estimating separate probit regressions for price increases
and decreases. All of these results are available on request.
   28
      Recall that we use t and τ to denote quarters and months, respectively. Therefore, t + 1 quarterly
corresponds to τ + 3 monthly.


                                                       23
decreases, now directly including current forecast errors and thus controlling for correlated
first- and second-moment effects. Second, we change our assumption regarding what firms
know when they set prices: instead of knowing the size of the forecast error tomorrow,
the firms now only know the forecastable or systematic part of said forecast error. This is
arguably the more reasonable information assumption, albeit not the one that maximizes
the possibility of a pure “wait-and-see” effect. Put differently, firms are now not uncertain
about the future because they happen to know that tomorrow, perhaps just once and thus
unsystematically, a large shock occurs or because today they experienced a certain shock.
Instead they are uncertain about tomorrow because, in line with a stochastic volatility view,
they can form systematic expectations about the size of their forecast error tomorrow using
the size of current and past forecast errors. Finally, we employ larger windows for our rolling
window standard deviation measure, which will also mitigate the danger that we just pick
up unsystematically large forecast errors, that is, pure wrongness, or a string of large, but
systematically positive (negative) forecast errors, given that the standard deviation subtracts
off their mean.29
    Our analysis regarding price increases and decreases in the previous section provides a
natural way to directly control for first-moment effects by including the realized forecast error
of period t as an additional regressor. Specifically, we now assume that the decision of a firm
to increase (or decrease) its price is a function of uncertainty, e.g., ABSF Et , plus all of our
standard controls and the realized forecast error, F Et , in that period:30

                                     ∆pt = f (ABSF Et , F Et , . . .) .                                     (8)

    Table 10 shows the results: including the forecast error does not change the finding that
an increase in volatility increases the probability of a price change. We further find that
the first-moment shocks affect the price setting decision of firms in an intuitive way. A
positive (negative) forecast error causes a higher likelihood for a price increase (decrease).
Interestingly, the importance of the forecast error diminishes when we include all firm-specific
variables described in Table 6 (see columns with header (2) in Table 10), confirming that
these controls indeed help absorb first-moment effects.
    Next, we employ a two-stage approach to focus on the systematic part of the absolute
   29
      In addition, in Appendix C.2, we use our firm-level forecast errors to compute cross-sectional dispersion
measures, that is, another true second moment, for randomly selected subgroups at each point in time. Again
we find a systematically positive relationship between these dispersion measures and the frequency of price
adjustment within a subgroup.
   30
      Recall that ABSF Etqual and ABSF Etquan (as well as the rolling window standard deviations) are defined
by using next period’s forecast error, i.e., we use the forecast in t and the realization in t + 1 (see equation
(1)).

forecast errors, which we can interpret as uncertainty/volatility as opposed to mere wrongness.
To this end, in the first stage, we regress ABSF E qual and ABSF E quan on their respective
lags. The upper panel of Table 11 shows that the lags have explanatory power for both the
qualitative and the quantitative volatility proxy. The high values of the F-statistic support
this finding. Both ABSF E qual and ABSF E quan are therefore systematically varying over
time and are not just driven by large one-off first-moment shocks. We then estimate a second
stage that is identical to our baseline model except for the fact that we use the fitted values
from the first-stage regression (i.e., the systematic part of the forecast errors) as our volatility
proxy. Standard errors in the second stage are bootstrapped using 100 repetitions. The results
are shown in the lower panel of Table 11. Results are highly significant for ABSF E qual with
point estimates that are slightly larger than in the baseline. For the quantitative volatility
proxy ABSF E quan , the estimates are quantitatively similar to the baseline, albeit statistically
insignificant in some cases, possibly partly due to the loss in observations.

    Recall that the rolling window standard deviation measure of volatility guards against
the possibility of a string of large forecast errors of the same sign being interpreted as large
uncertainty/volatility. It is also important to note that this case is not addressed by our first
two robustness checks, which is why the rolling window standard deviation is important to
be included as one of the baseline cases. In our baseline estimations, we keep the window
short at three periods as missing values in our panel lead to a large reduction in the number
of observations. In this robustness check, we allow for missing values, ensuring that we have
at least three observations in each window, which allows us to increase the window size
up to nine periods. The estimates, shown in Table 12, are very similar to those from the
three-period window. The overall picture that the volatility effect dominates is robust.31
   31
     Of course, using a symmetric window means that by increasing the window size, we look further and
further into the future, making it more likely that price changes themselves affect the volatility measure. We
therefore also consider purely backward looking windows. Table 22 in Appendix C.1 shows that this is not
driving our results.

4.2     Measurement
In this section, we deal with a number of potential measurement issues concerning both the
price changes and our measures of business volatility. First, we change the timing of the
volatility proxies towards the same period as when the price change occurs rather than from
one period ahead. Recall that we made this rather strong baseline assumption to give the
pure “wait-and-see” uncertainty effect its best chance. However, we have seen that even
in this case, the volatility effect dominates, which is why we now study the case where
only today’s forecast error (in absolute value), that is, realized uncertainty today, is known
today and can be used as a proxy for uncertainty about the future and future volatility,
the arguably more realistic assumption. Second, with the help of price plan questions in
the ifo survey, we redo our analysis only on unplanned price changes. Third, in light of
the apparent unimportance of the role of pure uncertainty effects, we relax a number of
assumptions made in the construction of the quantitative volatility proxies, thus moving

                                                                27
them away from being based on true surprises to being based on changes. Fourth, and finally,
we employ a control function approach to extract that component of the firms’ forecast errors
that the firms plausibly react to in their pricing decisions, which is arguably orthogonal to
pure measurement error.32

    The first robustness check (Table 13, upper panel) concerns the timing of the firm-specific
volatility measures, especially for ABSF E qual and ABSF E quan . In this robustness check, we
change the timing structure so that the realized expectation error is contemporaneous with
the pricing decision, and the results remain similar.
   32
     We provide two additional robustness checks concerning the qualitative volatility proxies in Appendix
C.1. First, as they are available at the monthly frequency, we redo our baseline estimations at this frequency
with basically unchanged results (see Table 23, upper panel). We also construct a binary firm-level volatility
measure that just takes the value one at time t if there is a realized expectation error in t + 1. Again, our
results remain the same (see Table 23, lower panel).
                                                                   28
    The second robustness check (Table 13, lower panel) deals with the possibility that some
price changes today were already planned in the past. Today’s prices may not, therefore,
react to current events. Some firms have long-term contracts with their buyers (see, for
instance, Stahl, 2010); these contracts might fix prices for some time or change them each
period in pre-defined steps. Firms may, therefore, rely on some form of pricing plan. As a
robustness check, we drop all observations where price changes were putatively set in the
past. These price changes are identified with the help of Q4 – the survey question relating to
price expectations for the next 3 months (see Table 1).33 Thus, in this exercise, we focus on
price changes that are unexpected and check whether they react to idiosyncratic volatility.
Again, the overall picture does not change.
    For the construction of the quantitative volatility measures, we imposed a number of
restrictions on our sample. For instance, we only included firms that had constant production
expectations in order to capture production expectation errors. Since our baseline results show
that the volatility effect dominates the “wait-and-see” effect of uncertainty empirically, we
also check, as a plausibility check, whether we get the same results if we focus on production
changes as opposed to production expectation errors. Table 14 (upper panel) says yes. If,
in addition, we relax the assumption of constant potential output, i.e., we now simply base
our volatility measures on capacity utilization changes, the results still hold (see Table 14,
middle panel). Finally, we conduct a similar exercise for the volatility measures based on
qualitative production expectation errors (see Table 14, lower panel). To be specific, we
                                   qual
use REALIZi,t+1 instead of F Ei,t+1     in equation (1). Again our results remain essentially
unchanged.
    More generally, one might be concerned that measurement error contaminates our pro-
duction forecast error measures. To deal with this problem directly and econometrically,
we use the so-called control function approach (see Imbens and Wooldridge, 2007; Rivers
and Vuong, 1988; Wooldridge, 2002), a two-stage instrumental variables procedure that
can also be applied to nonlinear models and functions of endogenous variables, including
                                                                                       qual
absolute values. In the first stage, we regress each forecast error type, that is, F Ei,t+1 and
    quan
F Ei,t+1 , on the level of capacity utilization, the change of input costs, two dummies for
the business situation, two dummies for the change of orders from period t (see Table 6),34
plus Taylor and industry dummies, and time-fixed effects. Since firms by definition do not
react to measurement error, the idea behind this first stage is to separate that component
of the measured forecast error to which firms react with observable actions, and thus the
  33
      To be concrete, we exclude price changes where firms stated a quarter before that they expect a price
change and they followed through with the price change in the expected direction.
   34
      Of course, these regressors are excluded in the second stage.

true forecast error, from measurement error. In the second stage, we estimate our baseline
probit model which includes our volatility measures on the right hand side (plus Taylor and
industry dummies and time-fixed effects), and the residual from the first-stage regression as
an additional control variable. Including the residual from the first stage directly controls for
potential endogeneity in our volatility measures. The results are essentially unchanged (see
Table 15).35 Also, the second-stage coefficient of the first-stage residual is statistically not
distinguishable from zero, which means that measurement error does not appear to drive our
results.

    We only study the absolute value version of our business volatility proxies here, because the rolling
window standard deviation measures contain forecast errors from multiple periods and are thus difficult to
handle in a control function approach.

4.3     Financial constraints
Gilchrist et al. (2017) argue that financial frictions are an important determinant of firms’
price setting decisions. To the extent that financing constraints are related to uncertainty,
we might link price changes to variations in uncertainty that were in reality due to changes
in financial conditions. In our final robustness check, we therefore follow Balleer et al. (2017)
and make use of a question regarding the financial constraints of firms, which was introduced
into the ifo survey in 2003. It is a special question that was added as a result of the acute
difficulties of the German banking system at that time. Specifically, firms are asked about
their access to bank lending: “How do you evaluate the current willingness of banks to grant
credits to businesses? Restrictive, normal, or accommodating?” (see Table 1).
    We re-estimate our baseline model on the sample starting in 2003, and then estimate
it with the additional credit constraint variable.36 There are two things to note: first, the
results without the credit constraint variable are very similar to those estimated on the
baseline sample starting in 1980. Second, results are not affected by controlling for financing
constraints of the firms.




   36
      As with the firm-specific variables in the baseline specification in Section 3.2, we allow for potential
                                                       −
asymmetric effects by including Credit+ i,t and Crediti,t separately.

5        Quantitative price change measures and volatility
Our analysis so far has shown that there is a positive relationship between firm-level volatility
and the frequency of price adjustment (extensive margin). However, the qualitative price data
in the ifo dataset does not allow us to analyze whether uncertain firms change their prices by
smaller or larger amounts than less uncertain firms (intensive margin). Yet, the behavior
of the intensive margin has also implications for the modeling of inflation dynamics. E.g.,
for U.S. CPI micro data, Vavra (2014) stresses the fact that the price adjustment frequency
and the price change dispersion are positively correlated. Furthermore, the price change
dispersion is countercyclical in U.S. data.37 These findings can be replicated by a standard
menu cost model only by incorporating countercyclical second-moment shocks.
    To get a sense of how firms adjust their intensive price setting margin to firm-level
volatility, we use the micro data underlying the German producer price index provided by
the German Federal Statistical Office (PPI henceforth). Unfortunately, we cannot match this
dataset to the ifo data, so we have no measures for firm-specific volatility in the PPI data
and, therefore, cannot estimate firm-level regressions. Our analysis will hence be based on
(Choleski-identified) structural vector autoregressions (SVARs).
    37
     Table 17 below confirms that also in German PPI data the price change dispersion rises in recessions.
Moreover, the unconditional correlation between the price change dispersion and the price adjustment
frequency is 0.15 for the German PPI data, and 0.41 when ifo price frequency adjustment data are used.
Finally, the IRF in Figure 2 below shows that this positive correlation between the extensive and the intensive
margins of price adjustment also and a fortiori holds conditional on a volatility shock.
                                                                  32
5.1     Micro data of the German producer price index
As mentioned above, in this section, we use micro data underlying the German producer price
index, available from 2005q1 to 2015q4.38 Note that these micro data do not include price
changes due to sales and that the Federal Statistical Office controls for product improvements.
   To make our analysis comparable to that based on the ifo data, we compute quarterly
growth rates from quarterly averages of the price levels.39 We define a price change to have
occurred if the quarterly growth rate is unequal to zero. In the beginning of the sample, we
have roughly 6,400 observations, which increases to slightly more than 8,500 observations at
the end of the sample.40

Notes: To compute the statistics we use quarterly data from 2005q1 to 2015q4. All data are seasonally
adjusted. Size and volatility of price changes are computed based on price changes unequal to zero. For the
cross-sectional mean absolute value, the cross-sectional standard deviation (dispersion), and the cross-sectional
interquartile range, we clean our data from outliers by removing quarterly observations that are smaller
than the 1st percentile and larger than the 99th percentile of the corresponding quarter. To compute these
percentiles, we use all observations including no price changes.




   38
      Before 2005 the price data were collected regionally by the statistical offices of the individual federal
states (Länder) and are not available to us.
   39
      The underlying data is available at the monthly level.
   40
      We clean our data from outliers by removing quarterly observations that are smaller than the 1st
percentile or larger than the 99th percentile of the corresponding quarter. To compute these percentiles we
use all observations including no price changes. All series are seasonally adjusted.


                                                        33
    We start by providing some descriptive statistics and a comparison to the ifo data. The
first entry in the upper panel of Table 17 is the proportion of price changes in a given quarter.
With a correlation coefficient of 0.77, the series from both sources are highly correlated; even
more so when looking at price increases and decreases separately, corroborating that the ifo
data are of high quality.
    The upper panel of Table 17 further shows the average price adjustment frequencies for
the recession of 2008/09. Similar to the numbers earlier reported for the ifo data in Table 5,
we see again that the Great Recession raised the average price adjustment frequency by a
significant amount in both ifo and PPI data.
    The lower panel of Table 17 presents the additional statistics that we can only compute
for the quantitative PPI data. The statistics are computed conditional on observing a price
change (including small price changes but cleaned for outliers). Our calculations show that
when a firm decides to adjust its price, it does so by roughly 3.5 percent on average. This
number was 1.3 percentage points larger in the recession of 2008/09. The cross-sectional
standard deviation (dispersion) of price changes is slightly less than 5 percent on average.
This number increased by 1.9 percentage points in the last recession.
    The key takeaway from this section is that the extensive and intensive margins of price
changes and their dispersion are countercyclical.


5.2    The dynamic effects of firm-level volatility on prices
We now use an SVAR model to analyze the aggregate effects of increases in firm-level volatility
(from the ifo data) on quantitative pricing moments (from the quantitative PPI data). While
the PPI data only start in 2005q1 and end in 2015q4, this time span nonetheless covers the
recession of 2008/09, the Euro crisis in 2011/12, and the booms in the periods 2007/08 and
2010/11.
    Our VAR setup is an extended version of that used by Bachmann et al. (2013). Formally,
we estimate the following model:

                                   yt = µ + A(L)yt−1 + νt ,                                  (9)
                                                                          iid
where µ is a constant, A(L) is a lag polynomial of degree p = 4, and νt ∼ (0, Σ). The vector
of endogenous variables yt comprises five variables at the quarterly frequency, approximating
the information set of our baseline micro data investigation. Specifically, yt contains (in the
listed order) the balance of firms’ production expectations determined by the ifo data, one of
our volatility measures, the log of West-German manufacturing production, the log of the



                                               34
HWWI price index for energy raw materials (in Euro),41 and a quantitative pricing moment
(cleaned of outliers). All variables are seasonally adjusted. The choice of variables ensures
that we control for forward-looking information as well as cost developments.
    As a baseline, we start with the two quantitative volatility proxies: the quarterly average
absolute ex-ante errors, ABSF E quant    and the average asymmetric (i.e., backward looking)
3-quarter rolling window standard deviation based on ex-ante forecast errors, ST DF E quant   .42
Pricing moments considered in this first set of estimates are the price change frequency for
both ifo and PPI data and the mean price change, the mean absolute price change, and the
dispersion of price changes from the PPI dataset excluding zero changes.
    To identify the volatility shock, we assume a recursive identification scheme with a
standard ordering of variables (see, e.g., Bloom, 2009; Jurado et al., 2015). Specifically,
we impose the restriction that volatility reacts contemporaneously to exogenous changes
in production expectations but not to variations in manufacturing production. We further
assume that volatility has an immediate impact on manufacturing production. For the
quantitative pricing moment, we assume that it can react contemporaneously to the volatility
shock.
    Figure 2 shows impulse response functions (IRFs) to one-standard-deviation volatility
shocks and the corresponding bootstrapped 68% and 95% confidence intervals. Each column
represents one of the quantitative volatility proxies, and each row represents one of the
quantitative pricing moments. That is, each panel represents a different SVAR.43 For the
frequency of price changes (first row), we also include the estimated response of the ifo series.
    The first row of Figure 2 shows that a surprise increase in business volatility leads to an
increase in the price change frequency, corroborating the findings from our firm-level analysis.
We also find that higher volatility has a negative impact on the price level (second row).44
This is consistent with the evidence in Born and Pfeifer (2017) who find that, empirically,
price markups and inflation tend to fall after uncertainty shocks.
    Next, volatility shocks cause protracted increases in price dispersion and in the mean of
the absolute price changes (rows 3 and 4) which fits the evidence in Vavra (2014). In the
case of ABSF E quan
                  t   , we find that a one-standard-deviation business volatility shock leads to
a rise in price dispersion (mean of the absolute price changes) by 0.5 percentage points (0.3
percentage points) after one quarter.


   41
      This series is constructed and published by the Hamburg Institute of International Economics (HWWI).
   42
      Similar results for the qualitative measures are shown in Figures 5 and 6 in Appendix D.
   43
      The IRFs of the other variables look similar to those found in the literature and are available on request.
   44
      Note that we plot the cumulated mean price change response. This is not quite equal to the development
of the total level PPI as we only consider price changes excluding zeros.


                                                       35
    In summary, this first set of SVAR estimates delivers three findings: first, we again find
evidence that the price change frequency reacts positively, certainly not negatively, as would
be implied by the dominance of “wait-and-see” effects, to uncertainty/volatility increases.
Second, volatility appears to have a negative impact on the price level. Third, increases in
volatility lead to more dispersed price changes.
    To shed further light on the transmission of business volatility shocks to prices, we next
distinguish between price increases and price decreases. The first row of Figure 3 shows that
the fraction of price increases rises significantly for ABSF E quan
                                                               t    and ST DF E quan
                                                                                t    . After two
quarters, however, the response turns negative, and only recovers/turns positive again after
about a year. In contrast to this, we find a delayed positive response of the fraction of price
decreases. While we see almost no reaction in the mean absolute value for price increases,
the positive reaction for price decreases is significantly larger. This means that the increase
in total price dispersion after a business volatility shock is largely driven by the dynamics
of price decreases. Conversely, conditional on an upward price adjustment after an increase
in business volatility, it is mainly the extensive margin that operates, perhaps suggesting
that firms follow a routine pricing rule conditional on upward adjustment. Conditional on
downward price adjustment after an increase in business volatility, we see, by contrast, both
the extensive and the intensive margins of price adjustment active, perhaps a sign that this
constitutes an unusual moment for the firm that requires some experimentation with prices.

6     Conclusion
The contribution of this paper is twofold. Using micro data from West German manufacturing
firms provided by the ifo Business Climate Survey, we construct measures of firm-level
uncertainty/volatility. Specifically, we compute firm-specific expectation errors and use their
absolute values and rolling window standard deviations as measures of idiosyncratic business
volatility. We then find that the frequency of price adjustment increases in idiosyncratic
business volatility and thus confirm theoretical predictions from various literatures about the
sign of the relationship between uncertainty/volatility and the frequency of price changes.
    In particular this means that, at least for price setting, the volatility effect of uncertainty
dominates the “wait-and-see” effect. Overall, however, it seems that only a relatively small
fraction of the time-series movements of the extensive margin of price adjustment can be
explained by movements in idiosyncratic business volatility.
    Second, we provide evidence that heightened firm-level volatility also leads to larger price
adjustments (intensive margin) and to an increase in price dispersion, where the adjustment
along the intensive margin is mainly driven by firms that decrease their prices.
    More generally, it thus seems important to understand better why the extensive and
intensive margins of pricing, and hence price rigidities, change so significantly over the
business cycle and which consequences for monetary policy these fluctuations in both margins
of price setting might have.

Notes: Table provides in the first two columns time-series correlation coefficients between ABSF E qual    τ   and
F EDISPtqual for specific groups of firms i with similar firm-level characteristics, i.e., firm size and industrial
affiliation. In the last two columns, we do the same for ABSF E qual
                                                                 τ    and ST DF E qual

are computed for the raw data as well as for the seasonally adjusted time series. We leave out the oil
industry, since they have only very few observations. Numbers are provided for the qualitative definition
of the expectation error. The construction of ABSF E qual τ  , F EDISPtqual , and ST DF E qual τ    is explained in
Section 2.

B     Description of the input cost variable
To compute a proxy for the cost of input goods, Costsk,t in industry k, we follow the approach
outlined in Schenkelberg (2013). In this approach, a weighted price variable of all K industries
that provide input goods for each production industry k is computed. This procedure follows
three steps. First, we compute the weights of inputs for each industry k. To this end, we
use data from input-output tables from the German Federal Statistical Office. These data
provide for each industry k the cost of input goods from each industry l (including from its
own industry). Data is available for the years 1991 to 2013. For each year we calculate the
cost share of industry l that is used in the production process of industry k. Finally, we
average these shares across time. Second, from the ifo survey we know whether a firm i from
industry l changes its price in period t. We compute the net balance of price changes within
a given industry l for each period t. That is, we subtract the fraction of price decreases from
the fraction of price increases. We, therefore, need to assume that price increases (decreases)
are similar across different firms within an industry. This gives us a proxy of the price of
input goods from industry l. Third, we combine the weights of input goods from industry
l in the production in industry k (from step one) with the respective price of goods from
industry l at period t (from step two). The resulting time series is a proxy for input costs
which industry k faces for each time period t.
    To check our procedure, we calculate a different proxy for input costs based on producer
prices, Costsppi
              k,t , which the German Federal Statistical Office publishes for all industries.
The problem with this in principle superior measure is that the data are only consistently
available since 1995. We proceed as above. We compute the quarterly inflation rates of the
producer prices for each industry k. We combine the weights of input goods form industry
l in the production process in industry k with the respective producer prices inflation rate
from industry l. We get a time series of input costs for each industry k for each time period.
Time series correlation coefficients between Costsk,t and Costsppi
                                                               k,t for the period of overlap are
shown in Table 19. In almost all industries we find high correlations which lends credence to
the use of Costsk,t since producer prices at the industry level are not fully available before
1995.

with ifo net price balances, Costsk,t , and the input cost measure based on industry-level producer price data,
Costsppi
      k,t . Industry-level producer price data are only fully available since 1995. The oil industry is omitted
due to very few observations.

Notes: The table presents marginal effects. All estimations are based on the probit model. First panel:
volatility measure computed from monthly three-month-ahead qualitative production forecast errors; second
panel: binary volatility measure that takes the value one at time t if there is a realized expectation error in
t + 1. Robust and clustered (by firm) standard errors are in parentheses. Included in the probit model but
not shown in the table are time-fixed effects, industry-specific dummies, and Taylor dummies.

C.2             Regressions with a cross-sectional dispersion measure
In this robustness check, we use an alternative empirical approach to analyze the link between
volatility and the price setting behavior of firms. The idea is to use the cross-sectional
dispersion of forecast errors (see equation (6)) within a randomly drawn group of firms to
construct a group-level volatility proxy. For the same random group of firms, we can also
compute the share of price changes, so that we obtain a panel of firm groups for each of
which we have a dispersion-based volatility proxy and a price change frequency measure.

Notes: For each t, 150 groups of firms are randomly drawn. For each group, we compute the cross-sectional
mean of price changes and the cross-sectional dispersion of the (qualitative and quantitative) forecast errors
one period later. We regress the price change frequency on the cross-sectional dispersion of forecast errors
(and on a set of time-fixed effects). This exercise is repeated 400 times. The histograms plot the frequency of
estimated coefficient values.



    Specifically, we first draw for each point in time in our sample 150 artificial groups that
consist of 13 firms on average.45 For each of these groups, we compute the within-group
dispersion of forecast errors and the within-group share of firms that adjusted their price.
We then regress the price adjustment measure on the volatility proxy (timed at the time of
the forecast, as in the baseline) and a set of time-fixed effects. Repeating this 400 times gives
us the distribution of estimated relationships between volatility and price setting shown in
Figure 4. The mean estimate for the qualitative forecast error is 0.016 with a standard error
across simulations of 0.003, for the quantitative forecast error the respective numbers are
0.025 and 0.011. Again we find a robustly positive relationship between business volatility
and price setting.
   45
     This number is just governed by the number of available firms. The results are robust to drawing 100 or
200 groups instead.
