      TAXATION AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES:
                   A RECONSIDERATION OF THE EVIDENCE


                                    ABs'rRAcr


        Foreign    direct investment in the United States boomed in the

late 1980s.        Some have attributed this rise to the Tax Reform Act

of 1986, which by discouraging investment by domestic firms may

have    provided opportunities for foreign firms not as strongly
affected by the U.S. tax        changes.   We challenge this view on
theoretical and empirical grounds, finding that:

(1)     While the argument applies to new capital investment, the

        boom was primarily in mergers and acquisitions;
(2)     While the argument holds primarily for investment in

        equipment, there was no shift toward the acquisition of

        equipment-intensive firms, and
(3)     The FDI boom in the U.S. was really part of a worldwide FDI

        boom   -   theU.S.   share of outbound FDI from other countries

        did not increase during the period 1987-9.

1. Introduction

         In recent years, a large body of research,   dating back to Hartman (]984,

198i)    has focused on the effects of taxation on foreign direct investieent

into and from    the United States             part, this literature has
                                     Far the most
related capital flows to some measure ef an effective tax rate on capital
income. The empirical resulta relating to inward FDI, on which we shall

concentrate in    this paper, have been mixed,   While there is some evidence that

tax rates affect investment, there has been little robustness to such

findings.

         We argue below that this lack of satisfactory results may be due, in

part,    to the fact that past efforts have typically studied financial flows

rather than investment itself, and have failed to account adequately for the

different methods foreign multinationals can use to invest in the United

States, each    of which carries its own particular tax implications. By lumping

together    all forms of investment, and relating this aggregate value to some

measure of the U.S. tax rate, previous researchers have obscured the posstbe

impact    of taxation on foreign investment.

         A foreign multinational seeking to undertake real investment in the

United Stares can do so in three different ways: it can acquire an exiating

U.S. company,    establish a new U.S. branch or subsidiary, or invest through an

affiliate branch or subsidiary already operating in U.S. markets,       The

relevant tax factors affecting the decision of the multinational depend not

only upon the source of funds and the home country's tax rules,      two factors

which previous authors have emphasized, but also critically -upon the chosen

method of undertaking the investment.       While most authors have modefled the

taxation of FDI as if it proceeded through the acquisition of new capital
goods, the predominant channel of POT actually has been through mergers             and

acquisitions. This distinction is of particular importance for the
interpretation of    recent FUt behavior.

         In a recent and provocative paper, Scholes and Wolfson (1990) argue that

the 1986 Tax Reform Act (TRA88) provided a strong incentive           for foreign

multinationals to increase their investment activity in the United States.

Their argument rests upon the observation that foreign companies whose home

countries credit U.S. toxes (those with so-called "worldwide" tax systems) are

relatively unaffected by increases     in U.S. taxes because any payments made are

credited at home upon repotriation. Since TRA86 raised effective tax rates on

certain corporate assete, the relative (to domestio        ti.S.   investors) tax

position of these selected foreign investors may have improved.            Scholes and

Wolfson offer stylized evidence that the boom in investment predicted by these

tax effects has actually occurred,     and Swenson (1989) provides some supporting

evidence with respect to the recent pattern of Pot across industries and

countries.     We reevaluate the   Scholes-t4olfson   hypothesis in this paper,

because we view it as a litmus test for the importance of taxes in determining

POT into the United States, and because we feel that econometric analysis in

the spirit of earlier studies would be difficult to interpret given the

limited sample sizes and clear nonstationarity in the variables we feel are

important.

         As we shall discuss below, a significant part of the FDI boom of the

late 1980's came through takeovers, rather than the purchase of new assets.

Yet, given the distinct tax treatment of takeovers (as opposed to new

investment) and the additional provisions of TRAS8 regarding takeovers, it is

questionable whether the boom in POT is really consistent with the 1985 tax
changes.    In particular, it is not clear     that:   tax factors would predict an

increase in FDI generally or a relative increase in EDI from home countries

following a worldwide tax system.        We demonstrate this point using a model of

FDI developed in Section V.         In light of the model's implications, we consider

the recent patterns of FDI and argue that the evidence of a tax- induced           boom

after 1986 is not as strong as others have suggested it to be.

II,   Foreign Direct Investment in the United States

        Foreign direct investment into the United States has been the subject of

a burgeoning empirical literature.        Table 1 suggests why.    The last column of

the table presents annual flows of FDI, the data series which has been studied

by most of the previous empirical efforts examining inbound         FDI'.   This

series grew at an average annual rate of 18% between 1980 and 1989, before

dropping sharply in 1990.

       One drawback of the use of capital flow data is that they are not

directly related to the actual physical investment which is of interest to the

researcher and on which the theoretical modeis used to form effective tax

rates are based.     For example,    if a foreign company borrows in the United

States in order to purchase a machine,       the transaction will not appear in the

capital flow data.    Quijano (1990) reports that roughly 81% of debt financing

of U.S. affiliates occurs through U.S. sources of funds, suggesting that this

omission may be quite important.2 While payments to cover the borrowing by

the foreign parent will appear in the flow data, the timing of the investment

will be obscured,    and any relationship between the tax treatment of investment

in a particular year and the observed flow series may be spurious,3
          Alternative measures of    Fbi  that are in some respects closer to the
desired measure are given in         the first three columns of the table. The first
is   total investment in plant and equipment          undertaken by foreign affiliates.

The second is the total value of           Ui.   firms acquired by foreign companies, and

the third is the value      of foreign     branches   and subsidiaries newly establi shed

by foreign companies,
          Each of these alternative messures also shows a striking increase in the

1980's.      Affiliate investment grew approximately 11 percent a year from 1980

to 1989, while establishment investment grew at e rate of 15%.             FDI through

acquisition of existing      Ui.   assets grew approximately 21% a year over the

sso'.e   period,   suggesting that the U.S. merger boom of the eighties was not

confined to domestic parents.         In our view, it is the plant end equipment

investment by affiliates plus the establishment of new operations that

correspond most closely to the theory on which past studies have been based,

since these studies have generally ignored the special tax provisions

affecting the acquisition of existing companies or their assets.             Yet, by

1988, these two categories combined accounted            for less foreign direct

investment than did acquisitions.



III. The Tex Treatment of FDI

          The tax treatment of foreign source income can be very complicated,

making empirical study difficult. Countries generally treat foreign source

income     in one of two ways.   A   "territorial"     or source-based approach involves

taxing only home source income, essentially exempting from domestic tax the

income a domestic multinational earns on its operstions abroad.             For companies




                                                 4
based in territorial countries, the relevant corporate         tax provisions directly

relating to investment are clearly those imposed by the host country.

         the other extreme is the "orldwide" approach that adopts the
        At

residence principle of taxation, whereby the home country attempts to tax the

worldwide income      of   its companies, normally offering a credit for income taxes

already paid on       such income abroad. In principle, the income of companies
based   in worldwide countries faces a tax burden determined by       the home

country's     tax provisions, since foreign taxes are simply offset by credits

against the home country's taxes.         This is the essence of the Scholes-Wolfson

argument.

        In practice, of course, there are many additional provisions that

attenuate this sterilization of a "worldwide" multinationals foreign tax

burden.      First,   if the foreign tax rate exceeds that of the home country,

there will typically be excess foreign tax credits, making the marginal tax

burden dependent on the foreign tax provisions, as with territorial home

countries. Second,         in practice the residence principle is commonly applied

only upon the repatriation of income.        As with the taxation of a corporation's

dividends upon their payment, the additional taxes paid upon repatriation may

have no      effect on investment financed by retained earnings, a point Lirst made
in   the foreign context by Hartman (1985).

        Much of the empirical literature on Ff1 into the United States,

beginning with Hartman's work, has focused on the distinction between retained

earnings and transfers. The theory suggests that U.S. tax provisions should

matter least for investment from worldwide countries financed by transfers,

but   the empirical evidence      offers at best weak   support. Indeed,   Slemrod
(1990a)     finds   that   the transfer   of funds is described well by tax and return

variables, hot that retention of earnings is not.

         A possible problem with this literature is the dependence on flow data

which,    as discussed above, do not necessarily correspond to investment itself.

One study, by Swenson (1989)          used the acquisition and establishment data

(given in the aggregate in the second and third columns of Table 1) and did

find some evidence that average U.S.          tax rates are positively correlated with

inbound FDI, as the Scholes-Wolfson hypothesis would suggest.             However,

iwenson also found a negative impact of the effective marginal tax rate, a

result difficult to reconcile with the apparent theory.             We believe part of

this puzzle may      be traced to the lack of attention to the alternative modes of

foreign direct investment, i.e., the effective tax rates used by Swenson

should not be expected to describe acquisition activity well.

         As indicated above, the theoretical discussion and empirical analysis of

the impact    of taxation on FbI has treated the problem as one of acquiring new

cspitsl,    even though this is only one of the possible modes.          The other

important mode is the acquisition of an existing U.S. company.              The mode of

investment chosen affects tax liability differently since the choice to

acquire a U.S. company will depend          on   the U.S. merger laws governing, for


example,    step up in basis and transfer of tax benefits,         whereas investment in

new capital will depend on the statutory tax rate, the investment tax credit

and depreciation schedules. Since the tax burden incurred depends upon the

method chosen and the investor doing the choosing,             it makes little sense to

group these forms of investment together             and relate them to a single tax

variable,    as has frequently been done in the past.




                                                 g
        A fire can chose to acquire   another   in the United States   in a number ci

ways.     The first choice is whether to acquire with cash or in exchange for the

abates of the acquirer, and the second choice is whether to acquite the abates

or assets of the target.     If an exchange of shares is chosen, the deal may

completely avoid immediate tax consequences, with the depreciable basis oi she

acquired corporation being absorbed into the acquirer and, in general, the

U.S. shareholder selling the stock deferring tax liability until such time as

the shares received in exchange are sold.       The tax basis of the new stock is

the same as that of the relinquished stock, and tax is paid upon realization

of any gains.5

          In a sample we have constructed, virtually all foreign acquisitions

were financed with cash throughout the 1980's.        If the acquirer chooses to pay

cash or a combination of stock and cash for the stock of the target, there

will generally be no deferral of shareholder capital gains tax          However,

there   is still   the choice of wherher to acquire the company as a going concern

or a collection of assets.     If   the acquirer chooses to perform a corporate

stock acquisition, the U.S. tax attributes      of the acquired company will be

inherited by the corporation, without any immediate corporate level

taxation.e Alternatively, the parent company can acquire the assets of the

target,    either explicitly or by electing to treat a stock acquisition as an

asset acquisition via Section 338 of the Internal Revenue Code.          In this case,

the acquirer can step up the basis of the depreciable assets of the target,

but in order to do so the liquidating corporation must pay some corporate tax

on the basis step up, and no transfer of net operating losses is allowed.

        To the extent that an acquiring foreign corporation is influenced only

by U.S. taxes at the margin     (the "territorial"   case),   the incentives it faces
in deciding     how to   structure a deal are similar to those facing a      U.S. parent

In the other extreme ("worldwide") cese in which U.S. taxes are absorbed by
tax credits at home,       there seems less reason to opt for the basis step-up,

since this provides no ultimate tax relief but does require the payment            of

taxes   by rhe liquidating corporation.


IV. The Tax Reform Act of 1986

        The passage of the Tax Reform Act of l9ii brought several changes in the

taxation of U.S. corporate investment. The lirerature on FDI has focused

primarily on the reduced investment incentives and the apparent advantages

this offers "worldwide" countries (see, for example,            Scholes and Wolfson,

Slearod 199Db, and Swenson 1989).          However,   TRAS4 also introduced important

changes    in   the tax creatment of mergers and acquisitions.

        Prior to 1985, the General Utilities docrrine allowed firms electing to

acquire the assets of the target to step up the basis of the acquired assets

while paying tax only on rhe recaptured depreciable basis for those assets

subject to recapture.       For example,    if the target had purchased a machine for

$50 and depreciated it to $10, then the acquirer,           upon purchasing the machine

for $100, was allowed to claim depreciation allowances on the full $100, after

paying tax on the $40 of recaptured basis,            Some believed this to have

provided a strong tax incentive for mergers            although aggregate evidence in

support    of this claim   is lacking (Auerbsch       and Reishus 1988). The repeal of

this provision may have played a role in the enormous surge in acquisition

activity    in the final two quarters of 1955.         The removal of the tax gain from

basis step up should provide a powerful disincentive for FDI in the form of
acquiring US, firms, at least to the extent that such acquisitions take the

form of asset purchases,9

          In addition to these provisions directly affectrng mergers and

acquisitions, the 1986 Act altered the structure of taxation in a way that may

indirectly have influenced takeovers.        In reducing investment incentives (most

importantly through the elimination of the investment tax credit) and at the

same time reducing the corporate rate, T8A86 sharply narrowed the distinction

in the treatment of new and existing       assets,   providing apparently large

windfalls to the value of existing firms.        In theory, this represents a large

tax-induced increase in the price of firms, and should have influenced the

incentives to purchase such firms, particularly for the "worldwide" companies

who by assuxsption cannot obtain the offsetting benefits of reduced domestic

taxation of the existing capital it purchases.

          In summary,   there are three sets of U.S. tax provisions relevant to FDI:

those     that apply to new capital,    those that apply to mergers and acquisitions,

and those affecting existing assets.        Quantifying the relative importance of

these effects requires an explicit model of the FDI process.




V.   A   l1odel of Foreign Investment

          In this section we introduce a model, drawing heavily on Auerbach

(1989), which allows us to derive effective tax rates for foreign firms

interested in acquiring U.S. assets.        In this   model,   there are three types of

firms:     domestic,    foreign "territorial" (which are subject only to U.S. taxes)

and foreign "worldwide" (which, at the margin, are not affected by          US.   taxes

they pay).




                                             9
          The model proceeds in two   stages.   in   stage one,   the   representative
 domestic    firm acts much like the firm in Auerbach (1989)       ,   maximizing value
 aubject to a constant-returns-to-scaleproduction function with quadratic

 adjustment costs of investment and potentially changing taxes.                Given the

constant-returns technology        the determinacy of equilibrium is provided by an

endogenous price of     output,   which vaties inversely with the level nf aggregate

production. The domestic firm's optimization problem leads to a system of

first order differential equations in the capital stock K and the shadow value

of new capital, q, which we linearize in order to solve.               The solution for the

path of K and q also provides a path for the output price,              p.    The combination

of q and U.S. tax previsions determine the price of existing capital, ql(

          in the model's second stage, the foreign firm observes the equilibrium

path of q, p and qt determined by the domestic firm and decides hew much

capital to acquire at each instant,      in light of the tax previsions That it

faces.     In order to make the problem tractable, we assuise that the
                                                                       foreign
firm's decision to acquire domestic capital has no effect on domestic output

or price, and that the foreign firm distributes its new
                                                        purchases between

existing and new capital subject to an exogenously given proportion,

This   approach incorporates the idea that, in order to grow within the United

States,    foreign firms may need to grow extensively as well as intensively,

thereby establishing a "toehold"      in new markets."
         We model behavior as if a steady state existed in 1986,             and consider the

change in the rate nf investment upon the passage of TRK86, which we treat as

unanticipated and permanent.       To obtain relatively simple expressions for the
level of FDI, we make a variety of additional
                                              simplifying assumptions, which
are discussed in detail in the appendix, where the following
                                                             expressions are

accumulation problem,            is the domestic    firm's adjustment cost parameter           (
being     the corresponding value for the foreign firm), '             is    the elasticity of

demand for output, p is the firm's real discount rate,                 S    (—   6(l-l/2))   an

adjusted rate of economic depreciation, it              the rate   of inflation and      the

fraction of FbI dnne in the form of acquisition (as opposed to new capital

purchases)

          The remaining terms in these two equations              all relate to changes in U.S.

taxation,     with k the investment tax credit, F           the   present value of

depreciation allowances and 6' the rate at which assets are written off for

tax purposes.         The term a is the proportional change in the domestic effective

tax rate associated with TRAB6, while B is the proportional change in the

relative value of old to new capital.              In general,     B>0 since the Ant raised

the relative valuation of existing assets.                If the cost of capital increased,

theim     a > 0   as well.   Note that B appears only in the first expression, since

territorial firms are assumed to get the benefits of the reduced taxation of

                                                   11
existing assets that the price       reflects.     Worldwide firms, on the other             hand,
must pay for these benefits but do not           by assumption, receive them: the

reduced U.S. tax burden simply leads to increased taxes at home.

        The other major difference between the two expressions is in the sign of

the term multiplying the expression (al,/r7)         ,   which relates      to the decline in

domestic capital accumulation. For worldwide firms,                there   are two effects,

both of which increase investment <for a>O).             The first,    (-l1/p),       is

associated with the rise in prices coming from the reduction in the scale of

domestic operations. The second comes from the decline in q, and reflects the

benefits of a reduotion in the price of oapital goods acquired through

existing oompanies, holding the relative valuation of new and existing goods

constant.

        For the territorial firm, the overall effect is negative unless $                      I,
since the increase in p results from the reduced domestic incentive to invest,

to which territorial firms are also subject.             Indeed,   when    fi   —   0, the

territorial firm's problem is essentially the same as that of the domestic

firm.    However, as         1, the impact of the U.S. tax increase is muted by the

offsetting benefit of the decline in q.

        In summary,     the impact of TRASi on the P01 of "territorial" firms should

go in the same direction as domestic investment, although these firms will

face no disincentive to the extent that FDI occurs through the acquisition of

firms rather than new capital.       Hence,   for assets facing a higher cost of

capital,    FlIT   should be discouraged in general but should shift toward

acquisitions. The impart on the Fol of "worldwide" firms is of a more

ambiguous nature for those assets for which investors face an increased omst

of capital,     as the reduction in domestic investment activity should encourage


                                              12
                                                   should discourage it.           As
entry but the higher valuation of existing capital

long as the net efiect of the tax reform is to increase the value of domestic

firms (i.e. the terms multiplying fi have a positive sum), wotldwide firms will

have   ait   incentive   to shift their activity     from acquisitions)2

        The sign of the impact of TRA86 on investsent by worldwide companies is

an empirical question, which can be elucidated by considering several examples

motivated by the tax treatment of different assets and the actual

distributions of FDI among the alternative modes of investment.

        Table 2 reports the results of simulations of the effect of the tax

reform on FDI for various assumptions about the relevant parameters. The

numbers given in the table are the initial change in the investment-capital

ratio associated with the 1986 tax change, multiplied by the foreign

adjusrment cost parameter F'         That is, one should divide the number given by

one's estimate of          to obtain an estimated first-year change in the

investment-capital ratio.

        The top panel gives the results for hypotheticai "worldwide'" firms and

the bottom panel comparable results for "territorial" firms.         For our

simulations, we have considered four types of asset: equipment, structures,

land and intangibles. Equipment, which depreciares relatively rapidly and

received the investment tax credit before 1986, typifies the investment that

should have been discouraged by TRA86       and, perhaps, been   made more   attractive
to   worldwide investors. Structures, at least those in the corporate secror,

were treated relatively favorably by the 1986 Act.10       Land is not depreciable

for tax purposes, while the creation of intangibles (as, for example, through

advertising) may generally be expensed.




                                            13
           For each   asset   and   country type    we have   consi dared a range       of potential
values      for the fraction of FDI taking the form of mergers and acquisitions                   (fi)


and for      the quadratic adjustment cost term facing domestic investors                  ().    For
     we consider values of 0 (all direct purchases               of new capital),       1 (all

takeovers) and .5 (a reasonable value,              given the relative importance of the

two methods indicated in Table 1).            We consider values for         of     5   and 15,

meant to represent reasonably low and high levels of adjustment oosts.

           Let us consider first the results for territorial firms.               Recall that,

since the value of existing capital reflects              its future productivity, the net

effect of any of the tax changes is zero if fll.                 For the intermediate value

of   /5,   .5, we can see that the tax reform provided a disincentive for equipment

investment,       and increased incentives for investment in structures and land

(since a     >0   for these assets).       For intangibles,      there is no effect because
our assussption of immediate expensing makes the cost of oapital                  impervious to
the corporate tax rate.             When fl0 the effects of the refotm are even

stronger,     but in the same direction.           In general,   territorial fitms'

investment in equipment should shift towards acquisition and away from new

investment after 1986.

           The results for worldwide firms reflect the offsetting effects described

above.      The results ate generally opposite those of rhe territorial firms, as

only investment in equipment may have been encouraged by the 1986 Act.

Investment in land and structures was doubly discouraged, since these assets

received both windfalls to the value of existing capital and reductions in the

effective tax rate on new investment. Hence, these assets would have cost

mote (to the extent acquired via takeover) and returned less, as domestic

investors were encouraged to invest.               Investment in intangihles was


                                                   14
discouraged because of the windfall to      existing rapi tal     wi Lit no   offsetting
effect   coming from changes   in the tax treatment of   new    investment      Only      for
equipment could the higher price      of existing capital have     been   offset     by
higher   returns in the future, and the table indicates that for this to occur

would have required a combination of low adjustment costs (so 'hat domestic

investment would drop and before-tax returns to capital rise quickly) and a

high fraction of capital purchased directly,       rather than through mergers and

acquisitions. Indeed, for the high-adjustment-cost case with half of all

capital acquired through takeover,      all types of investment by worldwide

investors   are discouraged, and even equipment investment is discouraged more

than for territorial investors.

      Hence,   the notion of worldwide investors rushing in to own domestic

capital requirea a very particular aligrsnent of assumptions about the type of

capital being acquired, the mode in which it is acquired and the speed with

which domestic investors   leave    the market to make foreign entry attractive.

In all of the cases, however,      worldwide companies should have been encouraged

to shift their mode of investment from acquisitions of companies to direct

purchases of new assets.

      In summary,   we can conclude the following from the :,imolations in Table

2: relative to territorial firms,     worldwide firms should have shifted their

investment toward equipment and utilized the takeover route less often,                   The

overall impact on investment by territorial firms should have been negative,

but, unless a preponderant share of Ff1 by worldwide companies took the form

of purchases of new equipment, these     firms'   overall incentive for investment

should also have decreased. We can evaluate these predictions using              a   variety

of data on the composition and level of FOI before and after TRABi.

VI. The Recent Fol Experience

      Tables 3A, 35 and 30, record the POT data by country end type of

investment from 3980 to 1989,        Table 30 reports affiliate investment both for

the maj   or worldwide countries the     UK    and Japan, and for the major territorial
countries, Canada, Franro,       Germany and    the Netherlands H' Clearly the sharp
increase observed in Table       1 is also evident here, with virtually every

country   experiencing growth in     P01 both before and        after   TRA86.   The growth

rates from   1986 to 1989 were large for all countries. Japanese affiliate P01

grew 98% over this period; UK affiliate P01 grew i2%.              The territorial

countries experienced a smaller boom, with growth rates over the period

ranging from 17% for the Netherlands to 46% for Germany.

      Table 35 reports acquisition FDI for the same countries. These series

also show an increase throughout the sample, but that by the worldwide

countries, the UK and Japan,       after TRA86 is truly striking.           From 1986 to

1968, Japanese acquisition activity increased by nearly a factor of ten, and

British acquisitions increased by a factor of nearly three.                 The most notable

event in the territorial data is the large temporary increase in acquisitions

in 1986, something consistent with the view that the suspension of the

favorable tax treatment of acquisitions induced these firms to get their

acquisitions in under the wire,        Table 30 reports establishment FDI, which

shows a solid increase for worldwide countries, but nothing striking for

territorial ones.15

      Figures 1-3 record the composition of worldwide and territorial POT over

the same period.    Figure   1   indicates the proportion of total acquisitions of

U.S. companies accounted for      by worldwide      countries   leapt dramatically after

1986, with    roughly 55% of all acquisitions by foreign firms being accounted


                                               16
for    by   those based in the   UK   and Japan by 1988.   Figure 2 shows thar the gap
in    affiliate investment between territorial       and worldwide countries has been

narrowing, and figure 3 indicates that worldwide countries account for roughly

60% of all establiabment investment by 1988.

         How do these trends mesh with the Stholes-Wolison hypothesis and the

predictions of our model?        Recall that the model predicts that if there is a

boom in investment by worldwide firms then it should occur in the form of

direct purchases of capital, not in acquisitions.           While investment in new

                                                               and
capital has increased, as reflected in the increased affiliate

establishment investment, acquisition actiwity has increased even more,

something inconsistent with tax factors.15          In fact, as Figure 4 shows, the

proportion of worldwide investment accounted for by affiliate and

establishment investment dropped precipitously after the 1986 reform, going

from roughly 60% in 1986 to only 35% in 1988.

         More consistent with the model is the shift of territorial investment

towards acquisitions, although the trend is not as clear cut.            The 1987

proportion of new investment is slightly less than that in 1985, and a large

decline followed in 1988.

            Figure 5 plots the share that U.S-bound FDI has in coral outflows from

the territorial and worldwide countries.17          Quite striking is the fact that

the share of U.S. investment in total FDI from worldwide countries is roughly

constant after 1986,      suggesting that the boom in investment experienced in the

United States is just part of a broader increase in foreign investment

activity by these countries. The share of the U.S. in total investment by

territorial countries shows a slight increase in 1987, followed by           a   decline

in 1985 and an increase in 1989.           For the period 1987-89,   there is no clear


                                               17
 trend in either inveetment share,     The resulrs do not offer much support for

 the Scholes-Wolfson predictions of a surge in U.S. -bound tax-driven FbI.

       Additional evidence comes from the industrial composition of FDI.      Our

model suggests that firms from worldwide countries should have faced potential

tax incentives to invest in the United States only in
                                                      equipment. While we do
not have detailed investment data on types of assets purchased, we do know the

industrial composition of   FM   and the asset mix of different industries.   Sn

particular, manufacturing is the major equipment-intensive sector in which FbI

occurs.

       Table 4 presents the proportion of total FDI inflow accounted for
                                                                         by
investment in the manufacturing sector for the major foreign investors into

the United States. Consistent with the theory, the proportion of FOI in

manufacturing for worldwide companies has increased dramatically since 1986,

going from .452 in 198i to .7O in 1989 for the United Kingdom,     and from .129

to .292 in the same years for Japan.     Contrary to the theory, the same upward

trend generally occurs for territorial FbI in manufacturing as well.     Taken

together it is difficult to judge whether the switch cc manufacturing by

worldwide firms was caused by TRA86, or if the swing towards manufacturing is

just part of a general trend towards increased manufacturing investment by

foreign countries.

      An alternative source of information about the mix of assets acquired is

the balance sheets of U.S. companies themselves. For the period 1980:1 to

1990:4 we compiled a sample of 243 companies acquired by foreign parents.        As

a control, we also compiled a sample of 4485 companies acquired by domestic

parents.   For each company with available data, we calculated the fraction of

equipment and structures in their overall fixed capital stock in the year


                                        18
before the acquisition. In table     5,    these fraclions are aggregated into the


pre- and post-1986 periods for the sample of firms acquired       by foreign
worldwide and territorial patents,    for domestic acquisitions, and for the


oompustat universe of firms,

       As the table clearly shows! the fraction of structures rose and that of

equipment fell for two of the three target groups, while the fraction for all

firms changed   little   While the results for the different target groups

are similar, we note that it was among territorial! and not worldwide firms

that the share of equipment rose.     The similarity across worldwide and

territorial targets is consistent with our model of the effects of the 1986

Act, but it offers no support for the view that the post 1986 surge in

acquisitions by worldwide firms was driven by tax induced bsrgmits in

equipment investment. For example,        under the high adjustment cost scenario,

assuming an   adjustment cost parameter of 15, and allowing the fraction of

acquisitions in total FDI to be 1, worldwide firms' investment in equipment

and in structures is deterred to roughly the same degree.




Vii.   Conclusion.

       This paper presents s model of FDI that takes into account the different

tax treatments of acquisition of old sod new capital       in order to isolate more

precisely the effects of taxation on FDI into the United States. Our

simulation results suggest that the Tax Reform Acc of 1986 generally decreased

investment incentives for worldwide countries      in all assets other than

equipment, and that the sign of the effect on      equipment depeuds uprt



                                           19
assumptions about adjustmeot costs and the ptopottion of investment aocounted

fot by acquisitions.

         The model also suggests   that TRAB6 ptovided an incentive fot tettitotial

iicms to invest telatively less in equipment,        and telatively mote in

sttuctutes and land. Also, acquisitions by companias ftom wotldwide countties

wete genetally discoutaged by the tax tefotm.

         Examination of tecent ttends suggests     that many of the obanges in the

composition of FDI ptedicted eithet by Scholes and Wolfson ot out model have

not occutted,    casting doubt on the position that the tecent boom in foteign

ditect investment is due to the changes in tax incentives btought about by

TRAS6.     Othet factors,   such as exchange    tate movements and the libetalization

of capital markets (see, e.g. Ftnot and Stein 1989) may have played a tole in

the ptocess.     In futute wotk using panel data, we hope to examine in mote

detail the chstactetistics of U.S. fitms acquitad by foreign multinationals in

ordet mote fully to undetstand the impact of taxation on FDI.

A Model of PCI

    This appendix presents e      model in which   the various effeors of taxation          on

foreign ditect investment     msy he measured and compared.        The   analysis closely
follows   that in Auerhsch (1989).    Where possible,       we will use the same notation

and unit steps in the derivation that follow from this earlier treatment.

     We assume that U.S. firms are price-takers and invest subject to a constant

returns to scale production function in capital alone,           subject to quadratic

adjustmenr costs.     Foreign firma invest in the United States only via takeover (an
                                                          also subject ro
essuaspricn we will relax later), with these acquisitions

adjustment rusts.     This means that one may separate the questions of investment

and ownership. with the former being determined by U.S. firms and the latter by

foreign firms.

Domestic Firms

        The aasumptiuns uf the modal give rise to a system of differential equations

in the capitel stuck, K, and the shadow value of new capital,             q.   Linearizing the

model and ruhuriruring fur q yields:



 (Al)                                 , - . -.          -
                                         pK

where p is    the firm's   real discount rate,     is the quadratic adjustment cost term,


I   5(l-hlfl is an adjusted measure of the depreciation rate 8,                K   is the steady-


arsre capital stock, and




                                             2S
                           - (k+r) - (k5+F) -               •   1   k+F - pt—p

where k is the investment tsx credit, F the present value of tax savings from

depreciation,     r   the corporate tax rate,          p then relative output price,     and the
                "S"
superscript           indicates     a steady state value.

        If we assume a constant elasticity demand specification for output:


 (A3)                                      .EL2.   -
                                                            K

then (Al) may be rewritten:



 (A4)
                                5-pkc - _____
Assuming that the economy is initially in a steady state at dare zero (say                       1986),

and that the tax parameters shift immediately and permanently at that date (at—a)

the solution for      K   and   q   (tO) are:


 (A5.l)                                    -   K(l±(le1t)a)

 (A5.2)
                                           q — iih±ae'
where   A   is the stable (<0) root of equation (A4).               Equations (Al) provide the

typical saddle-path behavior of K and q, with (for a>0) K steadily falling to its

new level as q rises steadily back to its long run value of                  1   after jumping

initially at t—0.


                                                       29
Foreign Firms
        The foreign firm's problem differs in two ways from thst of the domestic

firm.     First,    its acquisition policy has            no impact on domestic output           is the


output price, p.       Second,   it must acquire capital in the form of firms.

Specifically, we assume that increases                   in foreign-owned capital (as opposed to

simple replacement investment)               require the purchase of existing firms and their

capital.        Hence, the price a foreign firm faces for capital (net of adjustment

costs)     is not the new capital goods price,                 1, hut the value of the firm,          may c

(the determination of which will be discussed below).                           Thus,   if we define p° and


F   in a way comparable to       p   and     ,    the   foreign firm's behavior will he

characterized by (compare to Al and A2):



 (AG)                                         k1- P1kt                at

where

                                                          co           1
                                     atF -   -F                             (T
 (A7)                                                                       U
                                                            U        F,g

and A!     is   defined in parallel fashion to A               in   (A2),   -a-n            .   The   cost of
                                                                                        p
capital term in (A7) includes an additional component due to the changing price of

existing capital,       c.

         Since the output price change included in A! does not depend on the size of

the foreign-owned capital stock, K1, expression (Ag) is a first-order equation in

K, yielding the solution at r—O:




 (AS)                                        Ko    F4       re-/t-Fdr
                                                                 at




                                                          30
 which may be broken up into three pieces,
                                           using the definition of aF in (A7), due
 to changes in taxation (aF), changes in output
                                                prices (p) and changes in the cost
 of acquiring firms (mb),     Only the first two effects are ptesent for domestic
 firms in this model.

         From (A3) and (All), we have


  (AS)                                LI..!...   —   (l_eA1ba
                                          p

which, put into (AS), provides the initial change in the rate of FDI due to price

 changes:



  (Alo)                                       _aA1(pF+5)
                                              $FpF(pF_11)


which has the same sign as a.     Hence, a rise in domestic taxes, though a

restriction of domestic output and a rise in domestic prices, in itself
                                                                        encourages
P01. However, we must also consider the impact of taxation and the cost of

acquisitions. Even firms that do not face any direct tax increase            at all may

still face a change in the cost of acquiring capital goods.

      Before proceeding with a full analysis,           let us note some additional

properties of the solution (AS).          If we ignore changes in a, we obtain




 (All)                            -   -   [ar9rg +      al,(p5+5)
                             jr           [rr          FpF(pF_11)

which adds to (AlO) a term reflecting the direct effect of taxation on
                                                                       investment

                                                            if, in addition,          p?'p

An important change in       1986 was to lessen the relative harden on existing capital,


leading to an increase in        q5,   given q.

        A remaining element of the cost of acquisition involves capital gains and

recapture taxes,        As nearly all FDI acquisitions use cash as a means of payment,

and do not qualify as reorganizations.              selling shareholders are liable for

individual capital gains taxes.             If the acquisition is treated as an asset

                                                                          is
purchase, with a step-up in the basis of assets, the acquired corporation

liable for recapture taxes and, since the 1986 repeal of rho General Utilities

doctrine,       capital gains taxes as well.         This change, along with the increase in

individual capital gains tax rates, should have discouraged ar1uisitions in

general,       but especially asset acquisitions, for all acquirind prties.

        Because we are interested primarily in rho relative inL'utives for acquirc'ts
                                                                        an

increased incentive to acquire U.S. firms, we shall concentrate on the

favorable assumptions for foreign aoquisitions in general,               supposing that

shareholder capital gains taxes are unimportant and that deals were structured

acquisitions of stock to avoid corporate level taxes.

        These assumptions imply that existing capital costs foreign acquirers               qt put

Territorial Firms

     Instead of computing      e for        existing capital,           it is easier to note that the

difference between   q   and   q   reflects the difference between the tax treatment Oi

existing and new capital.          Hence,    buying exfsting capital fot qt or new capital

for q results (for the territorial firm) in the same present value, with the

difference in future taxes just offsetting the initial difference in price.                        This

means that we may replace      q with q        and let aF_a to obtain the solution fot the

territorial firm.    Combining (All) and (A12), we obtain:

2.    Table 4, p. 33.

3. In addition, there ate other possible shortcomings of the flow data. Fires
from territorial countries (those not receiving credits for U.S. taxes at
home) might have a highet incentive to borrow in the U.S. to Ovoid U.S. taxes,
so we might expect the flow data to systeeatically understate their investment
relative to that from worldwide countries.

4. For a useful discussion of the differences in coverage of the different
measures see Quijsno (1990). The balance of payments flow data and affiliate
financial and operating data track the behavior of existing U.S. affiliates of
foreign corporations. The acquisition and establishment data survey existing
U.S. companies acquired by foreign investors, and new companies established by
foreign investors. The reported affiliate investment here is affiliate
investment in new plant and equipment only. If an affiliate purchases an
existing U.S. fire, this shows up in the acquisition data.

S. The total of these three investment series, given in the fourth column of
Table 1, is roughly double the flow series given in the last column.  This
reflects both the absen e of domestically financed capital from the flow
series and the fact tht some of the domestic affiliates are only partially
owned by foreign investors.   Moreover, the flow data net out sales of domestic
firms back to domestic parents.    Still, we view the affiliate, acquisition and
establishment data as more closely related to business fixed investment
activity.

g, This is generally the case if the a quisition qualifies as a "5" or "C"
reorganization, so designated because the relevant code is Section 268 (a) (1)
(B) or (C) of the Internal Revenue Code

7. Since 1916, the tax losses of the acquired firm will be avsileble
                                                                     only for
restricted use, subject to the annual limitation that the losses claimod not
exceed the value of the target multiplied by the federal long term tax exempt
rate, provided that the acquirer can show that the acquired firm is an
"ongoing" enterprise. If the acquired firm is liquidated wt:hin two years of
the acquisition, the net operating losses cannot be used.
      This limitation on the use of losses applies to stock ,cqoisitions
generally, regardless of whether rb.y qualify for treatment ss a tax-free
reorganization.

B. Scholes and Wolfson (1910) argue that these transactions might also provide
a way for foreign corporations to avoid taxes on an eventual basis step up by
transferring assets initially acquired by a U.S. subsidiary in a stock
transaction from the subsidiary to a foreign parenc.  However, this type Oi

                                           39
transaction is caxoble under section 367 (e) (2) of the Intecnal Revenue Code.
There was some uncortainty as to whether the IRS could enforce this section.
Notice 87-5, issued at the end of 1986, argued that this treatment violates
some tax treaties, but eventually the IRS withdrew this notice (Notice g7-6i),
making clear its commitment to impede such tax avoidance strategies.

9.    Good information on the fraction of transactions by foreign parents caking
this form is nor availahie.

10. When a foreign iicm purchases old capital, i.e., an existing U.S. firm,
the transaction is simply a change in ownership, and should obey our
assumptions.  When a foreign firm purchases now capital, however, this could,
in principle, change domestic output and price, unless the foreign investment
is quite small relative to domestic investmcnt.

11. While    may range in the model between 0 and 1, it does not very over time.
Thus, we have not incorporated the possibility that    may depend upon a foreign
corporation's domestic experience, with relative newcomers perhaps mote likely
to weigh takeovers heavily at first. We return to this issue below.         (see
footnote 16)

12.  We note, however, that this conclusion regarding the relative shift toward
acquisitions by territorial companies ignores the possibility that worldwide and
territorial companies' acquisitions may also have been effected by the repeal of
the General Utilities doctrine, the effects of which our model does not include.

13. The effect of lengthened depreciation lifetimes was more than offset by the
reduction in tht corporate tax rate.    We have not attempted to quantify the
impact of other provisions, such as the strengthened corporate minimum tax.

14. These characterizations are taken from Slemrod (l9lOe).    We note, however,
that the distinction is not so clesr in reality.   Territorial countries do not
necessarily exempt all types of foreign source income.       On the other hand,
investors in worldwide countries may face no effective tax rate on foreign source
income, either because of excess foreign tax credits, or the use of retained
earnings as the marginal source of finance (see section III above)


15.   It                that the general increase in FDI over the late 1990's
           might be argued
simply  reflects exchange rate movements.     To control for this effect, we
recalculated the figures in tables IA, 18 and IC in units of the home currency.
Indeed, this did reduce the measured growth rate in FOl from 1966 to 1999.   The
explosion in acquisitions by worldwide      countries stands out even more.
Denominated in Yen, Japanese acquisitions grew by a factor of 7.5 from 1966 to
1988, while UK acquisitions, stated in pounds, grew by a factor of 2.5.

16. The merger boom might be less damaging if it reflected a choice by new
foreign parents to acquire existing U.S. firms in order to gain a foothold in the
U.S. market and facilitate further expansions through the purchase of new
equipment. In terms of our model, this would reflect a shift over rime from a
very high to a very low value of p.   Ifthis effect were powerful, then rho boom
in foreign merger activity could have been   a signal of   intended further   expansi on
through purchases of new equipment.

      To examine this hypothesis we calculated the parcentage of acquisitions by
new acquirers, for each year in a sample describedbelow, of U.S. firms acquired
by foreign parents. The ratio of new entrant to total arquisitions is unifounly
high throughout the eighties, and increases from roughly .7 in 1985 to .99 in
1986 and .93 in 1987.  Ihus, the jump appears a year too early to he ccnsisten
with this view.


17. Unfortunately, data on the breakdown of these flows among the various
modes of investment (acquisition, establishment and direct capitol porrhase)
are not available.

l8.The ratios were not significantly different from the full sample means when
weighted averages were used, because of the huge influence of a small number of
very large targets.
