                      ON THE ACCURACY AND PROPERTIES OF
                       RECENT MACROECONOMIC FO!ECASTS


                                  Abstract


        The aim of this study is to contribute to the measurement and analysis
of errors in economists' predictions of changes in aggregate income, output,
and. the prIce level. n11 sample studies of forecasts can be instructive,
it their limitations must be recognized. Compilation of consistent forecast
records extending over longer periods of tine is necessary to establish a
reasonably reliable base for assessments of forecasting behavior and. perfor—
mance. Thus the historical record of post—World War II forecasts assembled
in the 1960's by the NB is here extended and updated.
        The end—of—year predictions of annual percentage changes in GNP earn
good marks for overall accuracy when judged according to realistic rather
than ideal standards. Moreover, they are found to have improved significantly
in the period since the early l96O s compared with the previous years after
World War II.
       The corresponding predictions for GNP in constant dollars (real
growth) and the GNP implicit price index (inflation) are considerably poorer.
The former suffer fran large turning point errors, the latter from large
underestimation errors. Indeed, forecasts of inflation are not much better
than projections of the most recently observed inflation rates, and they lag
behind the actual rates much like such projections. But the errors in
forecasts of real growth are negatively correlated with the errors in forecasts
of inflation, which helped to make the nominal GNP predictions more accurate.

            Forecasts for the year as a whole can be satisfactory when based on
 a   good record for the first two    quarters;       they tend.   to be more accurate than

 forecasts      with longer spans. An exaiination of the recent multiperiod pre-
 dictions fr veU—kiown econometric models and. business outlook surveys shov
 that   the errors for real growth and inflation cumulated rapid.ly beyond. the
 spans.of 2 to 1 cpiarters. Previous studies have shon the cumulation to be
 as a rule less than proportional to the increase in the span, but in the
 period of recession and recovery 1973—75 the build—up of errors                  was much

 greater.       Again the nominal GNP forecasts benefitted from offsetting errors
 as the rise in      prices was heavily underestimated and          the downturn in real
 activity was missed. Forecasters were generally unprepared for the concurrence
 of accelerating inflation and slowing, then declining output rates: they
 optimistically (and. probably also from a lingering faith in a simple Phillips
trade-off) kept anticipating less inflation and            more growth.
           the present time, the predictive value of detailed multiperiod
           At

forecasts reaching out further than a few quarters ahead must be rather
heavily discounted. No doubt, in periods less turbulent than the recent
past the longer forecasts can be considerably more accurate, but thiz fair—
weather    argument is not very persuasive or helpful.

    I.     On Some Uses and      limitations    of Forecast Data

            How   and how well economists forecast, and how much their predictions
•   help or hurt public and. private decision mdcing, are matters that ought to
    receive much attention of the profession. This is so ot only because of
    their direct      interest to the authors, users, and critics of the forecasts,

    but    also because   of   their intrinsic but           less evident academic interest. hat

    is   the practical applicability of economic analysis in this critical area?
    l4hat is the quality       of   foresight and counsel that can          be expected of respon-
    sible economists?        These are      broad   questions which    are not    easy to answer,

    but they   are basic     and.   surely deserve     to be tackled. This        requires   that we

    systematically confront forecasts as indications of                 how economists    cx ante

    thought    events   are likely     to   un.fold   with   cx post knowledge of what actually

    did.   happen and how.      The aims, from tie       least    to t.e   most   ambitious, are   (1)
    to measure forecast errors, (2) to explain them, and (3) to learn how to
    reduce them in the future.
             Success   in forecasting may be occasional and. fortuitous or               intuitive,

    but    progress in. forecasting, to the extent it is possible, can only come from
    advances of science, not art or chance. It presupposes that su.fficiently
    important and persistent           regularities in economic processes and           relationships
    ed.st    and be   properly identified and. used. Learning processes are               involved,
    which    can be   time-consuming      arid, discontinuous,     reflecting in. part    the shifts
    and    discontinuities in       the econrmc change itself,         in   part the inadequacies
    of measurement and         analysis.
                on economic forecasts generally cover short tine periods. Iørlg
             Data

     tine series on consistent predictions simply do not exist. Few if any fore-
     cast sets    are fully identified according to the many aspects and. dimensions
                                                2


that   matter (source,   target,   timing,   assumptions,   data, models,   and   methods

used),    so that it   is often d.ifficult to determine what constitutes a suitable

"sample"     of forecasts of a given type. Moreover, few forecasters leave their
models and. techniq.ues unchanged for long as they seek inprovements and try to
adapt to new developments in the economy. Hence, a particular forecaster's
past record is often a hi.ly uncertain basis for inferences how he will
perform in the future.
         Even   more hazardous, if not irresponsible, are attempts to grade fore-
casters on the evidence of how well they predicted change in. a particular
short period, say, a year or a few years. C].early, on any individual occasion
sce forecasters will, be ahead of others by sheer chance or for some idio-
syncratic reasons. Strong evidence of significant and stable differences over
time would be required to rank the forecasting individuals, groups, or models
with a modicum of confidence, and, such evidence is essentially lacking
(Zarnowitz, 1967, 1971; Christ; McNees, 1975).
         The proliferation in recent years of mu.ltiperiod. quarterly macro-
forecastz offers no substitute for long historical series. These are rich
data containing much interesting material that certainly deserves to be care-

fully recorded and analyzed. However, such forecasts, and. so their errors,
tend. to be internally correlated in at least two ways: (a) serially, Within
each   sequence made from a given base period. and (b) across the successive
sequences, which overlap and thus refer partially to the sane target period.
Each multiperiod forecast is a joint product of the common infornation,
technique, and juderit used, and each depends on previo..s forecasts of which
it is to some extent a revision. Thus, errors in the data, models, procedures,
and jtidents, autocorrelated disturbances, and certain types of distributed
lags   are   all likely to induce interdepend.encies within and between the multi-
                                                   3


period forecasts. The resulting complex correlation structures resist estima-
tion, given the small samples of comparable predictions from any giverx
                                                                        source.
Consequently, measures of average accuracy, bias, etc., calcui.ated from such
samples are difficult to interpret from the viewpoint of statistical inference
(Spivey and. Wrobleski).
        Two conclusions are surely          valid.. First,     small-sample studies cf fore-
casts are still needed and can be instructive, but their llmi tations must be
recognized. Second, it is necessary to compile and. examine forecast records
extending as far back in time as possible, so as to gain information, take a
lcnger view of forecasting behavior and. performance, and place the short
records of recent predictions in a proper perspective. Historical data on•
post-World. War II forecasts assembled in the 1960's by the National Bureau.
of Economic Research provide a good base here, which I was able to partially
extend and update. Some pre1cm1nary results for annual forecasts of three
variables   are   reported below.

II.     The Record of Annual GNP Forecasts Since 1914.7

         In the   early post-World     War   II   period, most forecasts were made near

the end of the      calendar   year   for   the next year     and   most referred to GNP   in
 current   dollars. The evidence        we have on such forecasts goes back to 1914.7

but is quite fragmentary for the late 1914O's and early 1950's.
       The period of transition from the war economy witnessed the largest
 errors on record in the       GNP    forecasts.       Even after the 1914.5-14.6 predictions


 were   shown to have greatly underestimated the then prev±ling levels ci' economic
 activity (Klein, 1914.6), expectations of a business slump stubbornly persisted.
One =a].l, reputable group of private forecasters came up with an                   average

prediction for 1914.7 of a 6 percent decline in G?, whereas the actual change
turned out to be a rise of about U percent. For 1914.8 the group predicted a
                                                 II.



    fractional decline but GNP instead advanced again at much the same surprisingly
    high rate. The failure of forecasts during these years was widespread, with
    but a few partial except±ons; the develonents of the time could not be
    predicted well, with estimates based on data and relationships for the 1930's
    and false analogies with the early post-World War I period. When a recession
    finally cane late in 191.8, it proved shorter than many had. expected. A
    "consensus forecast" by znre than 30 respondents polled in December l9!.8
    anticipated well the decline of nearly 2% in TP during 1919, but a year
    1tter the sane group was wide off the mark in predicting a d.rop of                  3.5%
    while GP actually staged a strong cneback in 1950 with a rise exceeding 10%.
•
          The evidence for the period 1953-76 is stimr'ized in Table 1 in terms
.of compar1sou. between the predicted and the actual annual percentage changes.
    It is generally instructive to analyze forecast errors in terms of levels,
    absolute changes, and percentage changes but, if a choice must be made for
    succinctness,   there   are several good reasons for using percentage changes
'where technically      appropriate,     particularly    for   variables with strong trends.

    (1). What Is predicted in the first     place      is change   from   the   last   known or

estimated level, and         percent   changes often vary      less   with the levels     and are
more     stable   and comparable over time than        d.oflar changes.         (2) The percent

change     forecasts   are   apt   to be less affected by      data revisions. (3) some
important measures of        predictive performance, such as rre1ations with

actual     values, are much more meaningful for change forecasts than for level
    forecasts.    (14.) It is the rates of growth      in economic aggregates (income,
output,    prices) that are of main       interest     to analysts and policy. makers.

         The forecasts are made late in the year            t-1       or,   in a few cases,

very early in the target year t;            typically,     the forecasters know the official

estimates for the first three quarters but not for the last quarter of the

year t — 1.      The   actual changes used. to compute the errors are based on the
first official estimates for the year t published. early in. the following
(t + 1) year. These are provisional values which are themselves partly near-
term predictions, and subsequent revisions indicate that the errors in the
early data are by no means negligible (cols. 10-11). on. the average, without
regard to sign, these revisions are about one-third the size of the forecast
errors (lines 5-8).       The   errors are computed by subtracting the actual from
the predicted (or estimated.) changes, and. they are predominantly negative,
which shows that both forecasts and the provisional figures strongly tend to
und.erstate   the changes in C.TP (lines 9-12).       By far most of these underestimated.

changes    are increases   (for a review   of similar findings of      earlier studies,

see   Zarnowitz, 1972).
         Table 1 discloses a substantial correspondence between the forcasts
and. the realizations. The predicted changes approd.niate the actual ones well
in each period covered, the averages of the former being generally less than
one percentage point smaller than the averages of the latter (lines 1_li.).
Wflere the mean actual changes increased (is from 5% p.a. in 1956-63 to            8%
pa. in 1963-76), so did the mean predicted changes; moreover, the discrepan-
cies between the two diminished in the latter years. The forecasts are in
all cases   considerably more accurate than        the naive model which assumes that
next year' s percentage    change will be the same        as that of the previous year
and more accurate than the--somewhat less naive--tread extrapolation model
which projects the average percentage change of the four previous years.
Collectively, the mean absolute error of forecasts is less than half that            of
the   first naive model' (lines 5-8, col.    8),   arid   the ratio of the two declines
from 0.11.7 in 1956-63 to 0.11.3 in 1963-76 and 0.311. in 1969-76. The       corresponding
ratios   for comparisons of the forecasts with the four-year moving average
(:trefldu) extrapolations (col. 9) are O.8!i., 0.56, ar.d       o.1.
                                             7

         The average error measures are imDortant but they fall far short of
telling the whole story. Measures of correlation (which unfortunately are
often omitted from forecast evaluations) are needed to show how well the
predicted changes have tracked the actual changes over tii. The r coeffi-
cients for the forecasts covered in Table 1 are all positive and significant;
the r2 statistics generally exceed 0.5           and,   for the more recent periods,
average 0.7 or higher (lines 13—16, cola. 1—7). In contrast, the corresponding
coefficients for the extrapolations (cols. 8 arid. 9) are zero or near—zero
(where larger, r is negative).
         Because sufficiently long and consistent annual time-series data for IP are
not available, no attempt was made 'ere to test the forecasts against hier
startsds provided by more effective extrapolation methods such as the auto-
regressive integrated moving       average   (ARmA) models. However, recent com-
parisons of quarterly forecasts with such models show the forecasts to be on
the average more accurate (Hirsch, Grimm, and Narasixnham; rist; Spivey and.
Wrobleski), and I would expect this to be a          true for the annual fore-
casts and particularly with respect to the correlations with the actual values.
         ie evidence supports the     conclusionthat the end-of-year forecasts of
current-doUar     GNP next year    had a reasonably satisfactory record of accuracy

 since   1953. Indeed, in comparisons with earlier forecasts (Sapir; Okun;

 Zarriowitz, 1967),    that   record improved considerably in the 1960's and. even in

 the 1970's, a turbulent period presumed to have been particularly difficult

 to forecast.

          It must be noted that our collection is       certainly rio   random   sample,

 including    as it   does the official Administration forecasts and. several of the

 most    reputable and   influential sets of private predictions by business and.

 academic economists (see       notes to   Table 1). It is also true      that   our data
                                               8


and. measures have some shortcomings that must not be overlooked. In particular.

the   estimates of the cu.crerit position (ECP) thich the forecaster actually used
as the starting point or base are not always reported. In some cases, there-
fore, the base values had. to be imputed., which was done using data as of the

(precise   or approximated) date of the fortcast plus such information as was

available on how the forecaster derived his ECP's on other occasions. The

imputations, even if carefully made, undoubtedly contain some errors. However,

these   errors are    definitely   not such as to invalidate   the broad conclusions
                  1
of this paper.
        More detailed inferences concerning te relative accuracy of the different
forecast sets covered. cannot be drawn from these results. One reason is that

the forecasts differ appreciably with regard to their precise dates, and. it

is known    from previous research that the earlier predictions have a significant

advantage   over the later ones      (Zarnowitz, 1967; McNees, 1975). it        is relevant,
however, to make the general observation that the average error and correlation
measures do not       show large, consistent differences among the      forecast sets

being compared.       This is in   agreement   with earlier findings   which   together
strongly suggest that the      search for a consistently superior forecaster is

about as promising as the search for the philosophers? stone            (Zarnowitz, 1971;
McNees,
        A few further observations seem warranted. Although the forecasters

included differ in many respects, even a detailed inspection reveals few

sharp contrasts       between their predictions for the same years. Of course,


        1Other   possible errors, also not critical, might arise from          the fact that
 some of our forecasts, lacking directly reported annual predictions, are
 averages of forecasts for shorter periods within the coming year. This could
 cause some deviations from the span or target period intended by the fore-
 casters (Carison, 1977).
                                                          9


        competent      forecasters use common data and. techniques, regularly interact,
        and are often similarly influenced by recent events and. current attitudes and
        ways of thinking. The genuine cx ante forecasts here considered are all to a
        large extent 'judginental." Large doses of judnerit enter, mostly helpfully,
        the forecasts derived with the aid. of econometric models (see, e.g., Haitovsky,
        Treyz, and.     Su). This could weU. tend. to reduce the           dispersion among the
        corresponding prediction of this type; there is indeed some evidence that
        errors of ex ante forecasts with econometric models vary less than errors of
        cx   post forecasts made without       judental a&jtistments (irist). At the same

        time,     many so-called Judgmental forecasters use partly some more or less
        explicit econometric equations or models, "outside" or "own" (Zarnowitz, 1971;
        V. and J. Su). While publishd forecasts by ranking practitioners are often
               with particular skill or care, group average forecasts benefit over
        developed

    • time greatly from cancellations of individual errors of opposite sign
        (Zarnowitz, 1967 and. 1972). At any given time, the deviations between corres-
    •
        ponding forecasts from different sources are likely to be reduced by the
        working of these balancing factors. Thus, it is not surprising that forecasts
        for the same variable and. target period tend to be similar. Indeed, the cor-
        relations between pairs of the forecast sets included in Table 1, computed
*
        for the four periods distinguished therein, are significantly higher than the
        correlations between predictions and. realizations recorded on lines 13-16.
        The r2 coefficieats for eight pairs of the predicted percentage change series
        'all exceed o.8, and. some are considerably higher.

        percent     are   underestimates   and 311.   percent   are   overestimates.   By far   most of

        the latter refer to years marked by economic recessions (19511., 1960, 1970,

        19711.)   or   slowdowns (1962, 1967). The provisional P values show but two
                                                  10


year-to-year declines in the period covered in Table 1: in 195!., which the
forecasts overstated, and in 1958, which the forecasts missed (accounting for
the only      turning-point   errors   in this sample). Thus underestimation was            ii mi ted
to the increases in GNP; moreover, it was most pronounced when the increases

were part±cularly     1are as     in 1953,   1955-56,   1965-66,    1968-69, and   1973.

         These results suggest tim presence of "systematic" errors, but not

in the sense     of a bias that could have been readily escaped or corrected
in advance. It seems difficult to discount them as merely               another manifesta-

tion   of the faniliar tendency of forecasts to underestimate the observed
changes (which, for     series with     random elements, is a property of even unbiased
arid, efficient forecasts; Mincer and. Zarnowitz, 1969; Hatanaka, 1975). 2hat                  is
underestimated. here is the average annual rate of growth in a series which,
as   properly recognized by the forecasters, is trend-dominated and.               seldom

declines from year to year.        This   outcome can be    traced to the forecasters'
tardy recognition     of high-growth     phases   ("booms") and, increasingly, of infla-

tion speedups,     but it was also mitigated by their even tardier recognition of

business recessions and slowdowns, Such movements are               recurrent   and not

purely   random; they have     important,    detectable   regularities as shown by

historical     studies of business cycles; but they are also nonperiodic and.
indeed   vary a great deal over time, so their predictability remains               very
limited. In any event, simple          "learning from past errors" would not have been

of   much use here as   the errors of these forecasts generally have zero or very

low   autocorrelations.

III. Annual Forecasts of        Real GNP and the Price      Level
        It    is difficult to obtain and verify consistent forecasts of Piri

constant dollars and the       implicit price deflator (IPD) that would cover more

than   just   the most recent period. Few business forecasters in           the 1950' and
                                                11

1960's made systematic efforts to decompose their predictions of current-

dollar GNP into quantity arid,        price   elements. Of the forecasters with econo-

metric   models, who paid. mQre       attention to real GNP,     only   two    (Michigan and.

hartoa)    have    longer records.2
        Table 2 shows that the predicted changes in real GITP, taken without
regard to sign, differed from the actual changes by less than one percentage
point on the   average (lines 1-3). The predicted changes tend. to be smller
than   the actual ones, except for the CEA forecasts (col. 3) where the reverse
obtains. The mean absolute errors of the forecasts average a little over
tour tenths of those of the simple last-change extrapolatiorts in 1959-67 and
1962-76, about one third. in 1969-76 (lines i+-6, col.             6).     Comparisons with

extrapolations      of the average percentage change       of    the four      previous years

givevery similar results, except for 1959-67 where the forecast errors
average about two thirds of the extrapolation errors (lines I_6, ccl. 7).
         Correlations between the predicted and actual changes are eU signifi-
cant].y positive, and they too suggest some            improvement in recent years: the

r2     coefficients      for   1969-76 are higher than those     for the       earlier   and   longer
periods (lines 10-12). It is interesting to observe that all but one of them

exceed the      corresponding     coefficients for current-dollal GNP           forecasts,
particularly      so for the predictions with the arton models and the ASA/1BER

group    medians   (ci. Table 2, line     12,   and. Table 1, line      16).    In   contrast   to

the reasonably high        correlations   for the    forecasts   proper, those for the

extrapolations (cola. 6-7)          are here    again extremely low or negative.



        2Some   of the
                  econometric forecasts were released. at more than one date
near the end.     of                       one version depetid.ing on the data

used or policy assumptions made. In all but a few doubtful instances where
somewhat arbitrary decisions had to be made, the forecasts chosen are those
preferred. by the forecaster or, lacking stated preferences, those which embodied
assumptions most common to the forecasts made at the time.

          These surnary   measures, then, present te annual forecasts of real GNP
in a generally favorable light. However, the accuracy of these forecasts
varied greatly in different years, which at times impaired seriously their
usefulness, and this does not show up        in   the snmmry. As suggested by the
averages with regard to sign (lines 7-9), the usual tendency of forecasts to
underestimate changes prevailed in the first half of the period 1959-76 but
cot in the second. half. Actually, the errors varied considerably in. each sub-
period, primarily reflecting cyclical change and. in particular the disturbing
effects of missed downturns. Real. GNP turned down in             l951.,   1958, 1970, and.
19Th1.,   but of the 10 predictions for these years which are available eight
specified continued rises and only two succeeded in signaling declines.
Main, and not surprisingly, nearly all of the significantly large over-
etimatioa errors refer to the years during which national output grew at
relatively low or decreasing rates, and, most of the larger u.nderestiination
errors refer to the years of high real growth rates.
       It is of considerable interest to note that the tn'ning-point errors
are much larger than other errors (on the average about 2 1/2-3 times larger,
for all forecasts in this collection). Thus, even though relatively few,
these directional errors had, a strong adverse impact on the overall accuracy
of the real GNP forecasts, as indicated by the following tabulation.

                                                    Mean Pbso1ute          Percert of Total

            This evidence cntradicts the argument that turning-point rrors      matter

    little   because they are few arid. far between (cf. Samuelsori). Bat the argument
    goes further to say that such few large errors are the necessary (and small)
    price to pay for the avoidance of many large errors "between turning points"
    by means of optimal estimation procedures such as least squares. However, it
    is not clear that these procedures imply more than that the variance of the
    pred.icted.   changes must be less than that of the actual changes (and progres-
    sively declining as the forecast span is lengthened.). The inevitability
    (indeed;    even the existence) of a trade-off between errors at major turning

    points and other errors has never been demonstrated, and it would seern a

    e.u.nsel of despair for the forecasters to accept it. Prediction-of cyclical

    turns in such    series   as real GIP, though certainly difficult, is oat nieces-
•

    sarily impossIble,     particularly on an annual basis (note the good record. in

    forecasting troughs). In sum, there are indeed. strong reasons for makers arid.

    users    of economic forecasts to give a great deal of attention to turning-

    point errors.     Actually, most of them realize this, as shown by the widespread

    practice of analyzing such errors (Hicinan, ed., 1972; studies in I.E.R.,

    19714._75). However,   there is certainly much   need for improvement here, and

    room for some new initiatives (e.g., on. how to use current signals from

    leading indicators, see Vaccara and. Zarnowitz).

             The worst single year for the predictions covered. in Table 2 was 19714.,

    on   the e'e of which forecasters across the field missed the onset of a serious

    recession. This, plus the smaller turnin;-Doint errors for 1970, are        the
    main reasons for the rise in the average errors of these forecasts in
                                                                                1969-76
    compared with the earlier years. But the rise in. the absolute errors was not

    large, and there was no decline in accuracy as measured by the criteria of

    cumparisoris with extrapolations and correlations of predicted with actual

    changes    (Table 2, cols. 3 and ii.). Limited evidence   from one longer series of
                                                 15

     forecasts   suggests that real P was predicted with similar average errors in
     the two 8-year periods 1953-60 and. 1969-76, with much smaller errors in the
     relatively quiet     years 1961-68.

            Although the     forecasts   of real (NP   are about as   good. relative to our
     simpleextrapolative bew4imk models as are the forecasts of GNP in current
    dollers, they are less accurate in terms of comparisons of the errors with
    the   actual percentage changes to be predicted.         The point    is that the   extra-

    • polations perform substantially better for         noniaal GNP than for real GNP.
    This can be shown by dividing the error of extrapolation             into the   size of
    the   actual   change, without regard to sign, which      gives the following overall

    ratios for the    Xl (last changc) and.        (average change) models:


•                (P-—U, o.14; X2, 0.30                Real GNP-—Xl, 0.78; X2, o.68

    These   results accord with     expectations, since the growth rates in constant—

    dollar G1'P varied    considerably more  those in current-dollar GNP. The
                                               than

    ratios of forecast error to extrapolation error average about 0.l. when Xl is
    the standard, 0.5 to o.6 hea C2 is, and. the results are much the sane for
    either    variable.
              Table 3 surveys the performance of forecasts of percentage changes in

     the price level (I) that match the real G predictions covered in Table 2.

     On   the average, the   predicted inflation rates fall short of the actual ones by

     fractions of one percentage point (flues 1-3). The 1959-67 forecast sets are

     less   accurate than    simple last-change extrapolations (line Li.), and the other

     sets outperform the naive models by relatively small margins, much less than

     those observed for the          series. The naive models work comparatively well

     here, with errors averaging about 3/10 of the actual changes in IPD. Projec-

     tions of the last change are in this case better than those of the average

change (cols. 6-7), which is the reverse of the situation for GNP in both
current and. constant dollars. The forecasts underestimated strongly (much
more than the last-change extrapolations) the average inflation since 1961
(lines 7-9). The predicted and. actual percentage changes in the price level
are all positively correlated, but the correlations for 1969-76 are generally
lower than their counterparts for (TP and, still more so, for real GNP (lines
10-12).
      Forecasts of inflation often have much in common with projections of                       the

last observed rate of inflation. To illustrate, correlations between the
errors of these forecasts and the errors of the correspond.ing extrapolations
produce the following r2          coefficients:       Michigan, 1959-76: 0.51; CEA,
1962-76: 0.78; ASA/NBER, 1969-76: 0.95; Wharton, 1969-76: 0.80. For growth
rates in real G1'TP, the correlations between forecast errors arid, extrapolation
errors are also positive but throughout lower, in most cases much lower.
These results are not surpristng and they have a positive aspect inasmuch as

forecasts shou.ld be closer to extrapolations of a given type in those cases

where such extrapolations are        more effective (for an elaboration, see Mincer

 and. Zarrio'witz). However, our      comparisons     are   constrained     to naive   models
which presumably do not represent         high standards       for   economic forecasting.

 In particular, price-level forecasts that are          highly correlated with           last-

      extrapolations must share the
 change                                       property' of the latter to lag a           year

behind the actual rates of inflation.              Indeed, the correlations between the

 predicted    changes and   the   previous year' actual changes are           all   positive

 and. high: the r2 coefftcients for the four                sets   of IPD   forecasts   listed

 earlier in this paragraph        are 0.76,   0.87,   0.81,   and 0.72, respectively.

          The annual percentage changes in real GNP           are inversely    related to those

 in IPD   and   positively related to those in current-dollar GNP, while the last

two   variables do not show a strong                         relationships
                                            or stable association. The

between the predicted changes generally parallel the actual ones. This is
illustrated     by the r2 coefficients tabulated below (for symbols, see Table 1i).

        The   errors of the forecasts are similarly interrelated. Table Ii. demon-
trates a      pervasive pattern of      negative correlation between errors in fore-
casting                 inflation (col. 1). The tendency for these errors
          real growth and                                                                 to

be   offsetting, which benefits the forecasts of P in current dollars, is
most strongly in evidence for the more recent years. When forecasters over-
estimated real     growth,-   or missed a downturn and projected continued growth
instead, they typically also underestimated inflation, as in 1969-71 and
l973—7.. Underprediction of real growth occurred in 1972 and 1975-76 in
combination with overp,rediction of' inflation.
        These observations, which have some precedents (Zarnowitz, 1969; Moore,
1969, 1977), are consistent with a view of the world in which nominal              GN'P

changes are predicted directly and relatively well, but their division into
real and. price changes continues to pose great problems.           Many forecasters may

agree   with that view in general terms, and. some subscribe tà models consistent
with it (a specific excznple might be the St. Iuis model in which the dollar
change in total GNP expenditure is determined mainly by            the   dollar change in
a measure of money stock). However, most macroeconometric models, including
the two sets covered here, have separate aggregate real demand, output, and
price level equations, and. it is not at all clear why they should predict P

better in current than in constant dollars. In fact, so'e studies of the
recent   performance of quarterly    models   arrive   at the cpposite conclusion,
namely that    the results for real G are better than those for nominal GNP

because   of   deficient price   forecasts   (iggal, .ein, and   McCarthy; Eckatein,
Green, and. Sinai). The available evidence seans too lirnited and. too mixed.
to permit any conclusive generalizations on. this point. But it is interesting
to observe that the importance o± output errors vs. price errors ay vary
with changes in the relative roles of real vs. nominal factors and disturbances:
in the 1970's the errors of the GNP forecasts were for the most         part   better
correlated. with the IPD errors     than with the   RGNP errors, whereas in the 1960t
the contrary situation obtained (Table II., cols. 2-3).

IV. Quarterly Multiperiod Forecasts, 1970-75: An Overall Appraisal

        Here we have space only for a     summary of some early     results   from a study

in progress. The forecasts and actual data are          used in   the same form as before,

but they now refer to overlapping sequences of quarters, ot simply to a series

of successive years. Our materials cover 22 quarters from 1970:3 through

1975 :, a period for   which   forecasts from several new sources are available.

First   estimates for the   preceding   year, taken   from the   data prior to the 1976
benchmark   revision of the national income accounts, serve as           comparable reali-

zations. The full version of the study will include also comparisons with the

revised   data in an integrated treatment of forecast errors and measurement

errors. Adjustments of the      forecasts for base revisions, used in         some fore-

cast evaluations, are regarded as questionable and. are avoided.

        The mean absolute errors of GNP     forecasts   are close to one percentage

point (like the annual forecasts, see Table 1) for two quarters ahead, and

about half of that or less for one quarter ahead. Over longer spans, the MAE
rise more or less steadily by increments varying from 0.3 to 0.5 of one per-
centage point for each additional quarter; they approach           and exceed 2 percen-

tage points for l1.-quarter and 5-quarter spans, and 3 percentage points for

7-quarter and. 8-quarter spans, respectively (Table 5,           lines   1-3). Consistent

with earlier findings and interpretations for various types of multiperiod

forecasts (see, e.g., Zarnowitz, 1967, pp. 60-72), the MAE increase less than

in proportion to the extension of the span. The errors in forecasts of

percentage   changes expressed on a per-unit-of-time basis (roughly, errors
divided by   the length of the effective span) neither rise nor decline syste-

matically as the forecast reaches further into the future. The same applies

to the errors of the implicit predictions of changes during the successive

single quarters covered; it is the cumulation of these intraforecast (umarginalfl)

change errors that technically accounts for the tendency of errors in the total

predicted changes to grow with the span.3

        Vhere   both forecasts and realizations refer to increases (as       they do

most of the     time by far    in   the case of ip), rrors of positive sign denote
overestimation        of actual change. The mean errors in Table 5, lines 14._6, are

predominantly        small and. positive, except for the longer spans where some of
them are     large    and. negative. As will be shown below,
these averages conceal large errors of opposite sign in the forecasts for some
of the different economic phases of the period 1970-75.

forecasts)      and. exceed. Q•1. or 0.5 for two quarters ahead. They are much smaller

for    the   longer   spans, mostly in the 0.1-0.25 range,   in   a few cases near   zero

(lines 7-9).
         Theil? s    inequality coefficients generally fall between 0.2 and    0.3

(lines 10—12). This indicates           that these forecasts are all much better

than   a naive model extrapolating the last recorded percentage change (for
which U =  1). That model, it should be noted, is but a minimal standard
for economic forecasts. Interestingly, the U coefficients do not increase
with the forecast span;        in fact, they decline slitly below .2 for the longest spans.
         The next     two tables have the sane format as Table 5, which facilitates

 presentation        and comparisons of these measu.res. Real GNP forecasts have MAE

 (in percentage points) rising from o.-o.6 for one quarter ahead            to -6 for


        3Note that fewer observations are available for the longer spans (Table 5,
       b). This reduces the comparability of the measures reported for the differ-
 ent   spans, but does not eliminate it.

eight   quarters ahead, that is, somewhat more than in proportion to the measured

span    (Table 6,   lines   1-3). The errors for the two           shortest   spans are        not     much

larger than those for GP in current dollars, but the errors for the longest
spans   are 50 to 100 percent larger. The u.nusually rapid build-up of the MAE
can be traced in large part to turning point errors. In quarterly multiperiod.
forecasting, turning points are more frequent and more difficult to predict
than    in   annual forecasting, but the errors associated with them matter much
more yet: here, missing a turn often means that a whole chain of predictions
for the      subsequent observations is badly off.

         The mean   errors of these forecasts are          all   positive, which is largely
due to the effects of missing or underestimating the declines in real GNP
during the recession (Table 6, lines 1i.6). The                    also cumulate continuously
and. rapidly here,     quite nriltke those for the         nominal GNP forecasts. On the
other hand, the r2          coefficients      are   rather surprisingly high in Table             6,

lines    7-9, much above the corresponding figures for (2P                in Table     5,   particularly
for spans of 3-8      quarters.       Relative to the size of       the   actual changes, however,

the real (P       errors    are much larger     than   the current—dollar GNP errors:

the inequality coefficients rise from •14—.5               to    .7—.8   (Table   6,   lines
10-12).

         The MAE of forecasts of inflation in terms of the P                  implicit price
deflator      are like those of the (p forecasts for the shortest spans--O.5 or

less one quarter ahead, approximately 1               percentage   point two      quarters     ahead--

but they cumulate rapidly, especially for the longest spans (Table 7, lines
1-3). The figures for the eight-quarter-ahead predictions are here more than
12 times as large as those for the one-quarter-ahead predictions. This
exceptionally       strong build-up of errors reflects a progression of under-

estimates of the inflation rates, rising more than in                    proportion    to   the   span

extensions (Table 7,         lines   1.-6).

        The r2    coefficients for the IPD inflation forecasts are              generally

higher than those    for the forecasts   of percentage change in            nominal GITP

(except   for a few short predictions) but throughout lower             than the correspond-
ing statistics    for the real growth forecasts. They range from .23 to .66                      and
tend to decrease as the spans lengthen (Table 7,            lines   7-9).     The   U coeffi-

cients (lines 10—12) are close to .2 for the shorter spans and close to .5                       for
the longest; they are thus higher than their counterparts for the current—dollar

GNP forecasts but lower than those for the real GNP forecasts.

        The quantity   and price ingredients of the TP forecasts              show a pattern

of offsetting errors in the      quarterly    as   well   as annual data. The irtean errors

of real growth predictions are aLl, positive, those of inflation predictions

all negative, and. these statistics, matched by source and span, have similar

absolute values for most of the shorter forecasts                 As a result, the ?€ of

the current-doll:ar tP forecasts for spans 1_li. are as a rule positive but very

small   for chase and DRI, negative but small        for GE. The negative            of the

inflation     forecasts outweigh   the positive       of the real growth forecasts in

spans   5-8, so that the       of the percentage change        forecasts     for P are pre-
dnmiriantly    negative and substantial (of. lines k-6         in   Tables ,    6, and     7).

        The   surveyed accuracy measures   do not show any         of the forecasters to be
consistently superior to the others. They do              favor   GE over Chase and.   DRI in

most instances, but by modest margins        and in a way that        can be explained       by an

advantage in timing:     the   GE forecasts     are issued late in      each quarter, the

others early.

        The results reported in this study should and will be carefully conipared

with those of other evaluations of the same forecasts, but the task is still

to be completed.     The error   measures used here differ in          several respects

from those used by others,       and additional    computations are required to allow

for these differences.

V. Quarterly Multiperiod Forecasts: An Analysis by Su.bperiods

         The period l97O:3-l975:4, although short, was unusually          varied   and.


marked by major disturbances arid drastic changes in the economy's course. It

is    useful to divide it into the following parts, as suggested by the contemporary
business-cycle and inflationary developments.
      I. 1970:3-1973:1. End of the mild. 1970          recession     followed by an
                              expansion that accelerated in 1972, with relatively
                              stable inflation.
        II.   1973:l_1973:!.. Slower real growth and a sharp inflation speedu.p

                              (materials   shortages, run-ups in commodity prices,

                              oil embargo).

       III. 1973:1._1975:1. Recession, severe in its last two quarters, accoin-

                              panied first by     a further   rise   and then by a dxwri-
                              turn in the rate of inflation.
        IV. 19'7:1_197:11. Sharp    upturn arid   the initial recovery phase, with
                              a further decline in inflation.
        One question is whether forecasts that originated in these four sub-
periods show significantly different characteristics and performance. The
other is whether forecasts for these subperiods (i.e., those that aimed at
the   corresponding groups of   target quarters) are    so    differentiated. It turns
out   that the answers to both questions are definitely yes.

        To illustrate the first point, the expansion phase I produced forecasts

that underestimated growth in dollar GNP mainly because they underestimated

inflation. The percentage changes in real GNP were partly underpredicted,

partly (in some longer forecasts) overpredicted, but whether negative or

positive the        of these forecasts were small. In general, the record of the
                                                 29

forecasts        that were made   during the    period   I was good in tezs of both the ME
and   the MAE figures, even for the long spans. In contrast, the slowdown

phase     II produced real growth      predictions with very large positive ME and

inflation        forecasts with   very large negative       ME (widerestimation errors).
These errors balanced each other so that              the   ME for the nominal   GMP predictions

were   moderate (and mostly        negative,    except for the    longest forecasts).    The

recession phase I gave rise to even larger positive mean errors in the real

growth        forecasts as the declines were repeatedly missed anii,         when finally

recognized,        underestimated. These errors were larger absolutely than the
negative        errors on   the price side, which reflected a continuing underestimation

of   inflation, so that the predictions of' the growth rates              in nominal GNP   had
consistently        positive ME in   the subperiod     III.
          The above sIimrny is based on charts (not reproduced here) which show
the average errors (MAE and ME)            by   span and by subperiod. in which the fore-
casts originated.            These charts look very similar for such different models
as Chase and DRI: they show in each case the same strild.ng differences
between the forecasts made in          subperiods I,        II, and III. The suggested infer-
ence is that concurrent predictions from different sources and models have

common patterns such that their errors depend strongly and similarly on the

characteristics of the time of their origin.

          In a second exercise, the forecasts were assigned to the four stibperiods

according to their target quarters,             not their base    quarters, as illustrated

In   Charts 1-3. Here the samples are            partitioned differently, hence the

resulting patterns          diverge from   those obtained on the       first plan, but the

        LI.                                                        .
              No averages for phase IV are used on this basis, since they contain too
few observations in the truncated. sample.
                                           30

conclusion   is analogous: the type and size of forecast errors depend criti-

cally on the economic properties of the target periods vis--vis those of the

periods of origin. Forecasters perform best when the two            periods   are alike,

belonging to the same already recognized phase, e.g., a continuing expansion

as in 1971-72   (most of   subperiod. I). They perform worst when the target

falls into a new phase, particularly when the latter departs sharply from the

currently established pattern (forecasts made in. subperiods II and. III, and

those for subperiods III and. IV provide many examples, particularly in the

long-span categories). Such period characteristics are much more important

determinants of forecast errors than are any differences among the forecasters.

      Chart 1 shows that both Chase and DRI persistently underestimated the

percentage changes in GI'TP for su.bperiods I and., much more strongly, II. Both

forecasters overestimated the changes in their short forecasts for subperiod

III and. underestimated them in their long forecasts for the same phase. Over-

est.mates prevailed. in all forecasts for the last phase covered., IV, and. here

the average errors behave in an unusual fashion, first increasing and then

decreasing with the lengthening span.. This is due to offsets between. the

real growth forecasts with positive ME and the inflation. forecasts with

negative ME (see Charts 2 and 3).

      Chart 2, which covers the real growth forecasts, shows u.nderestimates

dominating the errors for I and. II, much larger MAE aud. positive lylE for III

and. IV. The huge average errors for the two latter phases derive mainly

from the forecasters' failure to predict the declines in real GNPI5 The long-

span errors for the 1975 recovery (IV) are strikingly large here.

                                     At   (see Table 5   for   the symbols), are positive
where P >     0 and.   At < 0,   and. also where         < 0 and At < 0 but
 At. These cases dominate in Chart 2 the results for both the recession
phase III and. the recovery phase IV. Although real GNP reached a trough in
1975:1 and increased thereafter, the actual changes over longer spans ending
in 1975 are negative; that is, real GNP was lower during period IV than in.
1973 (II) and. during most of l974. (III).

       The   inflation forecasts also had, very large average errors in the
recession    period (III), as demonstrated in chart       3. Their errors     were rela-

tively small    in   subperiod I, considerably larger     and   on balance all negative

in   II; in neither phase did. they increase strongly with          the span. The short
forecasts for phase IV had small errors; in several cases their means are

positive, ind.icating overestimation of inflation         rates that just began to

decline.     The long forecasts for this last subperiod, however, had very large
underestimation      errors.


VI. Concluding Observations
        The end-of-year forecasts of annual percentage changes in TP earn good
marks for overall accuracy when judged according to realistic' rather than
ideal standards. Moreover, they are found to have improved in the period
since the early 1960' s compared with the previous years after World War ii.
        The corresponding forecasts for 1P in constant dollars (real growth)
and IPD     (inflation)   are weaker. The former     suffer from large    turning-point
errors, the latter from large underestimation errors.             But the errors   in. fore-
casts of real growth are negatively correlated with the errors in forecasts

of inflation, which helped to make the nominal GNP predictions more accurate.

In recent times, these correlations were connected          with the unexpected con-
cu.rrence   of accelerating inflation and       slowing, then   declining output rates:

optimistically,      and probably also   from a   lingering faith   in   a simple iillips
trade-off,    forecasters kept anticipating less inflation and. more growth. But

in the late 190's and. early 1960's, it was the relative stability of the

price level that caused widespread surprises          and. offsetting    errors resulted

from the opposite combination of overestimates of inflation and. underestimates

of real growth.

        Forecasts   of inflation are not much better than projections of the most
recently observed inflation rates, and. they lag behind the actual rates much
like such projections. The deficiency of price-level forecasts, documented.
in this and other studies, surely impairs the general ability of economists to
analyze the prospects for the economy. provements will require major
advances in our knowledge, presumably through research based on carefully
worked out data (abstract speculation abounds bat good. information and. observa-
tion are rare in this area).
        The favorable record of annual G? pred.ictioris does not imply that fore-
casters can perform well the more difficult task of predicting quarterly
changes in '1P within the year ahead or even beyond it. Forecasts for the
year as a whole can be satisfactory when based on a good record. for the first
two
                                                                              .6
      quarters; they tend. to be more accurate than forecasts witt longer spans.
An examination of the recent xnultiperiod. predictions shows that the errors
for real GNP and IPD cumulated rapidly beyond the spans of 2 to 1 quarters.
Previous studies have shown the cumulation to be as a rule less than propor-
tional   to the increase in the span, but in this period the build-up of errors

was much   greater   than usual. No doubt, in less turbulent times the longer

forecasts can be considerably more accurate, but this fair-weather argument

is    not very persuasive or helpful. At the    present   time, the predictive value

of detailed forecasts reaching     out   further than a few quarters ahead must be

rather heavily discounted. Again, what is critical here is theoretical analy-

sis and empirical research that would lead to improvements in our       ability   to




             errors of predictions for the individual parts of the year at
times offset each other to some degree (Zarriowitz, 1967; McNees, 1973, i97).
These gains from aggregation over time resemble those from aggregation over
sectors (GNP is predicted with smaller average errors of relative change than
are most of its components; see Zarnowitz, 1967, 1972; Promm and Klein, 1976).

Despite setbacks, there is still no reason to give up moderate hopes for an.
