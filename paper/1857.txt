        The   Effects of Tax Rules on Nonresidential Fixed Investrtent:
                   Soire Preliminary Evidence from the 19 80s

                                     ABSTRACT

     The evidence presented in this study confirms that tax-induced changes in
the profitability of investment have had a powerful effect on the share of GNP
devoted to nonresidential fixed investment. More specifically, we have
reestimated two models of aggregate investment initially presented in
Feldstein, "Inflation, Tax Rules and Investment: Some Econometric Evidence,"
(Econometrica, 1982). The present study extends the previous analysis by
using revised national income accounts, by improving the estimation of the
effective tax rate and the profitability of new investments, and by extending
the sample to include the years 1978 through 1984. Despite these changes, the
new statistical estimates are remarkably close to the previous results. The
statistical estimates are also very robust with respect to sample period,
estimation method, and the presence of other variables.

     The first model relates the investment-GNP ratio to the real net-of-tax
rate of return received by the providers of debt and equity capital to the
nonfinancial corporate sector and to the rate of capacity utilization. Our
estimates imply that each percentage point increase in the real net return
raises the investment-GNP ratio by 0.4 percentage points. A one percentage
point increase in the net return is equivalent to a ten percentage point
reduction in the overall effective tax rate. Since the net nonresidential
fixed investment averaged 3 percent of GNP during the past three decades, a
ten percentage point tax reduction induces a 13 percent rise in the
investment-GNP ratio.

     Our second model relates the investment-GNP ratio to the difference
between the maximum potential net return that firms can support by investing
in a "standard investment project" and the net cost of debt and equity
capital. The statistical estimates imply that each percentage point change in
this measure of the rate of return over cost raises the investment-GNP ratio
by 0.3 percentage points or 10 percent of its three-decade average.

     The estimates imply that the 1985 tax bill passed by the House of
Representatives would reduce the investment-GNP ratio by between 10 percent
and 15 percent of its verage value, depending on the model used to make the
calculation. Such reductions would represent between one-half and
three—fourths of the rise in the investment-GNP ratio since the 1981
investment incentives were adopted.

         THE EFFECTS OF TAX RULES ON NONRESIDENTIAL FIXED INVESTMENT:

                   SOME PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FROM THE 1980S


                       Martin Feldstein and Joosung Jun*



     By the end of the 1970s there was widespread agreement that the rate of

capital accumulation in the United States was too low and that the tax system

was an important reason for that low rate of investment. Net fixed

nonresidential investment had fallen to only 2.7 percent of GNP in the second

half of the 1970s, one-third less than it had been a decade earlier. The tax

system depressed the return to saving and to investing in business plant and

equipment by a combination of corporate and personal taxes that took 67

percent of the pretax return to capital in the nonfinancial corporate sector

during the years 1975 to 1979.1 The sharp increase in this effective tax rate

between the 1960s and 1970s was due in large part to the interaction between

the rising rate of inflation and the persistence of tax rules that base

depreciation on the nominal value of capital assets and that tax artificial

nominal inventory profits and nominal capital gains.2

     Congress and the new Reagan administration responded to this problem by

enacting the Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA) of 1981. For individual

taxpayers, this legislation stimulated saving by reducing all statutory tax

rates by 25 percent and extending eligibility for Individual Retirement

Accounts to all employees in a way that that permits the majority of

individuals to be taxed on a consumption tax basis with all of their saving

done out of pretax income. For corporations, ERTA replaced the previous

system of depreciation allowances with a simplified "Accelerated Cost Recovery

Systemt' that substantially increased the present value of depreciation

allowances. Most purchases of equipment could be depreciated over an

accelerated 5-year schedule while structures could be depreciated over 15

years using a 175 percent declining balance schedule. ERTA also provided for

further accelerations in depreciation schedules in 1985 and 1986. According

to calculations presented in The Budget of the United States for Fiscal

Year 1986, ,   the original ERTA provisions would have reduced 1988 corporate

tax receipts by $55 billion or 56 percent of currently projected corporate tax

receipts for that year.3

     The reduction in the rate of inflation also reduced the effective rate of

tax on corporate sector capital income. The rate of increase of the GNP

deflator reached a peak of 9.6 percent in 1981 and then fell to 6 percent in


    2Feldstein (1983a) contains several papers that discuss this interaction
of inflation, tax rules and capital formation.

    3me Budget of the United States for Fiscal Year 1986 projected corporate
tax receipts of $99 billion in 1988 under current law and indicated that the
original ERTA provisions would, on the basis of 1985 economic projections, have
reduced 1988 corporate receipts by $55 billion. See pages 4-2 and 4-7 of Office
of Management and Budget (1985).

 1982 and to less than 4 percent for each of the next three years. Under the

 ERTA tax rules, a decline in the inflation rate from 10 percent to 4 percent

 raises the present value of depreciation deductions and investment tax credits

 per dollar of equipment investment from 45.2 cents to 49.2 cents.4 In

 addition, the combination of lower inflation and the voluntary shift from FIFO

 to LIFO inventory accounting reduced the inventory valuation adjustment from

$43 billion a year in 1979 and 1980 to only $ 6 billion by 1984.

      In short, the 1981 tax legislation and the reduction in inflation

provided a very substantial increase in the incentive to invest in plant and

equipment. But within a year there was enough concern about the prospective

deficits that Congress and the Administration passed a new tax bill aimed at

raising substantial revenue. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act

(TEFRA) of 1982 introduced a half—basis adjustment for the investment tax

credit and repealed the prospective further accelerations in the depreciation

schedule. These changes implied a $43 billion rise in the 1988 corporate tax

receipts, effectively cancelling 78 percent of the reduction granted in ERTA.5

Two years later, the Deficit Reduction Act (DEFRA) of 1984 raised projected

1988 taxes by an additional $10 billion, leaving the net 1988 corporate tax




    4mis assumes a 4 percent real discount rate. With a 10 percent real
discount rate, the corresponding present value rises from 41.8 cents to
45.2 cents. With the slower depreciation rules of the pre—ERTA tax law, the
increases are greater: from 41.2 cents to 46.2 cents with a 4 percent real
discount rate and from 37.2 cents to 41.2 cents with a 10 percent real
discount rate. These figures are figures are taken from
The Economic Report of the President for 1983.

    58y contrast, the 1988 personal tax increases in TEFRA were only $19
billion or 8 percent of the original ERTA personal tax reductions. These
figures are from The Budget of the United States for Fiscal Year 1986.

reduction from all of the 1980s tax legislation at only $4 billion.

     Although the 1982 and 1984 tax bills eliminated essentially all of the

previously enacted reduction in corporate tax liabilities, some improvement in

the incentive to invest remained for most corporations. For example, 5—year

property has depreciation deductions and an investment tax credit with a

combined present value of 45.2 cents per dollar of investment under TEFRA

(with 4 percent inflation and a 7 percent real discount rate), down from

47.1 cents under ERTA but up from 43.5 cents under the pre-ERTA rules. The

decline in inflation was also important -in reducing the overall effective tax

rate. With a 10 percent inflation, the present value of the depreciation and

investment tax credits was 39.0 percent under pre-ERTA rules and 41.8 cents

under TEFRA rules. Thus, the shift from an environment with 10 percent

inflation and pre-ERTA rules to 4 percent inflation and TEFRA rules raised the

present value of depreciation and the investment tax credit from 39.0 cents to

45.2 cents with 1.7 cents of the increase due to the change -in tax rules and

the remaining 4.5 cents due to the fall in inflation. Finally, the reductions

-in personal tax rates and -in the artificial inflation tax on capital gains

reduced the personal part of the overall tax wedge between the pretax return

to corporate capital and the net return received by the providers of debt and

equity capital.

    Any analysis of the effects of these tax changes on investment must

recognize that other potentially important determinants of invest were also

changing during the same period. The economy slipped into two back-to-back

recessions beginning in the second quarter of 1980 from which it did not begin

to emerge until the final quarter of 1982. The tight monetary policy in 1981
                                         —5-


 and the sharp increase in projected structural deficits in the federal budget

caused an unprecedented rise in real interest rates that began in 1981.

 Investment in particular -industries and assets was substantially affected by

the dramatic surge in the U.S. merchandise trade deficit which sharply

reduced output -in particular industries even while the overall economy was

expanding. A surge of technical change in computers and related office

equipment boosted the demand for those products even among firms that were not

doing any investment to expand capacity.

     All of these changes mean that the research presented here must be

regarded as preliminary. Additional years of data will help to reduce the

remaining uncertainty, especially if the fall in real interest rates and in the

cost of equity capital continues. Disaggregated data can also help to resolve

questions about the special factors that raise or reduce investments in

particular industries and types of assets.

     The simplest and most direct interpretation of the evidence developed -in

the present paper is that net fixed nonresidential investment increased

substantially in the first half of the 1980s as a result of the improved tax

climate for investment that resulted from the 1981 tax legislation and from the

reduced rate of inflation. The ratio of net fixed nonresidential investment to

GNP rose from from 0.027 in the second half of the 1970s and 0.030 in 1980 to

0.037 in 1984 and 0.040 in the first three quarters of 1985. The

investment—GNP ratio for these two years was exceeded in only five years in

the preceding three decades (1965-69).

    The rise in investment is consistent with the implications of two

previously formulated simple models of investment behavior that were developed
and estimated in Feldstein (1982). The first model relates the ratio of net

investment to GNP to lagged values of the capacity utilization rate and of the

real net-of-tax return to the providers of debt and equity capital. In the

second model, the real net return is replaced by the rate of return over cost

(i.e., the difference between the maximum return that firms can afford to pay

to providers of debt and equity capital and the actual cost of funds). The

latter model also implies that the increase in investment in recent years

would have been significantly greater if the rise in the level of the real

interest rates had not substantially increased the cost of funds to corporate

borrowers.

     The estimation of two very different models of investment behavior

deserves an extra word of comment. As Feldstein (1982) pointed out, all

models are "false" in the sense that they involve substantial simplifications

that could in principle cause significant biases in the estimated

coefficients. The only way to draw reliable inferences is to make alternative

estimates that are likely to be subject to different biases. These different

estimates may involve different types of data (the biases -in time series

analysis are different from the biases in cross-section analysis) or different

models of specifications. If the different analyses have similar

implications, the conclusions can be held with greater confidence and we are

spared the difficult problem of choosing among false models. Fortunately,

that is the case in the current study.

    The econometric evidence presented -in sections 3 and 4 of this paper

incorporates data for 1979 through 1984 as well as revised data for earlier

years to reestimate the two models of investent behavior that were previously
                                      —7—


estimated with data through 1978 (Feldstein, 1962). The new estimates confirm

the previous findings, showing that the parameter estimates are quite stable

and robust to data revisions and to changes in the sample period.

     The present paper also estimates several modifications of these two basic

investment models. The first alternative replaces the return net of all taxes

with the return net of only those taxes collected at the corporate level. This

return net of corporate taxes measures the return available to pension funds

and other tax exempt shareholders. It is also plausibly a better determinant

of investment behavior because changes in taxes at the level of the portfolio

investor affect the net return to alternative investments in a comparable way.

The statistical evidence shows that this model explains past variations in

investment about as well or perhaps slightly better than the original

net-of-all-taxes rate of return.

     Section 1 of the paper presents a brief discussion of the behavior of

investment during the past three decades with particular attention to the

period since 1979. Section 2 then provides summary data on the basic

determinants of investment, including variations in capacity utilization and

in the various rate of return and cost of funds variables. It also presents

an overview of the results and implications of the econometric estimates of

the basic investment models. The third section then discusses the net return

model in more detail and presents the estimated regression equations. Section

4 presents parallel evidence for the return over cost model. There is a brief

concluding section that points to several directions for additional research.

fixed investment to GNP. Table 1 presents averages of this ratio for five year

investment to net investment has been rising since the mid—1960s. Feldstein

(1983b) showed that capital consumption absorbed a growing share of gross

investment over this period for three reasons: the ratio of the capital stock

to GNP increased; the share of equipment in the capital stock rose (which

raises capital consumption because equipment depreciates more rapidly than

structures); and the nature of the equipment shifted to more rapidly

depreciating types of assets. These forces were powerful enough to maintain

gross investment at a constant share of GNP from the mid-1960s through the

late 1970s even though the net investment ratio declined by nearly one-third.

     Net investment is the economically important concept because it is net

investment that determines the growth of the nation's capital stock. From a

behavioral point of view, however, specifying investment behavior in terms of

net investment is clearly a simplification since it assumes that firms invest

only -in order to achieve a desired capital stock and ignores the special

character of investments made for modernization and cost reduction.7

     The data in Table 1 show that net nonresidential fixed investment has

averaged only 3.0 percent of GNP during the three decades from 1960 through

1984. The period began with investment at an even lower level of only about

2.5 percent of GNP, a condition that contributed to the Kennedy tax bill and

the introduction of the investment tax credit. Net investment rose to over 4

percent of GNP in the second half of the 1960's and then declined to 3.4



    7There is a substantial literature on replacement and modernization
investment. (See Feldstein and Rothchild (1974), Feldstein and Foot (1971), and
the work cited in those papers.) This specification of investment in terms of
achieving a desired net capital stock has, of course, been characteristic of
most modern econometric research on investment; see, for example, Jorgenson
(1963), Hall and Jorgenson (1967), Nickell (1968), Abel (1980,84), and Summers
(1981).
                                              -lo
percent of GNP in the first half of the 1970s and only 2.7 percent of 0LP in
the second half of the decade. In the lGSOs, investment was initially 3ut

ligtly above 3 percent of GNP, then decined during 1982 and 1983 to only

2.2   percent before ris ng    to 3 .7 percent ot GNF        in 1984 ann .0 penoet    ot 6NP

in 1985. At 4.0      percent   of   ON?,   :he 198f    level of   net investment was only

exceeded or equalled     in four other      years     during the past three   decades and

always    at a time when the level of capacity utilizatHon was substantially
higher than it was in 1985.
       The models estimated and discussed in this paper' relate the net
investment ratio to lagged capacity utilization and to alternative measures of

the profitability of investing in nonresidential fixed capital. As we noted

above, there are of course a great many other specific Factors that can

influence the rate of investment in any period. Bosworth (1984) has

emphasized that the growth of automobile leasing companies and rapid

technological progress in computers caused a rapid rise in both types of

investments in the 1980s and that when both of these are eliminated there is

no increase in gross investment relative to ONP.°

       Although this statistical fact is arithmetically correct, it is difficult

to know what economic importance it has. Just as there were special

exogenous reasons for a surge of investments in autos and computers in these

years, there were also reasons for unusually low rates of investment in

certain other industries. The early 1980s were characterized by an

unprecedented 70 percent rise in the real value of the dollar and a sharp



      88osworth' s  analysis must be done in terms of gross 1 nvestmert because the
Department   of   Commerce does not produce data on net investment in autos and in
computers.

 increase in real long-term interest rates to levels that had not been seen

for a half-century. The result was a lopsided recovery in which industries

exposed to international competition and interest sensitive industries

actually contracted while the economy as a whole was expanding. By the end of

1983, many of those industries had still not reached the level of output that

they had experienced five years earlier. Even at the end of 1984, thee were

still a number of industries producing at less than their 1978 levels of

output. For such industries, there was clearly far less reason to expand

capacity.

     More specifically, although real GNP rose 3.7 percent between 1979 and

1983, almost all of the increase was in the production of services. The

output of services rose $52.5 billion (in 1972 dollars) while the output of

goods rose only $10.9 billion and the output of structures actually fell by

$8.1 billion. Thus services rose 9.2 percent while the output of goods rose

only 1.6 percent. Since the services sector is less capital intensive than

the goods producing sector, this very substantial shift in the composition of

GNP would in itself tend to reduce the rate of investment.

     Similarly, although overall industrial production rose by 3.3 percent

during those years, production in the primary metals industries in December

1983 was 25 percent below the 1978 level. Production of iron and steel was 35

percent below the level in 1978. Production of fabricated metal products was

13 percent below its 1979 peak level and auto production was down 11 percent.

Others with less output in December 1983 than 5 years earlier included mining,

construction, apparel, consumer home goods, and agriculture. Of these, only

autos and consumer home goods had passed their 1978-79 output levels by the

end of 1984.

      In short, although unusual technical progress in the computer industry

may have stimulated aggregate investment in the first half of the 1980s, the

unusual character of the recovery caused by the unprecedented rise in the

dollar and in real long-term interest rates may have depressed overall

investment. The failure to extend the statistical models of investment

behavior to include variables that adequately measure these influences may

cause the resulting estimates of the rate of return variables to be biased.

The magnitude of the potential bias depends on the relative importance for

investment of the omitted factors and the extent to which the they are

correlated with the rate of return variables. A priori, it is not possible to

determine whether the net effect of omitting both types of variables is to

overstate or understate the effect of the rate of return variable. Bosworth's

(1985) procedure of excluding the computer investments of the last few years

without making a parallel adjustment for the adverse effects of the unbalanced

recovery is clearly misleading and inappropriate. Its net effect is to

understate any positive effect on investment of the recent changes in tax

rules and the increase in net profitability.



2.   AN OVERVIEW OF THE RESULTS


     The next two sections of this paper and the appendix will describe the

data and econometric estimates 'in detail. Before turning to that analysis,

the current section provides an overview of the results.

     Five-year averages for the past three decades are presented for each of

the alternative measures of net return as well as for capacity utilization
                                       —13—


 and for the investment-GNP ratio. Annual data are also presented for the

 years 1979 through 1985. Inspection of these data show the empirical

 relationships that the regression equations subsequently estimate with annual

observations.

     We also combine these data with the regression coefficients estimated later

 in the paper to answer three questions: (1) How well do the regression

coefficients estimated on the basis of data for the past three decades explain

the behavior of investment in the 1980s? (2) More specifically, how has the

change in tax rules affected the rate of investment? (3) How would prospective

investment be affected by the tax changes implied by the Administration's May

1985 plan and by the tax bill that passed the House of Representatives in

December 1985?

     The analysis begins with the net return models and then examines the

return over cost models.



2.1 Investment and the Net Rate of Return

     The basic data summarizing the relation between net investment and the

net rate of return on corporate sector capital are presented in Table 2.

Column 1 repeats the investment-GNp ratios previously shown in Table 1.    The

second column presents the capacity utilization rate, a fundamental

determinant of fluctuations in investment.9 Since studies generally indicate


    9The variable in column 2 is the Federal Reserve Board's measure of the
capacity utilization rate in manufacturing industry. The more general Total
Industry capacity utilization rate would in principle be a better variable for
the present purpose but was never constructed for the years before 1967.
Feldstein (1982) showed that additional variables measuring fluctuations in
demand (e.g., past changes in sales, available retained earnings or cashf low,
or the rate of unemployment) do not increase the explanatory power of
investment equations of the type studied here when the manufacturing capacity
utilization rate is already included. Similar evidence for the more recent
sample is presented below.

a lag that peaks at 12 to 18 months between changes in the determinants of

investment and subsequent changes -in investment, the capacity utilization

variable and the other variables in Table 2 are shown with a one year lag; thus

capacity utilization for 1955-59 actually refers to the average capacity

utilization rate in the period 1954-58. It is clear that periods of high

capacity utilization tended to be periods of high net investment. But even

with the one year lag there -is a problem of simultaneity in interpreting this

association; anything that raises the investment-GNP ratio during a period of

several years will also raise the capacity utilization rate during that

period. This causes the estimated investment equations to understate the

importance of profitability and tax variables relative to capacity

utilization.

     The starting point for calculating the net of tax rate of return variable

is the pretax return on nonfinancial corporate capital. We construct this as

the ratio of profits (with economic depreciation and an inventory evaluation

adjustment) before all state and local taxes plus net interest payments to the

value of the corresponding corporate capital stock at replacement cost.'°

     To obtain the net rate of return (RN), we subtract from this the ratio of

the taxes paid by the corporations, their shareholders and their creditors to

the capital stock. The calculation of the tax liabilities of shareholders and



   100ur calculation of the pretax return to capital follows the basic procedure
of Feldstein, Poterba and Dicks-Mireaux (1983), but several improvements have
been made. More details are presented in Appendix A.

creditors takes into account the distribution of debt and equity income among

different types of taxpayers (individuals by income class, pensions and other

tax exempt institutions, insurance companies, banks, etc.); details of the

calculation are presented in appendix A.

     A high value of the net return on nonfinancial corporate capital should

make this type of investment more attractive relative to other uses of funds

like owner—occupied housing, government debt, real estate partnerships, ard

overseas investment. A comparison of columns 4 and 1 shows that there has been

a strong association between the variations in this net return and the

concurrent variations in the investment GNP ratio. The net return was highest

in the second half of the 1960s (6.0 percent) when the investment GNP ratio was

highest and lowest in the second half of the 1970s (2.8 percent) when the

investment—GNP ratio was lowest. During the first half of the 1980s, the

annual values of RN rose to a quite strong 5.4 percent, roughly paralleling

the rise in the investment-GNP ratio.11

     The fluctuations in the net rate of return reflect not only tax rules but

also movements in pretax profitability over the business cycle and more

generally. Column 6 presents a cyclically adjusted net rate of return (RNA)

obtained by multiplying one minus the effective tax rate by a cyclically—adjusted

pretax return calculated by regressing the pretax return on the rate of

capacity utilization and then evaluating the return that would prevail at a

constant capacity utilization rate. For the five year periods, there is




   11Recall that all variables -in columns 2 through 9 refer to one year
earlier; thus the real net return reached 0.054 in 1984.
                                      -16-


little difference between the cyclically adjusted returns of column 6 and the

unadjusted returns of column 4 although cyclical adjustment does lower the

1965-69 return and raise the 1980—84 return. Cyclical adjustment is more

important with the annual data and shows that the cyclically adjusted net

return rose steadily from 2.1 percent for 1981 to 5.6 percent for 1985. The

important implication of these figures is that they indicate that the close

association between the investment-GNP ratio and the real net rate of return

do not merely reflect cyclical fluctuations in profitability but are based on

changes in effective tax rates and persistent changes in pretax

profitability.

     Column 5 presents an alternative measure of net profitability that

subtracts only those taxes paid by corporations to the federal government and

to state and local governments. We label the resulting variable RNC to denote

that it is the return net of corporate taxes. Taxes paid by individuals and

other portfolio investors are ignored. There are two possible reasons for

preferring this RNC variable to the return net of all taxes (RN). First, for

a very important class of investors, including pension funds and foreign

investors, only the corporate tax is relevant. The return after corporate

taxes governs the net return that they can earn as portfolio investors and

therefore their willingness to direct their assets into nonfinancial corporate

capital. Second, for taxable individual investors, the changes in personal

tax rates that affect the ultimate net return on corporate capital (RN) also

affect the net return on competing investments. The link is not complete

because the RN variable reflects the specific ownership of debt and equity

securities, the taxation of real and nominal capital gains, and other features
                                        —17--



that are specific to the return on nonfinancial corporate capital. But

fluctuations in RN induced by the changes in taxes paid by shareholders and

creditors probably exaggerates the changes in the relative desirability of

investing in nonfinancial corporate capital.

     The variations in the real return net of corporate taxes (RNC) generally

parallel the shifts in the real return net of all taxes (RN) with the highest

value in the second half of the 1960s (RNC =    0.077) and the lowest values in
the first have of the 1980s (RNC =   0.045).    The difference between the two

measures does vary from time to time, depending on the tax rules for

individuals and the rate of inflation. From 1955 through 1969, personal taxes

and other taxes paid by portfolio investors (including banks and insurance

companies) took approximately 24 percent of the return after corporate taxes

(i.e., the final net return RN was 76 percent of the the return net of

corporate taxes RNC) but this rose to 33 percent in the first half of the

1970s and 42 percent in the second half of the 1970s as inflation created high

levels of artificial nominal interest income and nominal capital gains that

were taxed to portfolio investers. By 1984, the combination of personal tax

changes and reduced inflation lowered the effective tax on portfolio investors

to about 23 percent of the return after corporate taxes.

     A cyclically adjusted net return after corporate taxes (RNCA) is shown in

column 7. The five year averages of this measure show greater stability than

the other measures of net return in columns 4 through 6. Nevertheless, the

period 1965-69 continues to stand out as a time when the net return was high

and the period from 1975 through the early 1980s remains a period of low net

profitability. This measure also shows a sharp rise in net real return from
                                       —18--



4.0 percent for 1981 to 7.1 percent for 1985 (i.e., 4.0 percent in 1980 and

7.1 percent in 1984. Although this increase is not as great as the rise -in

the full net return (RNA), there was clearly a very substantial rise in net

profitability in these years that did not reflect either cyclical fluctuations

in pretax profitability or changes in personal tax rates.


2.1.1 Estimated Effects of Changes in the Net Return

       Section 3 presents estimated equations relating the investment-GNP

ratio to the capacity utilization rate and to each of these four measures of

the net return. That analysis confirms that there is a strong and

statistically significant relationship between investment and the net return

in the previous year. The current estimates for the sample period 1954-84

(and for subperiods within these three decades) are very similar to the

results obtained in Feldstein (1982) with data for 1954 though 1978. The

similarity of the coefficient estimates persists even though there was a major

revision of the national income accounts in 1980 that changed much of the

earlier data and despite a number of small improvements -in the method that we

have used to calculate the net rate of return variables. The earlier analysis

did not consider the return net of corporate tax variables (RNC and RNCA) but

these are now found to explain variations in the investment ratio as well as

or better than the full net return variables (RN and RNA).

    A typical example of the estimated equations implies that each percentage

point increase in the real net rate of return increases the investment—GNP

ratio by about 0.4 percentage points. The actual equation relates the

investment—GNP ratio to the net rate of return (RN) in the immediate past year
                                      —19--



and to the capacity utilization rate (UCAP) in that same past year. When this

equation is estimated with data for 1954 through 1984, the coefficient of the

net return variable is 0.41 (with a standard error of 0.12). That same

equation implies that each percentage point increase in capacity utilization

raises the investment-GNP ratio by about 0.02 percentage points.

     Although these coefficients can only approximate an average relationship

over the thirty year sample period, it is interesting to see how well they

explain major shifts in the investment ratio between particular dates.

Consider first the sharp fall in investment between the high of 4.2 percent of

GNP in the 1965-69 period and the 2.7 percent of GNP a decade later, a decline

of 1.5 percent of GNP. Between these same periods the net return fell from

6.0 percent to 2.8 percent. This 3.2 percentage point decline and the

estimated coefficient of 0.4 imply a fall of 1.3 percentage points in the

investment-GNP ratio. The concurrent 8 percentage point decline -in capacity

utilization (from 88.0 percent in 1965—69 to 79.6 percent in 1975-79) and the

estimated coefficient of 0.02 imply a fall of 0.2 percentage points in the

investment-GNP ratio. Thus together the decline in the net return and in

capacity utilization imply a fall of 1.5 percentage points in the

investment-GNP ratio, exactly what was observed. More than 85 percent of this

fall was attributable to the decline in the net return.

     Of course, not all movements in investment can be explained as

satisfactorily by the simple models used here. For example, investment rose

between the early 1960s and the early 1970s even though the equation would

have predicted a decline of 0.2 percent in the investment-GNP ratio. What

matters for the purpose of this study is not the ability to provide a perfect

explanation of year to year variations of investments (although       =   0.60
 indicates a quite good explanation of the volatile investment GNP ratio

w-ithout the use of long distributed lags or lagged dependent variables) but

 the ability to measure the impact of tax changes on the level of investment.

     The predictions of the simple net return model also fit well with the

experience of the 1980s. The investment-GNP ratio rose from 3.3 percent in the

years 1979-81 to 3.9 percent in 1984-85. The corresponding (lagged) measures

of the real net return rose from 2.6 percent to 4.8 percent, implying a 0.9

percentage point rise in the investment—GNP ratio while the five percentage

point decline in capacity utilization implies a 0.1 percentage point fall in

the investment-GNP ratio. Thus the equation predicts a 0.8 percentage point

increase in the investment-GNP ratio while the actua' investment ratio

increased 0.6 percentage points. In short, investment increased slightly less

than predicted on the basis of the stronger investment incentive as measured in

this way.12

     It is interesting to decompose the effect of the change in the net return

during these years -into the effect of the change in tax rules and the effect

of the change in the pretax rate of return. The effective tax rate declined

from 69.0 percent in the years 1978-80 (i.e. the years relevant for investment

in 1979—81) to 47.0 percent in years 1983—84. The pretax rate of return rose

from 8.2 percent for the early years to 9.0 percent for the later years.     If

the tax rate had remained at the 1978-80 value while the pretax return rose,

the net of tax return (RN) would have increased by 0.25 percentage points.




   12Note that comparing 1985 with 1979-81 shows a similar result. The
investment-GNP ratio rose 0.8 percentage points while the equation predicts a
rise of 1.0 percentage points.
                                      —21—


The implied increase in the investment-GNP ratio would then be 0.1 percentage

points. In contrast, if the pretax return had remained at 8.2 percent while

the effective tax rate fell from 69.0 percent to 47.0 percent, the after—tax

return would have increased by 1.8 percentage points. The implied increase in

the investment would be 0.7 percentage points. Thus the fall in the effective

tax rate was about seven times as important in stimulating a rise in

investment as the increase in the pretax rate of return. The capacity

utilization rate actually fell slightly during this period, decreasing by just

about enough (5.3 percentage points) to offset the rise in the pretax rate of

return.13 The decline in the effective tax rate is thus responsible for all of

the predicted rise in investment.

     Of the initial 69.0 percent effective tax rate, 30.6 percentage points

was the federal corporate tax rate, 15.8 percentage points were state and

local profits and property taxes paid by corporations, and 22.6 percentage

points were federal and state income taxes paid by the individuals and other

providers of debt and equity capital. By 1983-84, these percentages had

declined to 17.0 percent, 14.0 percent and 16.0 percent. These figures imply

that the taxes paid by the corporations to the federal, state and local

governments fell from 46.4 percent of the real pretax return to 31.0 percent

of that return, a decline of one third in the effective tax rate at the

corporate level. The taxes paid by portfolio investors were initially 22.6

percent of the pretax return or 42.2 percent of the return that remained after




    131he 5.3 percentage point decline and the estimated investment sensitivity
of 0.02 together imply a decline of 0.1 percentage points in the investment-GNP
ratio.
                                       —22--



 the taxes paid by corporations. By 1983-84, this declined to 16.0 percent of

 the pretax return or 23.2 percent of the return that remained after the taxes

paid by the corporations, a decline of nearly one half.

     To calculate what these effective tax rate declines contributed to the

predicted rise in the investment—GNp ratio, we assume that the initial

8.2 percent pretax return remains fixed for all years. As we already noted,

the decline in the overall effective tax rate implied a 1.8 percentage point

rise in the real after-tax return and therefore a 0.7 percentage point increase

in the investment-GNP ratio. Slightly less than two-thirds of this was

accounted for by the decline in the effective federal corporate tax rate: the

13.6 percentage point decline in that effective tax rate represented a

1.1 percentage point rise -in the real after-tax return and therefore an

investment-GNP rise of 0.45 percentage. points.

     The model also provides a basis for making a very rough calculation of

how investment would respond to future changes in tax rules like those

proposed by the Administration in May 1985 or the ones enacted by the House -in

December 1985. The Adm-inistrations proposal would raise corporate tax

liabilities by approximately 25 percent while cutting personal taxes by about

7 percent. It is difficult to translate the personal tax changes into a

change in the effective tax rate on the interest, dividends and capital gains

arising from the earnings of nonfinancial corporations. Much of the interest

and dividend income is received by pension funds and others that are not

currently taxed and that would not be affected by the change in personal tax

rates. Although the maximum marginal tax rate on interest and dividends

received by individuals would be reduced from 50 percent to 35 percent, much
                                     —23--



of the overall reduction in personal taxes would take the form of an increase

in the personal exemption that left the tax rate on capital income unchanged.

In addition, special provisions would limit the use of 401k saving plans and

would impose heavier taxes on financial institutions. Fortunately, the

calculation -is ot very sensitive to alternative assumptions about the change

in the effective tax on individuals and other portfolio investors.

     For the purpose of this calculation, we assume that the pretax rate of

return and the rate of capacity utilization would remain unchanged. Federal

corporate taxes in 1964 took 16.6 percent of the total real pretax return on

nonfinancial corporate capital. A 25 percent increase in federal corporate

liabilities would raise this to 20.6 percent. The combined federal, state and

local taxes paid by the corporations would rise from 29.6 percent to 33.8

percent of pretax capital income. The return net of corporate taxes would

therefore Fall from 70.4 percent of pretax income to 66.2 percent. Taxes on

individuals and other portfolio investors in 1984 took 21.7 percent of the net

capital income after corporate taxes. If this fraction remained unchanged, the

effect oF the modified corporate tax rates would be to reduce the final net

share of pretax capital income received by portfolio investors from

55.1 percent (that is, 76.3 percent of 70.4 percent) to 51.8 percent (i.e.,

78.3 percent of 66.2 percent.)

     If the pretax rate of return is unchanged, the after tax rate of return

(RN) would fall From the 5.4 percent observed in 1984 to 5.1 percent. Since

each percentage point decline in the real net return causes a 0.4 percentage

point decline in the investment—GNP ratio, this projected decline in the net

return (from 5.4 percent to 5.1 percent) would reduce the investment GNP ratio
                                        -24-


by about 0.12 percentage points. This represents about 3 percent of the

investment level in 1984—85 and about   one-fifth   of the -increase -in investment

between 1979—81 and 1984-85.

     A 5 percent increase or decrease in the tax pa-id by individual and

institutional portfolio -investors would alter this change in investment by

about one-fifth of its value. Thus an average decline of 5 percent in the

effective tax on portfolio investors (from 21.7 percent of the

after corporate tax return to 20.6 percent) would imply that the decline in the

-investment--GNP ratio would be about 2.4 percent oF the 1984-85 level or

one—sixth of the increase since 1979—81. Conversely, a rise of 5 percent in

the effective tax rate on portfolio investors (from 21.7 percent of the after

corporate tax return to 22.8 percent) would imply that the decline in the

investment-GNP ratio would be about 3.6 percent of the 1984-85 level or

one—fourth of the increase since 1979-81.

     The bill passed by the House of Representatives in December 1985 would

depress investment by substantially more than the Administration proposal..

A critical difference between the two plans is that the Administration plan

calls for full indexing o-f the base for depreciation while the House version

would index the depreciation base only to the extent of half of the inflation

-in excess of 5 percent. At a 5 percent inflation rate, indexing raises the

present value of depreciation allowances in the Administration's plan by

15 percent for most types of equipment (the class 4 assets under the

Administration's plan). At a 10 percent inflation rate, fully indexed

depreciation would have a present value 22 percent higher than the

"half indexed over 5 percent" depreciation provided by the House bill.
                                         —25 -



        The difference in indexing rules is even more important for structures.

At a 5 percent inflation rate, indexing raises the present value of

depreciation allowances for most structures by 60 percent. At a 10 percent

inflation rate, the fully indexed depreciation would have a present value that

is 84 percent higher than the half indexed over 5 percent depreciation

provided by the House bill.

        The House bill is also more harmful to investment in a variety of other

ways.     It would depreciate the typical equipment investment over 10 years

instead of the 7 years provided by the Administration, although at

double-declining balance rate instead of the approximately 1.5 times declining

balance rate prescribed in the Administration plan. The House also enacted a

slightly higher corporate tax rate than the Administration proposed.

        Because of the lack of indexing and the difference in the timing of

depreciation, the House bill eventually raises corporate taxes by much more

than the Administration bill. Although both bills would raise corporate taxes

by about 25 percent in 1987 and 1988, by 1990 the Administration bill would

increase the corporate tax by 23 percent and the House would increase it by 37

percent. Under the House bill, corporate taxes would rise by about 50 percent

in the first half of the 1990s, twice the increase that we have assumed in

evaluating the potential impact of the Administration plan.

    To evaluate the impact on investment, we again assume that the pretax

rate of return and the rate of capacity utilization are unaffected. Since

federal corporate taxes in 1984 took 16.6 percent of the total real pretax

return on nonfinancial corporate capital, the 50 percent increase implied by

the House bill would raise that to 249 percent. The combined federal, state
                                     -26-



and local taxes pa-id by the corporations would rise from 29.6 percent to 37.9

percent. Taxes on individuals and other portfolio investors in 1984 took

21.7 percent of the net capital income after all corporate taxes. If this

fraction remained unchanged, the effect of the House plan would be to reduce

the final net share of real pretax capital income received by portfolio

investors from 55.1 percent (that is 78.3 percent of 70.4 percent) to 48.6

percent (78.3 percent of 62.1 percent).

     With the pretax return unchanged at 9.9 percent, the after tax return

(RN) would fall from the 5.4 percent actual value in 1984 to 4.8 percent. This

projected decline would reduce the investment-GNP ratio by 0.24 percent or

twice the decline implied by the Administration bill. This represents about

6 percent of the investment level in 1984-85 and about 40 percent of the

increase in the investment-GNP ratio between 1979—81 and 1984—85.


2.1.2 The Return Net of Corporate Taxes

       These particular numerical conclusions depend on the specification of the

net return after all taxes as the key determinant of the investment-GNP ratio.

The alternative equation relating net investment to the return after corporate

taxes (RNC) implies a somewhat larger effect of the Administration's proposed

tax changes. Section 3 shows that estimates of the RNC equation imply that

each percentage point change in the net return at the corporate level shifts

the investment—cNP ratio by 0.45 percentage points. More important than the

slight increase in this coefficient is the fact that the change in the net

return at the corporate level is not diluted by subsequent portfolio

taxation.
                                        —27—


     Consider the implications of this specification for the change in

effective tax rates and investment between 1979-81 and 1984-85. The effective

tax rate at the corporate level fell from 46.4 percent of the 8.2 percent

pretax return to 31.0 percent of the 9.0 percent pretax return. The return net

of the corporate tax thus rose from 4.4 percent to 6.2 percent. Multiplying

the 1.8 percentage point rise by the 0.45 investment sensitivity figure

implies a rise in the investment-GNP ratio of 0.8 percentage points. Since

the decline in the capacity utilization rate implied a 0.1 percentage point

fall in the investment-GNP ratio and the actual investment-GNP ratio rose

0.6 percentage points, the rise in the net return after the corporate tax

explains the actual movement in the investment-GNP ratio quite well.

     To isolate the impact of the change in tax rates, note that if the pretax

return had remained constant at 8.2 percent, the decline in the effective tax

rate at the corporate level would have raised the return net of corporate

taxes by 1.2 percentage points and therefore increased the investment—GNP

ratio by 0.54 percentage points, almost the entire observed rise.

     The estimated sensitivity of the investment-GNP ratio to the return net

of the corporate tax implies that a relatively modest increase in the

effective corporate tax rate would have a substantial impact on the investment

—GNP ratio. Thus a fall in the return net of corporate taxes from 70.4

percent of pretax income to 66.2 percent (as implied by the Administration's

tax proposal) would reduce the 1984 value of the return net of corporate taxes

from 7.0 percent (RNC =   0.070) to 6.5 percent. This 0.5 percent fall in the
net rate of profit would translate into a 0.22 percentage point decline in the

investment-GNP ratio. This is a decline of nearly 6 percent of the 1984-85
                                        -28—


 investment-GNP ratio and more than one third of the rise in the investment GNP

ratio from the level of 1979-81.

     The fall in the return net of corporate taxes from 70.4 percent to

62.1 percent, as implied by the House bill, would reduce the 1984 value of the

return net of all corporate taxes from 7.0 percent to 6.1 percent. This

0.9 percent fall in the net rate of profit would translate into a 0.41

percentage point decline in the investment-GNP ratio. This is a decline of

11 percent of the 1984-85 irivestment-GNP ratio and three-quarters of the rise

in the investment-GNP ratio of 1979-81.


2.1.3 Relative Rates of Return

       Increases in the real net return on corporate capital raise the

investment-GNP ratio by attracting funds away from alternative uses. This

suggests that the behavior of investment might be better explained and

predicted if the statistical model explicitly included the real return on

alternative assets as well as the return on investments in nonfinancial

corporate capital. The problem with doing this in practice is that there are a

wide range of alternatives to investment in corporate capital including

government debt, real estate, oil drilling and other natural resource

investments, overseas investments, owner-occupied housing, consumer durables

and other forms of consumer spending.

    Moreover, as the experience of the early 1980s dramatically

demonstrated, a substantial amount of U.S. investment can be financed by an

inflow of capital from the rest of the world. The U.S. current account deficit

in 1984 was $101 billion or 2.8 percent of GNP, implying that the capital
inflow was equivalent to approximately two-thirds of all net fixed

nonresidential investment. By contrast, the United States had a current account

surplus in 1980 and invested more abroad than foreigners invested in the United

States.

     The present paper makes a first step in analyzing the sensitivity of

investment to other rates of return by explicitly including the real net

return on government bonds. For this purpose, we measure the nominal return

on government bonds by the yield on 5-years Treasury bonds and calculate the

real interest rate by subtracting an estimate of the expected rate of

increase of the GNP deflator during the same five year period.14 The

difference between the real cyclically-adjusted net return to corporations

(RNCA) and the real interest rate is presented in column 9. For the real

return on corporate capital net of all taxes (RNA), the analagous comparison

is to the real net—of--tax interest rate, i.e., the net of tax nominal interest

rate minus the expected rate of inflation. For this purpose, we use the same

effective tax rate on nominal interest income that is used for the interest

component of the portfolio income generated by the nonfinancial corporate

capital. This is a weighted average of the marginal tax rates of individuals

in different tax brackets and of different types of taxable and nontaxable

financial institutions.15 The difference between the real net return




   14The projected increases in inflation are taken from Feldstein (1986)
and are only available from 1960.The projected increases in inflation were
calculated by estimating a first-order autoregressive moving average process,
using it to project annual inflation for ten future years, and then taking an
average of those inflation rates.

   15This series of effective tax rates on interest income is presented in
appendix table A-3.
                                        -30-


 on corporate capital and the real net interest rate is shown in column 8 of

 Table 2.

      It is clear that neither measure of the relative return on corporate

 capital has moved closely with the variations in the investment-GNp ratio.

 Both measures showed the greatest differential in favor of corporate cap-i tal

 in the 1975-79 period when the investment GNP level was actually very low.

 This occurred because the very high level of actual and expected inflation

 during these years caused the real return on treasury bonds to drop to only

one percent and the real net-of-tax return on those bonds to become negative.

Moreover, the investment-GNp ratio rose significantly in the 1980s even though

the differential between the return to corporate capital and to government

bonds declined because of the rise -in the real return on government bonds.

     These observations indicate that the yield differential between corporate

capital and government bonds -is not a good measure of the attractiveness of

corporate investment. As we noted above, investors face a wide range of

alternative investments. Moreover, whatever the yield on Treasury bonds, they

can only displace saving to the extent that the government deficit increases

the stock of bonds. And the recent experience shows that a combination of

high yields on government bonds and on corporate capital can at least

temporarily attract substantial funds from the rest of the world. Until a far

more complete model of the alternative to corporate capital investment is

implemented, it seems better to focus on the real net return to corporate

capital rather than on a differential rate of return.

2.2 Investment and the Rate of Return over Cost

     The analysis relating investment to the net rate of return is the

simplest possible model of investment behavior. The economy is treated like a

black box in which the mechanism is obscure but which produces the plausible

result that more capital flows into nonfinancial corporate capital when the

rate of return on that type of asset is high.16

     We now turn to a more explicit model of investment behavior in which

corporate demand to invest reflects the difference between the profitability

of new additions to the stock of plant and equipment and the cost of funds

with which to finance that investment. This approach, labelled the return

over cost model of investment, differs from the previous analysis in two

fundamental ways. First, the investment decision is explicitly made by the

corporation. Second, the decision reflects a comparison of the cost of funds

and the prospective yield on new marginal investments rather than the yield on

existing capital.

     The return over cost model is the empirical implementation in a world of

taxes and mixed debt-equity finance of the simple textbook model in which the

rate of investment depends on the rate of interest and the marginal efficiency

of investment. To make that operational, the location of the investment

demand schedule is represented by the rate of return that the firm can afford

to pay for funds used to finance a "typical't project. This return, which we

label the maximum potential net return",17 is analogous to the internal rate of



   160n the case for studying such a simple model and for examining several
alternate models rather than looking for the "true" model, see Feldstein (1982).

   17The maximum potential net return was introduced in Feldstein and Summers
(1978) and used in Feldstein (1982) to explain investment behavior. A more
formal description of the maximum potential net return is presented in
section 4.

return of a project in an economy without taxes. Changes -in   tax   rules,

inflation and pretax profitability all alter the maximum potential net return

and therefore the incentive to invest.

     More specifically, the real maximum net return is the maximum real return

that a corporation can pay to the providers of debt and equity capital on a

project that consists of both equipment and structures in a ratio that matches

the equipment-structure ratio of the nonfinancial corporate capital stock.

Two sets of calculations are presented: in one the pretax real rate of return

is fixed at 10.3 percent, the average pretax return during the period 1961 to

1984. In the other, the calculation assumes that the pretax return varies from

year to year and is equal to the then current ex post return on nonfinancial

corporate capital.

     The calculations described in more detail in section 4 show that     ,   for
example, with a pretax return of 10.3 percent, the tax rules of 1984 and an

expected inflation rate of 5.5 percent, the maximum potential real net return

that the firm could pay to the providers of capital would be 7.3 percent. The

maximum potential net return measure is "net" in the sense that it represents

the net cost that the firm can afford to pay after taking the tax deduction

for interest expenses. In 1984, the nominal interest rate on high grade

corporate debt was 12.3 percent, implying that the net-of-tax cost of debt was

6.6 percent and the real net cost of debt was 1.1 percent. The required real

return on equity capital (i.e., the ratio of economic earnings to the share

price) was however 8.4 percent. We assume that firms are forced by risk

considerations to use a mixture of two-thirds equity and one-third debt

(approximately the average ratio during the sample period) to finance their
                                            —33


investments. The weighted average real net cost of funds in 1984 was

therefore 0.33 (1.1) +   0.67   (8.4) =   6.0 percent.18
     Table 3 presents summary data on the maximum potential real net return

(MPRNR) and the real net cost of funds (RCOF). For reference, the

investment-GNP ratio is presented in column 1 and the capacity utilization

rate in column 2. Column 3 shows that the changes in tax rules raised the

MPRNR between the early 1960s and the second half of that decade and that the

1981—82 changes in tax rules and the sharp fall in inflation have caused a

very substantial increase in the MPRNR since 1980.

     Column 4 shows the effect of dropping the assumption of constant pretax

profitability and assuming instead that firms adjust their projected future

pretax profitability in proportion to the annual variations in observed

pretax profitability. This calculation, which obviously exaggerates the extent

to which firms react to year—to—year variations in profits, shows a much

stronger increase in the MPNR in the second half of the 1960s but much lower

values in the 1980s.

     The real net cost of funds is shows in column 5 and the difference between

the maximum potential return and the cost of funds in columns 6 and 7. The real

cost of funds was relatively high in the late 1960s, was high again in the

late 1970s (when the high cost of equity outweighed the very low cost of debt)

and rose again in the 1980s because of the combination of high real interest




   18Note that the maximum potential net return that a firm can afford to pay
is independent of its debt-equity ratio. In contrast, the returns that the
firm can afford to pay on debt and equity capital separately depends very much
on the debt-equity mix.
                                       -34-


rates, low inflation and relatively high equity costs.

     Although the effect of the variations in the real cost of funds has been

to leave the five-year average difference between the maximum potential return

and the cost of funds almost constant, the individual annual values show

substantial variation. Column 6 shows that the difference (MPRNR-RCOF) rose

from 0.7 percent for 1979 to 2.9 percent for 1984, implying a substantial

increase in the incentive to invest.


2.2.1 Estimated Effects of Changes in the Return over Cost

       The regression equations presented in section 4 relate the investment-GNP

ratio to the rate of return over cost (MPRNRCOF) in the immediate previous

year and to the capacity utilization rate in that year. The estimated

coefficient of the rate of return over cost variable implies that each one

percentage point increase in that differential raises the investment-GNP ratio

by 0.3 percentage points. The estimated equation also implies that each

percentage point increase in capacity utilization raises the investment—GNP

ratio by 0.09 percentage points.

     Although these values cannot be expected to explain each short-run

fluctuation in the investment-GNP ratio, it is interesting to see what their

implications are for the recent shifts in tax policy and in the cost of funds

and to speculate about the likely effects of future changes in tax rules. The

rate of return over cost relevant for 1979-81 averaged 0.009 for and rose to

0.021 for 1984-85. The rise of 0.012 implies an increase in the investment-GNP

ratio of 0.36 percent, thereby accounting for 60 percent of the observed rise

in the investment-GNP ratio between the 3.3 percent average for 1979-81 and
                                       —35--



 the 3.9 percent average for 1984-85. However, the fall in capacity

 utilization between these two same dates (from 0.827 for 1979—81 to 0.774 for

 1984-85) outweighed the improvement in the rate of return over cost and,

according to the statistically estimated equation, implied that the

investment-GNP ratio should have declined over the period. One possible

reason for this forecast error is that businesses in 1979 and 1980 recognized

that the high level of capacity utilization at that time was transitory

because the shift toward a tight monetary policy that began in October 1979

would inevitably bring about a substantial recession.

     The experience for the 1980s as a whole also shows the offsetting effects

of an improved tax environment and the increasing cost of funds. The maximum

potential real net return rose from 6.0 percent for 1979—81 (i.e., in 1978-80)

to 7.3 percent for 1985; the increase of 1.3 percentage points implies an

increase in the investment—GNP ratio of 0.4 percentage points. But during

these same years, the real cost of funds rose from 5.1 percent to 6.0 percent,

offsetting two-thirds of the increased incentive to invest. It is interestiRg

to note that the cost of equity funds was the same for 1985 as it had been for

1979-81, implying that the entire increase -in the cost of funds was due to the

rise in the cost of debt (from a real 3.4 percent for 1979-81 to 6.0 percent

for 1985). To the extent that the increase -in the deficit in the federal

budget was responsible for this rise in the rate of interest, it had the

effect of offsetting a large part of the increased incentive to invest that

resulted from the change in tax rules and the reduction in inflation.19



   19The evidence in Feldstein (1986) indicates that the rise in anticipated
budget deficits was the primary reason for the increase in real medium-term
interest rates between 1979—81 and 1984. In particular, there is no evidence
that the increase in the MPRNR raised interest rates.
                                      -36—


     The relation between the investment-GNP ratio and the rate of return over

cost gives some hnt of how future fiscal policies might affect the future

investment level. According to the estimates in Feldstein (1986), a decline

of the projected budget deficit from the 4 percent of GNP prevailing in 1984

to 1 percent of GNP would reduce the real interest rate by approximately 3

percentage paints (and therefore back to its historic norm). This in turn

would lower the cost of capital by 1 percentage point if it left the cost of

equ-ity capital unchanged and by 3 percentage points if the returns on debt and

equity declined by equal amounts. The estimated relation between the

investment—GNP ratio and the rate of return over cost implies that this fall

in the cost of captal would raise the investment-GNP ratio by between 0.3

percentage points and 0.9 percentage points, an increase equal to between

10 percent and 30 percent of the average investment-GNP ratio of the past

quarter century.

     The changes in the tax law that the Administration proposed in May 1985

would reduce the MPRNR by only about 0.2 percentage points at the 1984 rate of

inflation, from 7.3 percent to 7.1 percent. This decline reflects a sharper

decline for equipment and an actual increase for structures. This decline in

the rate of return over cost (assuming that the real cost of funds remained

unchanged) would reduce the investment-GNP ratio by only about 0.06 percentage

points or about 2 percent of the investment—GNP level in 1984-85. The

MPNR-COF framework thus implies only about half of the reduction in the

overall investment-GNP ratio in response to the Administration's bill as the

reduction implied by the RN and RNC calculations. In considering this

relatively small total reduction, it should be recalled that the fall in the
                                       —37--



 MPNR for equipment is much more substantial so that the composition of the

 overall investment would change in the direction of structures and away from

 equipment. The magnitude of this shift will be examined in a later paper

 using the MPNR data disaggregated into structures and equipment.

      In contrast to the small effect of the President's plan on aggregate

 investment, the House bill implies that the MPRNR for 1984 would fall from

7.3 percent to 5.9 percent. If the cost of funds remained unchanged, the

resulting 1.4 percentage point decline in the rate of return over cost would

reduce the investment—GNP ratio by approximately 0.42 percentage points. This

decline is seven times larger than the decline implied by the Administration's

plan. The fall in the investment-GNP ratio would be approximately 11 percent

of the 1984-85 level of that ratio and three quarters of the rise in the

investment-GNP ratio from 1979-81 to 1984-85. This agrees almost exactly with

the decline in the investment-GNP ratio implied by the model that relates that

investment ratio to the rate of return net of taxes at the corporate level.


3.       NET RETURN AND THE RATE OF INyT:TATIcALEpç

     This section presents the estimated equations relating the investment-GNP

ratio to the net rate of return on the capital of nonfinancial corporations.

Appendix A describes the calculation of the pretax rate of return on that

capital and of the tax rates paid by the corporations and by the portfolio

investors that provide debt and equity capital. The Appendix also presents

the annual time series of the basic regression variables (that were summarized

in Table 2 above) and of the components of the tax rate.

     Equation (3.1) reproduces the basic specification estimated in Feldstein

(1982) relating the ratio of net investment to GNP (I/Yt) to the real net
                                           -38—


rate of return in the previous year (RNt_i) and the rate of capacity

utilization (UCAPt_i). The equation is estimated with a first—order

autocorrelation correction, and the simultaneously estimated autocorrelation

coefficient is presented as the coefficient of the variable u,_1.


(3.1)        I/Y. = —0.014   +    0.459 RNt_i + 0.028 UCAPt i +            0.29    u1
                                 (0.095)          (0.025)                 (0.25)


                                                  =   0.754,   DWS =     2.04,    1954-78


        After this equation was estimated in the summer of 1980, the Commerce

Department prepared a major data revision that substantially modified a

number of the series used to calculate each of the variables.

In addition, in preparing to reest-imate this and other equations, we have

introduced a number of improvements in the procedure used to calculate the

real net return to capital. Nevertheless, when this equation is reestimated

with the new data for the same period, the resulting parameter estimates are

very similar to those that were presented in Feldstein (1982):


(3.2)        I/Y. =          +    0.453 RNt_i + 0.020 UCAPt_i +           0.445 ut_i
                                 (0.114)         (0.025)                  (0.230)


                                                  =   0.698, OWS = 1.99, 1954-78

        Extending the sample through 1984 has very little affect on the estimated

coefficients:



(3.3)        i!iv = -0.003   +   0.412 RNt_i +    0.021    UCAPt...i +    0.431 ut_i
                                 (0.116)         (0.024)                  (0.206)


                                                  =   0.598, OWS = 1.92,         1954-84
                                             —39—


The coefficient of the net return variable is 0.412, implying that each one

percentage point rise in RN causes the investment—GNP ratio to rise by 0.412

percentage points. The associated elasticity at the mean values of RN (0.038)

and of the investment-GNP ratio (0.030) is 0.52.

      The persistently strong effect of the real net return does not reflect

the dominant effect of the early years or of any other part of the sample. When

the sample is divided in half, the effect of the real net return is quite

strong in both halves. For the period from 1954 through 1969 we obtain:


(3.4a)           =   -0.055   +    0.433 RNt_i +    0.079 UCAPt 1 -       0.565 ut_i
                                  (0.067)          (0.023)            (0.253)



                                                       =   0.808, DWS = 2,17, 1954—69

The results for the second half of the sample are:


(3..4b)    I/Y = -0.040       +   0.576 RNt1 +      0.065 UCAPt i +       0.166   u1
                                  (0.136)          (0.022)            (0.347)


                                                           0.611, DWS =   1.79,   1970—84


      The coefficient of RN is actually higher in each of the sample periods

than -it is for the overall period. In particular, the evidence for the most

recent 15 years implies an effect that is nearly 40 percent stronger

than for the entire sample.

     The estimated coefficients are also quite insensitive to the use of the

autocorrelation correction. When the equation is reestimated for the entire

period by ordinary least squares, the coefficient of RN shifts only from the
0.41 value presented in equation (3.3) to 0.37. Even more reassuring are the

estimates obtained when the basic specification is first—differenced:

             1n       1n
(35)              -             = 0.0004   +   0.422     (Rti—R t-2 +        0.022 (UCAPt_i—UCAPt_2)
              t           t—1                  (0.126)                       (0.022)

                                                                    =   0.317,   DWS   2.45, 1955-84


The stability of these parameter estimates is certainly very impressive,

indicating that the investment-GNP ratio does respond to year-to-year

variations in RN and UCAP and not just to the broad shifts in these variables.

        We have also tested the simple lag structure of the basic specification

and found that the implications about the effects of RN and UCAP are unaffected

when more general lag structures are estimated. Equation (3.6) shows that a

second lagged value of RN is not statistically significant and that the sum of

the two coefficients is increased only modestly above the coefficient of a

single RN variable:


(3.6)                 =       -0.0002 + 0.351 RNt1 + 0.156
                                        (0.126)               (0.143)

                          +     0.014 UCAP      +   0.488 U
                               (0.033)              (0.233)


                                                                   =    0.616, OWS = 1.84, 1955—84

This conclusion is confirmed when the lagged values of RN are replaced by a

second—order polynomial distributed lag over four lagged values with no

restriction on the final distributed lag coefficient. The sum of the lag

coefficients is 0.419 with a standard error of 0.229. The lagged UCAP variable

has a coefficient of 0.022 with a standard error of 0.037 and the R2 value

is 0.624.

        Additional lagged values of the capacity utilization variable are also
                                                    -41--



 insignificant and leave the coefficient of the RN variable essentially

unchanged:


(3.7)        I/Y. = -0.006         +     0.361 RN_i +       0.037 UCAPt_i
                                        (0.124)             (0.028)

                      —    0.009 UCAPt_2 +        0.413 Ut1
                          (0.022)                 (0.218)


                                                                      0.598, DWS =    1.96,   1955-84

More complex lag structures for UCAP, including polynomial distributed lags,

confirmed this conclusion.

        We also considered a variety of alternatives to capacity utilization.

Substituting the unemployment rate among adult males left the coefficient of

RN essentially unchanged (at 0.445 with a standard error of 0.112) but was

itself insignificant (a coefficient of -0.020 with a standard error of 0.075).

Substituting a distributed lag in the percentage change in real nonf arm

business product (PCNFBP), as suggested by the traditional accelerator model,

leaves the coefficient of RN essentially unchanged.


(3.8)             =   0.011    +       0.400 RNt_1 +    0.026 (PCNFBP)_1 +        0.046 (PCNFBP)_2
                                       (0.126)         (0.027)                   (0.031)

                  +       0.034 (PCNFBP)_3 +        0.011 (PCNFBP).4 +         0.47    u_i
                      (0.028)                      (0.021)                    (0.18)



                                                                 =    0.590, DWS = 1.97, 1954—84

     Finally, we experimented with a number of possible additional variables

including the ratio of cashf low to GNP, the rate of inflation and a time

trend. The coefficients of these variables were not significant and the
                                                —42-


coefficient of the RN variable remained essentially unchanged. A typical

example of this specification is presented in equation (3.9):


(39)      1't =         —0.043 +
                                    0.372RNt1   +   0.054 UCAPt1
                                   (0.074)          (0.028)

                    +     0.106 (cashflow/GNP)_1 + 0.00028 Time -                0.042 Ut1
                         (0.194)                           (0.00021)            (0.248)


                                                            =   0.693   OWS =   1.96,   1954-84


     We have also reestimated the basic equation using the cyclically adjusted

net return, RNA. This variable is constructed by calculating a regression

equation relating the pretax profitability to the concurrent rate of capacity

utilization and then calculating the pretax return that would have prevailed

at a constant rate of capacity utilization. The effective tax rate is then

applied to this cyclically adjusted pretax rate of return to obtain the

cyclically adjusted net rate of return, RNA. The regression coefficient of

this variable is essentially identical to the coefficient of RN in the basic

estimate of equation (3.3):


(3.10)          =   —0.025 +       0.416 RNAt_i +       0.048 UCAPt_i +     0.422 ut_i
                                   (0.118)              (0.021)             (0.205)


                                                    =   0.595, DWS = 1.95, 1954—84

     Although our analysis focused on the net return after all taxes, we also

estimated the basic equations using the rate of return after corporate taxes

only. As we explained in section 2.1, the return after corporate taxes is the

appropriate measure of the attractiveness of investing in the nonfinancial
                                        —43--



corporate capital for tax exempt investors like pension funds and for foreign

 investors. Looking at the return after the corporate tax is also appropriate

to the extent that changes in personal tax rates have an equal effect on the

net return to the competing investments. Equation (3.11) shows that

variations in the rate of return after corporate taxes (RNC) has a slightly

stronger effect on the investment—GNP ratio than the RN measure of the net

return:


(3.11)    I/Y = -0.008   +    0.455 RNCt i +    0.016 UCAPt_i +       0.276    u1
                             (0.104)            (0.024)              (0.221)


                                                     =    0.632, DWS = 1.85, 1954—84

     The results with the cyclically adjusted measure of the real return net

of corporate tax have almost the same coefficient of the net return variable

but a stronger effect of the capacity utilization variable:


(3.12)    I/Y =   —0.044 +   0.455 RNCAt i +     0.061 UCAPt_i +       0.240
                             (0.103)            (0.020)               (0.222)


                                                     =    0.626,   DWS =   1.87,   1954-84


In both equations, the explanatory power (R2) is greater with the RNC

variable than with the RN variable. Moreover, since the RNC and RNCA variables

are about 40 percent larger on average than the corresponding RN variables,

the elasticity of the investment-GNP ratio with respect to RNC is

approximately 0.80.

     Finally, we have estimated equations describing the rate of growth of the

net capital stock, i.e., replacing the ratio of investment to GNP with the
                                      —44-


ratio of investment to the net capital stock at the end of the preceding year.

The results, shown in equation (3.13), are qualitatively very similar to the

basic investment-GNP estimates of equation (3.3):



(3.13) — = -0.21       +   0.608 RNt1 +   0.045 UCAPt_I +       0.138    ui
            K1             (0.121)        (0.032)              (0.241)

                                                    =   0.682, DWS = 1.91, 1954-84

The coefficient of RN is nearly 50 percent larger than the corresponding

coefficient in the equations for the investment—GNP ratio while the

investment-capital ratio averages only about 30 percent larger than the

investment—GNP ratio. Thus the elasticity of the investment-capital ratio

with respect to RN, calculated at the mean investment-capital ratio (0.039)

and the mean value of RN (0.038) is 0.59 or somewhat greater than the

previously calculated elasticity of 0.52 of the investment-GNP ratio with

respect to RN.



4.   THE RATE OF RETURN OVER COST AND THE RATE OF INVESTMENT:
     STATISTICAL EVIDENCE

     The second basic model that we discussed above and that was developed in

Feldstein (1982) relates the investmerit-GNP ratio to the difference between

the maximum potential net return on a standard investment project and the net

cost of funds that firms face. This model is the operational extension to an

economy with taxes of Irving Fisher's (1896, 1930) notion that investment

depends on the difference betwen the marginal efficiency of capital (or the

internal rate of return on an incremental investment) and the rate of

interest.
                                      -.45-



      In the standard textbook version of this theory, the firm faces a

 downward sloping marginal efficiency of capital schedule and a horizontal rate

of interest line. At the point where the two intersect, the firm has an

optimal stock of capital. If, however, the marginal efficiency of capital

exceeds the rate of interest, the firm has an incentive to invest. Adjustment

costs limit the speed with which the firm closes the gap but the volume of

investment can be assumed to be an increasing function of the difference

between the marginal efficiency of capital and the rate of interest.

     In an economy with complex tax rules, the analog to the marginal

efficiency of capital schedule depends on the tax rate, the depreciation rules

and investment tax credits, and the rate of inflation, as well as on the

pretax profitability of the available investment projects. Each point on the

schedule represents the maximum net cost of funds that the firm can afford to

pay to support that incremental project. We represent shifts in the level of

this entire schedule by the maximum net cost of funds that the firm can afford

to pay on a hypothetical "standard" project.

     More explicitly, we derive the maximum potential net return (MPNR) on the

assumption that the basic investment project is a "sandwich" of equipment and

structures that lasts for 30 years and replicates the average mixture of

equipment and structures in the capital stock of the nonfinancial corporate

sector. The sandwich consists of an initial investment of .33 dollars of

structures and .33 dollars of equipment. The output associated with the

structures -is assumed to decay exponentially at a rate of 3 percent a year;

at the end of 34 years, the remaining structure is scrapped without value.

The output associated with the equipment decays more rapidly, at 13 percent
                                      -46-


per year, and the equipment is scrapped without value at the end of 17 years.

After 17 years, a new equipment investment is made with real value (in the

prices of year 1) of $.33. This then decays in the same way as the initial

equipment investment and is scrapped at the same time as the structure.

     The net output values of the structure and equipment components are set

f or the first year of each project to satisfy two conditions. First, the

overall pretax return on the investment sandwich is 10.3 percent, the average

pretax return for the period from 1961—84 (or at the pretax return of the

current year in the varying profitability model). Second, the after-tax rates

of return on the two types of capital are equal under the tax rules prevailing

in the base period (chosen to be 1960). These conditions uniquely determine a

path of net output which we shall denote x.

     The MPNR is defined as the net rate of return that the firm can pay on

the funds "borrowed" (as a loan or an infusion of equity capital) to finance

an investment sandwich and have "paid off" the initially invested funds by the

end of the life of the project. More specifically, we consider a project that

has annual pretax real net output of x per dollar of plant and equipment

initially invested and nominal pretax net receipts of        The price level

of the firm's net output is assumed to vary in proportion to the price level

of the economy as a whole. The firm is allowed depreciation deductions for

tax purposes of a and pays tax on nominal output less interest expenses and

depreciation allowances at rate T. The firm needs initial cash per dollar of

the equipment investment equal to one dollar minus the investment tax credit.

Thereafter, the "loan" balance (Lt) is reduced by the project's after-tax

income but grows by an annual amount equal to the product of the net cost of
                                             -.47—



funds and the previous year's "loan" liability. The value of the rate of

return on the "borrowed" funds that permits the "loan" to be just repaid when

the project ends defines the maximum potential net return.20

        The nominal MPNR is thus the value that satisfies the equation:


                                 —
(4.1)        Lt =   (1+mpnr)L1       (1—T)ptxt

subject to the condition that L0 =       0.66 minus the investment tax credit per
dollar of equipment investment, that L11 is increased by the net cost of the

new equipment investment, and that the loan is repaid when the project is

scrapped (L1 =      0).
        An alternative measure of the MPNR is also calculated on the assumption

that firms assume that the real pretax return on the prospective investment

projects varies from year to year and is equal to the average pretax return

actually earned in that year on all nonfinancial corporate capital. This

measure is denoted MPNRVP (where the last two letters denote varying

profitability).

          The net cost of funds -is taken to be a weighted average of the costs of

debt and equity funds. The cost of equity funds (e) is the ratio of adjusted

economic earnings per share to the price per share.21




   20Note that if the project were financed by debt, the MPNR would be the
interest rate net of the tax deduction. If there are no taxes, the MPNR is the
traditional internal rate of return. The maximum potential real net return is
obtained by subtracting the expected inflation rate from the nominal MPNR value.
Annual values of MPNR and MPRNR are presented in Appendix table B-i.

    211he method of doing this adjustment and the adjusted data are presented in
appendix B.
        The gross cost of debt is the yield on newly issued high grade corporate

bonds (i). The net cost of funds is thus:


(4.2)        COF =   b(1-T)i   +   (1-b)e

where b is the proportion of investment financed by debt. We take b to be

one-third, approximately the average value of the ratio of the market value of

debt to the replacement value of the capital stock during the period 1960 to

1984. The annual values of the cost of funds and of its components are

presented in Appendix table B-i.

        An estimated relation of the net investment'-GNP ratio to the rate of

return over cost (MPNR-COF) and the rate of capacity utilization was presented

in Feldstein (1982):


(4.3)                = —0.040 +      0.316 (MPNR-COF)t       +     0.073    UCAPt..1 +     0.70    ut_i
                                    (0.066)                       (0.020)                 (0.17)


                                                         =       = 0.784,    OWS =1.79, 1955-77


        Although there were substantial revisions in the national income account

data and a number of significant improvements in the process of calculating

the MPNR and COF variables, the reestimation of this equation with data for

the quarter century beginning -in 1961 produced remarkably similar parameter

estimates:


(4.4)      I/Y = -0.044        +   0.313 (MPNR-COF)t_i +         0.086 UCAPt_i +         0.350 u_1
                                   (0.169)                       (0.033)                 (0.286)



                                                             =    0.510, OWS =1.74, 1961—84
                                                        -49--



        A strong test of this specification is obtained by splitting the return

over cost variable into its two components. Equation (4.5) shows that the

coefficients of the two components do have quite similar absolute values, as

implied by the initial specification.


(4.5)        I/Y = -0.012            +   0.294 MPNRt_i -        0.394 C0F_1
                                         (0.172)                (0.185)

                       +    0.058 UCAPt 1 +        0.565 ut_i
                           (0.033)                 (0.236)


                                                                       =   0.514, DWS =1.78, 1961—84

        A second type of evidence that indicates the robustness of the parameter

estimates is that very similar coefficients are obtained when the basic

specification is estimated by ordinary least squares (i.e., without the

first-order autoregressive transformation) or by first—differenc-ing the data

before estimation. In the ordinary least squares regression, the coefficient

of the return over cost variable is 0.27 with a standard error of 0.15. When

the data are first-differenced, the estimates are:

                                                                   =   0.202,    OWS =   1.94,   1962-84


        Splitting the sample produced less satisfactory results, with too little

information in each twelve year subperiod to permit accurate estimation of the

key parameter values:
                                            -50--




(4.7a)           = -0.083     +   0.035 (MPNR—COF)t_i + 0.139 UCAPt_i —      0.004 ut_i

                                                = 0.567, DWS =1.56, 1961—72
                                             SSR = 0.000222

and

(4.7b)           =   -0.056   +   0.575 (MPNR-COF)t_i +   0.094 UCAPt_i +   0.280 ut_i
                                  (0.325)                 (0.053)           (0.458)



                                                  0.248, DWS =1.74, 1973—84
                                                    =
                                             SSR = 0.000329

The point estimates imply that the rate of return over cost had a very small

and insignificant effect in the first subperiod but a quite powerful effect in

the second half of the sample. The coefficients of the capacity utilization

variables are much closer to each other. However, a standard F-test shows

that the coefficients in the two separate subsamples are not significantly

different from each other. The sum of squared residuals for the single

overall sample from 1961 through 1984 -is 0.000609 while the sum of the two

subsample sums of squared residuals is 0.000551; the resulting F-statistic

-is only 0.42 while the critical value at the 5 percent level with 16 and 4

degrees of freedom is 4.49. The difference in the coefficients in equations

(7a) and (7b) should therefore only be interpreted as indicating that here is

insufficient evidence in the separate subsamples to estimate separate

coefficient values.

      Different lag distributions did not alter the basic estimates or improve

the explanatory power of the equation. Thus, a second order polynomial
                                            —51—


distributed lag on the coefficients of four lagged values of MPNR-COF had

coefficients that summed to 0.49 with a standard error of 0.42. Only the first

of the coefficients was larger than its standard error; it had a value of 0.33

with a standard error of 0.17. With two lagged values for MPNR—COF the

estimated equation is:


(4.8)                  -0.047 +    0.291 (MPNR—COF)ti —       0.052
                                                                       (MPNR—COF)t_2
                                  (0.178)                    (0.221)

                   +   0.092 UCAPt 1 + 0.290
                       (0.039)


                                                =   0.480, DWS =1.69, 1962-84

The coefficient of the second MPNR-COF variable is completely insignificant

and the coefficient of the first MPNR-COF variable is very close to the value

of 0.313 in the basic equation (4.4).

        Several alternatives to the capacity utilization variable were also

considered as different ways of measuring the impact of economic activity on

-investment. The unemployment rate for adult males worked reasonably well as

an alternative to capacity utilization but provided less overall explanatory

power:


(4.9)        '/' = 0.034     +    0.443 (MPNR—cOF)t1 —       0.211 RUM20_1 +      0.447 u_1
                                  (0.190)                    (0.115)              (0.258)


                                               =    0.427,   DWS =1.66, 1961-84


When a third-degree polynomial distributed lag over four annual values of the

percentage change in nonfarm business output (with the final value
                                          —52—


unconstrained) is added to the basic specification, the capacity utilization

variable continues to have a coefficient of 0.085 (with a standard error of

0.038) while none of the distributed lag coefficients is a large as its

standard error; the sum of the distributed lag coefficients is 0.0010 with a

standard error of 0.0014.

     Including a variety of additional plausible variables in the equation has

little affect on the coefficient of the return over cost variable. For

example, the coefficients of the ratio of corporate cashf low to GNP and of a

time trend are both insignificant:


(4.10) I/Yt = -0.056   +    0.293 (MPNR—COF)ti +          0.091 UCAPt1
                           (0.181)                     (0.075)

             +   0.00014 time +      0.051 (cashflow/GNP)1 +           0.306 ut_i
                  (0.00056)          (0.457)                           (0.380)



                                               R2 =   0.463, DWS =1.82, 1961—84

     In contrast to the MPNR variable that has been used in all of the above

equations, the MPNRVP variable assumes that firms adjust their assumed pretax

rate of return from year to year in proportion to that year's actual pretax

profitability of capital in the nonfinancial corporate sector. The standard

deviation of the rather volatile MPNRVP-COF variable is twice as high for the

period 1960 through 1984 as the standard deviation of the MPNR—COF variable.

Moreover, as equation (4.11) shows, it is statistically insignificant and,

when combined with the capacity utilization rate, it provides a much less

satisfactory explanation of the behavior of the investment-GNP ratio:


(4.11)    I/Y =             + 0.0005(MPNRVP--COF)t_i +        0.O95UCAPt_i
                                                                                 +   0.272
                              (0.0008)                       (0.046)                 (0.389)


                                                      =   0.425, OWS =1.63, 1961-84
                                          -53-


     Finally, we present an equation relating the growth of the net capital

stock (i.e., the ratio of net investment to the net capital stock at the end

of the previous year) to the basic rate-of-return-over cost and capacity

utilization variables:



(4.12)         =   -0.068   +   0.482 (MPNR_COF)ti +    0.122
                                (0.234)                (0.054)
                                                                 UCAPt1+ i8'i-i
                                                                           •




                                                       = 0.555,   OWS =1.80, 1961-84
The coefficient of MPNR-COF is some 60 percent larger than the corresponding

coefficient in the equation for the investment—GNP ratio. Since the

investment-captial ratio is about 30 percent greater than the investment-GNP

ratio, the coefficient implies a more powerful effect of MPNR-COF on the

capital growth rate than on the investment-GNP ratio. Since a similar result

was obtained with the real net return model, this method of specifying

investment behavior deserves more careful examination in a future study.



5.   CONCLUDING COMMENTS


     The evidence presented in this paper confirms that tax—induced changes in

the profitability ofinvestment have had a powerful effect on the share of GNP

devoted to net investment in nonresidential fixed capital and on the rate of

growth of that net capital stock. More specifically, we have reestimated two

very simple models of aggregate investment that were previously studied in

Feldstein (1982). The present study extends the previous analysis by
                                      -54-


incorporating revised national income account estimates, by improving the

estimation of the effective tax rate and the profitability of new investments,

and by extending the sample to include the years 1978 through 1984, a period

of very substantial changes in tax rules and sharp shifts in inflation and in

the business cycle. Oespite all of these changes, the new statistical

estimates are remarkably close to the previous results.

     The statistical estimates imply that each percentage point increase in

the real after-tax net return on capital in the nonfinancial corporate sector

raises the ratio of net fixed nonresidential investment to GNP by 0.4 percentage

points. Since the 22 percentage point decline in the effective tax rate paid

by corporations and their shareholders and creditors between 1978-80 (just

before the passage of the 1981 tax act) and 1983—84 (the most recent years for

which data are available) implies a 1.8 percentage point rise in the real net

return, the implied increase in the investment-GNP ratio is approximately

0.7 percentage points. Although it is inappropriate to treat the specific

implications of these models as precise predictors of the impact of taxes in

any particular short period, the predicted rise in the investment-GNP ratio

accords quite well with the observed 0.6 percentage point increase. After

taking into account the fall in capacity utilization over this same period,

the analysis shows that virtually all of the rise in the investment-GNP ratio

appears to have been do to the reduction in effective tax rates that occurred

because of the decline in inflation and in personal tax rates and to the

accelerated depreciation of investment in plant and equipment.

     A separate analysis that relates the investment-GNP ratio to the

difference between the potential return on new investment and the cost of
                                       -55-


 funds also shows the importance of changes in taxes as a cause of changes in

 the investment-GNP ratio over the past quarter century. Each percentage point

 rise in the difference between the potential return on new investment and the

cost of funds raises the predicted -investment-GNP ratio by 0.3 percentage

points. Between 1979-81 and 1984—85, the maximum potential real return on new

investment rose by 1.3 percentage points, implying a 0.4 percent of GNP rise

 in investment.

     Although this model is not as successful as the net return model -in

explaining year to year variations in the investment—GNP ratio in general, and

the experience between 1980 and 1985 in particular, it does imply that changes

in the return on new investment and in the cost of funds do have powerful

effects on the investment-GNP ratio. It also shows that about two-thirds of

the increase in investment that might have resulted from the improved

after-tax profitability between 1978-80 and 1984 was offset by the rise in the

cost of funds during the same period. All of this increase -in the cost of

funds was in the cost of debt. Therefore to the extent that the increase in

expected budget deficits caused the rise in interest rates, it had the effect

of offsetting a large part of the increased incentive to invest that resulted

from the change in tax rules.

     The three alternative models of investment behavior all imply that the

types of tax changes proposed by the Reagan administration or passed by the

House of Representatives would significantly depress the ratio of investment

to GNP. Depending on the particular statistical specification, the

Administration proposal would reduce the investment--ONP ratio by between

20 percent and 40 percent of the increase experienced between 1979-81 (before
                                      -56-


the 1981 change in tax rules) and 1984-85. The bill passed by the House of

Representatives would reduce investment by substantially more.

     A high priority now is to reestimate the analysis of this paper with the

revised national income and product account data released in December 1985.

It is also possible to extend the present analysis in a number of ways. The

relation between investment and the net return after corporate taxes but

before personal and other portfolio taxes should be analyzed further.

Additional attention should also be given to analyzing the rate of growth of

the net capital stock as well as or instead of the investment-GNP ratio. The

process of replacement and modernization investment also deserves more

explicit analysis in this framework. The flexible accelerator models of Hall

and Jorgenson (1963, 1967) and the marginal-q models of Abel (1984), Summers

(1981) and Hayashi (1982) should also be estimated.22 Finally, a

disaggregation of investment by types of assets and by industry may also

improve our understanding of the investment process and of the impact of

changes in tax rules.

    22We have done some preliminary analysis with a variety of alternative
marginal q-models and find that a specification of marginal-q based on the
potential profitability of investment provides a better explanation of past
investment experience than the method used by Summers (1981).

                                  Appendix A


               The Pretax Rate of Return and Effective Tax Rates




     This appendix presents annual data for 1953 through 1984 on the

investment rate, capacity utilization, pretax and net—of—tax rates of return,

and the effective tax rates. Our procedures for estimating these magnitudes

from data published by the Commerce Department, the Federal Reserve Board and

the Internal Revenue Service are described.

     Our method follows the procedure used in Feldstein, Poterba and

Dicks-Mireaux (1983) but makes some modifications that we believe provide

better estimates of both the pretax return and effective tax rates. The

calculations use the most recent data available in the fall of 1985. This

means that the December 1985 benchmark revisions of the national income and

produce accounts and the subsequent changes adopted by the Federal Reserve

Board for the flow of funds accounts are not incorporated.

     All of our estimates of the pretax rate of return and of the effective

tax rates are for nonfinancial corporations. Nonresidential fixed investment

includes all sectors of the economy. The capacity utilization measure is the

Federal Reserve Board's estimate for the manufacturing industries.

     The columns of Table Al present the following annual values: (column 1)

the ratio of net investment in nonresidential fixed capital to gross national

product; (column 2) the ratio of net investment in nonresidential fixed

capital to the net stock of nonresidential fixed capital at the end of the

previous year; (column 3) the capacity utilization rate in manufacturing

industry; (column 4) the pretax real rate of return on capital in the

nonfinancial corporate sector; (column 5) the real rate of return on capital

in   the nonfinancial corporate sector after all taxes paid by the corporations,
their shareholders and their creditors; (column 6) the real rate of return on

capital in the nonfinancial corporate sector after all taxes paid by the

corporations; (column 7) the cyclically adjusted real rate of return on

capital in the nonfinancial corporate sector after all taxes; and (column 8)

the cyclically adjusted real rate of return on capital in the nonfinancial

corporate sector after all corporate taxes. The first two series are

calculated directly from the data published by the Commerce Department. The

data in column 3 are published by the Federal Reserve Board. The method of

calculating the remaining columns is discussed in the remainder of this

Appendix.


A.1 The Pretax Rate of Return

      The pretax rate of return is calculated as the ratio of the total pretax

capital income of the nonfinancial corporate sector to the replacement value

of that capital stock including fixed capital, land and inventories. The

Federal Reserve Board's Balance Sheets for the United States, 1945-84

presents year-end values for these components. We average the end of the

previous year and the end of the current year to obtain an average value of

the capital stock during the year. These capital stock values are reported

in column 1 of Table A2.

      The pretax capital income of the nonfinancial corporate sector consists

of four basic components: (1) corporate profits with the capital consumption

adjustment and inventory valuation adjustment; (2) net interest paid by the

corporations; (3) the property taxes paid to state and local governments; and

(4) the inflation-induced changes in the value of the net financial

liabilities of the nonfinancial corporations other than the liabilities to

those who are providers of capital to the corporations. Each of these will

now be explained and the time series presented in Table A2.

     Corporate profits with the capital consumption adjustment and inventory

valuation adjustment are the basic data provided by the Department of Commerce

as their national income account measure of the inflation-adjusted pretax

profits. This series is presented in column 2 of Table A2.

     Since we want the return to all providers of capital, we must add to

these profits the net interest payments of nonfinancial corporations. These

data are also from the national income accounts. Note that these are nominal

interest payments since any inflation—induced loss to the creditors is a gain

to the equity owners and leaves total real capital income unchanged. The net

interest payments are shown -in column 3 of the Table A2.

     The Commerce Department treats state and local property taxes as a cost

of production rather than a tax on capital. We therefore add this tax to the

other components Of capital income to obtain a more correct estimate of the

return to capital. Since data are not available on the state and local

property tax paid by nonfinancial corporations, we estimate that the ratio of

these taxes to all state and local property taxes is the same as the ratio of

the fixed capital of nonfinancial corporations to the total fixed capital of

the private sector other than the nonprofit sector. This method is subject to

a variety of potential biases since it: (1) assumes that nonfinancial
                                      -60--



corporate capital and other capital are taxed at the same effective rates,

probably causing an understatement of the tax on nonfinancial corporations;

(2) ignores the tax on inventories, causing a further understatement; but (3)

ignores the tax that some states levy on consumer durables, which offsets some

of the downward bias. The estimated tax is shown in column 4 of Table A2.

     The final adjustment is for the corporations' inflation-induced gains and

losses on financial assets and liabilities which are appropriately excluded

from the net capital provided to the nonfinancial corporate sector by

individuals and other portfolio investors. The net loss of the nonfinancial

corporations is equal to the inflation rate multiplied by the sum of (1) the

outstanding net trade credit (a nominal asset of the nonfinancial

corporations), (2) the federal government securities less net amounts owed to

the federal government; and (3) state and local government securities less net

amounts owed to these governments. Unfortunately, currency is not reported

and therefore cannot be included. The inflation rate is computed as the

fourth quarter to fourth quarter change in the GNP deflator and the financial

assets and liabilities are estimated as the average of the values for the end

of the year and the end of the previous year. The net gain is shown in

column 5 of Table A2.

     Adding all of these together gives the total income produced by the

capital of the nonfinancial corporate sector. This is shown in column 6 of

Table A2.

     Dividing the total capital income by the capital stock of column 1 yields

the pretax real return shown in column 7 of Table A2.

 A.2 The Effective Tax Rates

      The tax on the capital income of the nonfinancial corporate sector

 includes the taxes paid by the corporations themselves (to the federal

governemnt and to state and local governments ) and the taxes paid by those

who receive dividend income, interest income, and capital gains. Since we are

 interested in deriving the overall effective tax rate on this capital income

rather than tax rates on each component, we will express each component of the

overall tax rate as a proportion of the pretax capital income shown in column

6 of Table A2. Some intermediate effective tax rates used in the calculation

are shown in Table A3.

     The federal corporate tax payments as a proportion of pretax capital

income are shown in column 1 of Table A3. The corresponding state and local

corporate tax payments are shown in column 2. The state and local property

taxes discussed above and presented -in column 4 of Table A2 are expressed as a

fraction of the pretax capital income -in column 3 of Table A3. Adding

together these three columns gives the total taxes paid by the corporations

themselves as a fraction of their pretax capital income. This figure is

presented in column 4 of Table A3.

     To estimate the tax on dividend income we begin by using the Flow of

Funds data on equity ownership to distribute dividends among classes of

investors: individuals, nonprofit organizations, insurance companies, banks,

pensions, etc. The largest class of investors is individuals whom we assume

account for 93 percent of the dividends received by the household sector. To

obtain an effective tax rate on the dividends received by individuals, we have

updated the series originally prepared by Br-inner and Brooks (1979). The
                                      -62-


effective federal dividend tax is constructed as a weighted average of

individual tax rates, using the fraction of dividends received in each year by

each income class and the corresponding statutory marginal tax rate. A state

dividend tax series is calculated using the assumption that the net marginal

tax rate on dividends is 1.5 times the average state personal tax rate implied

by the national income account aggregates. Columns 1 and 2 of Table A4 show

the effective federal and state taxes on individual dividend income; these tax

rates are expressed as percentages of dividend income. We further assume that

dividends received by nonprofit organizations, pension funds, foreign equity

owners and other miscellaneous investors are untaxed. Insurance companies and

banks pay a tax equal to 15 percent of the corporate tax rate. The

appropriate weighted average of these tax rates is the effective tax rate on

dividend income and is shown in column 3 of Table A4. Multiplying this number

by the total dividends paid by nonfinancial corporations and dividing by the

pretax capital income of those corporations yields the tax on dividends as a

proportion of pretax capital income; this component of the overall effective

tax rate on pretax capital income is shown in column 5 of Table A3.

     The effective tax on capital gains also reflects the distribution of the

ownership of corporate equity and the further fact that capital gains are only

taxed when assets are sold. The distribution of equity ownership is again

based on the Flow of Funds data on the distribution of dividends among

different classes of investors and the Internal Revenue Service data on the

distribution of dividend income among different income classes. For the

sample years before 1969, individual capital gains were taxed when realized at

half the individual's statutory rate on dividends, but subject to an
                                       —63—


 "alternative" maximum rate of 25 percent. For the years between 1969 and

 1978, the effective tax rate on capital gains was raised in a number of ways:

 the use of the alternative tax was limited, the value of the loss-offset was

reduced, the "untaxed" portion of capital gains was subject to a minimum tax,

and the amount of ordinary income eligible for the maximum tax on personal

services income was reduced in relation to the amount of the "untaxed" portion

of realized capital gains. In 1978 legislation was passed that substantially

reduced the effective tax on realized capital gains and this happened again in

1985. Throughout all of the period, the principal was maintained of taxing

capital gains only when assets are sold and permitting a step-up -in basis when

assets are transferred at death.

     It is not possible to provide an accurate evaluation of the appropriate

weighted average tax rate on capital gains for every year in our sample.

Instead, we make the conservative assumption that households paid an effective

tax of only 5 percent on accruing capital gains for the years through 1968,

7.5 percent in 1969 through 1978, 5 percent in 1979 and 1980 and then

4 percent in 1981 through 1984. Banks and insurance companies are taxed at a

30 percent statutory rate on capital gains realizations. Because of the

effect of deferral, we assume that this -is equivalent to an effective 15

percent rate. We assume that all other equity holders pay no capital gains

taxes. The overall effective tax rate on capital gains is shown in column 4

of Table A4.

     To translate this capital gains tax rate into taxes as a share of the

total pretax income, we must estimate the annual value of capital gains. It

is convenient to estimate two kinds of capital gains separately: the real
                                      -64-


gains and the nominal gains that result form inflation. To calculate the real

capital gains we combine the real retained earnings of nonfinancial

corporations and the real inflation-induced gain that equity owners make at

the expense of creditors. This inflation-induced gain is calculated as the

product of the rise in the price level (the increase in the GNP deflator from

the fourth quarter of the preceding year to the fourth quarter of the year in

question) and the market value of the debt of nonfinancial corporations.*

Multiplying this amount of real capital gains by the effective tax rate on

capital gains and dividing the product by the total capital income of the

nonfinancial corporate sector yields the real capital gains component of the

overall effective tax rate shown in column 6 of Table A3.

     To calculate the additional nominal capital gain associated with the

nominal increase in the value of corporate assets that results from a general

rise in the price level, we abstract from the year—to-year fluctuations in

stock market values and calculate the nominal rise in the replacement value of

the capital stock.** To measure changes in the nominal value of the capital

stock, we have constructed a price index for the tangible assets of

nonfinancial corporations as a weighted average of the nonf arm business price

deflator (for inventories) and the price deflator for gross domestic fixed

investment. The fourth quarter to fourth quarter change in this price index is

multiplied by the nominal value of the tangible assets to get the nominal



    *This debt series has been estimated for the nonfinancial corporate sector
and the total corporate sector and will be discussed in Feldstein and Jun (1986)

   **Because of nonneutral tax rules, a change in the rate to the nominal
replacement value of the underlying assets but, with a persistent constant
rate of inflation, the nominal stock market value should rise at the same rate
as the nominal value of the underlying assets. See Feldstein (1980).
                                        -65—


 increase in the value of the capital stock of the nonfinancial corporations.

This nominal capital gain is multiplied by the effective tax rate on capital

gains (column 4 of Table A4) to obtain the nominal capital gains component of

the overall effective tax rate shown in column 7 of Table A3.

     The final component of the effective tax rate is the tax paid on the

interest received by the creditors of the nonfinancial corporations. We

understate this tax rate by ignoring the state and local taxes on interest

income. To obtain the federal effective tax rate on interest income, we

calculate a weighted average of the tax rates of the different providers of

debt capital to the nonfinancial corporations, using the fixed weights for

1976 derived from the Flow of Funds data by Feldstein and Summers (1979).t

We follow the Feldstein-Summers procedure of setting the household tax rate on

interest income at 35 percent, the mutual savings bank rate at 24 percent, and

the rate for private pensions, government accounts and "miscellaneous

creditors" at zero.    In computing the marginal tax rate for life insurance

companies we have followed Warshawsky (1982) in approximating the Menge

formula by the product of the federal corporate statutory rate and and the

factor 0.15 +   8,5 times the the difference between the Baa corporate bond rate

and the average interest rate assumed for life insurance reserves. Finally,

for commercial banks we assume that two-thirds of the interest received is

taxed at the statutory corporate tax rate while the remaining one-third avoids

all corporate tax; the income net of corporate tax is then taxed at a weighted

average of the dividend tax rate and the capital gains tax rate with weights



    tlhese weights are: individuals, 0.082; mutual savings banks, 0.055; life
insurance companies, 0.255; commercial banks, 0.427; all others, 0.181.

reflecting the dividend payout rate of the banks. The combined effective tax

rate on interest income is shown -in column 5 of Table A4. The product of this

rate and the interest payments of the nonfinancial corporations divided by the

total capital income of the nonfinancial corporations gives the interest

component of the overall effective tax rate shown in column 8 of Table A3.

     All of these numbers are combined in the final effective tax rate shown

in column 9 of Table A3.

     As a matter of interest, we also calculate two alternative estimates of

the effective tax rate on the equity income of nonfinancial corporations. The

first of these is calculated on the assumption that the providers of debt

capital bear only the tax that is levied on interest income, i.e., the tax

shown in column 8 of table A3. The second alternative assumes that the taxes

paid by the corporations fall equally on debt and equity capital.

     The first effective tax rate on equity capital income is therefore

defined as the ratio of all taxes paid other than the tax on interest income

as a fraction of all capital income other than interest payments.

Operationally, the numerator is the product of the total capital income

(column 6) of table A2 and the difference between the total effective tax rate

(column 9 of table A3) and the interest component of that tax rate (column 8

of Table A2). The denominator is the difference between the total capital

income (column 6 of Table A2) and the interest paid to creditors (column 3 of

Table A2). The resulting effective tax rate on equity income is shown in

column 6 of Table A4.

     The alternative procedure is to impute to the providers of debt capital a
                                      —67-


share of the taxes pa-id by the corporations (columns 1 through 3 of Table A3)

equal to the ratio of the market value of the debt to the replacement value of

the capital stock. The numerator of the equity tax rate is then equal to the

numerator described -in the previous paragraph minus the imputed tax paid by

creditors. The denominator is the same as before. The resulting effective

tax rate on equity income with imputed corporate taxes is shown in column 7 of

Table A4.

               The Maximum Potential Net Return and the Cost of Funds



     Table B-I presents annual values of the basic variables used in the rate

of return over cost models of section 4 and summarized and discussed in

section 2.

     Column 1 shows the maximum potential net return calculated according to

the method described in section 4. The expected inflation series used in this

calculation are derived by a "rolling" estimation of an ARIMA process (using

only those data available as of each date), using the estimated coefficients

to project inflation for the next 10 years, and calculating the weighted

average of those inflation rates. These expected inflation rates are shown in

column 2 of Table Bi.

     The maximum potential real net return (MPRNR) is the difference between

the MPNR value of column 1 and the expected inflation value of column 2.   It

is shown in column 3.

     The MPNR value is calculated assuming a constant 10.3 percent real pretax

return on capital of the nonfinancial corporations. The 'tvarying

profitability" alternative, MPNRVP, for each year is calculated with the

assumption that the future pretax profitability will be the real pretax return

on capital observed in that year and shown in column 7 of Table A-2.

Subtracting expected inflation from the MPNRVP yields the maximum potential

real net return with varying profitability (MPRNRVP) series shown in column 4

of Table Bi.

     The cost of funds to which the MPNR series is compared in evaluating the
                                      -69—


incentive to invest is a weighted average of the cost of equity capital and

the net—of-tax cost of debt capital. We calculate the cost of equity capital

as the ratio of adjusted earnings to the share price. The starting point of

this calculation is the Standard and Poor's price-earnings ratio for

industrial companies. We then multiply this by the ratio of estimated

aggregate net-of-tax book earnings to estimated net aggregate economic

earnings. Net aggregate book earnings are derived from the national income

account estimate of the net profits of nonfinancial corporations before the

capital consumption adjustment and inventory valuation adjustment by adding

the sum of (1) the tax rate times the acceleration component of the capital

consumption allowance, plus (2) the difference between the investment tax

credit and an average of the ITC of the past 10 years. Aggregate economic

earnings are derived from the national income account estimate of the profits

of nonfinancial corporations after the capital consumption adjustment and

inventory valuation adjustment by adding an estimate of the gain that equity

owners make at the expense of creditors (referred to in connection with column

6 of Table A3) and the gain made on miscellaneous net liabilities (column 5 of

Table A2). The resulting adjusted earnings price ratio is presented in

column 5 of Table Bi.

     The gross cost of debt funds is represented by the interest rate on

high grade corporate bonds calculated by Data Resources, Inc. This is shown

in column 6 of Table 81.

     Because the MPNR and MPRNR variables are net concepts, the cost of funds

must also be measured as a net of the corporate tax deduction for interest

expenses. Column 7 is the statutory corporate tax rate against which interest
                                      —70—


expenses are deducted.

     The nominal cost of funds is defined as a weighted average of the nominal

cost of equity capital (the earnings price ratio of column 5 plus the expected

inflation rate of column 2) and the nominal net cost of debt capital (the

product of the interest rate of column 6 and the one minus the corporate tax

rate of column 7) with a weight of one-third on debt and two-thirds on equity.

The resulting cost of funds variable is presented in column 8 of Table B-i.
