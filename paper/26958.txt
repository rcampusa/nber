Why Are Corporate Payouts So High in the 2000s?

                                         ABSTRACT

The average annual inflation-adjusted amount paid out through dividends and repurchases by
public industrial firms is more than three times larger from 2000 to 2019 than from 1971 to 1999.
We find that an increase in aggregate corporate income accounts for 37% of the increase in
aggregate annual payouts and an increase in the payout rate accounts for 63%. Firms have higher
payout rates in the 2000s not only because they are older, larger, and have more free cash flow,
but also because they pay out more of their free cash flow. Though firms spend less on capital
expenditures in the 2000s than before, capital expenditures decrease similarly for the firms with
payouts and for firms without.

      At the turn of the century, financial economists worried about "disappearing dividends" (Fama and

French, 2001). Times have changed. In recent years, the media and politicians have been increasingly

concerned about the magnitude of corporate payouts. These concerns are primarily focused on the size of

stock buybacks rather than dividend payments. For example, Senator Marco Rubio complains that "At

present, Wall Street rewards companies for engaging in stock buybacks, temporarily increasing their stock

prices at the expense of productive investment" and suggests taxing repurchases. 1 Senators Chuck Schumer

and Bernie Sanders want to restrict repurchases because they are a form of "corporate self-indulgence."

Like Rubio, they suggest that "So focused on shareholder value, companies, rather than investing in ways

to make their businesses more resilient or their workers more productive, have been dedicating ever larger

shares of their profits to dividends and corporate share repurchases." 2 Academics also express concern that

the growth of repurchases has contributed to a decrease in capital expenditures among firms (Almeida, Fos,

and Kronlund, 2016; Gutierrez and Philippon, 2017).

      In this paper, we investigate why payouts are so high in the 2000s, before the COVID-19 crisis. We

gather data on payouts and firm characteristics from 1971 to 2019 for industrial firms listed on U.S.

exchanges. We measure a firm's payouts as the sum of its dividends and its repurchases in excess of equity

issuance (net repurchases). To adjust for inflation, we examine real dollar amounts using the price level in

2017. Not surprisingly, we find in Section 1 that payouts from 2000 to 2019 are large. The companies in

our sample pay out $11.76 trillion from 2000 to 2019 ($12.80 trillion if we do not net out equity issuance).

In the 2000s, annual aggregate real payouts average more than three times their pre-2000 level. Aggregate

payouts as a percentage of aggregate corporate assets also increase substantially, averaging 2.88% from

1971 to 1999 versus 4.40% from 2000 to 2019. When we examine the ratio of aggregate payouts to

aggregate operating income, we see a large increase as well; the ratio averages 19.19% from 1971 to 1999

and 33.68% from 2000 to 2019. The year 2018 stands out. It is the first year that corporations can take

advantage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and is the only year when real payouts exceed $1

trillion. In that year, aggregate payouts are 48.72% of aggregate operating income.

    Much of the recent debate about payouts focuses on repurchases. In our data, the growth in the average

payout rate, defined as the ratio of payout to operating income, comes entirely from repurchases. This

finding is consistent with the evidence in Skinner (2008) on the growing importance of repurchases.

Dividends average 14.39% of operating income from 1971 to 1999 and 14.42% from 2000 to 2019. In

contrast, net repurchases average 4.80% of operating income before 2000 and 19.27% from 2000 to 2019.

Some readers might argue that our evidence shows that payouts are high because of repurchases. In other

words, if firms only paid dividends, payouts would be much lower. However, there is no basis for such a

conclusion. If firms could not pay out via repurchases, they likely would have increased their dividends

(Grullon and Michaely, 2002). A more careful analysis is therefore required to understand why payouts are

so much higher in the 2000s.

    To understand the increase in payouts, we must distinguish between two potential sources. If a firm's

income increases, it can pay out more. Consequently, as long as firms' propensity to pay is constant, payouts

increase as income increases. We show that aggregate earnings growth explains 37% of the increase in real

constant dollar aggregate payouts from 1971-1999 to the 2000s. Payouts can also increase because firms'

propensity to pay increases. The payout rate measures propensity to pay. We demonstrate that increases in

payout rates account for 63% of the increase in payouts. In regressions predicting aggregate payouts, we

find that the best predictor of aggregate payouts is aggregate earnings. Macroeconomic conditions do not

help explain the increase in payouts. Consequently, to explain the increase in aggregate payouts, we have

to understand why firms choose to have higher payout rates in the 2000s.

    In Section 2, we investigate whether firms have changed in ways that can explain an increase in payout

rates. Because the dollar payouts of the 200 firms with the highest payouts amount to more than 80% of the

payouts every year in our sample, we consider separately how the top 200 payers (the top payers) change

from 1971-1999 to 2000-2019 compared to the other payers; we similarly compare payers and nonpayers.

We find that the top payers are highly successful, older firms that are much larger in the 2000s than before.

                                                     2
The lifecycle model of payouts (DeAngelo, DeAngelo, and Stulz, 2006) predicts that younger firms should

invest heavily and have no payouts, while older, larger, successful firms have free cash flow that they can

pay out. Though there has been much concern about the decrease in capital expenditures of U.S. firms and

whether it is due to increased payouts, capital expenditures fall similarly for payers and nonpayers.

Nonpayers use the cash released by lower capital expenditures to increase R&D. In contrast, payers (and

especially the top payers) increase R&D spending, but by less than the decrease in capital expenditures;

thus they have an increase in free cash flow that enables them to make larger payouts. This change in how

firms invest reflects the growing importance of intangible assets and the fact that younger firms invest at a

higher rate (see Kahle and Stulz, 2017, for references).

    In Section 3, we investigate whether changes in firm characteristics can explain the change in payout

rates. Unfortunately, there is no established empirical model in finance that provides a quantitative estimate

of the optimal payout rate as a function of firm characteristics. In the absence of such a model, we use two

empirical approaches to determine whether changes in firm characteristics can explain the high payout rates

of the 2000s. In the first approach, we use data from 1971 through 1999 to estimate payout rate models. To

avoid data snooping concerns, we include firm characteristics common in the payout literature. We then

use these models to predict payout rates from 2000 through 2019. If models estimated from 1971 to 1999

predict payouts well in the 2000s, then changes in firm characteristics explain changes in payout rates. In

the second approach, we estimate models over the whole sample period (1971-2019) but allow for intercept

and/or slope changes in the 2000s to assess whether firms pay out differently in the 2000s. With this

approach, changes in intercepts and/or slopes indicate that changes in firm characteristics are not sufficient

to explain changes in payout rates.

    When examining firm-level payout rates, a model estimated on data from 1971 to 1999 predicts an

increase in the average payout rate. For the sample of firms with required data, the average payout rate of

the whole sample is 8.17 percentage points higher in the 2000s relative to 1971-1999. When we restrict this

sample to firms that have payouts, the difference increases to 14.20 percentage points. When we estimate

the model over 1971-1999, this model predicts an increase of 4.65 percentage points in the average payout

                                                      3
rate if estimated for all firms and an increase of 5.07 percentage points if estimated only on the firms with

payouts. Another way to look at the performance of the model is that it explains 56.92% of the increase in

the average payout rate when estimated on the whole sample and 35.74% when estimated on the sample of

payers only. However, looking at the average predictions over 2000-2019 understates the importance of

changes in firm characteristics in explaining the increase in the payout rate. First, the model performs better

if our sample period stops in 2017 instead of 2019. This is because the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts (TCJA)

causes firms to pay out more for reasons that are not captured by our model. Specifically, in that case, we

explain 84.56% of the increase in the payout rate for the whole sample and 59.32% of the increase for

payers. Second, focusing on payers, although the model underpredicts mean payout rates in the 2000s, it

overpredicts median payout rates. Consequently, the underprediction is driven by firms at the right tail of

payout rates.

    We also investigate whether payout rates are higher in the 2000s by estimating our models over the

whole sample period but allowing for an increase in the payout rate in the 2000s, in the 2010s, and in 2018

regardless of firm characteristics. We find no evidence that a firm pays out more in the 2000s than it did

before, given its characteristics. In other words, existing firms do not suddenly pay out more. However,

among firms that pay, the firms that initiate payouts in the 2000s have higher payouts than predicted by

their characteristics. Specifically, using the sample of payers, the average percentage prediction error for

the mean payout rate in the 2000s is 20.82% for firms that initiate payouts before 2000 and is 30.29% for

firms that initiate them afterwards. Further, we find that the firms with higher payouts are firms that initiate

payouts with repurchases. Repurchases are a more flexible tool for payouts than dividends in that firms can

vary the amount of equity they repurchase each year without fearing the adverse consequences associated

with dividend cuts (Jagannathan, Stephens, and Weisbach, 2000).

    Since models estimated from 1971 to 1999 explain a sizeable fraction of the increase in payout rates

during the 2000s, changes in firm characteristics must be of first-order importance to understand why

payout rates increase. We find that the most important firm characteristics in explaining the change in

payout rates for the whole sample are, in order, firm size, age, cash holdings, and leverage. When we turn

                                                       4
to payers only, the most important firm characteristics are, again in order of importance, cash holdings,

leverage, age, and capital expenditures. Although capital expenditures decrease in the 2000s (Gutierrez and

Philippon, 2017; Alexander and Eberly, 2018) and are negatively related to payouts, the decrease in capital

expenditures is not among the top three changes in firm characteristics explaining the increase in payout

rates for either all firms or for the payers only.

    We expect that increased monitoring by institutional investors pushes firms to more aggressively

maximize shareholder wealth in the 2000s than during the pre-2000 period. With this hypothesis, payout

rates should be more strongly related to firm characteristics in the 2000s than before. In Section 4, we find

that this is the case. We show that our model explains at least 65% of the increase in the payout rate for the

sample of payers. We also show that firms pay out more of their free cash flow in the 2000s than before. In

Section 5, we report a number of robustness investigations and extensions. In particular, we account for

market-timing, cross-market arbitrage, and differences between multinational firms and domestic firms.



1. The increase in aggregate payouts.

    In this section, we first introduce the sample used throughout the paper. We then show that payouts are

much higher in 2000-2019 than in 1971-1999 and that the increase takes place through an increase in

repurchases. The increase in the dollar amount of payouts is due to both an increase in operating income

and an increase in payout rates, but the increase in payout rates accounts for almost twice as much of the

increase in average yearly aggregate payouts from pre-2000 to the 2000s than the increase in operating

income ­ 63.15% versus 36.85%. Finally, we show that macroeconomic factors do not explain the increase

in aggregate payouts beyond their impact on earnings.



1.1. The sample.

    Our initial data source is all firms in Compustat from 1971 to 2019. We start in 1971 because Compustat

data on share repurchases and equity issuance are unavailable before then. We exclude firms not

incorporated in the U.S., as well as financial firms and utilities (Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)

                                                      5
codes 6000­6999 and 4900­4949, respectively) because of their statutory capital requirements and other

regulatory restrictions. We also exclude firms with missing data for total assets (AT), dividends (DV), and

market capitalization (CSHO and PRCC_F). We merge these observations with data from the Center for

Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and restrict the sample to NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ firms with

CRSP shares codes 10 or 11.

    Following Banyi, Dyl, and Kahle (2008), we compute share repurchases as the purchase of common

and preferred stock (PRSTKC) minus any reduction in the value of preferred stock; depending on

availability, we use redemption (PSTKRV), liquidating (PSTKL), or par value (PSTK) for the value of

preferred stock. However, firms often simultaneously issue and repurchase equity, so it is not clear when a

firm has a positive gross payout whether it is raising funds or returning cash to shareholders (Grullon, Paye,

Underwood, and Weston, 2011). In particular, firms that are concerned about the dilutive effect of stock-

based compensation may offset the dilution by repurchasing (Kahle, 2002; Bonaimé, Kahle, Moore, and

Nemani, 2020). Consequently, we compute net repurchases, defined as repurchases minus issuance of stock

(SSTK). If either calculation yields a negative value, (net) repurchases are set to zero. Dividends are

measured as cash dividends (DV). Gross (net) payout is defined as the sum of dividends and (net) share

repurchases. In the remainder of the paper, we focus on net payouts. Our conclusions are robust to using

gross payouts instead. All dollar values are reported in real 2017 dollars using the CPI. The Appendix

contains a complete list of variable names and calculations.



1.2. Aggregate constant dollar payouts.

    We begin by examining aggregate payouts from 1971 to 2019. Aggregate payouts are obtained by

summing the dollar payouts of all firms in our sample. Since we exclude financial firms and utilities,

however, our aggregate values do not represent the aggregate payouts of all public firms. As shown in

Figure 1, aggregate real net payouts increase over time. They equal $103 billion in 1971. They first exceed

$200 billion in 1987, fall to $154 billion in 1991, and then increase steadily to more than $300 billion in

1998. Aggregate net payouts exceed $500 ($600) billion for the first time in 2005 (2006) and in 2007 they

                                                      6
reach $740 billion. Net payouts fall during the global financial crisis (GFC) and, in 2009, only $353 billion

is paid out. They recover quickly, however, and in 2014 exceed their 2007 peak. Not surprisingly, the all-

time peak is in 2018, the year that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts (TCJA) becomes effective, when net real

payouts exceed $1 trillion. Our conclusions are robust to excluding 2018 from our sample.

    Table 1 provides summary statistics for relevant sample periods. We refer to the period from 1971 to

1999 as the pre-2000 period. The post-2000 period (or 2000s) starts in 2000 and ends in 2019. We divide

this period into the pre-GFC period (2000-2007) and the 2010s (2010-2019). Panel A shows results for the

aggregate real dollar amounts for each period and the yearly averages in each period. Panel B tabulates

yearly averages of ratios of interest.

    Column (1) of Panel A shows aggregate real net payouts. In the pre-2000 period, total real net payouts

equal $4,965 billion. In the post-2000 period, the total is more than twice the amount in the pre-2000 period.

62.98% of net real payouts in the 2000s are paid out in the 2010s. We also show the yearly averages. Not

surprisingly, the yearly average increases sharply from before to after 2000. Specifically, the yearly average

total net payouts are 3.43 times larger in the post-2000 period than in the pre-2000 period. The average is

73.28% higher in the 2010s than from 2000 to 2007. The only year in which aggregate net real payout

exceeds $1 trillion is 2018, when it is $1,016 billion.

    The high payouts of the 2000s are often attributed to the growth of repurchases, so Figure 1 also shows

dividends and net repurchases separately. Real net repurchases are extremely low before the 1982 SEC

Rule 10b-18 safe harbor that facilitated repurchases. Real net repurchases increase after 1982, but they do

not exceed $100 billion until 1997. After 1997, they exceed dividend payments in every year except for

2001-2003 and 2009. Net repurchases are extremely large in 2007; the only year with higher net repurchases

is 2018. In contrast to net repurchases, the path of dividends is much smoother. In constant dollars,

dividends equal $100 billion in 1971. They increase fairly steadily, but do not exceed $200 billion until

2005, and $300 billion until 2014.

    Columns (2) and (3) of Panel A show the summary statistics for aggregate real dividends and net real

repurchases, respectively. In our sample, total dividend payments are $3,589 billion in the pre-2000 period

                                                      7
and $4,979 in the post-2000 period. Since the pre-2000 period is much longer than the post-2000 period, it

is not surprising that annual average dividends are higher in the 2000s than before. Real average annual

dividend payments are 2.01 times higher in the 2000s than before, and are 76.68% higher in the 2010s

compared to the 2000-2007 period. The increase in net real repurchases is much more dramatic than the

increase in real dividends. The sum of real net repurchases is 4.93 times larger in the 2000s than before

2000. Perhaps more importantly, the annual average of real net repurchases is 7.14 times higher in the 2000s

than it was before 2000. Even more dramatically, average real net repurchases from 2010 to 2019 are 9.02

times larger than average real net repurchases before 2000.



1.3. Increase in income or increase in payout rate?

    A firm earns income that it can distribute to shareholders. In a steady state, the amount the firm can pay

out depends on its earnings. Consequently, payouts can be viewed as the product of the payout rate and the

available income, where the payout rate is the fraction of available income that the firm pays out. One could

define available income as net income. However, net income is problematic both because it includes many

transitory items and because it is negative in the aggregate in two years during our sample period. Floyd,

Li, and Skinner (2015) compute an aggregate payout rate using net income by setting a firm's net income

to zero if negative. Operating income has also been used in the literature as a measure of a firm's ability to

pay out (e.g., Jagannathan, Stephens, and Weisbach, 2000). Operating income is never negative in the

aggregate during our sample period and is less affected by transitory items. Consequently, we standardize

payout by aggregate operating income, computed by adding the operating income of all firms, and

investigate the following relation:

                Payout = Payout rate x Operating income                                              (1)

In this equation, payout can increase either because the payout rate increases or because operating income

increases. Note that in the following analyses, we focus on payout net of equity issuance; we use the term

gross payout to denote payout when we do not subtract equity issuance.

                                                      8
    In Columns (4), (5), and (6) of Panel A of Table 1, we show how aggregate real operating income,

assets, and market capitalization differ in our various sub-periods. Starting with operating income, the

annual average of aggregate real operating income increases less than the annual average of payouts

between the pre-2000s and the 2000s. Specifically, annual real operating income increases by a factor of

1.93 while net real payouts increase by a factor of 3.43. The average of annual real assets increases by a

factor of 2.19 from the pre-2000 period to the 2000s. Lastly, annual average aggregate real market

capitalization increases by a factor of 3.01. Aggregate market capitalization increases much more than

either operating income or assets.

    Real payouts increase much more than operating income. Consequently, the payout rate must increase

from the pre-2000 period to the 2000s. Figure 2 shows the payout rate over time. In 1971, the payout rate

is 18.46%. It exceeds 20% for the first time in 1984 and remains above 20% from 1984 to 1999, with the

exception of 1991 to 1995. Before 2000, the highest value of the payout rate is 25.93% in 1998. It rises

above 30% in 2005. After this, the payout rate falls below 30% only in 2009 and in 2010, when it is 24.50%

and 27.10%, respectively. Following the global financial crisis, the payout rate exceeds 40% for the first

time in 2014 and reaches 48.72% in 2018 before falling back to 42.61% in 2019. As shown in Panel B of

Table 1, the average annual payout rate is 19.19% in the pre-2000s and 33.68% in the 2000s, an increase

of 75.55%. The average annual payout rate increases further by 38.51% from 2000-2007 to the 2010s.

Column (8) shows similar results for the payout rate computed using gross payouts instead of net payouts.

    The increase in the payout rate between the pre-2000s and the 2000s is entirely due to an increase in

the repurchase rate. The dividend payout rate is almost the same for both periods. However, the averages

mask the fact that the dividend payout rate follows a u-shape with the lowest dividend rate in 2000. This

evolution is consistent with evidence of disappearing dividends before 2000 (Fama and French, 2002) and

of reappearing dividends in the 2000s (Michaely and Moin, 2019). The story for net repurchases is quite

different, as shown in Column (3). Before 2000, the average of net repurchases divided by operating income

is 4.8%. In the 2000s, the average is 19.27%, or 4.01 times higher. Column (4) shows net repurchases as a



                                                    9
percentage of total payout. Before 2000, repurchases average 22.22% of aggregate payout. In the 2000s,

they average 55.88%. Column (7) shows that a similar result holds for gross repurchases.

    Using the statistics in Table 1, we can assess what the average aggregate real payout would have been

in the 2000s had the payout rate remained at its pre-2000 average. We find that instead of averaging $587

billion per year, real payouts would have averaged $325 billion per year. Since the aggregate real payout

averaged $171 billion before 1999, it follows that the bulk of the increase in the average aggregate real

payout is due to the increase in the payout rate. The average aggregate real payout increases by 243.4%

from pre-2000 to the 2000s. With a constant payout rate, the aggregate average real payout would have

increased by 89.69%. It follows that 36.85% of the increase in the average aggregate real payout is due to

an increase in dollar operating income and 63.15% is due to an increase in the payout rate.



1.4. Can macroeconomic factors explain the increase in the payout rate?

    To understand the increase in payouts, we have to understand the increase in the payout rate. A simple

possible explanation for the variation in the payout rate is changes in macroeconomic conditions that make

firms more comfortable with higher payouts. To examine this possibility, we estimate a model that follows

Dittmar and Dittmar (2004). However, we use annual data in order to avoid seasonality issues and to make

our estimates comparable to our later firm-level analysis. Dittmar and Dittmar regress log changes in

aggregate payout on permanent and temporary earnings, as well as variables that capture economic

conditions. For each earnings variable, they use lagged changes in the logarithm of the variable. This means

that if the change in payouts is measured from t-1 to t, the change in an earnings variable is measured from

t-2 to t-1. They use market to book as a measure of growth opportunities, and again include lagged changes.

They also include the return on the value-weighted market portfolio for both t-1 and t+1. Firms tend to issue

more equity when their stock has performed well. Behavioral finance models use the lead return as a proxy

for market timing, with the prediction that firms are more likely to issue equity when that return is low and

buy back shares when it is high. We include the lagged yield on the 10-year Baa bond as a proxy for the

cost of borrowing. A higher yield makes it harder for firms to raise funds through debt to finance payouts.

                                                     10
Lastly, we include the lead and lagged changes in the log of GDP. The predictions associated with GDP are

ambiguous. On the one hand, high growth means good investment opportunities and hence more

investment, so firms pay out less. On the other hand, high growth means that firms worry less about bad

times and hence do not need a large liquidity buffer.

    We estimate this model from 1971 to 1999, and then use the results to predict real aggregate payouts

in the 2000s. Figure 3 shows actual and predicted payouts. To obtain the predicted net payouts, we use the

actual values of the dependent variables in each year in the 2000s and the coefficients from the model. The

log change in payout for 2000 uses the actual payout in 1999 as the lagged value. In subsequent years, the

predicted log change uses lagged predicted values to calculate the change. Because we use lead variables,

we can only predict aggregate payouts until 2018. We see that the path of predicted aggregate payouts is

similar to the path for actual aggregate payouts, but there are large differences between actual and predicted

payouts in many years. The average realized aggregate real payout is $572.6 billion while the average

predicted aggregate real net payout is $428.1 billion. To see the importance of earnings in explaining

payouts, we can freeze earnings at their 1999 level when predicting the values. When we do that, the model

predicts essentially the same net real payout in 2019 as in 2000. It follows that the macroeconomic variables

do not help in predicting aggregate payouts once one accounts for aggregate earnings.



2. Firm changes and increased payouts.

    As discussed, the increase in the aggregate payout rate is a bigger contributor to the increase in payouts

than the increase in aggregate earnings. In the remainder of this paper, we investigate this increase in the

payout rate. The starting point is to understand how firms change over time and how these changes lead

them to pay out more of their earnings. The finance literature provides guidance for the firm characteristics

that affect the payout rate and how they do so.




                                                     11
    Firm characteristics play a key role in theories of payouts and payout rates. 3 It is well-established that

firms should pay out funds that they cannot productively reinvest. In general, because young firms have

better growth opportunities, they are not expected to pay dividends or repurchase shares (DeAngelo,

DeAngelo, and Stulz, 2006). Profitable older firms have fewer growth opportunities, and thus should pay

out the funds they cannot invest profitably. We therefore expect the payout rate to increase with firm age

and size. Financially constrained firms need to conserve their resources to survive, so we expect the payout

rate to be lower for firms with high leverage or accounting losses. Firms with more growth opportunities

should pay out less (e.g., Smith and Watts, 1992). Therefore, we expect firms that invest through capital

expenditures, R&D, or acquisitions to have lower payouts. Tobin's q, measured as the ratio of the market

value of assets to the book value of assets, is often used as a measure of growth opportunities. However,

Tobin's q could also proxy for rents (Stigler, 1964), in which case payouts would be positively correlated

with Tobin's q (Lee, Shin, and Stulz, 2020), or overvaluation. Undervalued firms should repurchase more,

so if a low Tobin's q proxies for undervaluation, low q firms should repurchase more. Firms with large cash

holdings have more internal resources, so all else equal, they are likely to pay out more. Finally, agency

costs can cause firms to have a lower payout rate if management prefers to hoard cash (Jensen, 1986).

    Aggregate payouts reflect the payouts of the largest firms. As shown by DeAngelo, DeAngelo, and

Skinner (2004), a small number of firms account for a large share of aggregate dividends. We classify the

200 firms with the largest dollar payouts as the top payers in each year. In our sample period, a large fraction

of the aggregate net real payouts is accounted for by these firms. In the pre-2000 period, the top payers

account for an average of 82.31% of aggregate payouts. In the 2000s, they account for 87.09% of aggregate

payouts. In Panel A of Table 2, we examine how the top payers and other payers change. In Panel B, we

show how payers and non-payers change over time. We proceed in three steps. First, we show how firm

performance and payouts differ in the 2000s. Second, we examine how firms' investments and balance

 The literature on payout policy is extremely large. For specific citations, we refer to recent surveys such as DeAngelo,
DeAngelo, and Skinner (2008) and Farre-Mensa, Michaely, and Schmalz (2014).

sheets in the 2000s compare to their investments and balance sheets in 1971-1999. Finally, we investigate

whether the financing of payouts is different in the 2000s.



2.1. Firm payouts and performance.

    As shown in Panel A of Table 2, the payouts of the top payers are large in the 2000s, averaging $2.54

billion per firm in 2017 dollars. Prior to 2000, the payouts were $710 million on average. Though the real

payouts of the top payers increase sharply, they do not increase more in percentage terms than for the other

payers. Neither do their operating income, assets, or market value. However, their payout rate increases by

73.81%, from 32.95% to 57.27%. In contrast, the payout rate of the other payers increases by 56.72%, from

19.80% to 31.03%. As discussed previously, the finance literature expects that older, more successful firms

have higher payout rates. We show the average age of the top payers and the other payers. The top payers'

average age is much higher than the other payers' both before 2000 and in the 2000s. The average age of

the other payers increases from 13.63 to 20.82 years. In contrast, the average age of the top payers hardly

changes, as it is 38.05 years before 2000 and 37.64 years in the 2000s.

    Though we do not tabulate the results, the top payers in the 2000s include firms that become top payers

before 2000 as well as firms that become top payers in the 2000s. In our sample, there are 1096 unique

firms that are top payers for at least one year from 1971-2019. Of these, 385 become top payers for the first

time in the 2000s. These firms are smaller and younger, but surprisingly they have a very high payout rate

in the 2000s of 75.30%, compared to 48.08% for firms that become top payers before 2000.

    Panel B shows similar results when examining nonpayers versus payers. It is striking that real operating

income, real assets, and real market value increase much more for non-payers than payers. For example,

the average real dollar market value of nonpayers increases by 554% from 1971-1999 to 2000-2019,

compared to an increase of 294% for payers. This evolution is in part the outcome of a sharp drop in the

number of listed firms in the 2000s that results in an increase in the average size of firms (Doidge, Karolyi,

and Stulz, 2017). Further, the abnormally low level of IPOs causes the age of firms to increase. We see that

the average age of payers and nonpayers increases, but more so for nonpayers than payers.

                                                     13
    We now turn to firm performance. We report these values in year t-1 relative to when the firm is

classified as a top payer to avoid having our inferences muddied by an exceptional year when a firm

becomes a top payer. First, we report operating income to lagged assets. Operating income is higher for the

top payers than for other payers both before 2000 and in the 2000s. The difference in operating income

between the two groups is wider in the 2000s, however. Specifically, operating income to lagged assets of

the top payers is slightly lower in the 2000s than before, but lower by 3.82 percentage points for the other

payers. Examining net income, the net income of the top payers increases in the 2000s, whereas it decreases

for the other payers. The firms that become top payers in the 2000s have higher operating income to lagged

assets and net income to lagged assets than the firms that become top payers before 2000 (untabulated).

    The clear picture that emerges is that top payers are large, successful firms. This is quite obvious if we

focus on the highest payer. In general, the highest payer is a firm that has been, is, or will become the firm

with the highest market capitalization. For the last six years, the highest payer is Apple. Top payers are

large, profitable firms compared to other payers or nonpayers before 2000 as well. The most frequent top

payer before 2000 is AT&T, which ranks as the top payer in 13 years. Exxon Mobil is the top payer six

times before 2000 and eight times after. The size of top payers relative to the size of other payers is not

larger in the 2000s, but their performance is. In 1971-1999, their average operating income to lagged assets

is only 16.76% higher than for the other payers. In the 2000s, it is 45.90% higher.



2.2. Investment and balance sheet characteristics.

    As discussed in the introduction, there is much concern that firms reduce investments to make payouts.

Compared to young firms, older firms invest less because they have fewer growth opportunities (Loderer,

Stulz, and Walchli, 2017). Hence, finding that payers invest less is expected because payers are older firms.

However, if firms decrease investment to pay out, we would expect investment to fall more for the top

payers than other firms. Consequently, Table 2 also examines the investments of top payers versus other

payers, and payers versus nonpayers. In Panel A, we see that the top payers have a lower capital

expenditures to lagged assets ratio than the other payers both before and after 2000. However, this ratio

                                                     14
falls for both types of payers. Before 2000, the average ratio of capital expenditures to lagged assets is

9.01% for the top payers and 9.21% for the other payers. In the 2000s, the ratio falls to 5.11% for the top

payers and to 5.89% for the other payers. The difference between the two ratios is not significant before the

2000s but is in the 2000s. When we compare payers versus nonpayers, capital expenditures are significantly

lower for payers than for nonpayers before 2000, but not in the 2000s. Further, in both percent and

percentage points, capital expenditures fall less for payers (-37.11% and 3.41 percentage points) than for

nonpayers (-44.16% and 5.03 percentage points). It follows that the drop in capital expenditures occurs

equally for top payers and other payers, as well as for payers and nonpayers.

    Acquisitions are another component of investment. In contrast to capital expenditures, acquisitions

increase slightly for all groups. However, the ratio of acquisitions to lagged assets is the same both before

2000 and after for top payers and other payers, as well as for payers and nonpayers.

    R&D expenditures are not capitalized under GAAP, but from an economic perspective, they are

investments. R&D is often used as a measure of growth opportunities (e.g., Billett, King, and Mauer, 2007).

Younger firms have more growth opportunities and invest more in R&D (Loderer, Stulz, and Walchli,

2017). There is a large difference in R&D between payers and nonpayers before 2000 and this difference

grows in the 2000s. Nonpayers (payers) have an average ratio of R&D to lagged assets of 5.80% (2.07%)

before 2000. The ratio increases in the 2000s for both payers and nonpayers, but the ratio for payers

increases from 2.07% to 3.03%, while the ratio for nonpayers increases from 5.80% to 14.08%. For

nonpayers, R&D is roughly half of capital expenditures before 2000 and more than twice capital

expenditures in the 2000s. Since R&D expenses increase for payers, changes in R&D obviously do not

generate funds for payouts. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) and advertising expenses are used

as proxies for intangible investment (Peters and Taylor, 2017). Nonpayers have much greater SG&A than

payers. Their ratio of SG&A to sales increases by 54.02%. The ratio for payers increases by half that

amount.

    We next examine Tobin's q. The q-theory of investment predicts that payers have a lower Tobin's q

since they invest less. Table 2 shows that the top payers have a higher q than the other payers both before

                                                     15
2000 and in the 2000s. Such a result is surprising because, if Tobin's q is a measure of growth opportunities,

the top payers have better growth opportunities and would be expected to invest more and pay out less than

other payers. From before 2000 to the 2000s, the q of top payers increases by 46.57% while the q of other

payers increases by 30.15%. When we turn to payers versus nonpayers, we find that the q of nonpayers is

much higher than the q of payers in both periods. Though we do not tabulate the results for the firms that

enter the top 200 payers in the 2000s, these firms have especially high q's. Specifically, the average Tobin's

q of firms that enter the top 200 in the 2000s is 2.21, versus 1.78 for firms that enter before 2000. Noticeably,

the firms that enter the top 200 payers in the 2000s have a higher q than nonpayers. These firms are a puzzle

for the traditional q theory. It is also difficult to argue that these firms suffer from undervaluation. A more

plausible explanation is that, for these firms, Tobin's q is more a measure of rents than a measure of

investment opportunities (Lee, Shin, and Stulz, 2020).

    Firms can also invest in cash holdings. Not surprisingly, cash holdings are higher in the 2000s for all

types of firms considered. The percentage increase is highest for nonpayers, whose average cash holdings

to assets ratio doubles from 1971-1999 to the 2000s. At the same time, nonpayers are less levered than

payers, whether we examine book leverage or market leverage.



2.3. How do firms fund their payouts?

    Firms must fund their payouts somehow. The cash flow (CF) identity provides a useful tool to explore

how firms fund increased payouts. With that identity, we have:

    CF from operations + CF from investing activities + CF from financing = Cash + Payouts               (2)

Usually, payouts are considered a cash flow from financing but we remove them and consider them

separately. Note that CF from investing activities is typically negative, so if firms spend less on investment,

CF from investing activities increases. With this identity, an increase in payouts has to be funded through

an increase in CF from operations (OCF), an increase in CF from investment, an increase in CF from

financing, or a decrease in cash holdings. There is no causality implied in this identity. In particular, if cash


                                                       16
flows from investing activities become less negative and payouts increase, it does not mean that the increase

in payouts causes investing activities to decrease. Investment is endogenous. Firms could choose to cut

investment in order to pay out more. However, the pattern of changes in investment documented in Section

2.2 is inconsistent with the view that top payers decrease investment to fund payouts because the drop in

capital expenditures does not differ across firms depending on whether they are top payers, other payers,

or nonpayers.

    To assess how firms fund their payouts, we use variables as of date t, in contrast to using variables as

of date t-1 in the previous section. The reason is straightforward: we are assessing how firms fund payouts

as of date t, whereas before we assessed firm characteristics for groups of firms that we did not want to be

affected by their selection into those groups. We normalize all variables by lagged assets. We show next

the payout over lagged assets ratio. Not surprisingly, this ratio increases a lot for both the top payers and

the other payers. It increases most for the top payers (by 3.91 percentage points, or 66.16%). OCF for top

payers increases by 2.40 percentage points, even though operating income does not, because firms pay less

taxes and less interest in the 2000s. The increase in OCF is not sufficient to fund the increase in payouts.

However, investment (defined as capital expenditures plus acquisitions) for the top payers falls by 3.34

percentage points, so the combination of the increase in OCF plus the decrease in investment equals 5.74%

percentage points and is more than enough to fund the increase in payouts. For the other payers, OCF plus

investment is close to zero.

    Firms for which OCF plus investment is close to zero can still make payouts, but they have to issue

debt or reduce cash holdings. In general, firms issue debt if they grow and wish to keep their leverage ratio

stable. Debt increases make it possible for firms to pay out more (Farre-Mensa, Michaely, and Schmalz,

2018). Debt increases for top payers and other payers. Before 2000, there is no difference in the change in

debt for top payers versus other payers. In the 2000s, top payers increase debt normalized by lagged assets

significantly more than other payers. It is not surprising, therefore, that cash increases for top payers as well

as for the other payers, but it increases more for other payers both before 2000 and in the 2000s. However,

the difference in the increase in debt over lagged assets between top payers and other payers is only

                                                       17
approximately a quarter of the difference in payouts over lagged assets ­ 1.49 percentage points versus 5.65

percentage points ­ so absent increases in debt, there would still be a large difference in payouts between

top payers and other payers.

    Turning to payers versus nonpayers, the average OCF for payers is roughly equal to their investment

in the 2000s, but is less than that before. For nonpayers, the average OCF is negative both in the 2000s and

before. The low OCF of nonpayers is largely explained by the high R&D. Both before 2000 and in the

2000s, the sum of R&D and OCF for nonpayers is roughly zero. Hence, if R&D expenses were capitalized,

operating cash flow would be zero for these firms. Both payers and nonpayers increase debt. There is no

difference in the change in debt between payers and nonpayers before 2000 or in the 2000s. As we see in

Panel B, cash holdings increase much more for nonpayers than payers. The increase in debt cannot explain

that difference. Though we do not tabulate the results, an important contributor to the increase in cash is

equity issuance. In the 2000s, the average rate of equity issuance over lagged assets is 3.6% for payers and

28.3% for nonpayers.

    An alternative approach is to compute average free cash flow (FCF) directly, where FCF is defined as:

                  Free cash flow (FCF) = Max[OCF ­ investment, 0]                                      (3)

Investment includes capital expenditures and acquisitions. If firms pay out some of their cash flow in

excess of investment, FCF measures what a firm has available to pay out, absent cash flow from financing

and using its cash holdings. Before 2000, the ratio of FCF to lagged assets for top payers is not different

from the ratio for other payers. FCF for top payers more than doubles from before 2000 to the 2000s,

increasing by 107.02% from 3.56% to 7.37%. For other payers, FCF increases by 42.99% from 3.42% to

4.89%. Not surprisingly, in the 2000s, FCF of top payers is significantly higher than FCF of other payers.

Turning to payers versus nonpayers, FCF does not change for nonpayers but increases by 51.31% for

payers. Overall, the average FCF is much higher in the 2000s for payers, and especially for top payers.

    In summary, payers and especially top payers are more profitable in the 2000s than before on a cash

flow basis. They spend less on investment. Therefore, they have more free cash flow. They could choose


                                                    18
to hoard that free cash flow. However, they instead increase their payout rate and their payouts. The

nonpayers also invest less. Their free cash flow does not increase because their expenses increase as a result

of higher R&D. Had payers increased R&D expenses as much as non-payers, their operating cash flow

would be lower and they would have no free cash flow. However, payers are older and spend substantially

less on R&D than nonpayers. By having large payouts, the payers make it possible for investors to fund the

R&D expenses of the younger firms.



3. Can firm changes explain the increase in payout rates?

    Section 1 shows that the most important factor in explaining the increase in payouts from the pre-2000s

to the 2000s is an increase in payout rates. Section 2 shows how changes in firm characteristics between

the pre-2000 period and the 2000s imply an increase in payout rates based on the lifecycle theory. In this

section, we use two different approaches to investigate whether changing firm characteristics can explain

the increase in payout rates. Both approaches start from regressions that relate firms' payout rates to lagged

firm characteristics motivated by the financial economics literature. In the first approach, we use the

coefficients from regressions estimated from 1971 to 1999 to predict net payout rates during the 2000s,

conditional on the realizations of the explanatory variables. With the second approach, we estimate the

same regressions over the whole period but allow for intercept changes in the 2000s. Significant intercept

changes would indicate that firm characteristic changes are not sufficient to explain changes in payout rates.

Finally, we use the regression models to assess which changes in firm characteristics between 1971-1999

and 2000-2019 are most important in explaining why the net payout rate is higher in the 2000s.



3.1. Predicting payouts in the 2000s.

    In our first approach to examining whether changes in firm characteristics can explain changes in

payout rates, we estimate the relation between payout rates and lagged firm characteristics in the pre-2000

period. We then use that regression to predict payout rates in the 2000s, given realized firm characteristics.

The use of lagged characteristics gives our regression the interpretation of a forecasting regression. In Table

                                                      19
3, we show estimates of these models, with standard errors clustered by firm and year. The regressions

address the question: given a firm's characteristics in one year, what are its expected payouts the next year?

Note that our model does not include a firm's stock performance as an explanatory variable for the simple

reason that a firm's stock price is the present value of future payouts.

    Column (1) presents estimates using all firms with positive operating income. As expected, the payout

rate increases with asset size and firm age. From our discussion in Section 2, the payout rate should be

negatively related to variables that proxy for financial constraints. We find negative and significant

coefficients both on leverage and on an indicator variable for accounting loss. The payout rate is lower for

firms with a higher Tobin's q ratio, which is what one would expect if Tobin's q proxies for growth

opportunities. As predicted by models that emphasize growth opportunities, greater investment in R&D and

capital expenditures is associated with a lower payout rate. The payout rate also increases with cash

holdings. Surprisingly, lagged operating cash flow does not have a significant coefficient. We include an

indicator variable for high tech firms given the importance of option compensation for these firms, at least

prior to the 2005 adoption of FAS 123R, which changed the accounting treatment of option compensation.

This indicator variable is significantly negative. Firms with higher SG&A expenses and higher advertising

expenses have higher payouts. These variables could proxy for intangible assets that are associated with

rents that established firms harvest. Column (2) shows estimates of the regression when run on the sample

of payers only. A few coefficients lose significance or even change sign. Specifically, cash flow from

operations has a significantly negative coefficient, the accounting loss indicator variable has a significantly

positive coefficient, and the high-tech indicator variable is insignificant.

    We use the models in Columns (1) and (2) to forecast payout rates conditional on realized firm

characteristics. In other words, we forecast a firm's payout rate in year t using the coefficients in Columns

(1) and (2) and the actual values for the independent variables for that firm in year t-1. In Figure 4, we plot

the predicted average payout rate for each year in the 2000s from our regressions estimated before 2000.

Panel A shows the predicted payout rates from a regression that uses all firms. On average, the predicted

values for the 2000s are close to, but lower than, the actual values. More precisely, the average of the

                                                      20
predicted values is 17.86% and the average of the actual values is 21.85%. The model underpredicts payouts

by an average of 3.99 percentage points or by 18.26%. Since the average pre-2000s payout rate is 12.93%,

the regression predicts an increase in payout rates in the 2000s. If firms made payout decisions in the 2000s

in the same way as they did earlier, the average net payout rate would have increased by 36.66%. However,

as is evident from Panel A, the regression model does not do a good job of capturing the high payout rates

in 2007-2008 and 2014-2019. Further, the difference between the average actual payout rate (25.81%) and

the predicted payout rate (19.10%) is larger in the 2010s.

    When we redo the analysis for the payers only, the model again predicts an increase in average payout

rates in the 2000s, as shown in Figure 4, Panel B. The model predicts an increase in the average annual

payout rate from 20.56% in the pre-2000 period to 25.76% in the 2000s. However, the model systematically

underpredicts the payout rate and performs worse than the model that includes all firms. Specifically, the

actual average payout rate is 34.58% in the 2000s, or 68.19% higher than the pre-2000 average and 34.24%

higher than the predicted average payout rate. The underprediction is worse in the 2010s as the predicted

average payout rate is 26.49% and the actual payout rate is 36.43%. Panel B of Figure 4 shows that the

predicted net payout rate of payers is below the actual net payout rate every year. As with the whole sample,

the model does not explain the increase in net payout rates in 2007 and 2015.

    We use the same approach to estimate predicted median payout rates. We limit this analysis to the

payers since the median payout rate is zero in some years for the whole sample. Whereas the model

underpredicts the mean, it overpredicts the median in most years. Figure 4, Panel C shows predicted and

actual median payouts. The average annual median payout rate is 21.93% and the average annual predicted

median payout rate is 24.53%. Not surprisingly, the model still underpredicts median payouts in 2007 and

2015. However, the underpredictions are small compared to the underpredictions using the means. In 2007,

the actual median payout rate is 30.29% and the predicted median payout rate is 24.91%, an underprediction

of 17.76%. In contrast, the underprediction of the mean in 2007 is 46.19%.

    A concern with these results is that the predicted payout rate could be negative even though a firm

cannot have a negative payout rate given the way we predict the payout rate. To investigate whether

                                                     21
negative predicted net payout rates affect our results, in untabulated results we set the negative predicted

rates to zero. Since there are very few of these, making this change has no discernible impact on Figure 4.



3.2. Testing for intercept changes.

    In this section, we test whether the regression models in Columns (1) and (2) of Table 3 can explain

payout rates from 1971 to 2019. To do that, we estimate the models in Columns (1) and (2) over the whole

sample period, but we add period indicator variables. The indicator variables are for the 2000s, for the

2010s, and for 2018. A significantly positive indicator variable indicates that payout rates are significantly

higher than predicted using firm characteristics. Columns (3) and (4) of Table 3 report estimates of these

models with firm fixed effects and Columns (5) and (6) show results without firm fixed effects.

    Column (3) presents estimates using all firms. There are some differences with the model in Column

(1). First, lagged operating cash flow has a negative and significant coefficient. Second, the indicator

variable for high tech firms is not significant. Third, the coefficient on advertising expenses is not

significant. We find that the indicator variables are insignificant except for those for 2018. Not surprisingly,

the payout rate is significantly higher in 2018, when firms could repatriate foreign funds under

advantageous conditions. These results indicate that there is no exogenous change in the level of the net

payout rate except for 2018. Another way to put this is that firms do not set their payout rate differently in

the 2000s and 2010s than they do before 2000.

    Column (4) shows estimates when we use the sample of payers. The explanatory power of the

regression increases, but the sign and significance of coefficients change for only two variables.

Specifically, the coefficient on fixed assets becomes significantly negative and the coefficient on the

accounting loss indicator variable is now insignificant. It is again the case that the indicator variables for

the 2000s and for the 2010s are not significant, but the indicator variable for 2018 is significantly positive.

    The models estimated in Columns (3) and (4) demonstrate that a firm that is in the sample in the 1990s

and the 2000s does not change the way it sets its payouts in the 2000s compared to how it does that in the

1990s. With firm fixed effects, the period indicator variables are estimated within firms, and some firms

                                                      22
enter the sample in the 2000s. We therefore estimate the models without firm fixed effects in Columns (5)

and (6). The 2010s indicator variable is now significant for the whole sample and the 2000s indicator

variable is significant for the sample of payers. The economic magnitudes of the coefficients on the period

indicator variables for the 2000s and the 2010s is large. The indicator variable for the 2010s for the whole

sample has a coefficient of 4.3 percentage points. For the whole sample, the difference between the average

payout rate for 2000-2009 and the average payout rate in the 2010s is 7.8 percentage points, so the indicator

variable corresponds to 54.43% of the actual increase in the average annual payout rate between 2000-2009

and the 2010s. Finally, for the payers, the indicator variable for the 2000s has a coefficient of 6.3%. The

average payout rate increases by 14.20 percentage points from 1971-2000 to the 2000s, so that the indicator

variable corresponds to 44.37% of the increase in the payout rate.

    The evidence from Table 3 shows that payout rates are related to firm characteristics, so that changes

in firm characteristics help explain changes in payout rates. Further, firms do not suddenly decide to pay

out more in the 2000s given their characteristics. In other words, accounting for changes in a firm's

characteristics, its level of payouts is not different in the 2000s. However, when we drop firm fixed effects,

we observe changes in the intercepts for the 2000s and the 2010s indicating that new firms enter the sample

with elevated payout rates given their characteristics. This evidence is consistent with Michaely and Moin

(2019), who examine the phenomenon of reappearing dividends and conclude that newer firms drive

dividend trends.



3.3. Which firm characteristics matter most?

    We can use the regression models in Columns (1) and (2) of Table 3 to assess which changes in firm

characteristics are most important in explaining the increase in payout rates. To do so, we use the

coefficients from these models to estimate how the payout rate changes for a firm of average characteristics,

given the change in average firm characteristics between the pre-2000s and the 2000s. We report the

average value of the dependent variable (payout) and the explanatory variables in Table 4. Panel A

examines all firms with positive operating income; Panel B examines the subset of firms that have positive

                                                     23
payouts. Column (1) shows the average firm characteristics for the 2000s and Column (2) for the 1971-

1999 period. Column (3) reports the differences in firm characteristics between the two periods.

    The first row of each panel reports the average net payout rate for the sample of firms for which we

have data for all the variables used in the regression model. The payout rate increases by 8.17 percentage

points for the whole sample and by 14.20 percentage points for the payers. The next rows examine firm

characteristics that could explain payouts. In Panel A, we see that in the 2000s, firm leverage, tangible

assets, and capital expenditures are lower than before. The drop in capital expenditures of 36.73% is

substantial. This decrease in capital expenditures has concerned some economists and, as discussed in the

Introduction, politicians have argued that repurchases may be responsible for this decrease. However, as

discussed in Section 2, capital expenditures fall equally for non-payers (the decrease for non-payers is

39.82%). Cash flow to assets increases. Tobin's q is sharply higher in the 2000s. In contrast to capital

expenditures, R&D expenses increase and so do SG&A expenses. The fraction of firms with accounting

losses is greater in the 2000s, as is the percentage of high-tech firms. As noted earlier, listed firms have

become older. Results in Panel B for the net payers are similar. In light of Kahle and Stulz (2017), the

differences in firm characteristics are not surprising.

    In Column (4), we report the regression coefficients for the model estimated from 1971 to 1999. We

multiply the change in the firm characteristic in Column (3) by its regression coefficient to obtain the

column (5) "impact," i.e., the change in the net payout rate predicted by the change in that firm

characteristic. In Panel A, the payout rate increases by 8.17 percentage points and changes in firm

characteristics explain an increase of 4.65 percentage points, so firm characteristics explain 56.79% of the

increase. The four most important firm characteristics that explain the change in payout rates are assets,

age, cash holdings, and leverage. All variables except market leverage are positively related to payout rates

and increase from before 2000 to the 2000s. Market leverage is negatively related to payout rates and falls

from before 2000 to the 2000s. These four variables account for an increase in the payout rate of 5.11

percentage points.



                                                      24
    For the sample of payers in Panel B, the payout rate increases by 14.20 percentage points and changes

in firm characteristics predict a change of 5.07 percentage points. Whereas asset size has a large coefficient

in the regression for the whole sample, its coefficient is much smaller for the sample of payers, so size is

not one of the four most important variables in explaining the increase in the payout rate for payers. The

four most important variables are, in order of importance, cash holdings, leverage, age, and capital

expenditures.

    We repeat this analysis after excluding the last two years of the sample period. The reason for doing so

is that the TJCA results in large payouts in 2018 that are outside of our regression model. When we do that,

the model is more successful. Specifically, we explain 84.56% of the increase in the payout rate for the

whole sample and 59.32% of the increase for payers.



4. Does the sensitivity of payout rates to firm characteristics increase?

    In Section 1, we show repurchases drive the growth in payout rates. It is well-known that firms find it

costly to cut dividends. They do not appear to hold the same belief for repurchases. Consequently, with

repurchases being used more broadly, firms can vary their payout rate more easily. When institutional

investors push them to pay out funds they cannot invest profitably, they can pay these funds out quickly

through repurchases. Hence, if institutional investors pressure firms to maximize shareholder wealth more

aggressively in the 2000s than for much of our pre-2000 sample period, we expect payout rates to be more

sensitive to changes in characteristics that determine their payout rate. 4 A simple approach to test this

conjecture is to investigate whether the slopes of our regression models differ in the 2000s from before and

whether the differences are consistent with firms' payout rates being more responsive to changes in firm

characteristics.

    In Table 5, we re-estimate the models in Columns (3) through (6) of Table 3, but we allow the slopes

and the intercepts to change in the 2000s by including period indicator variables and interacting the 2000s


4
 Holmstrom and Kaplan (2001) write that "Shareholder value is back because it is the most efficient form of
corporate governance." They attribute much of this evolution to the greater influence of institutional investors.

                                                          25
indicator with firm characteristics. The odd columns have the coefficients with no interactions and the even

columns have the coefficients on the interaction terms. The interactions are significant across all four

models for five variables. These variables are market leverage, the log of assets, Tobin's q, capital

expenditures, and cash holdings. Each one of the interactions magnifies the effect of a change in the variable

except for Tobin's q, which has a negative and significant coefficient while the interaction has a positive

and significant coefficient. Further, in the regressions for the whole sample, the interaction for R&D has a

negative and significant coefficient, which magnifies the coefficient on R&D. Lastly, cash flow from

operations has a significantly negative coefficient for three regressions and a significant positive interaction

for two of these interactions. It follows that when interactions with market leverage, log of assets, capital

expenditures, cash holdings, and R&D have significant coefficients, the interactions imply that changes in

these variables have a larger effect in the 2000s on the predicted payout rate than before.

    We can compute the impact of the change in a variable on the payout rate for the 2000s using the same

approach as in Table 4, but now we have to add the effect of the interaction for the 2000s. Since the most

challenging sample is the sample of payers only, we focus on that sample. We do not tabulate these results.

The predicted change in the average payout rate due to changes in firm characteristics is equal to 9.23

percentage points when the actual change is 14.20 percentage points. We find that five variables contribute

more than one percent of the increase in the average payout rate. These variables are, in order of importance,

size, cash holdings, market leverage, capital expenditures, and age. Allowing the slopes to change in the

2000s has a large effect on our measure of the impact of the change in firm size and capital expenditures

on the predicted payout rate. In Table 4, the impact of the change in firm size and capital expenditures on

the predicted payout rate are, respectively, 0.34 and 0.73 percentage points. With the interactions, the

impact of the size change is 2.09 percentage points and the impact of the capital expenditures change is

1.73 percentage points. With Tobin's q, the impact goes from a small negative to a positive impact of 0.43

percentage points. A positive relation between Tobin's q and the payout rate is challenging for theories of

payouts that argue that undervalued firms pay out more.



                                                      26
    The regression models of Table 5 do not allow us to examine the sensitivity of payouts to free cash

flow (FCF). In Table 6, we estimate regressions of payouts over lagged assets on FCF, allowing the intercept

and the slope to differ in the 2000s. We measure FCF as in Section 2, namely as Max(OCF ­ investment,

0) divided by lagged assets. We estimate the regressions with and without fixed effects for the sample of

all firms. We find that the indicator variable for the 2000s is not significant. The slope on FCF is

economically small before the 2000s. In the regression with firm fixed effects, an increase in FCF from 0%

to 10% increases payouts on assets from 1.7% to 1.702%. The same change in the 2000s increases payouts

on assets to 2.76%. It follows from this that the sensitivity of payouts to FCF is much higher in the 2000s.

Though payouts are sensitive to contemporaneous FCF before 2000, this sensitivity is not economically

significant. It is in the 2000s.



5. Extensions and robustness.

     We perform eleven separate investigations to assess the robustness of our results and to consider

extensions, but we do not tabulate the results. First, a concern with the regressions in Table 3 is that the

payout rate is skewed. The average ratio of mean to median is 1.63 for the mean payout rate for firms with

positive operating income. One way to assess whether this issue affects our inferences is to estimate the

regressions using the log of one plus the payout rate. When we do so, the inferences are similar.

    Second, we estimate the regressions separately for dividends and repurchases. Most firm characteristics

have similar coefficients in both. However, the coefficients on firm characteristics are smaller in absolute

value in the dividend regressions, suggesting that dividends are less sensitive to changes in firm

characteristics. This evidence is consistent with the established view that repurchases are a more flexible

mechanism for payouts than dividends.

    Third, we estimate the regressions on a sample of firms that are in Compustat for at least ten years to

verify that the difference in results between regressions with and without firm fixed effects are not driven

by firms that are in Compustat for a short time. The results are similar.



                                                     27
    Fourth, we use two additional definitions of payers. In Table 3, a firm is defined as a payer if it pays

out in the same year that we measure the payout. We reestimate the regressions defining a firm as a payer

if it pays out (1) in the previous year or (2) in any of the past three years. Our conclusions are not affected

by these changes.

    Fifth, we reestimate Table 3 using gross payouts instead of net payouts. Using gross payouts makes no

difference for the regressions with firm fixed effects. For the regressions without firm fixed effects, when

all three period indicator variables are used, only the indicator variable for 2018 is significant for the whole

sample.

    Sixth, we replace cash/assets with a measure of excess cash. We estimate a model of cash holdings

similar to the one in Bates, Kahle, and Stulz (2009) and use the residual from that model as our estimate of

excess cash. 5 The results are not meaningfully different.

    Seventh, we investigate the extent to which our results depend on whether a firm initiates payouts with

dividends or with repurchases. Our results are the same for both groups of firms when using firm fixed

effects. Without firm fixed effects, when examining the whole sample there is an intercept shift for firms

that start payouts with repurchases but not for firms that start payouts with dividends. For payers, we find

that the intercept shift is larger for firms that start payouts with repurchases than for those that start payouts

with dividends. These results suggest that the change in payout rates that cannot be explained by firm

characteristics is related to the arrival of firms that initiate payouts with repurchases. Banyi and Kahle

(2014) show that firms that go public in the 1990s and 2000s are much less likely to pay dividends and

much more likely to use repurchases for payouts.

    Eighth, we estimate an alternative specification that allows for slow adjustment of dividends and

repurchases. With this model, we re-estimate the regressions of Table 3 but include the lagged payout rate

as an independent variable to account for slow adjustment. None of our results differ meaningfully with

this alternative specification.


5
 The model differs from the model in Bates, Kahle, and Stulz (2009) in that we use firm age instead of IPO indicator
variables and include asset growth and tangible assets as additional variables.

                                                        28
    Ninth, we explore whether market-timing theories (Baker and Wurgler, 2002) can help explain years

with particularly high payout rates. We add to our regressions the one-year forward excess return of the

firm's stock because firms that time the market with repurchases should do so before positive performance.

The coefficient on the forward excess return is positive, but it is never economically significant.

    Tenth, we allow for cross-market arbitrage (Ma, 2019) and debt financed-payouts (Farre-Mensa,

Michaely, and Schmalz, 2018). Our baseline analysis ignores cross-market arbitrage, so we would expect

our models to perform better if we look at payouts in excess of net debt issuance. Doing so reduces the

average percent prediction error of our models, especially in the years with particularly high payout rates.

    Lastly, multinationals benefitted from a tax holiday before the crisis and from the TJCA. 6 We

investigate whether our models perform better for domestic firms than multinationals. We define a firm to

be a multinational firm if its pre-tax foreign income in any of the last three years exceeds 3% of sales. With

that criterion, we can estimate our regressions from 1987 to 2019. The payout policies of multinationals are

not different from the payout policies of domestic firms in general, but they do differ a great deal in 2017,

when multinationals have much larger payout rates not accounted for by firm characteristics than domestic

firms. This evidence is consistent with Bennett, Thakor, and Wang (2019) who show that the increase in

repurchases in 2018 is largely the result of increases by multinationals who were able to repatriate foreign

cash advantageously with the TJCA.



6. Conclusion.

    In this paper, we show that payouts in the 2000s are sharply higher than from 1971 to 1999, whether

measured as constant dollar aggregate payouts or firm-level payouts. The increase in payouts results from

both an increase in payout rates and an increase in funds available for payouts. Thirty-seven percent of the



6
  The Homeland Investment Act of 2004 provided firms a one-time tax holiday on the repatriation of foreign earnings.
The literature reaches mixed conclusions on the extent to which the Act caused an increase in equity payouts.
Dharmapala, Foley, and Forbes (2011) find that firms with repatriated earnings experienced a substantial increase in
payouts (up to 92 cents per dollar repatriated, depending on their estimates), but Faulkender and Petersen (2012)
conclude that at most 25% of the cash repatriated by financially constrained firms goes to equity payouts.

                                                        29
increase in aggregate constant dollar payouts is explained by an increase in constant dollar aggregate

operating income while sixty-three percent of the increase is explained by an increase in the payout rate.

    We investigate how firms change from 1971-1999 to the 2000s and whether these changes can explain

the increase in payout rates. The finance literature tells us that successful older firms pay out more. We find

that firms in the 2000s are larger and older. Payers have higher operating cash flow and higher free cash

flow. This is especially true for the top payers. The increase in free cash flow results from a decrease in

investment. This decrease is not specific to the payers or the top payers, however. Capital expenditures fall

across the board and do not fall more for payers or top payers. It is therefore implausible that payers fund

payouts in the 2000s by decreasing investment when firms that have no payouts decrease investment by as

much or more. The difference between payers and nonpayers is that payers use the funds released by the

reduction in investment to increase payouts and the nonpayers use it to increase R&D. This difference has

a simple two-part explanation. First, young and small firms spend more on intangibles because they have

to build the intangible capital they require to operate successfully. Second, the importance of investment in

intangible assets increases in the 2000s (Kahle and Stulz, 2017). Thus, as intangible capital becomes more

important, young and small firms spend much more on intangibles than they do before 2000. Older firms

increase spending on intangibles by a much smaller amount because they have already built much if not all

of their intangible capital.

    To investigate how much of the increase in payouts can be explained by changes in firm characteristics,

we estimate models using data from 1971 to 1999 that relate payouts to firm characteristics. We then use

these models to predict payout rates in the 2000s given actual firm characteristics. These models predict an

increase in payout rates for the 2000s because of changes in firm characteristics, but they do not predict an

increase as large as the actual increase. For the firms with available data, the average payout rate using all

firms increases by 8.17 percentage points from before the 2000s to the 2000s. Changes in firm

characteristics explain 56.79% of that increase. For the sample of payers, the payout rate increases by

14.20%, but changes in firm characteristics explain only 35.74% of the increase. However, the predicted

average payout rate for payers is always below the actual payout rate in the 2000s. In contrast, the predicted

                                                      30
median payout rate for payers is too high. Perhaps not surprisingly, the models estimated from 1971 to 1999

predict payouts better when we exclude 2018 and 2019, the years impacted by the TCJA.Models estimated

over 1971 to 1999 explain 84.56% of the increase in the payout rate from 2000-2017 for the whole sample

and 59.32% of the increase for payers. Further research should help understand better why average payout

rates increase more than can be explained by changes in firm characteristics and changes in their sensitivity

to firm characteristics.

    The question this paper tries to answer is why payouts are so high in the 2000s. The answer is that a

sizeable fraction of the increase in payouts can be explained by changes in firm characteristics. However,

there is also evidence that part of the increase in payout rates can be explained by the fact that firms are

more sensitive to determinants of payouts in the 2000s. In other words, if a firm's payout rate is positively

related to a firm characteristic before 2000, it is more strongly related to that firm characteristic in the 2000s.

An increase in the sensitivity of payouts could be a positive development if it means that firms are less

likely to hoard funds internally that could be invested more profitably outside the firm. Alternatively, such

an increase could be problematic if it means that firms are more reluctant to take advantage of valuable

internal investment opportunities. While our study does not provide tests that would establish or reject a

causal relation between capital expenditures and payouts, it does show that it is implausible to argue that

payers decrease investments in order to make payouts.

                              par value (PSTK) of preferred stock in order of preference.

 Operating income ($2017)     Operating income (OIBDP), in $2017
 Assets ($2017)               AT in $2017
 Market Cap ($2017)           Market capitalization = CSHO * PRCC_F
 Net payout / OI              (Dividends + netrep) / oibdp; set to missing if OIBDP < 0

 OI / lagged assets           Operating income (OIBDP) / lagged assets (AT)
 NI / lagged assets           Net income (NI) / lagged assets (AT)
 CFO / lagged assets          (Operating income (OIBDP) minus interest (XINT) minus income taxes (TXT) minus
                              change in NWC)/lagged assets, where NWC = (RECT + INVT + ACO - AP - TXP -
                              LCO) - (lag_rect + lag_invt + lag_aco - lag_ap - lag_txp - lag_lco)
 Market Leverage              Total debt (DLC + DLTT) / (assets (AT) - book equity (CEQ) + mkt equity

 Fixed assets                 Net PPE (PPENT) divided by assets (AT)
 Tobin's q                    The market to book ratio is calculated as the market value of assets divided by the
                              book value of assets. The market value of assets is equal to the market value of
                              equity (CSHO*PRCC_F) plus the book value of debt (DLC+DLTT) plus the book
                              value of preferred stock minus investment tax credits (TXDITC).
 R&D / lagged assets          R&D (XRD) / lagged assets. If R&D is reported annually, then quarterly R&D is set
                              equal to one-fourth of annual R&D. If R&D is missing, it is set equal to 0.
 SGA / sales                  SG&A (XSGA) divided by sales (SALE)
 Advertising / sales          Advertising expenses (XAD) divided by sales (SALE); XAD set to zero if missing
 Capex / lagged assets        Capital expenditures (CAPX) / lagged assets
 Cash / assets                Cash and marketable securities (CHE) divided by assets (AT)
 Fraction with accounting     Fraction of firms with (IB + XIDO) < 0. IB is net income excluding extraordinary
 losses                       items and discontinued operations, and XIDO is extraordinary items and discontinued
                              operations.

                              (Department of Commerce definition)


                                                34
Age                            Years since CRSP listing. We use the CRSP link tables to merge the CRSP and
                               Compustat databases, and use as the listing year the first year on CRSP with price
                               data.
Acquisitions / lagged assets   Acquisitions (ACQ) / lagged assets
Cash / lagged assets           (Cash (CHE) - lagged cash) / lagged assets
Debt / lagged assets           (Debt (DLC + DLTT) - lagged debt) / lagged assets
FCF / lagged assets            FCF is calculated as Max(OCF ­ investment, 0) divided by lagged assets. Investment
                               is equal to capital expenditures plus acquisitions.
Multinational firm (MNF)       Firms with material pre-tax foreign income (PIFO) in any of the last three years. We
                               define material foreign income to be foreign income of at least 3% of sales.
Non-debt financed payout       Net payout minus net debt issuance dividend by operating income, where net debt
                               issuance is the maximum of (dltis - dltr), or zero.

Table 1
This table examines aggregate firm characteristics. Panel A shows aggregate total amounts and annual averages (in $MM) of firm characteristics, and Panel B
shows ratios of key aggregate variables. All numbers are in 2017 dollars. The sample begins with all firms listed on Compustat from 1971 to 2019. We exclude
firms not incorporated in the U.S. and financial firms and utilities (SIC codes 6000­6999 and 4900­4949, respectively) because of their statutory capital
requirements and other regulatory restrictions. We also exclude firms with missing data for total assets (AT), dividends (DVC), and market capitalization (CSHO
and PRCC_F). We then merge these observations with data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and restrict the sample to NYSE, AMEX, and
NASDAQ firms with CRSP shares codes 10 or 11. We divide the sample into several time periods, including pre-2000 (1971-1999) and post-2000 (2000-2019).
The post-2000 period is further subdivided into pre- vs. post-GFC (2000-2007 and 2010-2019, respectively). We report the year 2018 separately due to the 2018
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Details on all variables are provided in the Appendix.

Table 2
Table 2 compares the characteristics of high payout firms to other paying firms in Panel A and the characteristics of firms with payouts to nonpaying
firms in Panel B. In a given year, the firms with high payouts are firms that rank among the top 200 firms in dollar payouts for that year. Firms with
payouts in a given year are firms with nonzero net payouts. We show average firm characteristics obtained by first averaging within years and then
across years. Variables noted as in year t (t ­ 1) are measured in the same year as (year before) the determination of whether a firm is a top payer
(Panel A) or payer (Panel B). The sample begins with all firms listed on Compustat from 1971 to 2019. We exclude firms not incorporated in the
U.S. and financial firms and utilities (SIC codes 6000­6999 and 4900-4949, respectively). We also exclude firms with missing data for total assets
(AT), dividends (DVC), and market capitalization (CSHO and PRCC_F). We then merge these observations with data from the Center for Research
in Security Prices (CRSP) and restrict the sample to NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ firms with CRSP shares codes 10 or 11. The Appendix provides
detailed definitions for the variables. ***, ** and * denote significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively, for differences in yearly averages.

Table 3
Table 3 shows estimates of firm-level net payout regressions. Net payout is calculated as net payout as a
fraction of operating income, for firms with positive operating income. The sample begins with all firms
listed on Compustat from 1971 to 2019. We exclude firms not incorporated in the U.S. and financial firms
and utilities (SIC codes 6000­6999 and 4900-4949, respectively) because of their statutory capital
requirements and other regulatory restrictions. We also exclude firms with missing data for total assets
(AT), dividends (DVC), and market capitalization (CSHO and PRCC_F). We then merge these
observations with data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and restrict the sample to
NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ firms with CRSP shares codes 10 or 11. Odd columns present results for all
firms with available data and even columns present results for firms with positive net payout. All control
variables are lagged relative to the dependent variable and all continuous variables are winsorized at the
1% and 99% levels. Details on all variables are provided in the Appendix. P-values are in parentheses;
***, ** and * denote significance at 1%, 5% and 10% respectively.

Table 4

Table 4 examines the role of changing firm characteristics on the ratio of net payout to operating income by estimating
the regression models of Columns (1) and (2) in Table 4 without fixed effects over the period 1971-1999. We show
for these models how the payout rate changes given the change in average firm characteristics between the pre-2000
and the post-2000 periods. Columns (1) and (2) show the mean value of firm characteristics in the post-2000 and pre-
2000 periods, respectively, for firms with available data to estimate the regression and calculate predicted values.
Column (3) shows the difference between the two and whether they are significantly different. Column (4) provides
the coefficient estimate of the regression model estimated from 1971-1999. Column (5) examines the impact of each
variable by multiplying the coefficient estimate by the change in mean value of the variables from the pre- to the post-
2000 period. Panel A provides the results for all firms with available data, while Panel B estimates the regression and
predicted values for firms with positive payout only. Details on all variables are provided in the Appendix.

Table 5
Table 5 shows estimates of firm-level net payout regressions. Net payout is calculated as net payout as a fraction of operating income, for firms with
positive operating income. The sample begins with all firms listed on Compustat from 1971 to 2019. We exclude firms not incorporated in the U.S.
and financial firms and utilities (SIC codes 6000­6999 and 4900-4949, respectively) because of their statutory capital requirements and other
regulatory restrictions. We also exclude firms with missing data for total assets (AT), dividends (DVC), and market capitalization (CSHO and
PRCC_F). We then merge these observations with data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and restrict the sample to NYSE,
AMEX, and NASDAQ firms with CRSP shares codes 10 or 11. Numbered columns present results for the uninteracted variables, and the next
column shows results for the variable interacted with an indicator for observations in the 2000s. All control variables are lagged relative to the
dependent variable and all continuous variables are winsorized at the 1% and 99% levels. Details on all variables are provided in the Appendix. P-
values are in parentheses; ***, ** and * denote significance at 1%, 5% and 10% respectively.

Table 6
In Table 6, the dependent variable is net payouts over lagged assets. FCF is calculated as Max(OCF ­
investment, 0) divided by lagged assets. Investment is the sum of capital expenditures and acquisitions.
The sample begins with all firms listed on Compustat from 1971 to 2019. We exclude firms not incorporated
in the U.S. and financial firms and utilities (SIC codes 6000­6999 and 4900-4949, respectively) because of
their statutory capital requirements and other regulatory restrictions. We also exclude firms with missing
data for total assets (AT), dividends (DVC), and market capitalization (CSHO and PRCC_F). We then
merge these observations with data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and restrict the
sample to NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ firms with CRSP shares codes 10 or 11. Details on all variables
are provided in the Appendix. P-values are in parentheses; ***, ** and * denote significance at 1%, 5%
and 10% respectively.

Figure 1. Aggregate Real Net Payouts

This figure shows aggregate real payouts (in 2017 $MM) from 1971 to 2019 for the sample of listed
CRSP/Compustat firms described in Table 1. Repurchases are calculated as the purchase of common and
preferred stock (PRSTKC) minus any reduction in the value of preferred stock; depending on availability,
we use redemption (item PSTKRV), liquidating (item PSTKL), or par value (item PSTK) for the value of
preferred stock. Net repurchases are equal to repurchases minus issuance of stock (item SSTK). If either
calculation yields a negative value, repurchases are set to zero. Dividends are measured as cash dividends
(DV). Net payout is defined as the sum of dividends and net share repurchases.

Figure 2. Net Payout rate

This figure shows the aggregate net payout rate from 1971 to 2019 for the sample of listed CRSP/Compustat
firms described in Table 1. Repurchases are calculated as the purchase of common and preferred stock
(PRSTKC) minus any reduction in the value of preferred stock; depending on availability, we use
redemption (item PSTKRV), liquidating (item PSTKL), or par value (item PSTK) for the value of preferred
stock. Net repurchases are equal to repurchases minus issuance of stock (item SSTK). If either calculation
yields a negative value, repurchases are set to zero. Dividends are measured as cash dividends (DV). Net
payout is defined as the sum of dividends and net share repurchases. The net payout rate is the sum of net
payout for all firms in the sample, divided by the sum of operating income for all firms in the sample.

Figure 3. Aggregate Predicted versus Actual Net Payouts

This figure shows actual aggregate real net payout (in 2017 $MM) and predicted net payout from 2000 ­
2018. Predicted net payout is estimated by applying the coefficients from the time-series regression model
of aggregate real net payouts in Column (4) of Table 2 estimated using data from 1971 to 1999 to the
aggregate values of the explanatory variables in each year from 2000 to 2018. The evolution of Predicted
Net Payouts measures the effects of changing aggregate characteristics on net payouts.

Figure 4. Average Predicted versus Actual Payout rates
This figure shows the average actual net payout rates and predicted values of payout, where the payout rate
is the ratio of net payout to operating income. Predicted values are calculated from the regression model
shown in Column (1) of Table 3 estimated from 1971 to 1999 without fixed effects. The coefficients from
the regression model are then used to calculate the predicted values from 2000 to 2019. In Panel A, the
regression model is estimated for the full sample of firms with available data. In Panel B, it is estimated for
firms with positive payout. In Panel C, the model is estimated based on firms with positive payouts and the
median predicted payout in each year is presented.
