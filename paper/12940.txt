                                             ABSTRACT

Human beings want to believe that good outcomes in the future are more likely, but also want to make
good decisions that increase average outcomes in the future. We consider a general equilibrium model
with complete markets and show that when investors hold beliefs that optimally balance these two
incentives, portfolio holdings and asset prices match six observed patterns: (i) because the cost of biased
beliefs are typically second-order, investors typically hold biased assessments of probabilities and
so are not perfectly diversified according to objective metrics; (ii) because the costs of biased beliefs
temper these biases, the utility costs of the lack of diversification are limited; (iii) because there is a
complementarity between believing a state more likely and purchasing more of the asset that pays
off in that state, investors over-invest in only one Arrow-Debreu security and smooth their consumption
well across the remaining states; (iv) because different households can settle on different states to be
optimistic about, optimal portfolios of ex ante identical investors can be heterogeneous; (v) because
low-price and low-probability states are the cheapest states to buy consumption in, overoptimism about
these states distorts consumption the least in the rest of the states, so that investors tend to overinvest
in the most skewed securities; (vi) finally, because investors with optimal expectations have higher
demand for more skewed assets, ceteris paribus, more skewed asset can have lower average returns.

       This paper studies portfolio holdings and asset prices in an economy in which people’s

natural tendency to be optimistic about the payout from their investments is tempered by

the ex post costs of basing their portfolio decisions on incorrect beliefs. We show that this

model can generate the following three stylized facts.

       First, households’ portfolios are not optimally diversified according to various theoretical-

based measures (Marshall E. Blume et al. (1974), William N. Goetzmann and Alok Kumar

(2001) , Laurent E. Calvet et al. (2006), Stephanie Curcuru et al. (forthcoming)). The costs

of this lack of diversification appear to be modest. Most households hold a well-diversified

portfolio of mutual funds and also a significant amount of one or two additional stocks.1

       Second, and part of the evidence for the first fact, household portfolios are tilted to-

wards stocks with identifiable attributes, and in particular towards holdings of individual

stocks with positive skewness. Further, undiversified households hold individual stocks that

have relatively high idiosyncratically skewed returns and their portfolios have relatively high

idiosyncratically skewed returns (Todd Mitton and Keith Vorkink (forthcoming)).

       Finally, positively skewed assets tend to have lower returns. This is true for stocks in the

US stock market in general (Yijie Zhang (2005)) as well as for specific well-studied examples,

such as the value-growth premium and the long-run underperformance of IPOs.2

       This paper argues that these three patterns are observed because human beings both

want to believe what makes them happier and want to make good decisions that lead to

good outcomes in the future. We consider an exchange economy with two periods and

complete markets in which households with log utility invest in the first period and consume

in the second period. We show that these patterns arise in this economy when investors

hold beliefs that optimally trade-off the ex ante benefits of anticipatory utility against the

   1
     Further, and complementary evidence for our purposes, household income risk is not fully-insured by
households across groups of households, where moral-hazard would seem an implausible reason for this failure
(Orazio Attanasio and Steven J. Davis (1996)).
   2
     There is also complementary evidence from gambling behavior. Lotteries are highly skewed assets, and
the demand for lottery tickets rises with probability controlling for expected return. And, in parimutuel
betting on races, in which the bettors determine returns in equilibrium, long-shots have lower expected
returns than favorites.

ex post costs of basing investment decisions on biased beliefs.

       Our model of beliefs follows the optimal expectations framework of Markus K. Brun-

nermeier and Jonathan A. Parker (2005). We assume that people behave optimally given

their beliefs, choosing portfolios that maximize their expected present discounted value of

utility flows.3 Because investors care about expected future utility flows, they are happier

if they overestimate the probabilities of states of the world in which their investments pay

off well. But such optimism would lead to suboptimal decision making, and lower levels of

utility on average ex post. Optimal beliefs trade-off these competing forces: people’s beliefs

maximize the objective expectation of their well-being, the average of their expected present

discounted value of utility flows. This economic model of beliefs balances the anticipatory

benefits of optimism against the costs of basing actions on distorted beliefs. Because the

costs of small deviations from optimal behavior are of second order, and the anticipatory

benefits of biases in probabilities typically are of first-order, optimal subjective and objec-

tive probabilities differ. Christian Gollier (2005) and Brunnermeier and Parker (2005) study

portfolio choice and asset prices in incomplete markets (and a two-state complete market

example). This paper derives a general characterization in a complete markets economy.

       In terms of portfolios, we show in Section I that an investor with optimal expectations

does not fully diversify its portfolio but instead biases upwards (a lot) its subjective beliefs

about the likelihood of one state and biases downward (a little) its subjective beliefs about the

likelihood of all the remaining states. It does this because there is a natural complementarity

between believing a state more likely and purchasing more of the asset that pays off in that

state. Once a state is perceived as more likely, one wants more consumption in that state, and

once one has more consumption in that state, one wants even more to believe that that state

is more likely. We further show that an investor chooses to be optimistic about the states

associated with the most skewed Arrow-Debreu securities: either the least expensive state

   3
    Annette Vissing-Jorgensen (2004) shows that differences in investor’s self-reported beliefs about future
market returns (or internet stock returns) are highly significantly correlated with the share of their portfolio
in equities (or in internet stocks).


                                                       2
(when states are equally likely) or the least likely state (when state prices are actuarially fair)

or the least expensive and least likely state when these coincide (in general). This happens

because low-price and low-probability states are the cheapest states to buy consumption

in, and so distort consumption in the rest of the states the least (for a given bias). Thus

portfolios are not perfectly diversified, households overinvest in the most skewed assets, and

household portfolios have positively skewed returns.

       In general equilibrium, we show in Section II that investors tend to be optimistic about

different states. Thus investors’ portfolios have idiosyncratically skewed returns and con-

sumption insurance appears to be incomplete. In terms of asset prices, this preference for

skewed returns has price effects. Ceteris paribus, states with relatively small probabilities

tend to have relatively low expected returns.4

       All proofs are contained in the appendix.



I. Portfolio choice with optimal expectations

The economy has two periods. There are S possible states of the world in period 2, with

state s having objective probability π s > 0. An investor with subjective beliefs π̂ s allocates

his wealth among a complete set of Arrow-Debreu securities in the first period and consumes

the payoff from this portfolio in the second period. A person’s investment choices, c =

{c1 , c2 , .., cS }, maximize his expected utility given his subjective beliefs, π̂ = {π̂ 1 , π̂ 2 , .., π̂ S }:

                             XS                                  XS
                 V1 = max             π̂ s ln (cs ) subject to          ps cs = 1 and cs ≥ 0,               (1)
                         c      s=1                               s=1


   4
    Nicholas C. Barberis and Ming Huang (2005) show that exogenous belief distortion as proposed by
Prospect Theory can lead to similar investment and price patterns. Gollier (2005) shows that in an incomplete
markets investment problem with a stock and a bond, optimal expectations imply that the investor biases
up the probability of the states in which the risky asset’s returns are the highest and the lowest, as implied
by Prospect Theory. Thus, in this situation, overweighting extreme events is an endogenous outcome of the
trade-off between the benefits of anticipatory feelings and the suboptimality actual outcomes, rather than
being an exogenous characteristic of human beings.

where ps > 0 is the price of the Arrow-Debreu security yielding one unit in state s, and

initial wealth is normalized to unity.5 Optimal portfolio choices exist and are unique:

      Optimal beliefs. But what are the investor’s subjective beliefs? One assumption is

that people hold rational expectations, an extreme assumption typically made both for its

tractability and for the discipline it provides. Further, the argument goes, since objective

beliefs lead to the best decisions and thus the highest average present discounted value of

utility, people have the incentive to acquire information and learn rationally so that their

beliefs should have a general tendency to converge to objective probabilities.

      But in fact, rational beliefs do not lead to the highest expected present discounted value

of utility flows. An investor can increase V1 by holding quite distorted beliefs, trading

on these, and then anticipating high average future utility. But biased beliefs come at a

cost. A person that makes objectively poor investment decisions has lower utility ex post,

V2 = ln c, on average. Our theory balances these effects – it trades off the anticipatory

benefits of optimism against the utility losses caused by decisions based on optimistic beliefs.

Further, this approach provides discipline: biases in beliefs are determined endogenously by

the economic environment.

      Formally, each investor’s beliefs maximize his well-being, defined as the average expected

utility across periods 1 and 2 when actions are optimal given subjective beliefs. That is,

π̂ maximizes 12 E [V1 + V2 ] subject to the constraints that the π̂ s are probabilities and that

portfolio choices are optimal given π̂. This wellbeing function is similar to that proposed in

Andrew J. Caplin and John Leahy (2000), and analogous arguments support our use of this

  5
      While here we assume ps > 0, Section II endogenizes prices and derives this as a result.

(and subject to π̂ s ≥ 0). Beliefs impact well-being directly through anticipation of future

flow utility and indirectly through their effect on portfolio choice.6

       Because c∗s (π̂) is continuous in subjective probabilities, L is also; and since probability

spaces are compact, optimal beliefs exist. Further, if π̂ s = 0, c∗s (π̂) = 0 and the investor

would get infinite negative utility if state s is realized.


       Proposition 1: (Existence of interior optimal beliefs)

Optimal subjective probabilities, π̂ ∗ , exist and are positive: 0 < π̂ ∗s < 1 for all s.


       Turning to the characterization of behavior, the first-order conditions for beliefs are

And the second order conditions (reorganized) are

                                    ·            ¸         ·         ¸

       The first-order conditions are displayed in Figure I.1, which plots the left-hand-side and

the right-hand-side of the equations against π s /π̂ s . The left-hand-sides of the first-order

conditions are all identical convex curves with minima at objective beliefs, π̂ s = π s ; the

right-hand-sides are horizontal lines, independent of beliefs, that are higher for states that

are more expensive per unit of probability. By Proposition 1, we know that µ is such that the

left-hand-side of each first-order condition intersects the right at least once (with 0 < π̂ s < 1

   6
   This approach is a ‘frictionless extreme’ in the sense that only ex-post costs limit biases in beliefs.
Additional factors might also constrain biases.

for all s). Thus, each first-order condition has one or two solutions.7 If for state s, the

right-hand side equals one, then objective beliefs are the only possible solution. Otherwise,

the right-hand side is greater than one, and, by the concavity and linearity of the two sides,

there are two solutions to the first-order condition, one with a positive bias and one with

a negative bias. From the second-order condition if beliefs about the probability of s0 are

biased upwards, so that π s0 /π̂ s0 < 1, then π s /π̂ s > 1 for all s 6= s0 so that beliefs about the

probabilities of all other states are biased downwards. Further analysis of the program shows

that objective beliefs are optimal beliefs only if S = 2 and π 1 = π 2 and p1 = p2 .

      Proposition 2: If S = 2 and π 1 = π 2 and p1 = p2 , objective beliefs are optimal. Otherwise:

      (i) one and only one state has upward-biased subjective probability, all other states have

downward-biased subjective probability: ∃ s0 such that π̂ ∗s0 > π s0 and π̂ ∗s < π s for all s 6= s0 ;

      (ii) among states with downward-biased subjective probabilities, states with larger price-

probability ratios (economy-wide stochastic discount factors) are biased down by larger fac-

  7
      Equations (4) are Lambert W functions in π s /π̂ s and in general no closed-form solution exists.

                                                       6
tors: for s00 , s0 ∈ {s : π̂ ∗s < π s }, π s0 /π̂ ∗s0 > π s00 /π̂ ∗s00 iff ps0 /π s0 > ps00 /π s00 and π s0 /π̂ ∗s0 = π s00 /π̂ ∗s00

iff ps0 /π s0 = ps00 /π s00 .


    The result that the investor biases upward the probability of only one state comes from

a natural complementarity between the subjective belief about a state and the level of con-

sumption in that state. Once a state is perceived as more likely, one wants more consumption

in that state, and once one has more consumption in that state, there are greater benefits to

believing that that state is more likely. The second part of the proposition is driven by the

same force. An investor purchases less consumption in a more expensive state, and so has a

greater incentive to believe that the more expensive state is unlikely to occur.

    For the remainder of this section, we rule out the knife-edge case that delivers rational

expectations.


    Assumption 1: Either S > 2 or π s 6= 1/2 or p1 6= p2 .


    We now characterize which state an investor is optimistic about. The benefits of optimism

about a state are related to the consumption purchased in that state and the costs are related

to the objective misallocation of consumption across states. The costs are second-order, so

for an infinitesimal change in beliefs a person should bias upwards the probability of the

state in which they have the most consumption. Starting from objective beliefs, this is the

cheapest state in terms of price-probability ratio.

    Analogously, optimal expectations, which are not infinitesimal deviations from rational

expectations, tend to bias upward the probability of the cheapest state because extra con-

sumption in that state requires the least decrease in consumption in the remaining states,

where ‘cheap’ refers to a combination of low price and low ratio of price to probability. If all

states have the same ratio of price to probability, the investor biases upwards the probability

of the lowest price (and probability) state. If states have equal objective probabilities but

vary in price, then the investor overestimates the probability of the least-expensive state



                                                                 7
because this requires the smallest reduction in consumption in the other states.8


       Proposition 3: (i) If all states have the same price-probability ratio, ps /π s = m for all s,

the investor overestimates the probability of (one of) the state(s) with the lowest probability.

       (ii) If all states are equally likely, π s = π for all s, then the investor overestimates the

probability of (one of) the state(s) with the lowest price-probability ratio.

       (iii) If one state has both the lowest probability and the lowest price-probability ratio,

then the investor overestimates the probability of this state.

       (iv) For any state, there exist m̄ and m, such that for a sufficiently low price ps ≤ mπ s

optimal beliefs overestimate the probability of this state, π̂ ∗s > π s , and for a sufficiently high

price ps ≥ m̄π s optimal beliefs underestimate the probability of this state, π̂ ∗s < π s .


       The labels of ‘optimism’ and ‘pessimism’ in Figure I.1 denote the actual optimal beliefs

when states have equal probability: the state with the lowest price per unit of probability

is viewed with optimism and the remaining states are viewed with pessimism (Proposition

3(ii)). Figure I.2, discussed subsequently, displays the first-order conditions when states are

priced fairly.

       Optimal portfolio choice. While beliefs are interesting, our ultimate interest is in

explaining prices and quantities, that is, returns and portfolios.

       Consider first the case of actuarially fair prices, ps /π s = m for all s. Under rational

expectations, the optimal portfolio is risk-free. For optimal beliefs, Equations (2) and (4)

imply first-order conditions 1/mcs + ln mcs = µ − 1 + ln m for all s, where the Lagrange
                                    P
multiplier µ is such that c̄π s0 + c s6=s0 π s = 1/m and (c, c̄) are the two solutions to this

equation: c̄ is the consumption level in the state with positively-biased subjective probability,

and c is the consumption level in the remaining states. This can be seen in Figure I.2,

which displays the first-order conditions when prices are actuarially fair. Because the right-

   8
    Other effects are present – the elasticity of consumption to beliefs, and the curvature of the utility
function matter – but this is the strongest effect here.

hand-sides are identical, all pessimistic biases are identical. The following corollaries follow

directly.


   Corollary 1: (Preference for skewness) If ps /π s = m for all s, then the investor prefers

the most skewed assets: the investor buys c̄ of one of the Arrow-Debreu securities that pays

off with the smallest probability and c < c̄ of each of the remaining securities.


   Corollary 2: (Two-fund separation) If ps /π s = m for all s, then the investor holds a

portfolio consisting of the risk-free asset (an equal amount of all Arrow-Debreu securities)

and an additional positive amount of one and only one of the most skewed securities.


   These Corollaries match two of the empirical findings described at the start of the paper.

First, investors are well diversified except for investing in one asset. Second, both the return

on the additional asset they hold and the return on their portfolios are positively skewed.

   When prices are not actuarially fair, investors still do not optimally diversify and invest

more than the investor with rational expectations in securities with skewed returns. The


                                                9
latter occurs both because investors tend to be optimistic about states with low probabil-

ities and prices (Proposition 3) and because pessimism is more severe for states with high

prices (Proposition 2(ii)). In general, diversification, preferred by an agent with rational

expectations, would destroy skewness, preferred by an agent with optimal expectations.

   As we now show, equilibrium prices tend to make different investors optimistic about

different states, and so portfolios in equilibrium tend to be heterogeneous and have idiosyn-

cratically skewed returns.


II. Asset pricing in an exchange economy with optimal expectations

We consider an exchange economy with a unit mass of investors, S > 2, and aggregate per

capita endowment in each state of Cs . Due to space constraints, we consider an example

that illustrates the general characteristics of optimal expectations equilibria. In this economy,

portfolios are heterogeneous across investors, portfolio returns are idiosyncratically skewed,

and securities with positively skewed returns have lower expected returns.

   Definition: An optimal expectations equilibrium is a portfolio ci and beliefs π̂ i for each

agent i and prices p such that: (i) each agent’s portfolio is optimal given his beliefs and

prices; (ii) each agent’s beliefs maximize his well-being; (iii) the market for each asset clears.

   Before analyzing a more complex environment, consider first an economy with equally

probable states, π s = π, and no aggregate risk, Cs = C = 1. Suppose that prices are

actuarially fair, ps = p. Each investor biases upward the subjective probability of one state,

purchases c̄ of the Arrow-Debreu security associated with this state, and purchases c < c̄ of

the Arrow-Debreu security associated with the remaining downwards-biased states (where

c̄ and c are as defined in the previous section). This is an equilibrium if an equal share

of agents are optimistic about each state, so that demand for consumption is equal across

states, and each asset’s price is p = 1/S. This equilibrium is locally stable, in the sense that

a small change in prices would lead all investors to bias up the subjective probabilities of

                                               10
the cheapest states (Proposition 3(ii)), which would lead to excess demand for consumption

in these states and a (relative) increase in price for the cheapest states.

       Consider now similar economies in which the variation in the aggregate endowment across

states is ‘not too large.’ An equilibrium with actuarially fair prices exists as long as there exist

different shares of agents that are optimistic about each state so that the demand for each

asset matches the supply. Thus, in economies with equally probable states and low aggregate

risk, prices are fair and agents hold heterogeneous beliefs, overinvest in different skewed

assets, and thus hold portfolios with idiosyncratically skewed returns. In the corresponding

rational expectations equilibrium, investors’ portfolios would be homogeneous and perfectly

diversified, cs = Cs . Further, also unlike in the rational expectations equilibrium, aggregate

risk, in limited amounts, is not priced.9 People have an interest in risk, and a small amount of

aggregate risk satisfies this desire without changing prices. Finally, as aggregate endowment

risk increases beliefs become less heterogeneous.


       Proposition 4: (Heterogenous portfolios and idiosyncratic skewness) Suppose that

π s = π for all s. For any vector (C1 , ..., CS ) of aggregate endowment such that c ≤ Cs ≤ c̄
     PS
and    s=1 Cs = c̄ + (S − 1)c, there exists an optimal expectations equilibrium with the

following characteristics:

       (i) prices are actuarially fair: ps = p for all s;

       (ii) for all s, a fraction λs = (Cs − c)/(c̄ − c) of investors buys c̄ of the Arrow-Debreu

security associated to state s and c of the security for every other state;

where c and c̄ are defined in Section I.


       Having established this result, we now construct our example that matches all three styl-

ized facts discussed in the introduction. Consider an economy with some unlikely states and

some likely states. At actuarially fair prices, each investor would bias upward his probability

   9
     The equality of probabilities across states is key for this results. With unequal probabilities, aggregate
risk is typically priced.



                                                      11
of one of the unlikely states. Analogously to Proposition 4, this is an equilibrium if there

exists shares of investors that are optimistic about each unlikely state such that the market
                                                       ³      ´
                                                  1         1
                               A              A
clears. For example, if π s = π and Cs = C := s c̄ + 1 − s c for s ≤ s and π s = π B > π A

and Cs = C B := c for s > s, then an equilibrium with fair prices exists in which 1/s investors

bias up their probabilities for states s ≤ s. But if the endowments across states are not so

different, then prices in the unlikely states must be relatively higher so that demand for

output is also relatively lower in these states, and hence the expected returns of the most

skewed Arrow-Debreu securities are lower.


   Proposition 5: (Underperformance of skewed assets) For a small reduction in C A −

C B such that ps does not change for s > s, ps increases for s ≤ s so that:

   (i) the securities with the more skewed returns have lower expected returns than in a

rational expectations equilibrium;

   (ii) the securities with the more skewed returns have relatively lower expected returns,

π A /ps < π B /ps0 for all s ≤ s and s0 > s.


   This equilibrium fits all three stylized facts: (a) portfolios are heterogeneous and not

perfectly diversified; (b) each investor overinvests in one security that is more skewed than

the average security and his portfolio return is more skewed than the market return; (c) more

positively skewed securities have lower returns. These results relate to the use of co-skewness

as a pricing factor. As C A varies (and in richer environments), the relative importance of

idiosyncratic skewness and aggregate skewness for asset prices varies. Finally, consumption

insurance appears incomplete, but not because of missing markets or moral hazard, but

rather because households optimally choose to hold risk.

   How important are the assumptions of our example? First, if the low-probability states

have much larger endowments than the other states (Cs > C A ), then we still match (a) and

(b), but the expected returns on the most skewed assets are higher for the usual reason that

investors discount payouts in states with high aggregate endowment. However, even in this


                                               12
case, Proposition 5(i) implies that the returns on the most skewed assets are lower than in a

rational expectations equilibrium. Second, the assumption that some probabilities are equal

is not essential. If probabilities differ among high-probability states, nothing changes. If

probabilities differ among low-probability states, prices would have to be higher for lower

probability states for investors to remain indifferent among (perhaps a subset) of states and

for portfolios to be heterogeneous.

   The desire for skewness can also impact the market return. If bad aggregate states have

low probabilities, as for disasters or Peso problems, then it is possible for the desire for

skewness to increase the equity premium, as investors seek to avoid negative skewness.

   In conclusion, the natural human tendency towards optimism tempered by the real costs

of poor decisions, implies that people hold heterogeneous, underdiversified portfolios to attain

skewed returns, and that this behavior reduces the returns of positively skewed assets.

A. Proof of Proposition 1
                  n                  PS           o
Define the set Π = π̂ : 0 ≤ π̂ s ≤ 1, s=1 π̂ s = 1 . Optimal consumption choices given be-

liefs are continuous in probabilities on Π (Equation (2)). The objective for beliefs (Equation

(3)) is thus continuous in beliefs on Π since L is linear in π̂ and continuous in c. Since Π

is compact, a maximum exists on Π. To see that the optimum requires 0 < π̂ s < 1 for all

s, note that for π̂ such that π̂ s = 0 for at least one s, c∗s = 0, and thus the objective for

beliefs has value negative infinity and this cannot be optimal since the objective is finite on

the interior of Π.¥



B. Proof of Proposition 2

To establish the results, we first prove four lemmas. Without loss of generality, we choose

units so that
                                                     S
                                                     X
                                                           ps = 1.
                                                     s=1

This implies that ps /π s = m = 1 for all s for actuarially fair prices.


    Lemma 1: The subjective belief of at most one state is biased upwards.

    Proof of Lemma 1: The second-order condition, Equation (5), implies


                              π̂ 2s [π̂ s0 − π s0 ] ≤ π̂ 2s0 [π s − π̂ s ] for all s 6= s0 .   (B.1)


Thus if beliefs about the likelihood of s0 are biased upwards, so that π̂ s0 − π s0 > 0, then

π̂ s − π s < 0 for all s 6= s0 .¥


    The proof of Lemma 1 also directly implies Lemma 2.




                                                           16
    Lemma 2: If the subjective belief of one state is biased upwards, then the subjective

beliefs of all other states are biased downwards.


    Lemma 2 corresponds to result (i) in Proposition 2, except that we still need to prove that

rational expectation cannot be optimal except in the case in which prices are actuarially fair,

probabilities are equal, and there are only two states. We first examine the case of actuarially

unfair prices.

    Lemma 3: If prices are not actuarially fair, rational expectations cannot be optimal.

    Proof of Lemma 3: The first-order conditions (4) for rational expectations are


                                                            ps
                                           1 = µ − 1 + ln      for all s
                                                            πs


which cannot be satisfied for all s if ps /π s 6= ps0 /π s0 for some s and s0 .¥


    Combining lemmata 2 and 3 implies that there is one, and only one, state whose proba-

bility is biased upwards when prices are actuarially unfair. In the remaining proof of result

(i), we assume that prices are actuarially fair.

    Lemma 4: If prices are actuarially fair, ps /π s = 1 for all s, then the investor biases his

beliefs for all states with downward-biased subjective probabilities by a common factor: For

one state, s0 , cs0 = c̄ ≥ 1 and π̂ s0 = c̄π s0 ≥ π s0 , and for all other states, s 6= s0 , cs = c ≤ 1 and

π̂ s = cπ s ≤ π s , where (c, c̄) are the two solutions to


                                                1     1
                                                  − ln = µ − 1                                      (B.2)
                                                c     c

                              P
with µ such that c̄π s0 + c       s6=s0   π s = 1.

    Proof of Lemma 4: Equation (B.2) is the first-order conditions for optimal beliefs written

in terms of consumption using Equation (2). If µ = 2, cs = 1 for all states, in which case

beliefs are objective and the Lemma holds trivially (c = c̄). If µ > 2, every first-order

condition has the same two possible solution, so that cs = π̂ s /ps = π̂ s /π s is the same among

                                                      17
all states whose likelihood is biased down. For these states let c := c∗s (π̂). Then Lemma

1 implies that there is at most one state perceived as more likely than it is, and let its

consumption level be c̄. We note µ < 2 is not possible by Proposition 1.¥


   We now prove that the one specific case has rational expectations and part (i) for actu-

arially fair prices by using these Lemmas to analyze the program given by Equation (3).

   Let π denote the probability of the state whose probability is biased upwards, and let

c be the consumption level in that state, which is denoted s0 . By Lemma 3, we know that

the consumption level is a constant c in all other states. Using the fact that π
                                                                               b = cπ, we can

rewrite the Lagrangian objective for beliefs as a function of only c̄ and π:
                                                                 " S             #

                                                                                     1−πc̄
where the last step imposes the constraint by substituting in c =                    1−π

over the choice of state to bias upward and consumption level in that state. We proceed in

two steps.

   Suppose that we know the state, and thus its objective probability π, whose belief is

biased upwards. We determine the optimal bias c in the following way. Notice first that

U (1, π) = 0 and that
                                ∂U                 c̄(1 − π)       1 − c̄
                                    (c̄, π) = π ln           +π             .
                                ∂c̄                  1 − πc̄    c̄(1 − πc̄)

Evaluating Uc̄ at c̄ = 1 and c̄ = (1 − π)/π, we obtain that


                                                 ∂U
                                                     (1, π) = 0,
                                                 ∂c̄




                                                       18
and
                                 ∂U 1 − π              1 − π 2π − 1
                                     (    , π) = 2π ln      +       .
                                 ∂c̄   π                 π    1−π

The second derivative of U with respect to c̄ is:

                                                                         1
                                    ∂ 2U               2 (c̄ − 1)(c̄ − 2π )
                                         (c̄, π) = −2π                      .                              (B.3)
                                    ∂c̄2                    c̄2 (1 − πc̄)2


       When π = 1/2, the right-hand side of the above equality is negative, implying that U is

concave in c̄. Combining this with Uc̄ (1, 1/2) = 0 directly implies that c̄ = 1 (and so π
                                                                                         b = π) is

optimal if π = 1/2. This sheds light on the special case with only two states that are equally

likely. In that case, the choice of the state whose probability would be biased upwards is

arbitrary, and we have just shown that it is optimal not to distort beliefs. We now argue

that in all other cases, π̂ 6= π.

       First, we show that if we consider π < 1/2, then c̄ > 1/2π so that π̂ > 1/2 > π. When π is

less than 1/2, we see from (B.3) that U is alternatively concave, convex and concave (in c̄) over

the intervals ]0, 1], [1, 1/2π] and [1/2π, 1/π]. Combining this with U (1, 1/2) = Uc̄ (1, 1/2) = 0

implies that the optimal solution has a c̄ larger than 1/2π.

       Second, we show that given π, the optimal c̄ has c̄ ≤ (1 − π)/π, or equivalently that

π
b ≤ 1 − π. This follows from


                                         ∂U 1 − π              1 − π 2π − 1
                             q(π) =          (    , π) = 2π ln      +
                                         ∂c̄   π                 π    1−π


being negative when π is less than 1/2.10 This implies that c̄ ≤ (1 − π) /π or π̂ ≤ 1−π which

       This is because q(1/2) = 0, and

so that q 0 (1/2) = 0 and q 00 has the same sign than π − 0.5. This implies that q has the same sign than π − 0.5.



                                                              19
implies that the state perceived as more likely than it is necessarily has π ≤ 1/2. Combined

with the first result, we know that if the optimal π 6= 1/2, we have π̂ s 6= π s for all s (“for all

s” follows from Lemma 2).

   What we still need to show is that π 6= 1/2 when there are more than 2 states with one

state having probability 1/2. We do this by showing that the function V (π) = maxc̄ U (c̄, π)

is symmetric and U-shaped with a minimum at 1/2. Thus, as long as there exists a state with

probability different from 1/2, π̂ 6= π. V is symmetric around π = 1/2 from the definition

of V . By the envelop theorem, we have that

                                            ¡      1−π

                                  V (π) =                          ,
                                            c̄(1 − π)(1 − πc̄)


where c̄ maximizes U (c̄, π). Suppose that π is less than 1/2. We have seen above that it

implies that c̄ is larger than 1/2 but smaller (1 − π)/π, yielding V 0 (π) < 0. This shows

that the optimal state to bias upwards is the objectively least likely one. Except the case

π 1 = π 2 = 1/2, this state has a π less than 1/2, which implies that c < 1 < c. This concludes

the proof of result (i) in Proposition 2.


   The above proof also directly implies Lemma 5, used in the proof of Lemma 6.

   Lemma 5: If prices are actuarially fair, ps /π s = 1 for all s, then π̂ s0 ≥ 1/2 where s0 is the

state whose probability is biased upwards.


   Proposition 2(ii) follows directly from the first-order conditions, Equation (4). Given

that one selects the solution with π s /π̂ s > 1, the left-hand side is increasing in π s /π̂ s and

the right-hand side is increasing in price-probability ratio, ps /π s .¥



C. Proof of Proposition 3

Proposition 2 implies the pattern of belief distortion but does not specify which is the state

that has its probability biased upwards.

                                                 20
    The proof of part (i) relies on the function V (π) defined in the proof of Proposition 2(i)

as the value of holding beliefs that are optimistic about state s0 where π is the probability

associated with this state. The proof of Proposition 2(i) shows that this function, V (π), is

symmetric and U-shaped with a minimum at 1/2. Further, the proof of Proposition 2(i)

shows that the optimal s0 is necessarily such that π ≤ 1/2. Thus, V (π) is maximized by

choosing to bias upwards the probability of (one of) the smallest probability state(s).


    To prove part (ii), we show that the local maximum in which subjective probabilities

satisfy the first-order conditions and the budget constraint with an arbitrary optimistic state

is dominated by the same set of subjective probabilities in which the subjective probability

of this state and the cheapest state are interchanged.

    Let states 1 to s̄ be the least expensive states, ps = ps0 < ps00 for s0 , s ≤ s̄ and s00 > s̄. Let

π̂ ∗ (s00 ) denote the vector of subjective probabilities that satisfy the first-order conditions,

sum to one, and have π̂ s00 > π s00 and π̂ s < π s for all s 6= s00 and let L (π̂ ∗ (s00 ) , p) denote the

associated value of the objective for beliefs:

                                                                      µ                  ¶                       µ                  ¶

               L (π̂ (s ) , p) :=               s=1 π̂ s   (s ) ln                           +    s=1   π s ln
                                                                               ps                                         ps


where p denotes the vector of prices.

    Consider taking π̂ ∗ (s00 ) for some s00 > s̄ and switching the subjective probability for state

s00 (π̂ ∗s0 (s00 )) with the subjective probability of some state s0 ≤ s̄ (π̂ ∗s0 (s00 )),


               (π̂ ∗1 (s00 ) , ..., π̂ ∗s00 (s00 ) , ..., π̂ ∗s̄ (s00 ) , ..., π̂ ∗s0 (s00 ) , ..π̂ ∗S (s00 )) := π̂ Switch (s00 )


This is feasible because it is still the case that probabilities sum to one and as a result the

budget constraint is also satisfied. For notational simplicity, for the moment, let π̂ ∗s = π̂ ∗s (s00 ).

where the sign follows from the initial assumptions that ps0 < ps00 and that optimism is

focussed on state s0 so that π̂ ∗s00 (s00 ) > π > π̂ ∗s0 (s00 ).

    Since π̂ Switch (s00 ) is not optimally chosen for the situation in which the investor biases

upward his beliefs about state s0 , these probabilities may not satisfy the first-order conditions

and so are weakly worse than those that are optimally chosen conditional on being optimistic

about state s0 :
                                                             ¡                     ¢
                                       L (π̂ ∗ (s0 ) , p) ≥ L π̂ Switch (s00 ) , p

Thus we have,

which completes the proof of part (ii).


    For part (iii), we make a similar argument. Let states 1to s̄ be the least expensive and

lowest probability states, ps = ps0 < ps00 and π s = π s0 < π s00 for s0 , s ≤ s̄ and s00 > s̄. Consider

taking π̂ ∗ (s00 ) for some s00 > s̄ and switching the subjective probability for state s00 (π̂ ∗s0 (s00 ))

with the subjective probability of some state s0 ≤ s̄ (π̂ ∗s0 (s00 )) and let this vector be denoted

where the sign follows from the initial assumptions that π s00 > π s0 , ps0 < ps00 and that

optimism is focussed on state s0 so that π̂ ∗s00 (s00 ) > π > π̂ ∗s0 (s00 ).

    Analogously to part (ii), since π̂ Switch (s00 ) is not optimally chosen for the situation in

which the investor biases upward his beliefs about state s0 :

                                                             ¡                     ¢
                                       L (π̂ ∗ (s0 ) , p) ≥ L π̂ Switch (s00 ) , p

         L (π̂ ∗ (s0 ) , p) ≥ L π̂ Switch (s00 ) , p > L (π̂ ∗ (s00 ) , p) for all s00 > s̄ and s0 ≤ s̄


which completes the proof of part (iii).


    For part (iv) of Proposition 3, we first note that, for any problem, there is a lower bound

placed on µ by the requirement of real solutions to the first-order conditions (Proposition

1). Thus,
                                                        ½          ¾
                                                                ps
                                            µ ≥ µ := max 2 − ln                                                       (C.1)
                                                      s         πs

Second, for any problem, there is an upper bound placed on µ by the requirement that the

π̂ s0 < 1 in the solution to the first-order condition for the probability that is positively-biased

state. Thus, for state s0 to have π̂ s0 > π s0 , we require


                                           µ < µ̄ (s0 ) := 1 + π s0 − ln ps0 .

                                                            23
Consider first m. As one decreases ps0 , µ increases (at least once ps0 /π s0 is the minimum),

µ̄ (s0 ) increases, and µ̄ (s) for s 6= s0 does not change. Thus, there is an ms0 such that for

ps0 = ms0 π s0 , µ̄ (s0 ) > µ and µ̄ (s0 ) < µ for all s 6= s0 . Thus, the agent must be optimistic

about state s0 . Then m = mins0 {ms0 }.

   In terms of m̄, as one increases ps0 , there is an m̄ such that for ps0 = m̄π s , µ̄ (s0 ) < µ

and µ̄ (s0 ) > µ for some s 6= s0 . Thus, the agent must be pessimistic about state s0 . Then m̄

= maxs0 {m̄s0 }.¥


D. Proof of Proposition 4

Proof by construction in the text.


E. Proof of Proposition 5

This Proposition is not trivial because, while an increase in the price of a given state decreases

the demand for the asset that pays off in that state, an increase in the price of a state for

which π̂ ∗s < π s decreases the demands for the assets that pay off in all other states that are

viewed with pessimism. Following the proof of Proposition 5, we prove two Lemmata that

characterize these price effects in Section F.

   We start with the following Lemma.

Using these relationships, our term of interest becomes:

                                          (π̂ s0 − π s0 )


which is positive if π̂ s0 > 1/2. This follows from from Lemma 5.¥


   For notational simplicity, let a index the states s ≤ s so that π s = π a and Cs = Ca for

s ≤ s, and let b index the S − s states with π s = π b and Cs = Cb . Let a0 be the state, less

than or equal to s, that is viewed as more likely than it is; this state differs across investors

but all a-states are symmetric so we can impose that pa0 = pa .

   To prove Proposition 5, we write the conditions for the initial equilibrium with fair prices,

totally differentiate the system for a small increase in the aggregate endowment in the a-

states, dCa , imposing that dpb = 0, show that dpa > 0, and check that dCb < 0. Because

there is a discrete interval between π a and π b and because the wellbeing functions evaluated

for different choices of s0 (the state such that π̂ s > π s ) are continuous in prices, small enough

changes in pa and pb do not change the relative rankings of the wellbeing as a function of s0 .


                                                     25
Thus, locally the pattern of a0 across investors remains unchanged.


E1. Equilibrium conditions at fair prices

The exogenous variables are S, s, π a . Given these three, π b is given by the fact that

probabilities sum to one

                                              sπ a + (S − s) π b = 1.

   For actuarially fair prices that (normalized) sum to one, we have


                                                      pa = π a

                                                      pb = π b .


   Optimal beliefs are given by the investor first-order conditions,


                               π a0         π a0               pa

                                  πb         πb                pb
                                       − ln       = µ − 1 + ln
                                  π̂ b       π̂ b              πb

                                                                    πa         πb
(note that at fair prices, the last two imply and                   π̂ a
                                                                           =   π̂ b
                                                                                    ),   and the fact that subjective

probabilities sum to one,


                                     π̂ a0 + (s − 1) π̂ a + (S − s) π̂ b = 1.                                   (E.4)


These equations can be used to solve for π̂ a0 , π̂ a , π̂ b and µ, which we know exist and are
                        π̂ a       π̂ b              π̂ a0
unique. Note that c =   πa
                               =   πb
                                          and c̄ =   π a0
                                                           .

   Finally, the two remaining exogenous variables that deliver fair prices in equilibrium, Ca




                                                               26
and Cb , are calculated from market clearing conditions:

                                     Ca     =         + 1−                                             (E.5)

                                      Cb    =      .
                                              pb


     We have three exogenous variables that are chosen to generate an initial fair-prices equi-

librium, π b , Ca , and Cb , six endogenous variables (µ, π̂ a0 , π̂ b , π̂ a , pa , pb ), and nine equations.


E2. Totally differentiated equilibrium conditions

We totally differentiate the system (E.3), (E.4), and (E.5) allowing Ca and Cb to vary and

imposing dpb = 0:


                          π̂ a0 − π a0                  1
                                  2      dπ̂ a0 = dµ + dpa

                              π̂ b − π b

                                   π̂ 2b
     dπ̂ a0 + (s − 1) dπ̂ a + (S − s) dπ̂ b = 0
                                                                          µ      ¶

                                               pb


Now we want to study dpa , dCb , and dCb around an equilibrium with fair prices, i.e., with
pa       pb
πa
     =   πb
              = 1.

Together these two inequalities imply that α > 0. Thus dµ and dpa have opposite signs.

                                 c̄ − 1           Cb − 1


so that the sign of the denominator is given by the sign of:

                        = (α − c̄ − (s − 1) Cb ) (π a α + π b β) − α2 π a

                        = −c̄ (π a α + π b β) − (s − 1) Cb (π a α + π b β) + π b βα < 0


    From equation (E.8), we have that dµ > 0, and from equations (E.6), we have that

dπ̂ b < 0, and so from equation (E.7), we have dCb < 0.

    Thus, reversing signs, for a small reduction in aggregate risk – a decrease in Ca and an

increase in Cb – such that the expected returns on the less-skewed assets do not change,

dpb = 0, the expected returns on the more skewed assets rises, dpa < 0.¥

     Lemma 8: (Cross-price effects for fair prices) For π s /ps = 1 for all s and t such that

     Proof of Lemma 8: If the investor switches to become optimistic about state s as we

increase the price of the state previously viewed with optimism, then we have our result.

Increasing the price of another state cannot cause the investor to switch their optimism from

the state viewed with optimism.

     So under the assumption that the investor remains optimistic about the same state, using

                                                                                       > 0 if π̂ s > π s or π̂ t > π t otherwise

it is negative.¥
