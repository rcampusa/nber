                                           ABSTRACT

This paper explores the link between mobility and the presence of international research networks.
 Data come from the GlobSci survey of authors of articles published in 2009 in four fields of science
working in sixteen countries. Summary evidence suggests that migration plays an important role in
the formation of international networks. Approximately 40 percent of the foreign-born researchers
report having kept research links with colleagues in their country of origin. Non-mobile researchers
are less likely to collaborate with someone outside their country than are either the foreign born or
returnees. When the non-mobile collaborate, their networks span fewer countries. Econometric results
are consistent with the hypothesis that internationally mobile researchers contribute significantly to
extending the international scope and quality of the research network in destination countries at no
detriment to the quality of the research performed. Results also suggest that the “foreign premium”
on collaboration propensity is driven in large part by mobile researchers who either trained or worked
outside the destination country where they were surveyed in 2011. With but one exception, the mobility
findings persist when we estimate models separately for the US, Europe, and other countries.

1. INTRODUCTION


The capability of a country to attract foreign talent is fundamental to building and sustaining the
quality of its national science and engineering workforces. The contribution of foreign-born
scientists and engineers in most advanced economies is sizable. In the US, by way of example,
currently about 48 percent of all PhDs awarded in science and engineering go to those who are
either temporary or permanent residents. Almost 60 percent of all postdocs working in the
United States are on a temporary visa (Stephan, 2012) and approximately 41.6 percent of those
with a doctorate degree working in a science and engineering occupation in 2009 were born
outside the United States (National Science Board, 2012, table 3-28). Significant mobility is also
present across European countries. A study of postdoctoral researchers working in Europe in the
life sciences found, for example, that 43 percent were working in a country different than that of
origin (Empirica, 2005). The percent of foreign students enrolled in graduate science and
engineering programs in the UK in 2008-2009 was 51.2 percent (table 2-40 (National Science
Board, 2012).

Foreign-born and foreign-educated scientists have been shown to be disproportionately
distributed among those who make exceptional contributions in science (Stephan and Levin,
2001). Hunter et al. (2009), for example, found that 50 percent of all highly-cited PhD physicists
in the world work in a different country than that in which they were born. Stephan and Levin
found exceptionally productive scientists and engineers working in the United States, defined by
a number of measures, to have a higher probability of being foreign born and foreign educated
than the underlying population of US scientists.

The gains from international migration, however, do not accrue only to countries that succeed in
attracting talented individuals at the expenses of countries that lose human resources. Personal
and professional ties often remain between immigrants and their country of origin or prior
residence and constitute an invisible backbone enabling reverse knowledge flows (Saxenian,
2002). Previous contributions have highlighted the presence of a complex network of links
between flows of researches and the generation and transformation of scientific networks (Melin,
2004; Jonkers and Tijssen, 2008). Research and innovation policies, particularly in Europe, have
strongly supported international mobility of the high skilled workforce as a means for enhancing
the overall scientific performance of both source and destination countries. Despite the
importance attributed to such ties, few empirical studies have systematically investigated the
topic, in part because of the lack of internationally comparable data, particularly for Europe1.
Most of the available evidence on the effects of international mobility of scientists is based on
observation of scientists from specific countries and disciplines or of researchers who applied for
specific publicly sponsored mobility programmes2.

1 Two recent studies have gathered data on mobility of doctorate holders in Europe: the Careers of Doctorate
Holders (CDH) developed by OECD and UNESCO (Auriol, 2010) and the MORE project (2010), funded by the
European Commission. The CDH study focuses on all doctorate holders; data reported vary by date, depending
upon country. The MORE study of researchers at universities has an exceptionally low response rate of 11percent
and thus provides, at best, a noisy picture of mobility of scientists within Europe and to the United States. In the US
the National Science Foundation’s Survey of Doctorate Recipients only recently began to track individuals trained in
the United States who subsequently leave the United States.
2 Edler et al. (2011) analyse a sample of about 950 German academics from science and engineering faculties and

investigate through a survey how the duration and frequency of scientists’ visits abroad affect technology transfer
propensity, finding a positive effect of mobility in both the origin and host country. Hunter et al. (2009) collect data
on the movement and productivity of elite scientists. They find that mobility is remarkable in this group: nearly half
of the world’s most-cited physicists work outside their country of birth and they tend to migrate systematically
towards nations with large R & D spending. Laudel (2005) also analyses the brain drain of elite scientists in two
specific scientific fields (angiotensin and vibrational spectroscopy) using bibliometric data. The data reveal the

                                                           3
This paper contributes to our understanding of the role that migration plays in collaboration by
providing new data on international mobility patterns of researchers working in four scientific
fields and exploring the links between scientists’ migration and the establishment of international
research networks. Data come from the GlobSci survey, conducted in the spring of 2011 by the
three authors3. The survey is unique in that it studies scientists working in 16 “core” countries:
Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, India, Japan, Netherlands,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and the US. The methodology involved surveying
corresponding authors of articles published in 2009 in four fields of science who were studying
or working in one of the 16 countries. The four fields are biology, chemistry, earth and
environmental sciences, and materials. Collectively the core countries produce about 70 percent
of all articles published in these fields. The overall response rate was about 40% (Franzoni et al.,
2012). The survey resulted in 19,183 records. The size and international scope of the survey allow
us to produce a comprehensive picture of mobility patterns based on the mobility status of active
researchers in 2009. Moreover, the data allow us to consistently control for a number of
individual characteristics that cannot be observed through alternative research approaches such
as bibliometric indicators or the analysis of the CVs of researchers.
Our analysis of the relationship of foreign-born scientists and returnees to the international
openness of research networks reveals a number of interesting facts. First, a sizable share of
foreign-born scientists included in our sample (about 40%) report research collaborations with
research groups located in their country of origin. Second, we find robust evidence suggesting
that both foreign-born scientists and returnees have larger international research networks than
do native researchers who lack an international background. Such patterns appear to hold even
when we conduct the analysis separately for the US, European countries and other countries.

Third, we find that internationally co-authored papers with a foreign born or returnee
corresponding author tend to have on average a higher scientific standing than those with a
native non-mobile corresponding author. The effect on international collaborations and research
quality of foreign-born researchers is driven primarily by migrants who did not get their PhD in
the destination country, but rather came for a postdoc position or directly for employment at a
university or public research centre in the destination country after doctoral training in another
country. Such results suggest that research links established during doctoral training matter when
the student moves. We also find that natives who return after having one or more international
experiences have more international collaborations than those who do not have international
experience. More generally, the overall evidence suggests the presence of a non-trivial impact of
international mobility on the international openness of the research system of countries and the
quality of the research produced. Results have clear policy implications in light of the high
heterogeneity in the patterns of foreign-born attractiveness and returnee rates across the analysed
core countries.

The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we introduce the characteristics of the GlobSci
survey, the related datasets and discuss the evidence on international mobility patterns for the 16


presence of relevant field heterogeneity in migration rates and highlight that migration generally occurs before
scientists have gained the ‘elite’ status. Furukawa et al. (2012) trace the movements of about 2,200 researchers in the
domains of robotics, computer vision and electron devices using a bibliometric approach based on affiliation
countries. Their results confirm that the US, China and India exhibit the greatest global flows of researchers.
Nerdrum and Sarpebakken (2006) use data registers and a survey to examine the stock and flows of foreign-born
researchers in Norway, and related reasons for moving. Filippo et al. (2009) present an analysis of mobility patterns
and scientific performance based on a case study of Spanish universities.

2. DATASET AND SUMMARY STATISTICS
2.1 The GlobSci survey
We surveyed active researchers in the four scientific disciplines of biology, chemistry, earth and
environmental sciences, and materials science during the period February-June 2011. Surveyed
countries are: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan,
Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States.
In order to construct the sample, we selected all journals classified by ISI as belonging to one of
the four disciplinary fields and sorted them by Impact Factor for all subfields of the four
disciplines. Impact Factor was taken from the latest available release of the Journal Citation
Report of Thomson-Web of Science®. We then randomly picked a selection of journals in each
quartile of the Impact Factor distribution in each of the subfields of the four disciplines. In the
aggregate, this selection corresponds to approximately 30% of all journals published in the four
fields.
We downloaded full bibliographic data for all scientific articles published in the selected journals
in 2009 and retrieved the email address of the corresponding authors of each of the survey
articles. In case of multiple corresponding authors, we picked the first name on the list. In the
case of corresponding authors appearing repeatedly in the list, we randomly selected one record4.
The main language of the survey is English. However, the questionnaire and the invitation emails
were available in six other languages: French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish.
The online questionnaire was developed through the platform Qualtrics®. Each respondent
received a customised questionnaire, given that some questions made direct reference to the title,
year and journal of the person’s own article included in the sample.
The final dataset contains information on the survey article selected by the sampling criteria as
well as information on background characteristics of the corresponding author and co-authors of
the survey article. In addition to standard bibliometric data, we also have information on the
composition of the network of co-authors, whether the article involved an international
collaboration, and a set of reported characteristics of the topic that the survey article addresses
(e.g. whether it is in an emerging or multidisciplinary field and whether it is in a main research
area for the author).5
With regard to the corresponding author, the structure of the dataset allows us to control for a
number of individual characteristics, including age, gender, job position, type of affiliation,
international mobility data (including country of origin, reasons for leaving the origin country,
periods of education or work abroad) and type of initial entry in the host country (for PhD
training, post-doc, direct employment).
In the two following sub-sections we present aggregated statistics on mobility patterns and on the
relationship between mobility and research networks.



4 In the four selected fields 95 percent or more of all articles contain an email address for the corresponding author.
More specifically, in 2009 the estimated number of records that did not report email address for corresponding
author was 0.9% in biology, 3.6% in chemistry, 2.9% in earth and environmental sciences and 4.5% in materials
science.
5 Survey response rates and response biases are discussed in Appendix A.

2.2 International mobility patterns
Country of origin was determined by asking the corresponding author to report country of
residence at age 18. Data for the 17,182 scientists for whom country of origin and country of
residence in 2011 could be determined are summarized in the left hand panel of the table 1 and
show considerable variation in the percent foreign working or studying in country. Switzerland
heads the list. More than one out of two scientists studying or working in Switzerland in 2011
lived abroad at age 18. Canada is a distant second, being 9.8 percentage points lower, followed
closely by Australia (44.5 percent), and then by the United States with 38.4 percent and Sweden
with 37.6. A number of countries have an extremely low percent of foreign scientists studying or
working in the country. Particularly notable is the virtual absence of foreign scientists studying or
working in India, followed closely by Italy with 3.0 percent, Japan with 5.0 percent, Brazil with
7.1 percent and Spain with 7.3 percent.
Countries also vary in the degree of diversity of immigrants who work in country, measured by
the percentage of immigrant researchers from the top-four source countries (four-country
concentration rate, column 4). High concentration rates indicate less diversity. Switzerland,
which shows the highest incidence of foreign born also has a very high concentration of inflows
due to the substantial migration of researchers from Germany. Other countries, such as the UK,
show a more diversified composition of source countries.
The survey also provides information on scientists living in a core country at age 18 who were
working or studying in a core country in 2011 (right hand panel of the table). We again find
considerable variation in the percent studying or working abroad. Not surprisingly, India heads
the list with 39.8 percent of the scientists who lived there at age 18 working or studying in one of
the other core countries in 2011. But the country that has the second highest rate among the 16
is Switzerland, with approximately one third of its residents studying or working abroad in 2011.
The Netherlands and the UK are next, with approximately one in four of their residents studying
or working outside of country. The country with the lowest percent of emigrants is Japan (3.1
percent) but the United States is close behind at 5.0 percent, followed by Brazil and Spain.
There is considerably less variation in the country of destination (column 7). Indeed, the top
destination country for emigrants from 13 of 15 countries is the United States; for the remaining
two the United States is the second most likely destination country. The most likely destination
country for individuals living in the United States at age 18 is Canada.
The aggregated statistics reported above for the country level are computed using all collected
observations for which information regarding country of origin and country of residence in 2011
was available. In the following summary statistics and in the subsequent econometric analysis we
focus exclusively on the subset of surveyed scientists working in academia or at a public research
institution at the time of the survey, dropping respondents whose main affiliation in 2011 was in
a company (about 2.5% of the sample).

3. SUMMARY DATA CONCERNING MOBILITY AND INTERNATIONAL
COLLABORATION
The last three decades have witnessed an increase in the extent of international scientific
collaboration (Wagner and Leydesdorff, 2005). Numerous factors have been noted as
contributing to the trend, from policy “push” initiatives (European Commission, 2005) to the
advancement of technological solutions for remote collaborations (Ding et al. 2010) to the
construction of large pieces of equipment, such as the Large Hadron Collider. Here we
investigate the specific link between international mobility and the establishment of international
research networks.
In the analysis that follows, surveyed researchers have been classified into one of three possible
mobility statuses with respect to her/his country of residence in 2011: i) foreign born (24.3
percent of the sample); ii) returnee after one or more periods abroad for a PhD, a postdoc
position or employment (29.7 percent); and iii) non-mobile natives (46.0 percent).
Based on the survey data, we derive two measures of the individual’s propensity to have an
international research network using two alternative types of information: i) characteristics of
the survey paper and ii) the number of countries with which the scientist reported having one or
more collaborations in the past two years. Respondents directly declare the latter information in
the questionnaire.



                                                  8
Table 2 provides information regarding the incidence by mobility status of researchers who are
corresponding authors of a survey paper with one or more international co-authors. The data
show that about 24 percent of the articles in our dataset involved an international collaboration,
although there is some variance across the four disciplines. In all fields the incidence of
internationally co-authored papers is lower for non-mobile researchers; with the exception of
earth sciences, it is highest for foreign-born researchers. Note that these summary statistics do
not account for additional factors (e.g. age, type of affiliation, country of origin and residence)
that are likely to affect the propensity to engage in international collaboration. We will address
such factors in detail in the section devoted to the econometric analyses.

Table 3 presents self-reported data concerning the number of countries with which the scientist
reported having one or more collaborations in the past two years. We see that non-mobile
researchers show on average the highest incidence of no international collaboration or minimal
international collaboration (with only one country). Conversely, both foreign born and returnees
consistently show the highest incidence of collaboration with researchers in two or more
countries. Interestingly, more than 12 percent of the sample consists of scientists who
collaborated in the last two years with colleagues located in 6 or more different countries. Clearly,
such patterns are likely affected by field characteristics that will be accounted for in the
econometric section.

In order to further investigate the correlation between international collaboration and
international mobility, we present data in table 4A concerning the incidence, by country, of
current residence, of foreign born who declare having a research collaboration with scientists in
their country of origin. The incidence of collaboration is computed first irrespective of country
of origin (column A), and then for the foreign-born coming from non-core countries. By way of
example, 46.1 percent of foreign-born researchers in Australia report that they have an
international collaboration with someone currently based in their home country. When we
restrict the sample to the foreign born from non-core countries, we find the rate of collaboration
with someone in their country of origin to be 42.6 percent. We find that on average slightly
more than 40% of foreign-born researchers report on-going research collaborations with
researchers in their countries of origin. The incidence of collaboration with individuals in the
origin country tends to decrease considerably when we focus exclusively on foreign-born
researchers from non-core countries (column B). There are, however, important exceptions: in
the case of US, which attracts a large number of researchers from China and India, we observe a
relatively smaller reduction in the percentage when we restrict the analysis to foreign natives of
non-core countries only and in the case of Brazil and Italy we actually see an increase.

* In this statistic non-core countries also include India.

We also analyse the relationship between international mobility and research networks by looking
at the propensity of foreign-born scientists to have a collaboration with researchers from their
country of origin who are currently based in the same institution as the respondent or to have a
collaboration with researchers from their country of origin who have moved to a third country.
The data reported in table 4B reveal that a non-negligible share of the foreign born collaborate
with a community of expatriates from their country of origin. Indeed, between a quarter to a
third of mobile researchers report collaborating with someone from their home country in their
current place of employment. A lower but not insignificant proportion of respondents report
collaborating with colleagues from their native country currently based in another country. The
findings suggest that personal/cultural links matter in explaining patterns of collaboration.

Table 5 reports summary statistics from our sample of mobile researchers regarding the
perceived impact of their international mobility experience. We see that on average, both
returnees and foreign-born researchers assign the highest average value to the item “enlarging my
research network”, followed by “learning new techniques / theories”. This is consistent with the
hypothesis that international mobility has a non-negligible impact on the international openness
of the research systems of both source and destination countries. Notably, items related to
economic and pecuniary benefits from international mobility receive on average lower ratings.
This suggests that high-skilled migration patterns–at least in the case of scientific career--cannot
be fully captured by underlying theoretical models that predict mobility primarily on the basis of
wage differentials but rather factors contributing to research productivity play a large role in
determining mobility.6




6When returnees were asked to evaluate reasons for returning to their native country, the factor that received the
highest score related to personal or family reasons rather than economic factors or career prospects in the country of
origin.

4. ECONOMETRIC ANALYSES
To date we have presented only descriptive statistics concerning the relationship between
mobility and international collaboration. Here we extend the analysis by providing a set of
econometric models that investigate the presence of significant correlations at the individual level
between international mobility and the scope and quality of international research networks. We
assess such relationships controlling for the researcher’s background, characteristics of the
researcher’s scientific field and country of residence.
We perform two analyses to assess the degree to which international mobility of researchers is
associated with international collaboration. First, we look at the correlation between the mobility
status of the respondent and the likelihood that the survey paper is internationally co-authored.
For this purpose we have created a dummy variable named INTER that equals one for survey
articles in our sample that have an international network of co-authors. Second, we analyse the
correlation between the mobility status of the scientist and the scope of the respondent’s
international research network, measured by whether the respondent reported collaborating with
individuals living outside the current country of work or study in the past 2 years. To be more
specific, we create the dummy variable NETWORK and set it equal to one for respondents who
report collaborations with authors in more than 4 countries in the last 2 years.
In our models we use the following article-specific variables: number of co-authors (SIZE),
whether the author reports the article to be in her/his main area of research on a 1-5 scale
(CORE_PROJ), the quality of the scientific article proxied by the impact factor of the related
journal in 2009 (IF). In terms of author-specific characteristics, we control for the following: age
(AGE), a dummy variable for gender (FEMALE), a dummy variable for whether the respondent
has a job position that allows full research independence, i.e. professorship or staff scientist
(INDEPENDENT), two dummy variables for mobility status (FOREIGN BORN,
RETURNEE), a dummy variable set equal to one for those foreign-born researchers who
received their PhD in the destination country (PHD_INCOMING). In the analyses we also
include several full sets of control dummies: 16 country dummies that control for the baseline
distribution in the core-country of residence of the respondents in 2011; 4 field dummies; 3
institution dummies (university, public research centre, other non-profit institutions). Table 6
provides the summary statistics of the variables used in the econometric models.

In all econometric models presented in the following sections we have adopted a standard
approach which consists of dropping observations for which we were not able to collect all the
required information in the survey. To check for robustness we present additional models which
account for missing data7 and also introduce country-level weights that account for the variations
in response rates across countries in Appendix B.
4.1 Mobility and international research network
Table 7 presents estimates from a probit model testing for the presence of significant correlations
at the individual level between mobility status and international co-authorship of the survey
article. For all probit models we report both coefficients and marginal effects computed at
covariate means. In model I we show the baseline specification while in models II – IV we test
for the additional effect exerted by the mobility status of the author. Regardless of specification,
we find that the probability of observing an international collaboration increases at a decreasing
rate as the number of co-authors increases. We also find international collaborations to be more
likely for articles that are in a main area of research interest of the author and that women are less
likely to engage in international collaboration, even after controlling for field and country. Our
results also suggest that, on average older researcher are more likely to be involved in
international collaborations.
In Model II we differentiate between those who are foreign born vs. all other researchers
working in the same country. In Model III the distinction is drawn between those who have
returned from work or study abroad and all others. The results suggest that both types of
mobility increase the probability that a researcher has written the survey article with one or more
international co-authors. The effect appears larger, however, for the foreign born than for those
who have returned. This is confirmed in model IV where we compute the marginal effects of
both types of mobility on international collaboration relative to non-mobile researchers working
in the same country and scientific field. We find the marginal effect of being foreign born on the
likelihood of having an international collaboration, net of individual and article specific effects, to
be 13.8 percentage points. The marginal effect of the variable RETURNEE is 7.4 percentage
points. The estimated coefficient for the FOREIGN BORN variable is significantly higher (99
percent confidence level) than the coefficient for the RETURNEE variable.




7 In particular some individual characteristics used in the econometric models (e.g. age and gender) were asked at the

end of the questionnaire. As a result, there are 880 missing entries for gender and 1034 missing entries for age,
mostly due to respondent dropouts. We applied a methodology for the imputation of these missing data (see Little
and Rubin, 2002). Results fully confirm the evidence reported in this section of the paper.

The models presented in Table 8 use the dependent variable NETWORK to further analyse the
relationship between mobility status and international collaboration. The distinction between this
analysis and the analysis presented above is that here we focus on the self-reported scope of the
researcher’s international network during the past two years; the analysis above uses the presence
of one or more international co-authors on the survey article to indicate international
collaboration. Although here the NETWORK variable takes the value of one for those authors

                                                                     16
who declare having collaborated with individuals in more than 4 countries in the past two years,8
we have also run alternative probit models using slightly higher and lower thresholds to measure
scope in order to check for robustness. The main results presented below are confirmed.
Using this alternative indicator of international collaboration we again find a significant positive
effect of the international mobility variables (models II-IV in Table 8), confirming the previous
results presented in Table 7 that were based on the incidence of international co-authorships in
the survey paper.9 Of more importance to this research is that once again the foreign-born
dummy shows a significantly higher impact on international collaboration than the returnee
dummy in model IV. As expected, we also find age to be positively related to collaboration and
women to be less likely to have large international collaborative networks. The variable capturing
job independence has a positive and significant effect on the scope of the international research
network.




8On average in our sample this amounts to about one fourth of surveyed researchers.
9The number of observation available to estimate the NETWORK equations is greater than the number used to
estimate the INTER equations because of the number of incomplete answers related to article-specific questions
used as controls in the NETWORK equations

4.2 Mobility and the quality of internationally co-authored papers
To date we have established that mobility -especially that of the foreign born- is positively
associated with the propensity to have one or more international collaborations. But is this
international collaborative research of the mobile of a higher quality than the international
collaborative research of the non-mobile? Here we examine this question, using as a measure of
quality the Impact Factor of the journal in which the 2009 survey article was published. We
restrict the analysis to internationally co-authored papers to avoid spurious effects due to a
possible average positive correlation between quality and international collaborative papers.
In all model specifications we keep field dummies in order to control for the baseline distribution
of Impact Factors among the journals of a specific field. Following previous research regarding
the determinants of researchers’ scientific output, we include both age and age squared among
individual controls. In the baseline model specification (model I in Table 9) we find that the
effect of both team size and age on quality increases at a decreasing rate. Job seniority – net of
age effects - is also positively associated with research output quality. Of particular interest to our
research is the finding that internationally co-authored papers with a mobile corresponding
author tend to have on average a higher Impact Factor than those with a non-mobile
corresponding author (model IV). However, we do not find a statistically different effect between
the two types of mobility. Although we are well aware that the Impact Factor is but a partial
measure of the actual scientific relevance of articles, the results suggest that the higher propensity
of mobile researchers to collaborate across borders that we observed above does not translate
into producing research of a lower quality.

4.3 The effect of international training on international collaboration and network
advantage
The network edge and superior performance of foreign-born researchers with respect to other
researchers in the same country and field could, of course, be due to the quality of their existing
networks at the time they immigrate. Here we investigate this possibility by including in the
model specifications a variable that equals one for those foreign born who received their PhD in
the destination country (PHD_INCOMING). The sample analysed includes all researchers in
each core country. The reason we control for this variable is that the foreign born who have
trained in the destination country should have a more limited “international” advantage (e.g. no
previous research networks abroad established during their training and research career) than the
foreign born who trained outside the country. Thus, PHD_INCOMING is expected to have a
moderating effect on the FOREIGN BORN variable.
Table 10 presents results when this variable is included in the analysis of the two measures of
international collaboration propensity (model I and II) and in the analysis of research quality
(model III). The estimates indicate that the variable PHD_INCOMING has indeed a negative
and significant effect on all three of the measures. However, its moderating impact is different
across model specifications. In the case of research quality (model III) the PHD_INCOMING
dummy variable substantially offsets the FOREIGN BORN dummy variable. This suggests that
the foreign born who receive their PhD in the destination country do not show a significantly
higher level of performance than the average local researcher in the same field. In the case of
international collaboration (Model II), the moderating effect of the PhD variable turns out to be
relatively small in magnitude but significant. It is less small, and significant, in the case of the
propensity to have a large international network (model I).
The results suggest that the aggregated “foreigner premium” effect is driven considerably by
mobile researchers with training or work experience outside the destination country, i.e. by
individuals who had the opportunity to form research networks prior to arriving in the
destination country. Immigrants who come for a postdoc position represent a clear example of
this typology of researchers. The effect may also be related to the ex-ante selection process
which is likely to be more binding for postdocs or for immigrant researchers directly employed
by universities or public research centres in the destination country, rather than for PhD
candidates. In this regard our evidence is in line with other recent contributions that have pointed
out the relevance of temporary international mobility (Edler et al. 2011).

4.4 The effect of country conditions on networks and performance
The average estimated differentials between non-mobile researchers, foreign born and returnees
in collaboration propensity may, of course, be affected by specific conditions existing in the
destination country, such as the strength of the national research base. We have controlled for
this effect in previous model specifications (sect. 3) by introducing destination country dummies.
Here we explore the potential differentials of destination countries further by estimating separate
models for different pools of countries. In order to have sufficiently large sub-samples, we split
the core countries into three groups: US, European countries, and other countries. In the
following three tables we report the estimated results for selected models. The evidence suggests
that the mobility effects on the propensity to have international collaborations persist across
subgroups of countries and that our previous results concerning international collaboration are
not fully driven by a specific set of destination countries (Table 11 and Table 12). On the other
hand, when we regress the Impact Factor of internationally co-authored survey papers against
individual characteristics we find that mobility status matters for European countries as well as
other countries but does not matter for the US (Table 13).

5. CONCLUSION
This paper contributes to the existing evidence on international mobility of researchers working
in four scientific fields, presenting results from the GlobSci survey that collected detailed data on
the mobility and scientific collaborations of more than 19,000 researchers working or studying in
16 countries in 2011. The homogeneity of the administered survey allows for direct comparisons
across countries of inflow and outflow patterns of high-skilled people involved in scientific
research. Our summary evidence confirms the absolute relevance of the migration phenomenon
for most advanced economies. More than 40% of the researchers sampled in the four fields in
Switzerland, Canada and Australia are immigrants. The phenomenon is also non-negligible for
the US and for certain other European economies such as the UK, the Netherlands, Germany
and Sweden.
The specific focus of this paper is the relationship of mobility to international networks. We
investigate the relationship in a variety of ways. Using descriptive analysis, we find, for example,
that on average about 40% of foreign-born scientists in our sample report having kept research
links with their country of origin, suggesting the presence of significant knowledge spillovers
between source and destination countries. We also find, using descriptive analysis, that non-
mobile researchers compared to the foreign born or to scientists who have returned to their
country of origin, are the least likely to collaborate on research with someone working outside
their country. When we estimate models that control for field, country, and individual effects, we
find that both the foreign born and returnees are more likely to have an international co-author
on the survey article than are the non-mobile benchmark; they are also more likely to have
reported working with researchers in more than four countries during the past two years. The
effect is more pronounced for the foreign born than it is for returnees. We also see evidence of a
performance effect: when we restrict the sample to respondents who have an internationally co-
authored survey article, we find that foreign born and returnees publish articles in higher quality
journals, as measured by Impact Factor, than those who have not experienced mobility. With
but one exception, the above results hold when we estimate comparable models for the US,
Europe, and other countries.
Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that internationally mobile researchers significantly
contribute to extending the international scope of the research network of destination countries
at no detriment to the quality of the research output. All else equal, being foreign born increases
the likelihood of having an international collaboration by 13.8 percentage points and being a
native with work or study experience abroad increases the likelihood by 7.4 percentage points.
Moreover, our results suggest that the “foreigner premium” on collaboration propensity and
research quality is driven considerably by mobile researchers who have trained or worked outside
the destination country where they were surveyed in 2011, as opposed to those who trained in
the country of destination. This finding suggests that foreigners who arrive with a degree or work
experience in hand contribute to openness by bringing a well-established network with them.
We also find that returnees and foreign-born researchers tend to assign the highest reason related
to mobility to factors such as “enlarging my research network” and “learning new techniques/
theories”. This is consistent with the hypothesis that international mobility has a non-negligible
impact on the international openness of the research systems of both source and destination
countries. It is also consistent with the idea that high-skilled migration patterns – at least in the
specific case of scientific careers - cannot be fully captured by underlying theoretical models that
predict mobility primarily on the basis of wage differentials. In all instances other items related
to economic and pecuniary benefits from international mobility receive on average lower ratings.

APPENDIX A
Survey response rates
Table A1 reports the number of answers received by country. Answers are further divided into
complete answers and partial answers. The latter are answers from respondents who began the
survey, but dropped-out before reaching the last question. The total dropout rate is 5%. The
response rate is 40.6% if both complete and partial answers are counted. Reported response rates
do not take into account undelivered invitations due to such things as incorrect email address,
retirement or death and consequently underestimate the response rate.

Response rates by scientific field are reported in Table A2. Participation was highest for scientists
in earth and environmental sciences and lowest for scientists in biology. Differences in country
and discipline participation are likely to reflect in part the degree to which similar populations of
scientists have been surveyed in the recent past by other, unrelated studies (Haeeussler, 2011;
Sauermann and Roach 2011).

We have assessed non-response bias by comparing respondents against non-respondents.
Comparison is done for two characteristics known for the entire panel and sample: total citations
received by the underlying article and number of coauthors. Total citations are likely to be
positively correlated with the eminence of the scientist and could potentially reflect differentials
in the propensity to answer related to how busy the respondent is. Because the number of
coauthors was a basis for a branching question in the survey, more coauthors meant that more
questions were asked. Therefore, it is potentially associated with dropping out of the survey.
Tests for equality of means are performed for each pair of country samples (Table A3). A
relatively higher propensity to answer from authors with better-cited papers is found for France,
Italy, Spain and the U.S. Authors of papers with more co-authors are also more likely to have
answered from Brazil, Germany, Italy and the U.S. Thus, although there is some response bias, it
is not in the direction that one might hypothesize.

APPENDIX B
Robustness controls: observation weights and missing values
In this appendix we present the results for selected model specifications in which we account for
missing values and we use sample weights to account for differential response rates across
countries. For a review of the statistical properties and implication of multiple imputation of
missing data we refer to Little and Rubin (2002) and Allison (2001)
The standard steps involved in multiple imputation processes are the following (Allison, 2001) : i)
impute missing values using an appropriate model that incorporates random variation; ii) repeat
the previous step M times, producing M “complete” data sets; iii) perform the statistical analyses
on each data set using standard complete-data econometric techniques; iv) average the values of
the parameter estimates across the M samples to produce a single point estimate; v) calculate the
standard errors by averaging the squared standard errors of the M estimates and calculating the
variance of the M parameter estimates across samples. Note that multiple imputation requires
that the data must be missing at random (MAR), meaning that the probability of observing
missing data on a particular variable Y can depend on other observed variables, but not on Y
itself (controlling for the other observed variables).
Concerning the imputation of missing values, we have imputed only the variables age and gender.
The imputation procedure is based on the use of predicted values from a Logit model (for the
FEMALE dummy variable ) and of an OLS model (for AGE variable).
The specifications used in the imputation models include among the covariates country of
residence in 2011, foreign experience ( PhD, postdoc and job), job position, affiliation type, the
presence of secondary affiliations, and field of research. The data have been treated using the
Multiple Imputation routine of STATA 12. We have generated M=5 imputations for each
missing value. Note that due to the application of the multiple imputation procedure, for the
subsequent estimates based on standard maximum likelihood methods we have computed
standard errors for the estimated coefficients but we cannot derive traditional goodness of fit
indicators such as pseudo R-squared
In the set of estimates presented in table B1 we have also included observation weights. The
weights are equal for each respondent to the inverse of the complete response rate of the related
core-country (see table A1). Of particular interest is the fact that both the foreign-born variable
and the returnee variable maintain significance after including imputed variables and observation
weights although in the case of the first two models the coefficients are substantially larger. They
are approximately the same magnitude when the dependent variable is the Impact Factor.
