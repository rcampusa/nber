       We study a one-sector growth model which is standard except for the presence of an

externalityin the productionfunction. The set of competitive equilibriais large. It includes constant

equilibria, sunspot equilibria, cyclical and chaotic equilibria, and equilibria with deterministic or

stochasticregime switching. The efficient allocation is characterizedby constant employment and

a constant growth rate. We identify an income tax-subsidy schedule that supports the efficient

allocation as the unique equilibriumoutcome. That schedule has two properties: (i) it specifies the

tax rateto be an increasingfunction of aggregateemployment,and (ii) earningsaresubsidized when

aggregate employment is at its efficient level. The first featureeliminates inefficient, fluctuating

equilibria, while the second induces agentsto internalizethe externality.

1. Introduction


Interest is growing in business cycle models with multiple, self-fulfilling rational expectations

equilibria. 1 These models offer a new source of impulses to business cycles+isturbances                     to

expect ations-and      they offer new mechanisms for propagating and magni~ing the effects of

existing shocks, such as shocks to monetary policy, to government spending, and to tech-

nology.2 Although initial versions of these models appear to rely on empirically implausible

parameter values, recent vintages me based on increasingly plausible empirical foundations.~

    The policy implications of the new models differ sharply horn those of current main-

strem    equilibrium models, which emphasize shifts to preferences and technology as the

basic impulses to the business cycle. These models have been used to articulate the notion

    1Ifiuential early papers include Azariadis (1981), Bryant (1983), Cass and Shell (1983), Cooper and John
(1988), Diamond (1982), Farmer and Woodford (1984), Shleifer (1986), and Woodford (1986b). The first
paper to take seriously the quantitative predictions of a business cycle model with self-fulfilling expectations
is Woodford (1988). Rational expectations models with multiple equilibria have attracted attention in other
areas too. See Benhabib and Perli (1994), Krugman (1991), and Matsuyama (1991a) for a discussion in
the context of international trade and growth. See Cole and Kehoe (1996) for an analysis of the Mexican
debt crisis. See Bryant (1981) and Diamond and Dybvig (1983) for discussions in the context of models of
bardcing. See Boldrin, Kiyotaki, and Wright (1993) and Mortensen (1989,1991) for discussions on dynamic
models of search and matching.
    2An extensive literature documents the inadequacy of propagation in standard business cycle models.
See, for example, Burnside and Eichenbaum (1995), Christian (1988, p. 269), Cogley and N=on (1995),
Rotemberg and Woodford (1996), and Watson (1993). An emly study showing how models with indetermi-
nate equilibria provide increased mastication    and propagation of monetary shocks is Farmer and Woodford
(1984). More recent studies include Beaudry and Devereux (1994), Benhabib and Farmer (1996), Guesnerie
and Woodford (1992), and Matheny (1994). For a recent mgurnent that macroeconomists are short on shocks
for accounting for the business cycle, see Cochrane (1995).
    aFor exmple, the models of Benhabib and Farmer (1994), Farmer and GUO (1994) and Gali (1994a~b)
rely on increasing returns in production. (See Schmitt-Grohe 1995. ) The results of subsequent empirical
research suggested that the degree of increasing returns required for the Benhabib and Farmer and Farmer
and Guo models to display sunspot equilibria is too high. (See Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo 1995 for
one such effort, and see also Benhabib and Farmer 1995 for a review of several others. ) These empirical
results in turn stimulated further theoretical work: recently, Benhabib and Fwmer (1995) showed that a tw~
sector version of theti model requires a much lower degree of increasing returns to guarantee the existence
of sunspot equilibria.
that economic fluctuations represent the economy’s efficient responses to shoti                   and to cast

doubt on the desirability of macroeconomic stabilization policy.4 In contrast, the new mod-

els suggest that institutional arrangements and policy rules designed to reduce fluctuations

in output may be desirable. (See Grandmont 1986, Guesnerie and Woodford 1992, Shleifer

1986, Woodford       1986b,1991, and the articles in the symposium summarized in Woodford

1994.)5

   This paper pursues these ideas in a pmticdar business cycle model. The model studied

is a version of the one-sector, external increasing returns model recently studied by Bater

and King (1991), Benhabib and Farmer (1994,1995), and Farmer and Guo (1994,1995 ).6

Our version of this model has a significant advantage relative to the versions analyzed in the

literature. In those, analysis of the global set of equilibria is typically quite difficult, and

so resemchers confine themselves to studying the set of equilibria that is local to the steady

state. By contrast, the structure of our model is such that the global set of equilibria is

transparent and can therefore easily be analyzed. It turns out that this set of equilibria is

remmkably rich, and it includes sunspot equilibria, regime switthing equilibria, and equilibria

    4See Kydland and Prescott (1980) and Sargent (1979, p. 393) for a statement of the case that output sta-
bilization is undesirable. The “preference and technology” literature on macroeconomics did not completely
rule out the possibility that some forms of stabilization might be desirable. Researchers who incorporated
frictions like price rigidities did see some role for activist policy. (See Fischer 1980.)
    5An import ant early example of the potential stabilizing role of instit utional arrangements occurs outside
the area of business cycle analysis and is provided by the work of Bryant (1981) and Diamond and Dybvig
(1983). They showed that a spontaneous burst of pessimism on the part of depositors could trigger s~
cially inefficient bank runs and that a government policy-deposit        insurance-could   be designed that would
eliminate this source of instability.
    6As in these papers, we do not formally articulate what the source of external increasing returns is.
Examples of analyses that are explicit about the nature of external effects include Diamond (1982), Hewitt
and McAfee (1988), and Romer (1986). Benhabib and Farmer (1994) suggest the possibility that there
is a way of reformdating our model so that the source of incre=ing retmns is internal to the fire, while
leaving our basic analysis unaffected. The analysis in Romer (1987) suggests yet another possibility: that the
increasing returns may actually reflect gains from specialization. We have not yet explored these possibilities.


                                                        2
which appear chaotic. Our analysis illustrates the potential pitfalls of focusing only on the

equilibria that are local to some steady state.

   We establish that the set of bounded solutions to a particular expectational difference

equation corresponds to equilibria for our model. This set is simple to characterize because

the difference equation is only first order and has a simple analfiic representation.              This

is true, despite the fact that capital accumulation and employment are endogenous in the

model. An important feature of the difference equation is that for every initial condition,

it has two solutions. This tw~branch feature of the Euler equation is an important reason

the set of equilibria for the model includes regime switching equilibria of the type studied

by Hmilton     (1989) and equilibria that appear chaotic.7

   Even the efficient allocations in our model are straightforward to determine, despite the

lack of convexity in the aggregate resource constraint set due to the externality. The efficient

allocations are unique and involve no fluctuations.

   We examine the operating characteristics of two automatic stabilizer tax regimes. Each

has the property that the income t=          rate rises if the economy moves into a boom and

falls if it goes into a recession. Under each tax regime, the economy has a unique interior

equilibrium, in which output is comt ant. However, one tm regime stabilizes output on an

inefficient level of output, and the other stabilizes output on the efficient allocations.           We

show that implementing the fist tax regime may increase, or even decrease, welfare.a We

   7For other exmples of a “branching” Euler equation in infinite horizon growth models, see Benhabib and
Perli (1994) and Benhabib and Rustichini (1994).
   8This possibility has been discussed by Guesnerie and Woodford (1992, pp. 383–388), Shleifer (1986),
and Woodford (1991, p. 103) in other contexts.
establish two things about designing a tax system that supports the efficient allocations as

the unique interior equilibrium. First, such a system must specify that the t=                     rate vary

with the level of aggregate economic activity. When the tax rate is specified to be a &ed

constant, then there is more than one equilibrium, with the efficient one being only one

of them. Second, the efficient equilibrium in this case is determinate, so that a standard

local analysis of the set of equilibria would falsely conclude that only one equilibrium is

possible. These restits draw attention to the importance of the proper design of automatic

stabilizer t=   systems and point to a potential pitfall in the traditional approach to policy

design, which tends to focus on minimizing output variance.o These results also illustrate

the potential dangers of the standard practice of focusing exclusively on local equilibria.

    Finally, our model provides a convenient vehicle for articulating some econometric issues

that arise in the analysis of models with multiple equilibria. As emphasized by Woodford

(1991, p. 77), there is a widespread perception that “anything goes” with sunspot models—

any set of facts can be explained. The model in this paper can be used to illustrate that

sunspot models in principle do impose discipline on an empirical analysis.10 With one ex-

ception, the econometric procedures used to analyze standard models with unique equilibria

and driven by exogenous shocks can be used to analyze and test sunspot models too. The

exception is that procedures which select parameter values by equating model first moments

and corresponding sample first moments may no longer be well-defined. This is because

    gAn itiuential example is the analysis of Poole (1970), who argues that the appropriate choice of monet ary
policy regime depends on whether sho~         emanate from financial markets or investment decisions. The
criterion driving the policy design in Poole’s analysis is minimization of output variance.
   10See Dagsvfi and Jovanovic (1994), Farmer and Guo (1995), Imrohoroglu (1993), Jovanovic (1989),
Sargent and Wall=e (1987), and Woodford (1987,1988,1991) for further development of this point.

there may be a set of possible first moments associated with any parameter configuration,

depending on which equilibrium the economy is in.

   The intuition underlying the dyntics             in our model is essentially the same as that de-

scribed by Benhabib and Farmer (1994) and Farmer and Guo (1994).                          The economy is

perfectly competitive, and individual producers have linearly homogeneous product ion func-

tions in capital and labor, which are strictly concave in each. However, economywide average

output operates as an externality in front of each firm’s production function, shifting it up

when average output is high. The latter is the key to why there are multiple equilibria in

our model and to why expectations can act as an independent source of fluctuations. If all

households act on the conjecture that the current period’s wage rate is high by supplying

more labor services to the market, then the market-clearing wage is high because of the

externality on labor. Similarly, if households act on the conjecture that next period’s rental

rate on capital is high by buying more investment goods today, then their conjecture will be

validated. 11

    A regime which specifies that the tax rate rises with aggregate employment has the

potential to stabilize output by defeating the mechanism that gives rise to multiple equilibria.

Conjectures that the rate of return on market activity is high cannot be self-fulfilling if the

  11This is the case for two reasons. First, the externality on capital prevents next period’s incresse in
capital from directly reducing the marginal product of capital. (That the externality is strong enough for
the aggregate capital stock not to enter the marginal product of capital is the reason the difference equation
mentioned above is fist order, which in turn is the reason the global set of equilibria is transparent in our
model. ) Second, the externality on labor helps ensure that the increase in next period’s wage rate, occasioned
by the rise in capital next period, stimdates a large increase in employment. This indirectly helps drive up
next period’s rental rate on capital.

   The outline of the paper is as follows. Our model and equilibrium concept are presented

in Section 2, Section 3 establishes our characterization resdt for the set of competitive

equilibria. Sections 4 and 5 analyze the deterministic and stochastic equilibria of the model,

respectively. Econometric issues are addressed in the context of the analysis of stochastic

equilibria. Section 6 considers the impact of an automatic stabilizing tax policy and reports

the socially optimal allocations. Section 7 concludes.




2. The Model


Let St denote the realization of the exogenous shocks at date t. In models with shocks

to fundamentals, St would include shifts to preferences or technology, or to government

spending.    In this paper, we do not consider such shocks.            In the stochastic versions of

our model, St represents disturbances which influence equilibrium outcomes, but which do

not tiect   fundamentals.     We let St = (s., S1,.... St) denote a history of realizations up to

and including date t. For simplicity, we only consider environments in which the number

of possible values of St is finite for each t. The probability of history St is denoted p~(St).

To conserve on notation, from here on we delete the subscript -t on p. This should not

cause confusion: that the functions Pt(St) and p, (s”), r # t are different is evident horn

the fact that the quantity of elements in St and s“ is dfierent.           We adopt this notational

  120ur argument is related to the one in Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (1996). They show that a procyclical
tax policy (designed to support a balanced budget) can destabilize the economy by making possible sunspot
equilibria.




                                                    6
convention for all functions of histories. The probabilityy of s~+l conditional on St is denoted

p(st+l I St) - p,+l(s’+l)/p,(s’).     We now discuss the agents in our model and our concept of

equilibrium.



2.1. Households


We assume a large number of identical households.            At each St and t, the representative

household values consumption and leisure henceforth according to the following utility func-

tion:




where DC(O, 1) is the discount rate, s~ I St denotes histories, s~, that are continuations of the

given history, St, and c(s~), n (s~) denote consumption and labor, respectively, conditional on

history s~. The household must respect the following sequence of budget constraints:



                                               C(sj) + k(sj) – (1 – a)k(s~-l)       =       (2.2)


                 [1 – T(sj)][T(sj)k(sj-’)   + w(s~)n(s~)] + T(sj),   all Sjls’, j   2   t




 where r(s~ ) and w(s~) denote the mmket rental rate on capital and the wage rate, respec-

tively. Also, ~(s~) is the tax rate on income, T(s~) denotes lump-sum transfers from the

government, and k(s~) denotes the stock of capital at the end of period j, given history

sj.   The household also takes k(st–l ) as given at St. Finally, the household must satisfy the




                                                    7
following inequality constraints:



                               k(sj)~ o,c(s~) >0,0<          n(s~)   <1                     (2.3)



for all s~ I St and j ~ t and takes as given and known the actual future date-state contingent

prices and taes:

                         {r(.sj), w(#),7(#),   T(sj);     j ~ t, all # I s’}.               (2.4)



We assume that

                                   U(c, n) = loge+      alog(l   – n,)                      (2.5)


where a > 0.

   Formally, at each St and t, the household problem is to choose {c(s~), n(s~), k(s~); j z t,

all s~ I St} to maximize (2.1) subject to (2.2), (2.3), (2.4), and the initial stock of capital,

k(st-l ). The intertemporal Eder equations corresponding to this problem are




               UC(N”)
                   =p ~        p(~”+lI sj)uc(s~+l){[l – r(s~+l)]r(s~+l) + 1 – 6}            (2.6)
                         ~j+lIst


all s~ I St, j z t, and the intratemporal Euler equations are



                         -Un(s’)
                          UC(SJ)
                                 =[1 -     Tow,             all Sj I St, j >
                                                                           — t.             (2.7)




Here, ud(s~) and u.(s~ ) denote the partial derivatives of u with respect to its first and second




                                                  8
arguments, evaluated at c(s~), n(s~). Finally, the household’s transversality condition is




                                                                                         (2.8)


The sufficiency of the Euler equations, (2.6) and (2.7), and transversality condition, (2.8),

for an interior solution to the household problem may be established by applying the proof

strategy for Theorem 4.15 in Stokey and Lucas with Prwcott (1989).



2.2. Firms


We assume a large number of identical fires, each of which solves a static problem at every

St. As a result, we can, without risking confusion, simplify the notation by deleting the St

notation. The representative firm faces the following technology relating its output, Y, to

its capital, K, and labor, N, inputs and to the economywide average level of output, y:



                        Y = f(y, K,N)    = y7~aN(1-”))    O < ~,a <1.                     (2.9)




We assume that

                                          a=l–~.                                        (2.10)



The relation between the econom~ide      average level of output and the econom~ide   average

stock of capital, k, and labor, n, is obtained by solving g = ~(y, k, n) for y:



                                                                                        (2.11)



                                               9
given (2. 10). The line~ity of this function in terms of k is essential for simplifying the

analysis to come. In addition, as discussed by Rebelo (1991), linearity allows for growth to

occur endogenously.

   The lirm takes y, r, and w as given and chooses K, N to m~irnize profits:




                                       Y–TK–wN                                          (2.12)




subject to (2.9). The firms’ fist-order conditions for labor and capital are




                                      f~=w,     f~=r                                    (2.13)




where f~ and j~ are the derivatives of ~ with respect to its second and tbird arguments,

respectively. We assume firms behave symmetrically, so that consistency requires y = Y, k =

K, n = N. Imposing these, we get




                                 fN = (1 – a)nk, fK = an2                               (2.14)




with ~ = 2/3. With this value of ~, the model impliw that labor’s share is 2/3, which is close

to the value estimated using the national income and product accounts (Christian      1988).




                                              10
2.3. Government


The income t= rate policy, r (St), is specified exogenously, and we require that the following

budget constraint be satisfied for each St:




                             T(SL)[T(St)k(St-l) + Wan]            = ~(St).                         (2.15)



2.4. Equilibrium


The resource constraint for this economy is




                      C(st) + k(st) – (1 – 6)k(st-1) < k(st-1)n(st)2 = y(st).                      (2.16)



We then havelq

   . Given the prica, the quarttities solve the household’s problem.

   . Given the pricw and q“ven {y(st)           = k(sL–1)n(st)2}J the quantities solve the firm’s
     problem.

   ●   The government’s budget constraint is satisfied.

   ●   The resource constrm”nt is satisfied.


We find it useful to define an intetior equilibrium. This is a sequence-of-markets equilibrium

in which a ~ n(st) ~ b for all St for some a and b satisfying O < a ~ b < 1.

   131t is easily verfied that the analysis would have been unaltered had we instead adopted the date O,
krow-Debreu      equilibrium concept. In this case, households would have had access to complete contingent
claims markets.

3. Characterizing Equilibrium


In the next section of the paper, we study deterministic equilibria in which prices and quan-

tities do not vary with St and stochastic (sunspot) equilibria in which prices and quantities

do vmy with St. The analysis of these equilibria is made possible by a characterization result,

which is presented next.

   Substituting (2.13) and (2. 14) into the household’s intertemporal Euler equation, (2.6),

we get

           —=D—                                                                                    (3.1)

                                       z(st) = k(s~_~) I ‘(st)   = ~(st-1)“                        (3.2)



Substituting (2.14) into the household intratemporal Euler equation, (2.7), we get



                                  E(st) = [1 – T(st)]:n(s~)[l       – n(st)].                      (3.3)




The resource constraint implies that



                                        E(st) = n(st)2 + 1 – 6 – A(st).                            (3.4)




Combining the two Euler equations, (3. 1) and (3.3), and the raource constraint, (3.4), our

Here, a ‘ denotes next period’s value of the variable. The transversality condition, (2.8), is

equivalent to


                                  [n(s~)’ + 1 – 6 – [1 – T(sT)]:n(s’-)[l – ~(sT)l] = o

   The basic equilibrium characterization rault for this economy is

Proposition     3.1. Suppose that T(st) -0.            If ford]   s’ and t >0,


                                           {n(s’)}    satisfim (3.5)


and

then {n(st )} corresponds to an equilibrium.

Proof.     To establish the result, we need to compute the remaining objects—prices and
quantities-in an equilibrium md verify that they satisfy (2.6), (2.7), (2.8), (2.13), and
(2.16). A candidate set of objects is found in the obvious way. The sufficiency of the first-
order and transversality conditiom for household optimization and the sficiency       of the
first-order conditions for firm optimization guarantee that these me an equilibrium.

   The characterization result indicates that understanding the equilibria of the model r~

quires understanding the v function. It is easily cofimed           that v = w defines a quadratic

function in n’ for each fixed n, U. (Later, we refer to w as the Euler emor.) Hence, for each

n, w there are two possible n’ : n’ = j.(n, U) and n’ = jl (n,,u), where




                                                                                              (3.9)




Here,



                                   p(n)q(n, w)                         1–6
                   b(n, 0)   =                      , c(n, w) =                              (3.10)
                                 a + q(n, w)p(n)                  a + q(n, u)p(n)

                     p(n)    =                                                               (3.11)
                                        fln(l -n)

                   q(n, u)   =   1–   ~n(l – n)w.                                            (3.12)




The function v has the shape of a saddle, as can be seen in Figure la. The intersection of w

and the zero plane (w = O) is depicted in Figure la as the boundary between the light and

dark region of v. This intersection defines the curves ju(., O) and ~1(-, O), which are shown

in Figure lb.   We refer to these as the upper and lower branches of the function w. The

lower brmch intersects the 45-degree line at two points, which are denoted fil and fi2. These

intersection points cannot be seen in Figure lb, but can be seen in Figure lc, which displays

n’ — n for n near the origin. It is easy to see from Figure la that with higher values of

u, ji increases and iu decreases. The figure also indicates that for these functions to be



                                                 14
real-valued, w must not be too big.

   The branches in the figure are computed using our baseline parametetization, o = 2,

@ = 1.03-*, 6 = 0,02. Here, E1 = 0.02 and fiz = 0.31. The gross growth rates of capital

(that is, A) at these two points aze 0.973 and 1.004, respectively.     Our assigned value of

~ is often used in the real business cycle literature. The value of a causes the model’s

implication for the share of income going to capital and labor to coincide with one estimate

of this quantity based on the national income and product accounts.         (See, for example,

Christian   1988.) In addition, this pararneterization of a facilitates some of the analytic

results described above. However, we have verified that the shape of the v function is not

very sensitive to the perturbations in a. The assigned value of 6 can be justified based on

our model’s capital accumulation equation and on U.S. capital stock and investment data.

(See, for example, Christian   1988 and Christian and Eichenbaum 1992.) The issue of how

data may be brought to bear to determine a value of u is addressed below.




4. Deterministic        Equilibria


We begin by considering deterministic equilibria, in which prices and quantities depend on

t, but not on st. To simplify the presentation, we drop the history notation, and we use

the conventional time subscript notation instead. As we shall see, the set of deterministic

equilibria is qtite rich. For example, any constant sequence {nt }, with nt = fil or nt = fi2,

satisfies the conditions of the characterization result and so is an equilibrium. Similarly, any

sequence with no E (fil, fi) and n~+l = fl (n~,O), t z O is also an equilibrium, with nt ~ fi2.



                                               15
Here, fi satisfies fi > fi2 and RI =    fl(fi,O).   Figure 2 exhibits two equilibrium paths, one

sttiing     with no = 0.4 and the other with no = 0.2. Each path convergw monotonically to

fi2.

       Other deterministic equilibria are more exotic and display a variety of types of regime

switching. For example, the equilibrium employment policy function could be time non-

stationary, with employment determined by the lower branch for, say, six periods, followed

by a singleperiod jump to the upper branch, followed by another six-period sojourn on the

lower branch, and so on. The model has another type of regime switching equilibrium too,

in which the employment policy function is discontinuous.

       As an example of the latter, consider equilibria in which employment, n’, is determined

by the upper branch for n over one set of intervals in (O,1) and by the lower branch over the

complement of these intervals. One example of this is given by




                                                I
                                                    f~(n, 0)   for   fil < n ~ 7721
                    n’ = f(n),   where j(n) a                                                    (4.1)
                                                    fU(n, O) for ml < n < m2

where ml < fi2 and m’ are a chosen set of numbers. By considering dfierent values of a,

(4.1) defines a family of maps. A we sh~ see, there are elements in this family of maps

which exhibit characteristics that resemble chaos. 14 There are several concepts of chaos in

suyama (1991 b).



                                                    16
the literature. We consider two.



4.1. Topological    Chaos


We consider the topological concept of chaos as discussed in Devaney (1989). We require

two definitions first:

Definition 4.1. The map j : J 4 J is said to be topo~ogicdly transitive if for any pair of
open sets, U, V c J, there ew”sts k >0 such that fk (U) fl V # 0.


   Here, ~1(n) = ~(n), ~2(n) = ~[~(n)], and so on.            Loosely, the above definition says

that for almost all initial conditions, iterations on the map, j, produce an orbit (that is,

n, j(n), f 2(n), ...) that visits every region, no matter how small, of J. An example of a map

that violates this condition is the policy function of the standard one-sector growth model.

For any initial capital stock, iterations on the policy function generate a sequence that

converges monotonically to the steady state. -If the initial capital stock is below the steady

state, then capital stocks smaller than the initial condition and above steady state are not

visited. A second definition that is important is

Definition 4.2. The map j : J A J has sensitive dependence on im”tid conditions if there
w“sts 6>0 such that, for any n c J and any neighborhood N of n, there exists y ● N and
m ~ O such that lf~(n) – jm(g)l >6,


   This says that for any initial condition, n, and any neighborhood, no matter how small,

around n, there is at least one other initial condition whose orbit eventually dtiers by at

least 6 from the orbit of n. Note that the parameter 6 is chosen as a function of the map,

but it is not a function of n, or the size of the neighborhood around n. A sequence generated

by a map that etibits    sensitivity to initial conditions is dficult   to forecast for two reasons.

                                                17
First, the slightest measurement error in the initial conditions may result in a substantial

error of forecast. Second, even if the initial conditions are measured accurately, then any

slight rounding error in computing an orbit is likely to be magnified.

   Then, we have

Definition   4.3. Let J be a set. The map j : J -     J is said to be Aaotic on J if

   ●   j has sensitive dependence on im”tid conditions.

   ●   t is topologicdy   transitive.

   ●   perio~c points off   are dense in J.


By a periodic point, n, we mean one for which there is some k >0 such that n = ~k(n).

   Theorems exist that establish conditions under which a given map is chaotic. Unfortu-

nately, these theorems require either that ~ be continuous (see, for example, chapter 1.1 of

Devaney, 1989) or that it be piecewise continuous and differentiable with derivative greater

than unity in absolute value. (See Lasota and Mackey, 1985, chapter 6.) We are not aware

of theorems that include maps of the kind considered here. Instead, we follow the strategy

pursued in Domowitz and E1-Gamal (1993,1994) and develop simulation-based evidence on

whether our map is chaotic.

   Consider semitivity to initial conditions first. For this, we compute the Lyapunov coef-

ficient, L(n), associated with the map, ~, defined in (4.1). The function, L, maps n E (O, 1)

into the real line. For any fixed fi E (O, 1),



                                                                                        (4,2)




                                                 18
where nj+l = ~(ni), i = l) ..., T – 1, nl = fi,, and d~(ni)/dn denotes the derivative of j with

respect to n, evaluated at n = ni. To see why L is of interest, note that the sum is equivalent

to log *       . If h is a periodic point of any finite order k, then jk(fi) = fi. If it is a stable

periodic point, then ~            <1.   If T = rnk, where m is an arbitrary positive integer, then




                                                                                               (4.3)



where nl = fi, and nl+l = ~k(nl), 1 = 1, .... m – 1. This suggests that if E, is a stable periodic

point of any period, then L(fi) must be negative. But if ~ has a stable periodic point, or a

point whose orbit intersects with such a point, then it violates sensitivity to initial conditions.

Thus, a negative value of L(n) indicates that one of the conditions necessary for j to be

chaotic fails. A positive value of L(n) is a necessary condition for chaos.

   Figure 3 shows L(h) for a in the range 1.25 to 2.20, with fi fied at 0.255.1s We truncated

the infinite sum in (4.2) at T = 2,000. We set m 1 = 0.33, m2 = 0.70. Note that L(fi,) is

positive for values of u less than 1.5. Hence, for values of a in this range, there is evidence that

~ is characterized by sensitivity to initial conditions. To investigate this further, comider

IS = 1.25. Figures 4a and 4b show two sequences of 400 observations on hours worked,

simulated using f. In one cme the initial condition is 0.455, and in the other the initial

condition is 0.454. Despite the fact that the initial conditions are very close, the two orbits

are quite different. In fact, they are eventually as dissimilar as they would have been had the

  lsln ~OmPUtatlon~
                  experimentsnot reported here, we found that the graph in Figure 3 is insensitive to
the value of h. This insensitivity is consistent with r=tits   in Figure 5, discussed below.




                                                       19
initial conditions been far apti.   By the 70~~observation, the two series are completely out

of phase. Then, by around the 310t~ observation, they are almost identical again. Although

the amplitude of the two series mies     somewhat, most of the differences between the two

series has to do with ph~e. Note how strikingly different these equilibria are from the ones

shown in Figure 2.

   Now consider topological transitivity.     One way to investigate this is to compute the

histogram of orbits associated with different initial conditions. To compute this histogram,

we divide the unit interval into 3,000 equal-width intervals and approximate the histogram of

an orbit by the number of times hours worked lands in each interval in a simulation of length

50,000. Figure 5 shows histograms for orbits associated with fou initial conditiom drawn

from very different parts of the unit interval. These histograms are similar in two respects.

First, consistent with topological trmsitivity, each orbit appears to cover the same region

of the unit interval. In particular, let J denote the union of intervals with positive mass in

Figure 5. Then J appears to be independent of the initial conditions.        This is consistent

with the notion that orbits associated with almost all n c J wander through every small

neighborhood of J. The second striking feature of the histograms in Figure 5 is that they

appear to have the same shape. Thus, the histograms are consistent not only with the notion

that almost all orbits in J visit each subinterval in J with positive probability (topological

transitivity), but they are also consistent with the notion that the probability of visiting each

subinterval is the same across orbits.




                                               20
4.2. Statistical      Chaos


A second concept of chws, closely related to the first, is statistical (Lasota and Mackey

1985). Here, we follow the treatment in Domowitz and E1-Gamal (1993,1994) and E1-Gamal

(1991).

   Let g be a density function defined on J. That is, JJg(n)dn = 1 and g(n) 20              for all

n ● J. If we draw from g and apply the map fi : J +               J to each draw, we have a new

distribution of points on J. Denote this distribution by ~~. Then following Domowitz and

E1-Gamal (1993,1994), we say that f exhibits statistical chaos if j; exhibits the ergodic

property or the mixing property.

Definition     4.4.    The map j : J ~ J is ergodic if



                                                       for all g c G.




   For re~arity        conditions on the limiting density function, q, and the set of density func-

tions, G, see Domowitz and E1-Gamal (1993,1994).            (Obviously, G cannot include density

tictions     which place mass exclusively on a single periodic point.) For f to be ergodic does

not actually require that f; settle down for large i. The mixing property does require this.

Definition     4.5.    The map f : J ~ J is mixing if




The properti~         of ergodicity and mixing are closely related to the notions of topological

transitivity and sensitive dependence. For example, consider a density function, g, which

                                                  21
assigns positive probability to an arbitrarily selected ad   extremely small interval of initial

conditions. Mixing requires that the orbits of these points eventually cover the same range

in J as if the initial conditions were instead drawn from a density that assigns positive

probability to every subinterval of J.

   We adopted the simulation-based approach of Domowitz and E1-Gamal to investigate

whether our j map exhibits statistical chaos. Thus, we considered two g functions.           One

places a uniform distribution on the interval [0.16, 0.32] and the other places a uniform

distribution on the interval [0.58, 0.71],   In each case, we drew 1, 000 times      from   the g

                           for each draw. The resulting histograms are shown in Figure
function and computed ~31000

6. There are two interesting features of these histograms. First, to the unaided eye they

appear very similar to each other, consistent with the notion that f satisfies the mixing

condition. Still, the differences can be re~onably substantial, as the bottom graph in Figure

6 shows. Second, the histograms in Figure 6 closely resemble the orbit histograms shown

in Figure 5. This suggests that our f map approximately satisfies concepts of ergodicity

in standard econometrics textbooks (for example, Hamilton 1994, pp.           46-47), in which

statistical properties of individual sample realizations (that is, histograms of orbits) coincide

with q = limi~a ~~.




5. Sunspot Equilibria


In this section, we study equilibria of our model in which prices and quantities respond

to St. We construct two equilibria to illustrate the possibilities.    The fist,   which we call



                                               22
a conventional sunspot equilibrium, uses jl only. This equilibrium is constructed near the

deterministic steady state, fi,2, which, as noted above, has a continuum of deterministic

equilibria which converge to it. Our choice of name reflects that this type of equilibrium is

standard in the quantitative sunspot literature. 16 The second equilibrium considered, which

we call a regime switching sunspot equilibrium, involves stochastically switching between fl

and ju. Our analysis of these equilibria focuses on their welfare and business cycle properties.

For this analysis, we find it useful to use the business cycle properties of U.S. data and of a

standard real business cycle model w benchmarks. We conclude this subsection by making

some observations about the econometrics of sunspot models in general and by discussing

the empirical plausibility of our model.



5.1. Conventional       Sunspot     Equilibrium


In this equilibrium, s c R is independently distributed over time, with s = –0.06 and

s = 0.06 with probability 1/2 each. These values for s were chosen so that the equilibrium’s

implication for the standard deviation of Hodrick-Prescott detrended, logged equilibrium

output coincides with the corresponding figure in the data. Given any n, next period’s hours

worked, n’, is computed by first drawing s and then solving



                                               n’ = jl(n, s)                                           (5.1)


  16Because a continuum of other nonstochastic equilibria etists near the steady state equilibrium, fiz, this
equilibrium is said to be indeterminate (Boldrin and Rustichini 1994, p. 327). For a general discussion of
the link between indeterminate equilibria and sunspots, see Woodford (1986a). Examples of quantitative
analyses that construct sunspot equilibria in the neighborhood of indeterminate equilibria include Benhabib
and Farmer (1994,1995), Farmer and Guo (1994,1995), and Gali (1994 a,b).



                                                     23
where ~1is defined in (3.9). We set the initial level of hours worked, no, to fi2. Recall that

fi2 is the higher of the two deterministic steady states associated with the lower branch, ~1.

That is, of the two solutions to x = ~1(z, O), fi2 is the larger of the two.

    To establish that this stochastic process for employment corresponds to an equilibrium,

it is sticient   to verify that the conditions of the characterization result are satisfied. The

first condition is satisfied by construction, and the second is satisfied because n(s~) remains

within a compact interval that is a strict subset of the unit interval. That is, let a be the

smaller of the two values of n that solve a = jl (a, –0.06), and let b > a be the unique value

of n with the property a = ~1(b, –0.06). Here, a and b are 0.0249 and 0.9509 after rounding.

We verified that if a < n < b, then a ~ n’ ~ b for n’ = jl(n, –0.06) and n’ = jl(n, 0.06).

Thus, prob[ a < n’ s b I a s n S b] = 1. It follows that a < n(st) S b for all histories,

St, with p(st) > 0. The conditions of the characterization restit are satisfied, and so we

conclude that n(st) corresponds to an equilibrium.

    The first-moment properties of this equilibrium are reported in Table 1. They are similar

to the corresponding properties of the U.S. data and of the real business cycle model. The

second-moment properties of this equilibrium (see Table 3) also compare favorably with

the corresponding sample analogs, at least relative to the performance of the real business

cycle model (see Table 2). In this context, three observations are worth stressing. First,

note the equilibrium’s prediction that consumption is smooth relative to output and that

productivity is roughly as volatile as hours worked. In the latter respect, the conventional

sunspot equilibrium actually conforms more closely to the data than does the real business




                                                24
cycle model.   The real business cycle model implies that productivity is about 65 percent

more volatile than hours worked, whereas the conventional sunspot equilibrium implies that

productivity is about as volatile as hours worked. In the data, productivity is about 30

percent less volatile than hours worked. Second, hews and productivity are both procyclical

in the equilibrium, as they are in the data. The equilibrium’s implication that productivity

is procylical reflects the increasing returns in the model.    Procyclical productivity helps

account for the fact that equilibrium hours worked and consumption are both procyclical in

the model. Finally, the model inherits a shortcoming of standard real business cycle models

in overpredicting the correlation between productivity and hours worked. In the data, this

quantity is essentially zero.

   Some of these properties can also be seen by examining the plots in Figure 7. They

are graphs of the logged and Hodrick-Prescott filtered data from the equilibrium described

above.   Consumption is smooth and investment is volatile in these graphs.         In addition,

hours worked and productivity are seen to be procyclical. Overall, this sunspot equilibrium

compmes quite well to the real business cycle model in its ability to mimic key features of

postwar U.S. business cycles.



5.2. Regime    Switching    Sunspot   Equilibrium


For this equilibrium, s = [s(1), s(2)] c R2, with s(1) G {u, 1} and s(2) = w c {–0.06, 0.06}.

We set the date O value of hours worked to n(so) = fi2. We use the following recursive

procedure to assign a level of employment to each history, s~,that is logically possible, given

the specified so. For any history, St, and associated level of employment, n(s~), let n(s~+l) be

                                              25
as follows:

                                      n(s’+’)   = f.,+, (,) (n(s’),St+,(z))                             (5.2)


for t = 1)2, .... We construct an equilibrium by devising a sequence of probabilities, p(s’),

that assigns positive probability only to histories, St, for which a < n.(st) < b, for some a, b

such that O < a < b < 1. When the value of s(1) changes along a history, we say there has

been a regime switch.

   Consider the following probabilities for S,+l(1):



                                          0.9, fil < n(sc) < fi2, fil = 0.0370, fi2 = 0.9279
              prob[s,+l(l)   = /] =                                                                     (5.3)
                                          1, otherwise.
                                      {



Let s(2) have the same distribution as s in the previous equilibrium.                    We assume that

the two elements of s are independently distributed.                Let a and b be defined as in the

convent ional sunspot equilibrium. We verified numerical y that, under these circurnstantes,

if a s n(s~) s b, then prob[a s n(s~+l) s b] = 1, It follows that, for all Stsuch that p(st) >0,

a ~ n(st) < b.17 This establishes the second of the two conditions of the characterization

restit. To establish the first condition, note that by (5.2),



                                 v (n(st), n(st+l)) = st+1(2), for all st                               (5.4)


  170u.r specification of fil and fi2 is crucial for guaranteeing the second condition of the characterization
resdt. For example, with fil = a and fi2 = b, histories, St, in which hours worked fluctuate betieen values
that approach O and 1 occur with high probability. With p(st ) specified in this way, the second condition of
the char=tertiation resdt fails.




                                                       26
and by construction of the Etier error, s~+l(2),




                            ~ p(s’+’    I st)s,+,(2) = O, for all s’.                      (5.5)
                           St+llst


This establishes that the conditions of the characterization result are satisfied, and we con-

elude that n.(s~) corresponds to an equilibrium.

   We now consider the dynamic properties of the regime switching sunspot equilibrium.

First-moment properties are reported in Panel C of Table 1, while second-moment properties

are reported in Panel B of Table 3.      Regime switching is the key to understanding the

dynamics of this equilibrium. Periodically, the economy switches to the upper branch, fu,

where employment is very high. The economy typically stays on the upper branch only

briefly, and when it switches down again, employment drops to a very low level: near a.

Employment then rises slowly until another switch occurs, when the economy jumps to the

upper branch, and the process continues. The fact that the economy spends much time in

the left region of the lower branch explains why average employment in this equilibrium is

so low. This also explains why investment is, on average, negative. Regarding the second-

moment properties, output is substantially more volatile than it is in the data. Also, output

displays very little serial correlation. The positive serial correlation produced by sojourns on

the lower branch is offset by the negative serial correlation associated with transient jumps

to the upper brmch. These observations are supported by the time series plots of the logged,

Hodrick-Prescott filtered data born this equilibrium, presented in Figure 8.

   The regime switching equilibrium nicely illustrates a type of sunspot equilibrium that


                                               27
is possible.   However, in contrast with the conventional sunspot equilibrium, the second-

moment properties of this equilibrium do not match the corresponding quantities in the

data.



5.3. Empirical      Evaluation         of the Model


A variety of other econometric methods can be used to assess the empirical plausibility of

this model.lg One test of the model analyzes the fitted values of the sunspot shocks, s. Given

values for the model parameters, these shocks can be recovered using employment data. 19

For this test, we used the data on per capita, qumterly hours worked covering the period

1955Q3-1984Q1 studied in Christian              (1988) and Christian       and Eichenbaurn (1992). The

data, shown in Figure 9a, were converted into fractions of available time worked under the

assumption that households’ available time is 15 hours per day (1,369 hours per quarter).

The fitted values ofs imply that all quarterly U.S. observation on hours worked lie on jl, that

is, ~(1) = 1 throughout the sample. This complements the findings of the second-moment

analysis reported above, which indicates that—wit h.in the confines of this model—regime

switching does not improve our understanding of the aggregate data.

    The time series on the fitted Euler equation error, 3(2), are shown in Figure 9c. The model

requires that this shock satisfy (5.5). All dynamic models have at least one orthogonalit y

  18For a formal statistical appro~h    to the moment comparison strategy for testing undertaken in the Previ-
ous subsection, see the method based on the work of Hansen (1982) developed in Christian and Eichenbaum
(1992). This analysis integrates parameter uncertainty into evaluations of the “distance” between model and
data second moments.
   19For any two consecutive observations on employment, n and n’, s(2) = v(n, n’). Then, given s(2), one
finds the two values of z, zl < ZU such that s(2) = v(n, z). If n’ = xl, then s(1) = 1, and s(1) = u otherwise.
condition like this. Generalized method of moments (GMM) procedures for testing it have

been developed ad           applied extensively, beginning with the work of Hansen (1982) and

Hansen and Singleton (1982). These tests focus on a model’s implication that date t + 1

Euler errors be orthogonal to all information available at date t, including a constant. The

evidence in Figure 9C indicates that this test fails: the sample mean of the fitted Euler error

is significwtly negative (—O.27), indicating that a nonzero constant is useful for predicting

this variable. The second-moment properties of the fitted values of ~(2 are more consistent

with the theory. Figure 9b shows the scatter plot of consecutive values of fitted Euler errors,

and it suggests that the fist-order autocorrelation of ~(2) is not significantly different from

zero. (The point estimate is –O. 18, with standard error O.0920.) Figure 9C shows the scatter

plot of the empirical measure of hours worked at date t, nt, against the date t + 1 fitted

Euler error, ~t+l(2). Here too, the evidence does not imply a strong relationship between

these variables. The point estimate of the correlation between these two variables is –0.20,

slightly more than twice the standard error of 0.09. These results are subject to two caveats.

First, they do not take into account sampling uncertainty in the estimated values of a and

6. However, the results in Ch.ristiano md Eichenbaum (1992) suggest that this is very small

and unlikely to chmge the results. Second, they me based on arbitrmily setting a = 2. A

conventional GMM approach to this would select a value for a to ensure that sample analogs

of the population orthogonality properties of the Euler errors are satisfied. For example, the

value of a that sets the sample average of the fitted Euler errors to zero is 6 = 2.72. Apart

  ‘“The   standard error is l/fi,   where 115 is the number of observations in the sample.




                                                    29
from changing the sample mem, this change in the value of u does not alter the properties

of the Euler errors reported above.

   We conclude that there is little evidence in the Etier errors against the model and that

the upper branch appears not to be operative in the data.

   Interestingly, conditional on ruling out the upper branch, ~., the model implies a re-

duced form relation very much like the one found in standard models driven by fundamental

shocks. For example, equation (5. 1) closely resembles the equilibrium relation for employ-

ment implied by the general equilibrium model analyzed in Sargent (1979, p. 377). The only

qualitative difference is that in the latter, the shock variable, s, is a combination of distur-

bances to preferences and technology, while here it is a sunspot shock, s(2). An implication

is that the model can be estimated and tested using the same maximum likelihood strategies

pursued in Altug (1989), Christian      (1988), Hall (1996), and McGrattan, Rogerson, and

Wright (1996). This observation is consistent with the notion that sunspot models simply

offer a new source of shocks. From an econometric perspective, they are not qualitatively

different from models with fundamental shocks.

   Our final test of the model focuses on its implications for the agg-regate production

technology, (2. 11). To assess the plausibility of this formulation, we plot the log of output per

unit of capital versus the log of per capita hours worked in Figure 10. (See the observations

marked *.) The output and capital stock data used are the quarterly data covering the period

1955Q3–1984Q1 studied in Christian       (1988) and Christian     and Eichenbaum (1992). The

data do indicate a positive relation, but it is not M strong as the one implied by the model, in




                                               30
which log(y/k)    = 210g(n). One way to assess the plausibility of the model is to compare this

line with the least squmes line fitted through the U.S. data points. A factor complicating

the comparison with this data is that the model does not contain a theory of the error term

in this relation-clearly     one is needed, given the wide dispersion of the U.S. data points.

Now, suppose the errors reflect technology shocks, which could easily be incorporated into

the analysis. Then, assuming equilibrium labor responds positively to technology shocks, a

standard simultaneity bias argument implies that the slope of the least squares line is biased

upward, as an estimate of the power on hours worked in the aggregate production function.

(See Klenow 1992.) Thus, conditional on interpreting the dispersion of data points in Figure

10 M reflecting the effects of technology shocks, we conclude that the data in that figure

constitute a rejection of the very high power on hours worked in the production function of

this paper.21

   To summarize the results so far, the analysis in this section shows that—at least in the

context of our model—it is far from true that “anything goes” empirically with sunspot

models. The models can be tested using standard econometric methods-GMM                       procedures

for compming sample and model-based second moments, GMM procedures for testing Euler

equations, and standard mtimurn likelihood procedures. Although the conventional sunspot

equilibrium does a surprisingly good job of accounting for business cycle phenomena, in the

end, its strong increasing returns assumption is rejected by the data.22

  21This complements findings in Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (1995) and in the references they cite.
  22For an attempt to extend our analysis to a version of the model with a smaller externality, see Guo and
Lansing (1996).




                                                    31
5.4. Welfare     Analysis


We approximated the expected discounted utility for our equilibria using a Monte Carlo sim-

ulation method. For the conventional sunspot equilibrium and the regime switching sunspot

equilibrium, the expected present discounted utilities are –378.21 (0.24) and –570.58 (1.77),

respectively (numbers in parentheses are Monte Carlo standard errors). 2S To understand

the impact on utility of variance in the Etier error, s(2), we also computed expected

utility for a high variance version of our conventional sunspot equilibrium.                  In this case,

s(2) E {– 0.55, 0.55}. The expected present value of utility for this equilibrium is –363.35

(2.14).   The present discounted level of utility associated with the constant employment

deterministic equilibrium at fi2 is – 378,49. We refer to this equilibrium as the constant

employment equilibrium.

   To compare these welfare numbers, we converted them to consumption equivalents. That

is, we computed the constant percentage incre~e in consumption required in the constant

emplo~ent      equilibrium to make a household indtierent between that equilibrium and an-

other given equilibrium. The results are shown in Table 4. They indicate that going from the

constant employment equilibrium to the regime switching sunspot equilibrium is equivalent

to a 289 percent permanent drop in consumption. Going to the conventional sunspot equi-

librium is equivalent to a 0.9 percent permanent rise in consumption, and going to the high

   23For emh equilibrium,we drew 1,000 histories, St, each truncated to be of length 2, 500 observations.
Subject to the initial level of employment being fi2 always, we computed consumption and employment along
each history. For each equilibrium, we computed 1,000 present discounted values of utility, VI, .... Vlooo.
Our M~&~ Calo estimate of expected present discounted utility, u, is the sample average of these: u =
& ~i=l vi. The fact that we use a finite number of replications implies that u is approximately normally
distributed with mean v and standard deviation IS~/~~,         where ui is estimated by the standard deviation
of VI,..., Vlooo.we refer to ui /~~      as the Monte Carlostandarderror.


                                                     32
variance version of that equilibrium is equivalent to an 11.2 percent rise in consumption.

   An interesting feature of these results is that, despite concavity in the utility function,

increasing volatility in s(2) raises welfare. This reflects a trade-off between two factors.

First, other things being the same, a concave utility function implies that a sunspot equilib-

rium is welfare-inferior to a constant, deterministic equilibrium ( concatitg eflect ). However,

other things are not the same. The increasing returm means that by bunching hard work,

consumption can be increased on average without raising the average level of employment

(bunching eflect). When the volatility of the model economy with initial employment fi2 is

increased by raising the volatility of s(2), then the bun~hing effect dominates the concavity

effect. men   volatility is instead increased by allowing regime switches, then the concavity

effect dominates.   In interpreting these results, it is important to recognize that they say

nothing about the nature of the efficient allocations. All of the equilibria that we consider

are inefficient, because of the presence of the externality in production.




6. Policy Analysis


We now consider the impact of various policies on the set of equilibria. We consider two

countercyclicd   tax polici~ that reduce the set of interior equilibria to a singleton in that

output is a constant. We refer to the first as a pure stabilizer because it does not distort

margins in equilibrium. The second t=      policy introduces just the right distortions so that

the equilibrium supports the optimal allocations. We show that, for a tax policy to isolate

the efficient allocations as a unique equilibrium, it is necessary that the tax rate vary in the



                                               33
right way with the state of the economy. For example, under a comtant tax rate policy, the

equilibrium is not unique. Interestingly, the equilibria are isolated in this case, so that they

would escape detection under the usual procedure of analyzing local equilibria.



6.1. A Pure Automatic       Stabilizer


In this section, we display a particular procyclical tax rate rule which reduces the set of

equilibria to a singleton with nt = fi2 for all t (the constant employment equilibrium). The

t= policy has the property that in equilibrium, the tm rate is always zero and thus does not

distort any margins. Given our previous rwults for the constant employment equilibrium,

this tax rate rule improves welfare relative to the regime switching sunspot equilibrium, but

actually reduces welfare relative to the conventional sunspot equilibrium. The possibility

that stabilization of a sunspot by government policy might reduce welfare should not be

surprising, given that both the sunspot equilibrium and the fi2 equilibrium are inefficient.

   Consider the following t= rate:



                                                     fi2
                                         T(n) =l–;                                         (6.1)




where n denotes economywide average employment and fi2 is the higher of the two nonsto

chastic steady state employment levels. (See Fi~e     lb. ) Note that this t= rate is zero when

aggregate employment is fi2. It turns positive for higher levek of employment and negative

for lower levels.

   Let ti(n, n’) denote (3.6) after substituting out for T(n) from (6.1). It is easily verfied


                                               34
that, for each value of n, there is at most one n’ that solves ti(n, n’) = O. This is given by



                                                 fi2– K(n)(l – 6)
                                   n’ = f(n) =    _
                                                  722[1+ aK(n)]



where
                          fifi2
                   K(n) = ~(1          -n),   A(n) =n’+1    -6-     ~fi2(l -n)
                                                                    ~


The function, ~, and its derivative, fl, have the property that at n = 1,




                            f(l)   =




since afi2 < 1. Figure 11 shows f under our baseline parameter values. For convenience, the

two branches of v = O, ~Uand jl, are also displayed.

   There are three things worth emphasizing about ~. First, it cuts the 45-degree line from

below at n = fi2, and it intersects the horizontal axis at a positive level of employment. This

implies that there is no infinite sequence, n~, t = O,1,2, .... with no < fi2 and nt = f(nt–1),

such that nt > 0 for all t. Since satisfaction of the Euler equation, Z = O, is a necessary

condition for an interior solution to the household problem, it follows that there is no interior

equilibrium with no < fi2. Second, a sequence of employments, nt, t = O,1, .... which has the

property nt = f(nt-l)   and no > ii2, has the property nt ~ 1 m t ~ m. Appealing again to

the necessity of the Euler equation, we conclude that there is no interior equilibrium with

no > fi’. Third, nt = fi2 for all t satisfies the Euler and transversality conditions and so

corresponds to an interior equilibrium. Thus, the only deterministic interior equilibrium is

                                                 35
the one that corresponds to nt = ii2 for t = O,1, .... That sunspot equilibria are also rtied

out follows from the fact that the Euler equation cuts the 45-degree line from below and

from the arguments in Woodford (1986a). These remmks establish


Proposition    6.1. For the b=eline parametrization         and under the tax policy in (6. l), there

is a um”queinterior eqw”librium m“th n.t= fi2 for d] t.


Note that under the tax rate policy considered here, ~~ = O in equilibrium.               Evidently,

the mere threat to change t= rates is enough to rule out other equilibria. This feature of

fiscal (and monetary) policies designed to select certain equilibria is common in models with

multiple expect ational equilibria. (See, for example, Boldrin 1992, p. 215 and Guesnerie and

Woodford 1992, p. 380-382.)



6.2. Optimal   Allocations


The efficient allocations correspond to a fictitious planner’s choice of investment, employ-

ment, and consumption to maximize discounted utility subject to the resource constraint.

We reproduce the utility fmction here for convenience:




                         ~ ~;~’p(s’){log[c(s’)]        + olog[l - n(s’)]}.                      (6.2)
                         t=o St


The resource constraint is



                C(st) + k(s~) – (1 – 6)k(st–1) ~ k(st–l)[n(s’)]2,       for all t, St.          (6.3)



                                                  36
This problem simplifies greatly. Thus, using the change of variable in (3.2) and the identity

                                                 logk(s’-’)                                            (6.4)




the objective function can be written




                      ~   ~B’P(’t) {log[n(’t)’+ 1-6-             A(”)] + &       log A(st)             (6.5)
                      t=o St

                      +Olog[l – n(s~)]} + *           logko.




In (6.5), consumption has been substituted out using the (scaled) resource constraint after

replacing the weak inequality in (6.3) by a strict equality. Notice that the objective in (6.5)

is separable across dates and states. This has two implications. First, unsurprisingly, the

efficient allocations are insensitive to sunspots. Second, the efficient Ievek of employment

and capital accumulation do not exhibit cycles.               It is trivially verified that this result is

independent of the curvature on leisure in the utility function, the degree of nonconvexit y on

labor in the production function, and the degree of homogeneity on capital in the resource

constraint 24 Thus, for example, increasing the gains from bunching production, by raising

the power on labor above 2, and reducing the msociated costs, by making utility linear in

leisure, still does not imply that the efficient allocations exhibit cycles.

  24Lack of cycling in the efficient allocations also obtains for utility functions which are homogeneous   of
degree ~ # O in consumption. See the Appendix for further discussion.




                                                     37
   With our specification of preferences, optimizing (6.5) requires that the planner mmirnize,

for each t, St,



                                                  D
                       log[n2+l–6–        A]+ ~       log A + alog[l – n]                  (6.6)


by choice of n and A, subject to




                                                                                           (6.7)




The objective, (6.6), is not concave, because of the nonconcavity in the production function.

However, for tied n, (6.6) is strictly concave in A, and its optimal value is readily determined

to be A = ~(n2 + 1 – 6). Substituting this into (6.6), the criterion maximized by the efficient

allocation   becomes

                             ~       log(n2 + 1 – 6) + alog(l   – n)                       (6.8)



after constant terms are ignored. The constraint on this problem is O ~ n ~ 1. There are

two values of n that set the first-order condition associated with mtimizing     (6.8), and the

larger of the two is the global optimum. This is given by no, where



                                                                                           (6.9)




With the baseline parameter values, no = 0.98, which implies that the optimal value of A is

1.94, or 94 percent per quarter, The fact that equilibrium employment is so high reflects the



                                                38
fact that the efficient allocations internalize the externality in the production function.

     It is easily verified that the tm rate which supports no as an equilibrium is ~ = –2. It

is not surprising that this involves a subsidy, since the t=          must in effect coax individuals

into internalizing the positive externality associated with production. Consider first the case

in which the t=    rate is simply bed   at ~ = –2 for every n. Let ti(n, n.’) denote (3.6) after

substituting out for ~ = – 2. In effect, reducing      T   born zero to -2 pushes the saddle in Figure

la down, so that the w = O plane now covers the seat of the saddle. The consequences can

be seen in Figure 12a, which displays the values of n’ that solve ti(n, n’) = O for n E (O, 1).

Note the region of values for n for which there are no values of n’ that solve i(n, n,’) = O.

In   the other regions, there are generally two values of n’ that solve this equation for each

n. Interestingly, the unique intersection of these points with the 45-degree line, at no, is

associated with a slope greater than one.         As a result, the equilibrium associated with

n“, no, no, ... is determinate. However, there is at least one other equilibrium, H,no, no, ....

(See Figure 12a for fi.) Evidently, the constant t= rate policy does not guarantee a unique

equilibrium.

     One way to construct a tax regime that selects only the desirable equilibrium follows the

strategy tden    in the previous subsection. Thus, consider



                                                           3n0
                                        ~(n)=l–            —
                                                            n“



Evidently, with this policy, r(n”) = –2, so that there is an equilibrium associated with this

t= policy which supports the efficient allocations. Also, it is easily verified that—following


                                                  39
the same reasoning as in the preceding subsection—the Euler equation has only one branch.

In addition, we found for the baseline parameter values that this branch is monotone, and

it cuts the 45-degree line from below. It follows by the logic leading to Proposition 6.1 that

there is a unique interior equilibrium.




7. Conclusion and Directions for Future Research


We have displayed a model environment which rationalizes implementing a tax regime which

is procyclical in the sense that if aggregate employment were to rise, the government stands

committed to raise the tax rate. In this sense, the environment seems to rationalize the

importance assigned by macroeconomists before the 1970s to devising automatic stabilizer

tn   systems.2J But, since a properly constructed tax regime eliminates fluctuating equilibria,

the actual tax rate is constant.    We expect this basic result to survive in versions of our

model with fundamental shocks, Thus, if there were technology shocks, we conjecture that

the optimal tax rate regime would move procyclically with sunspot shocks, but would not

vary with technology shocks. Assuming an efficient tax regime eliminates sunspot equilibria,

the optimal “automatic stabilizer” t=      rate would then not be procyclical in equilibrium.

An interesting question for future resemch would be to inv~tigate what happens when the

t=   regime cannot respond differently to fluctuations due to sunspots and to fluctuations

due to technology shocks. Possibly, under these circumstances an efficiently constructed tax

regime would exhibit procyclical behavior in equilibrium. Another interesting question for

  25Fora discussionof “automaticstabilkers,”seeChristian (1984).



                                                40
future research would explore the robustness of our result that a properly constructed tm

regime necessarily stabilizes fluctuations. We have shown that this is so under a ptiicdar

homogeneity assumption on the resource constraint. But, standard models do not satisfy

this condition.

In this appendix, we establish efficiency for a policy of the form, kt+l = A“h and nt = n,*,
where A“, n* are fixed numbers. We do this for a class of economies in which the resource
constraint is homogeneous in capital and in which preference are homogeneous in consump
tion. Our result pmallels that in Alvarez and Stokey (1995), except their environment does
not explicitly allow for variable hours worked.
    Consider the following planning problem:



                                                                                      (Al)



subject to the following femibility constraints:




We assume that F is homogeneous:




ln   terms of A and n, the constraints on the planner are:




That is, the plmer’s   feasible set is the set of infinite sequences, {At, nt}~O, such that
At,nt c B for each t ~ O. We place the following assumptions on ~ :

We have w < w, since w < ti < m. To establish –m < w when T >0 note simply that


                                                    47
u is bounded below by zero in tfis case. For the case ~ < 0, note that the feasible polic~
At = 1, nt = h, for t ~ O has retmn k~vti, where ti = ~(1, fi)vg(fi)/ [7(1 – ~)] , so that
—m<ti    <w.
    We have established that w is a finite scalar. By ~iting (A. 7) out explicitly, one verifies
that w satisfies the following exprmsion:


                                                                                          (A.8)



Let A“ and n* denote dues of A. and no that solve the above m=”m”zation problem. The
result follows from the fact that these solve a problem in which the objectives and constraints
are independent of ko. Q.E.D.

Remark 1. The proof for the class of utility functions U(C,n,) = log(c) + g(n) is a trivial
perturbation on the argument in the text,

Remark 2. When ~ > 0, then the fied point problem in (A. 8) can be shown to be the
fied point of a contraction mapping. ln this case, w in (A. 7) is the ody solution to (A.8),
and the contraction mapping theorem provides an iterative algorithm for computing w, A“,
and n*. men ~ <0, the mapping implicitly defined in (A.8) is not necessarily a contraction.
Almez and Stokey (1995) supply iterative schemes for computing w in this case.
