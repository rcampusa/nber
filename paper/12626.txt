The Performance of Reverse Leveraged Buyouts

                                                  ABSTRACT

Reverse leveraged buyouts (RLBOs) have received increased public scrutiny but attracted little systematic
study. We collect a comprehensive sample of 496 RLBOs between 1980 and 2002 and examine three-
and five-year stock performance of these offerings. RLBOs appear to consistently outperform other
IPOs and the stock market as a whole, with economically and statistically meaningful positive returns.
There is no evidence of a deterioration of returns over time, despite the growth of the buyout market:
RLBOs performed strongly in the late 1980s, the mid-1990s, and the 2000s. Large RLBOs that are
backed by private equity firms with more capital under management perform better. We also find the
so-called quick flips--when private equity firms sell off an investment within a year after acquisition--underperform.

Introduction
       In recent years, intense public scrutiny has surrounded the phenomenon of reverse
leveraged buyouts (RLBOs), or initial public offerings (IPOs) of firms that had
previously been bought out by professional later-stage private equity investors. This
paper seeks to understand the long-run performance of these offerings, in order to
understand whether these concerns are justified.


       To date, much of the discussion of these offerings has focused on a few troubled
RLBOs, such as Refco, which Thomas H. Lee Partners bought a majority stake in for
more than $500 million in 2004 and took the company public at more than double the
price a year later. In one of the more than a dozen lawsuits filed after the collapse of the
firm soon after its IPO, the plaintiffs asserted “there are substantial questions to be
answered concerning the structure, cost and effects of the investment in Refco by Thomas
                                          s IPO in August of 2005."2
H. Lee Partners in June of 2004, and Refco'


       More generally, observers have argued that buyout groups push overleveraged
companies too quickly into the public market. For instance, the New York Times (Sorkin,
2005) observed:
       [S]everal high-profile quick flips have left critics wondering whether
       buyout firms were using such offerings simply to line their pockets, rather
       than using the proceeds to support companies. Earlier [in 2005], the
       Blackstone Group sold a German chemicals company, the Celanese
       Corporation, to the public after owning it for less than 12 months. The
       firm quadrupled its money and all of the proceeds from the offering were
       used to pay out a special dividend to Blackstone. Mr. Kravis'      s firm,
       Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, also quadrupled its money by
       flipping PanAmSat, the satellite company it owned for less than a year.

A recent Wall Street Journal article on RLBOs (Cowan, 2006) noted that “while some
debt is fine, when it is taken on to finance things that only benefit some shareholders—
such as special dividends—new investors are buying hobbled companies.”

(accessed May 22, 2006).
       But it is plausible to wonder whether buyout groups would find such a strategy
productive. Buyout groups typically hold large equity ownership in firms prior to their
IPOs, and continue to retain large ownership stakes subsequent to the offerings. Thus, the
post-IPO long-run performance of RLBOs will have substantial wealth implications for
the private equity investors. More importantly, as repeated players in IPO market, buyout
groups will suffer reputation losses if its RLBOs turn out to be failures.


       These discussions suggest the desirability of a systematic look at the long-run
performance of RLBOs. Surprisingly, these offerings have attracted little attention in the
academic literature in recent years, despite the considerable attention devoted to the
performance of venture capital-backed IPOs (Brav and Gompers, 1997; Gompers and
Lerner, 1999; Hamao, Packer, and Ritter, 1999; Jain and Kini, 2000; Masulis and Li,
2005; and many others).


       Several papers in the earlier literature, however, are quite relevant to this one.
First, there is a literature on the evolution of LBOs. Kaplan (1992) examined 183 large
leveraged buyouts executed between 1979 and 1986, and documented that a significant
fraction of firms undergoing LBOs went public once again: the RLBOs in his sample
remained private for a median time of 6.82 years. Muscarella and Vetsuypens (1990)
examined 72 RLBOs between 1983 and 1987, and documented substantial increases in
profitability and temporary increases in leverage when compared to the same firms prior
to the LBO.


       Most relevant are four studies. DeGeorge and Zeckhauser (1993), examining 62
RLBOs between 1983 and 1987 (though much of the analysis is based on a smaller
sample), find that the accounting performance of these firms exceeds their peers prior to
going public, and then deteriorates thereafter. They find no evidence, however, that these
offerings’ stock prices underperform the market. Holthausen and Larcker (1996) examine
90 RLBOs between 1983 and 1988, and argue that there is no evidence of either poor
performance when either accounting or stock market measures are employed. Chou,
Gombola and Liu study the earning management around RLBOs and find positive and



                                              3
significant discretionary current accruals coincident with offerings of RLBOs. Finally,
Mian and Rosenfeld (1993) examine 85 RLBOs over roughly the same period and find
that the offerings slightly outperform their stock market peers.


        The absence of scrutiny of RLBOs since the 1980s is especially striking due to the
changes in the market since these years. As discussed in the next section of the paper, the
buyout market of the 1990s and 2000s is very different from that of the 1980s, both in
terms of the amount of capital deployed and the degree of competitiveness of these
transactions. It is natural to ask whether the earlier patterns still characterize this market.


        This analysis also provides an opportunity to understand the drivers of cross-
sectional differences in RLBO performance. The modest number of offerings studied
limited the ability of earlier authors to draw systematic conclusions about the
considerations that made RLBOs particularly successful.


        In this paper, we examine 496 RLBOs between 1980 and 2002. The following
conclusions emerge from the analysis:
    •   RLBOs appear to consistently outperform other IPOs and the market as a whole.
        The positive returns appear to be economically and statistically meaningful.
    •   No evidence of a deterioration of returns appears over time, despite the growth of
        the buyout market. RLBOs performed strongly in the late 1980s, the mid 1990s
        (less consistently), and the 2000s.
    •   RLBOs sharply outperform the market in the first, fourth, and fifth year after
        going public; performance in other years is more ambiguous.
    •   Much of the outperformance seems associated with the larger RLBOs, but this
        may be driven by the apparently superior returns of RLBOs by groups with more
        capital under management at the time of the offering.
    •   There is no evidence that more leveraged RLBOs perform more poorly than their
        peers.




                                               4
       The plan of this paper is as follows. Section 1 briefly reviews the evolution of the
leveraged buyout market since the 1980s. In Section 2, we discuss the construction of the
data-set employed in the study. Section 3 presents the basic analyses of long-run
performance. Several supplemental analyses examining cross-sectional differences in
RLBO returns are discussed in Section 4. The final section concludes the paper.


1. The Evolution of the Leveraged Buyout Market
       During the 1980s, the U.S. buyout industry was comprised of a relatively small
number of organizations. These groups identified transactions through personal contacts
with executives in key industries and various intermediaries. When they identified a
transaction, they would often have weeks or months to analyze the proposed deal. They
would then structure the transaction using high degrees of leverage: often as much as
85% or 90% of the total purchase price would be in the form of debt. As a result, even a
modest increase in the value of the firm—which could be due to the overall growth in the
stock market, inflation, and operating improvements—would lead to substantial profits
for the equity-holders.


       As Kaplan (1997) notes:
       In the first half of the 1980s, the LBO insights led to great success. As
       documented in Kaplan (1989) and Kaplan and Stein (1993), buyout
       companies experienced improved operating profits and few defaults.
       Adjusting for the overall stock market or industry, these early buyouts
       generated abnormally positive returns. Because the overall stock market
       increased over this period, buyout sponsors earned substantial nominal
       returns.

Subsequent years have more challenging for buyout groups. The buyout industry today is
far larger than it was during the years when it enjoyed its greatest returns. Fundraising by
U.S. buyout funds was six times greater in 1998 than it was in 1987, and by 2005, it was
nine times the level in 1987.


       At the same time, the returns from these investments deteriorated. For instance,
while average buyout fund established between 1980 and 1985 earned a rate of return of
47%, those established between 1986 and 1999 earned an average IRR of slightly less


                                             5
than 10%.3 This observation is corroborated by a correlation analysis, which shows a
very strong negative correlation between fundraising and returns in private equity.4


        Most observers attributed the deterioration of returns as capital under
management has increased to increased competition for transactions. Over time, there
were increasingly fewer opportunities to buy companies at relatively low prices without
competition. Sellers of firms—having become aware of the numerous potential buyers—
increasingly hired investment banks, who conducted auctions between leveraged buyout
groups. As a result of the increased competition, buyers were required to pay more for
transactions. Auctions also had another, less direct cost: that of “dry holes.” When
assessing a proposed transaction arranged through close contacts where there is only one
private equity group involved, the general partners can be confident that if they decide to
go ahead with the transaction, they will be able to complete the transaction. In an auction
where there are a dozen or more groups bidding, the dynamics are very different. Even if
it wants to undertake the transaction, the private equity group has a low probability of
success. Hence, the risks are much greater in this scenario.


        These changing dynamics have been widely recognized by sophisticated
practitioners. For instance, Rick Rickertsen of Thayer Capital commented in 2001:
        Capital has always been a commodity, but never has it been more plentiful
        than it is today. Have management availability and expertise been
        growing at the same rate? Very unlikely. This means the ratio of capital
        to expertise is increasing dramatically.

It might be anticipated that these changes would have affected the market performance of
RLBOs as well, if, as press accounts suggested, competitive pressures were leading firms
to take more marginal and more leveraged firms public.

 These         calculations    are       based        on       the        VentureXpert          database
(http://vx.thomsonib.com/NASApp/VxComponent/VXMain.jsp, accessed May 23, 2006). Returns are
computed as of December 31, 2005. Data are continuously updated, and therefore subject to change.

 The correlation coefficient between the leveraged buyout fundraising and the average returns from 1980 to
2002 is -0.67. Because Venture Economics only reports aggregated data for the returns of buyout funds in
vintages years 1980 through 1983, we use the average annual fundraising in this period in the correlation
analysis.


                                                    6
2. Data
        We sought to build as comprehensive a collection of RLBOs between 1980 and
2002 as possible. We chose the former cut-off date because the earlier literature suggests
that there were essentially no such offerings previously. We employed the latter date to
ensure that we had at least three years of performance data for each offering.


A. Identifying the RLBO Sample
        One of the main barriers to research in this area is the identification and
characterization of the RLBOs. The difficulty in identifying the buyout-backed IPOs
arises from two factors.
    •   The first is the secretive nature of buyout organizations. Unlike venture capital
        organizations, these groups rarely disclose new investments on web sites or in
        press releases. As a result, the coverage of the major databases is considerably
        less complete than that of venture-backed transactions.
    •   Another complication comes from the fact that the boundaries between venture
        capital and buyout investments are increasingly blurred. For example, private
        equity firms that typically make buyout investments have in the past decade also
        often made venture capital type of investments. Hence, one cannot infer the deal
        type by just looking at the attributes of the investors. This gives rise to ambiguity
        in identifying the Reverse Leveraged Buyouts among the private equity-backed
        IPOs.


        Since we wish to understand the performance of RLBO transactions, we choose to
eliminate transactions that are ambiguous. In particular, we insist that the transactions
satisfy two criteria:
    •   That the financing was undertaken by a buyout group. We compile a list of
        buyout firms/funds that primarily engage in buyout activities from VentureXpert
        and Capital IQ. Any IPOs that are not backed by at least one organization on this
        list was regarded as non-buyout backed and eliminated from the sample.




                                             7
   •   That the investment was characterized by the use of leverage. To help screen out
       investments by buyout organizations that more closely resemble venture capital,
       we search press accounts via the Factiva, as well as financial sponsor home pages
       and SEC filings, to understand the features of the transaction.


       We identify RLBOs from several sources. The first of these is Securities Data
Company’s (SDC) Corporate New Issues database. The database flags IPOs with an
identifier indicating that it had previously conducted a leveraged buyout. This gives us a
sample of 229 RLBOs for the period from 1980 through the middle of 1998. SDC,
however, does not flag any RLBOs after 1998. Moreover, it appeared that the list was
incomplete in earlier years.


       The second approach was to search databases of LBOs, and seek to identify
whether any transactions subsequently went public. RLBOs were determined by
examining both the entries in the databases indicating the outcomes of the transactions
(which are frequently incomplete), as well as through our own searches of news stories
and the SDC Corporate New Issues database. To do this, we employed SDC’s
VentureXpert and SDC Mergers and Acquisitions databases, as well as Standard and
Poors’ Capital IQ. While the Capital IQ database is more comprehensive, it only extends
back to 1998. In each case, the databases identify a large number of transactions that
could be better characterized as venture capital investments, which we eliminate using
the criteria described above. These three sources generate an additional 267 RLBOs,
leaving us with a final sample of 496.


       Table 1 presents the distribution of the sample by year. It highlights the increase
in RLBO activity in the 1990s and the 2000s. It also highlights that the level of RLBO
activity remains modest (at least until the final two years of the sample) in relation to that
of LBOs, venture capital-backed IPOs and that of IPOs as whole: overall, only 8% of the
IPOs by number and 13% of the IPOs by market value between 1980 and 2002 are
RLBOs. In total, the number of RLBOs represent 13% of the LBOs conducted during this
period. While almost 150 private equity groups are represented, the bulk of the offerings



                                              8
are by well-known groups such as Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, Forstmann Little, Citicorp
Venture Capital, T.H. Lee, and Warburg Pincus.


          Despite our efforts to be as comprehensive as possible, our sample may be subject
to potential selection effects. Large and visible RLBOs are more likely to be included in
the sample due to the fact that the buyout groups’ attempts at secrecy are less effective
here. Although one cannot check ex post whether the sample used in this work is
representative of the universe of RLBOs or not, we did two “sanity checks.” First, we
asked several buyout firms to check whether our sample includes all the RLBOs that they
have backed in practice. Second, we compared our sample those used in the existing
literature to see whether it is consistent. Our sample performed well in the above two
checks.


B. Supplemental Data
          In addition, we use a variety of data on private equity returns in this study. This is
drawn from the databases of the Center for Research into Security Pricing (CRSP) with
the following exceptions:
    •     Benchmarks based on industry and size and book-to-market matched (5 X 5)
          portfolios       are        taken         from        Kenneth           French’s         website
                                                                                             5
          (http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/index.html).
    •     The benchmark of non-buyout backed IPOs is based on the SDC Corporate New
          Issues database, which reports 11,004 IPOs from 1980 through 2002. After
          eliminating American Depository Receipts, Real Estate Investment Trusts, closed-
          end funds, unit offerings, and spin-offs, as well as IPOs with an offering size
          smaller than $1.5 million, firm assets less than $5 million, or an offering price of

 French’s website contains a detailed description of the industry portfolio’s construction. The 5 X 5
portfolios, which are constructed at the end of each June, are the intersections of five portfolios formed on
market capitalization and five portfolios formed on the ratio of book equity to market equity. The size
breakpoints for year t are the NYSE market equity quintiles at the end of that June. The book-to-market for
June of year t is the book equity for the last fiscal year end in t-1 divided by market capitalization for
December of t-1. The BE/ME breakpoints are NYSE quintiles. All firms that have issued equity in the
previous five years in either an IPO or a seasoned equity offering are not included.



                                                     9
       under $5 per share, we have a final sample (including the 496 RLBOs) of 6,202
       IPOs, of which 5,265 are listed in CRSP.
   •   The lead underwriters of all IPOs were identified from SDC Corporate New
       Issues database. (We also obtain from this database other information on the
       characteristics of the firm prior to the IPOs, such as assets and leverage.) The
       corresponding underwriter reputation measures are from Jay Ritter’ website
       (http://bear.cba.ufl.edu/ritter/ipodata.htm), which are in turn based on Carter and
       Manaster (1990) and subsequent papers.
In addition, for our returns analysis, we require the RLBOs to be listed in CRSP, which
reduces our sample to 428 RLBOs. In some analyses, we further require that all IPOs
have information in SDC on the offering’s lead underwriter, and in Compustat on
leverage and assets after the time of the offering. This reduces the sample to 364 RLBOs
and 3,799 total IPOs.


       Finally, we collect some information for the RLBOs exclusively. For the buyout
group sponsoring the transaction, we determine the year of formation of its first fund and
its total capital raised from its first fund to the most recent fund before the RLBO. This
information was hand-collected from the SDC VentureXpert database. When multiple
groups were investors, we used the information on the oldest or largest group (lead
buyout firms), since we believed it would be critical in certifying the firm to investors. In
addition, we manually collected from the prospectuses that the RLBOs filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) information on the representation of the
buyout group on the board of the firms and the buyout organization’s and management’s
ownership holdings prior to and after the IPOs. This step further reduces our sample to a
final sample of 251 RLBOs. The smaller sample of 251 is used whenever IPO ownership
and governance data is analyzed. Otherwise, the larger sample of 364 RLBOs
(COMPUSTAT-CRSP-SDC matched) or 428 (CRSP matched) is used.


       Tables 2, 3 and 4 summarize some of the key information collected. As Table 2
reports, the RLBOs are considerably larger than the other IPOs (again, excluding unit
offering, ADRs, closed-end funds, REITs, and smaller offerings based on share prices,



                                             10
assets, and offering size). These offerings are less underpriced: their first-day return is
less than half that of the other offerings. There are also considerably more leveraged after
the IPOs (this ratio is the book value of debt to the sum of the book value of debt and the
market value of equity) and           considerably more assets beforehand. Finally, at least
partially reflecting the greater size of the offerings, the gross spread is lower for the
RLBOs.6


        Table 3 provides some specific information about the RLBOs. The RLBO firms
remain private for more than six years after LBOs. This is consistent with Kaplan (1992).
The buyout groups’ total capital7 managed before the year of RLBO averages $2.9
billion, but with a tremendous range. Similarly, buyout groups are on average 14 years
old at the time of the RLBO, but with a great deal of diversity. As noted, above, both
measures will be used as a proxy for buyout group reputation. The buyout group (or
groups, if multiple investors are present) typically holds a majority ownership of 55% in
the RLBO firms before the IPO and the ownership stake decreases to 38% after the
offering, largely due to the effect of dilution from new share issues.8 Managers and
directors also take large equity stakes: their ownership decreases from 66% pre-IPO to
36% post-IPO. The buyout groups not only have large stakes in the RLBOs, but also
actively monitor the managers. About 44% of the boards of directors are from or
affiliated with buyout groups and 30% of RLBO firms have their chairman from buyout
groups. In 14% of the cases, the president, CEO, and chairman (some of whom may hold
multiple titles) are from or are affiliated with the buyout group.


        Table 4 summarizes the characteristics and accounting performance of the RLBOs
shortly after the offering. The RLBO firm characteristics include the following: equity

employed is from Compustat.

 We replicate the analyses below using different measures of capital under management, and find the
results are robust to their use.

 All ownership stakes are calculated on a common share equivalent basis: that is, convertible preferred
shares are converted into common stock at the ratio then in effect (typically at the time of the IPO, all
classes of preferred stock are converted into common shares).


                                                   11
market capitalization, book-to-market ratio, assets, the ratio of operating income to
assets, the ratio of net income to assets, the debt-to-assets ratio, the capital expenditures-
to-assets ratio, and the underwriter reputation. For each measure (except the reputation
measure), we obtain data from the quarter immediately after IPO or the end of the quarter
of the IPO. We then report the cross-sectional summary statistics. The last column reports
sample mean, adjusted by the industry averages, which we compute for each two-digit
industry using the Standard Industrial Classification scheme.


        Consistent with findings by DeGeorge and Zeckhauser (1993) and Holthausen
and Larcker (1996), RLBOs have better financial performance than other IPOs. RLBO
firms on average outperform the industry average. The operating return on assets (ROA)
is 1.68% higher than the industry-adjusted average of other IPOs. Similar results hold for
the ratio of net income to assets, which is 0.95% above the industry. Consistent with the
earlier LBO literature, RLBO firms are more levered than others: their total debt to asset
ratio is 30%, more than 9% above the industry median. Moreover, RLBOs are backed by
more reputable underwriters than other IPOs; differences are again statistically
significant.


3. Analysis of RLBO Performance
        Panel A of Table 5 turns to the question at the heart of this study: whether RLBOs
create value for investors. The table summarizes the cross-sectional mean and median
performance measures of RLBOs within five years following the IPOs. The measures are
the raw (unadjusted) buy-and-hold returns, the buy-and-hold returns adjusted by market
(the value-weighted NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ index), and the alphas (excess returns)
from the capital asset pricing (CAPM) model (also known as Jensen’s alpha) and from a
three-factor Fama-French model.9



9
 In the Fama-French regression, we employ as independent variables (in addition to the alpha, or constant
term) RMRF, the value weighted market return on all NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ firms (RM) minus the risk
free rate (RF) that is the one-month Treasury bill rate, SMB (small minus big), the difference each month
between the return on small- and large-capitalization firms, and HML (high minus low), the difference each
month between a portfolio of high book-to-market stocks and the return on a portfolio of low book-to-
market stocks.


                                                   12
       The RLBOs deliver a raw buy-and-hold return of 18.25% over one year, 43.83%
over three years, and 72.27% over five years after the IPOs. When this return is adjusted
by value-weighted buy-and-hold market return, the mean remains positive, but is only
statistically different from zero in the first year. (The previous study by Holthausen and
Larcker (1996) did not find significant first year returns.) Risk-adjusted returns from the
CAPM or Fama-French models are positive and significant over all the years after the
IPOs. The coefficients on the alpha terms suggest that the offering outperform the market
by between 0.4% and 0.6% per month in the five years after the offering.


       In Table 5, the market–adjusted RLBO performance has the median sharply
below the mean. When we run regressions and compute the Jensen and Fama-French
alpha, the mean does not differ significantly from median. A potential explanation is the
large dispersion in the RLBO returns: there are many negative returns as well as very
large positive returns. Simialrly, the market adjusted return has a very negative median
but the mean is dominated by the very large positive returns. While we estimate
regressions, the magnitude of such outliers is limited by the control variables,
substantially reducing the differences between the mean and median.


       The evidence from Table 5 suggests that RLBOs outperform the market generally,
but the extent depends on the evaluation methods. Panel B and C in Table 5 address the
concerns in the literature (Mian and Rosenfeld (1993)) that performance of RLBOs is
driven by premium paid for RLBOs which are acquired subsequent to the offerings. Panel
B reports the performance of RLBOs for the sub-sample of firms that survive five years
following the IPOs. Panel C reports the performance of sub-sample of firms that are
merged within 60 months after the RLBOs. There are 252 firms that survive 60 months
after the RLBOs. This sub-sample outperforms the market. For the surviving firms, the
market-adjusted return is positive and significant after one year, two years, and three
years following the RLBOs, but less consistently statistically significant thereafter. Panel
C shows that the merged RLBO sub-sample consistently outperforms the market.




                                            13
         Over time, there have been “LBO waves,” where private equity groups have done
a series of transactions in a single industry: for instance, many LBOs and RLBOs were in
the 1980s were concentrated in the food retailing industry (Denis (1994), Chevalier
(1995)). Moreover, different buyout groups have different industry foci.10 As a result, the
industry mixture could be important factor to control for. More generally, Barber and
Lyon (1997) argue that matching sample firms to control firms of similar size and with
similar book-to-market ratios yield well-specified test statistics in the long-run
performance studies.11 It might be particularly important to control for size and book-to-
market since RLBOs are larger and have high book-to-market ratios than other firms, as
Table 3 showed.


         Figure 1 shows the geometric average returns for RLOBs over three years after
going public. The bar shows the distribution of returns and the line is the fitted normal
distribution. Two patterns emerge from the graph: (a) the bulk of the RLBO geometric
returns are positive, with a positive median, and (b) the distribution of the geometric
average returns is skewed, with fat tail at the left. These two patterns suggest that overall
performance of RLBOs is positive and that poorly-performing RLBOs have strong
impact on the distribution.


         Table 6 looks at the performance of various sub-groups of R:BOs. Much of the
discussion in the business press about the performance of RLBOs has focused on
offerings that went public soon after being bought out, as well as public firms that were
taken private and then returned to the public marketplace. This table breaks down the
offerings by whether the firm at the time of the LBO was private or public, the months
the firm kept private between the LBO and the RLBO, the use of proceeds as debt
reduction or other. The public LBO firms perform better than their private counterparts
when they go public. The difference, though economically large, is not statistically
significant.

10
 For instance, the Carlyle Group established its initial reputation through transactions in defense industry,
while Silver Lake Partners focuses on high-technology firms.
11
 Brav and Gompers (1997) find that after size and book-to-market ratios are controlled for, IPOs do not
outperform the market, as the initial analyses in the literature suggested.


                                                     14
           We also divide the sample according to the months after the LBO and before the
RLBO. If a firm was kept private longer than median holding period of 37 months, it
actually performs slightly worse than the ones kept private shorter. But when we examine
the “quick flips”--the 53 RLBOs that went public within a year after the LBO—these
RLBOs perform much worse than those firms kept longer than one year by buyout
groups. The differences are not statistically significant, though. The evidence provides a
partial support for the claim that “flipping” LBOs does not provide much value.


           Panel D in Table 6 reports the sub-sample performance according to the use of
proceeds to reduce debt or not. For the firms that use the funds from RLBOs to reduce or
retire debt, performance is much better. The differences are not statistically significant
when using the value-weighted market benchmark or S&P 500 index returns. For the
equal-weighted benchmark, the differences are significant at 10% level. The evidence
suggests that debt reduction seems to create value for RLBO firms.


           The analysis in the Table 7 uses different benchmarks to examine the three-year
RLBO performances using monthly data. The benchmarks include the return of the S&P
500 index, equal- and value-weighted market portfolio, 5 X 5 Size and Book-to-Market
portfolio returns, and the Fama-French 48 Industry portfolio. The performance measure
employed is the wealth relative12 for the portfolios if RLBO firms, which is defined as


                   Wealth Relative= (1+Ri,T)/ (1+RBench i,T),


where Ri,T is the buy-and-hold return on IPO i for period T and RBench i,T is the buy-and-
hold return on the benchmark portfolio over the same period. Whenever a firm is delisted
within 36 months, we calculated the buy-and-hold return up to the delisting date.


           Panel A of Table 7 shows that when we equal-weight the RLBOs (that is, we treat
each offering the same, regardless of size), they outperform various benchmarks, while

12
     Brav and Gompers (1997) propose this measure in their long-run study of VC backed IPOs.


                                                    15
other IPOs underperform them by a considerable extent. The wealth relatives of the
RLBOs are bigger than one for all benchmarks except for equal-weighted market
portfolio, which is likely to be dominated by small (and presumably high-risk) NASDAQ
companies.


       Panel B shows the value-weighted RLBO performance. We form the weights in
this and subsequent tables using first-available market value of the RLBOs from
Compustat, which is from the end of the quarter of the IPO. The value-weighted RLBOs
continue to perform at least as well as the market in general, and considerably better than
other offerings, though the effects are not as dramatic.


       We explore the robustness of the results in several ways. We use daily, rather than
monthly, returns data and compute five-year (rather than three-year) returns. Both sets of
analyses, which lead to few substantial differences, are reported in the Table 8 and 9.


       A natural question is whether the performance of RLBOs has varied over time.
For instance, do offerings perform well initially, and then encounter difficulties? Have
particular time periods been especially good or poor for RLBOs?


       Figure 2 shows the event-time average excess returns for each of the five years
following the RLBOs. Panels A and B report the market adjusted returns, and Panels C
and D report the adjusted returns using 5 X 5 Size and Book-to-Market portfolios.
RLBOs have positive excess returns over the first year, forth and fifth years after the
IPOs. When equal weighted, RLBOs underperform in years 2 and 3, but value-weighted
RLBOs always have positive excess returns.


       Table 10 reports the three-year buy-and-hold returns for the RLBOs that took
place in each calendar year. The long-run returns show great variation over the time.
Performance tends to cluster together; the worst performances are concentrated in the
mid- to late 1990s. There is, however, no regular pattern in long-run performance of other
IPOs. Panel B of Table 10 shows that the value-weighted RLBOs perform better, with an



                                             16
average wealth relative to S&P 500 of 1.26.13 This implies that following a buy-and-hold
strategy, for every dollar earned holding the S&P 500 index, an investor would get 1.26
dollars if instead investing in the RLBOs. Again, the poorest performing years are in
1997 and 2000.


         Tests of long-run performance with buy-and-hold returns are subject to a variety
of measurement problems, which are discussed by Barber and Lyon (1997) among others.
One way to address this issue is to analyze the returns in calendar time, which is
somewhat different from that in Table 10. Rather than computing the subsequent returns
for the RLBOs that went public in a given year, the returns are computed for each year
for a portfolio of the RLBOs that went public in recent years. In Table 11, the portfolio is
formed by including returns within three years following the IPOs. Once again, we equal-
and value-weight the observations.


         As the table reports, the equal-weighted portfolios have monthly excess returns of
0.30%, while other IPOs under-perform the market on average. The value-weighted
RLBO calendar-time portfolios outperform the market strongly. The monthly excess
returns adjusted by value- and equal-weighted market index are 1.29% and 1.03%, both
statistically significant at 1% level. The market-adjusted RLBO return is positive in most
years, with the negative returns clustering in the 1990s. Other IPOs show marked under-
performance compared to the market. The excess returns adjusted by equal- and value-
weighted market are –0.59% and –0.76% respectively, significant at 1% level. In contrast
to the RLBOs, other IPOs only outperform the market in a few years (including 1998 and
1999, the Internet Bubble period).


         We run both CAPM and Fama-French regressions and report the results in the
Table 12. Consistent with the former univariate tests, we find value-weighted RLBOs
outperform the market significantly. Alphas from CAPM and Fama-French are about 1%
per month, significant at 1% level. RLBOs have positive exposures to firm size (SMB)
factor; the SMB coefficient is 0.7, significantly different from zero at the 1% level of

13
  The sample in Panel B is slightly smaller due to missing data needed to construct the value weights.


                                                    17
statistical significance. The book-to-market (HML) factor coefficient is not significant.
By way of contrast, other IPOs under-perform the market consistently. Consistent with
Ritter and Welch (2002), non-buyout backed IPOs have a market beta of 1.38.
Coefficients to SMB and HML factors are slightly smaller than those in Ritter and Welch
paper. Both SMB and HML coefficients are significant in these estimates.


4. Cross-Sectional Differences across RLBOs
       A natural next question has to do with the differences across offerings. What roles
do buyout groups play in post-RLBO long-run performance? Does equity ownership and
governance structure have any impact on post-RLBO long-run performance? Moreover,
does the financial situation of the firm post-offering affect its subsequent performance, as
one of the initial quotes suggested?


       In this section, we seek to answer these questions with multivariate analyses that
explain performance of RLBOs in the three years after going public. We find that the
performance of RLBOs is cross-sectionally associated with ownership, governance, and
the buyout group reputation proxies.


       Table 13 reports the multivariate regression results conditional on the offering
being an RLBO. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the three-year wealth
relative, defined as above, where the benchmark is the value-weighted buy-and-hold
return of the market. The right-hand side variables include the two proxies for buyout
group reputation: the natural logarithm of the buyout firm’s capital under management
and age at the RLBO date. In addition, we employ a dummy variable denoting whether
the chairman of the firm is from the buyout group, the percentage of board controlled by
the buyout group at the time of the IPO, the buyout firm’s equity ownership immediately
after the firm’s IPO, the logarithm of the equity market capitalization at the end of the
quarter of the IPO, the debt-to-total capitalization ratio after the IPO at the end of the
quarter of the IPO (again computed as the book value of all outstanding debt divided by
the sum of the book value of debt and the market value of equity), and the underwriter
reputation. All variables except for the underwriter rank are computed using data from



                                            18
the quarter immediately after IPO or the end of the quarter of the IPO. Columns 1
through 4 report the results from basic regressions; columns 5 through 8 with year and
industry fixed effects.


        When we first look at the buyout group reputation proxies without controls, we
find that RLBOs by younger groups perform better. Changes in buyout group size,
however, is associated with no change in performance. Contrary to the claims in the
quote in the introduction, more levered offerings perform better, not worse. While
greater representation of the buyout group on the board is positively (if insignificantly)
associated with performance, companies with a buyout group affiliate as their chair
perform poorly. One possibility is that in these firms, the transition to a public firm is
more wrenching (typically, buyout groups’ representatives sever their ties to the
companies at some point after the IPO).


        We know, however, that the relative performance of IPOs differs across time
periods. Moreover, as noted above, the industry composition of these buyouts has
changed over time. It thus makes sense to add industry and offering year controls to the
regressions.


        When we do add these controls in the final four regressions in Table 13, we find
that the negative coefficient on age disappears. The coefficient in the earlier regressions
may have reflected the fact that offerings in the 1980s, when buyout groups were
disproportionately young, did particularly well. Similarly, the coefficient on leverage is
no longer significant. What is positive and significant in the final regression is the
coefficient on buyout group size, while the coefficient for the market capitalization of the
RLBO has no significant explanatory power. This result suggests that large RLBOs do
particularly well because they are sponsored by large buyout groups.14



14
  In unreported regressions, we also add controls for the LBO group sponsoring the transaction. Once this
control is added, the other independent variables are uniformly insignificant. This suggests the RLBOs of
buyout groups that eventually become large outperform through the group’s life-span, and not just once
they raise substantial amounts of funds.


                                                   19
5. Conclusions
       In this paper, we take a comprehensive view of RLBOs over the past 25 years.
The rapid growth in the private equity industry, and the changes in the industry’s
structure in the past two decades, suggest the desirability of understanding the
performance of offerings since the 1980s.


       Examining a sample of nearly 500 offerings between 1980 and 2002, we find:
   •   On average, RLBOs are much larger in size, have more leverage and higher book-
       to-market ratios, are more profitable, and are backed by more reputable
       underwriters.
   •   Unlike other IPOs, LBOs, by and large, create wealth for equity holders in the
       long run. Value-weighted calendar time portfolios strongly outperform the
       market. When we explore the robustness of the results, CAPM and Fama-French
       models deliver the same results.
   •   The RLBO outperformance is especially strong in the first year, fourth and fifth
       years after the IPOs.
   •   The superior performance is not confined to a single time period, but has been
       found in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.
   •   Larger RLBOs appear to perform better, but this seems driven by their
       sponsorship by larger buyout groups.
   •   Greater leverage after the IPO does not lead to poorer performance.


       This research leaves a number of questions open, which we hope to explore in
later work. First, we have taken an initial look at the buyout groups’ involvement with
their portfolio firms and how it impacts value accretion of RLBOs. Characterizing in
more detail the extent of the buyout groups’ involvement, and understanding the
consequences of those connections, is challenging. But if these relationships can be
tracked more carefully (as has been done in research on venture capital), they should help
us enhance our understanding of the buyout process. Second, we have focused here
exclusively on offerings that have gone public. The outcome of buyout investments more




                                            20
generally, and the types of firms selected for each form of exit, remain surprisingly
poorly understood.

Table 2. Summary Statistics for RLBOs and Other IPOs

The sample consists of 496 RLBOs and 5,706 other IPOs between January 1980 and December 2002.
We exclude American Depository Receipts, Real Estate Investment Trusts, closed-end funds, unit
offerings, and IPOs with an offering size smaller than $1.5 million, firm assets less than $5 million, or
an offering price of under $5 per share. Mean characteristics for RLBOs and non-buyout backed IPOs
are provided. Summary statistics include the mean gross proceeds, under-pricing (first-day return),
leverage immediately after the IPOs (the ratio of the book value of all outstanding debt to the sum of
equity market capitalization and the book value of debt), firm assets immediately prior to the IPOs, and
gross spread. Information on underpricing is not available from SDC prior to 1986; that on assets is
unavailable prior to 1985.

Table 3. Summary Statistics for Buyout Firms.

The sample consists of 496 RLBOs between January 1980 and December 2002. The table
reports summary statistics for the buyout firms sponsoring the RLBOs and the RLBOs
themselves. The variables include years between the buyout and the RLBO, the total capital
raised by the buyout group prior to the RLBO date, the buyout group’s age at the time of the
offering (the years between buyout group’s first fund and RLBO year), the share of equity
held by buyout group or groups and the management and directors as a whole before and
after the IPO, the share of the board filled by representatives of the buyout group at the time
of the IPO, dummy variables indicating whether the chairman of the firm was from (or was
previously affiliated with) the buyout group and whether the CEO, president and chairman of
the firm was from (or was previously affiliated with) the buyout group.

Table 4. Summary Statistics for RLBOs

The sample consists of 496 RLBOs between January 1980 and December 2002. The table
reports summary statistics for the RLBO firms. The RLBO firm characteristics include
the following: equity market capitalization, book-to-market ratio, assets, the ratio of
operating income to assets, the ratio of net income to assets, the debt-to-assets ratio, the
capital expenditures-to-assets ratio, and the underwriter reputation (on a zero to nine
scale, with 9 being the highest). All variables except for the underwriter rank are
computed using data from the quarter immediately after IPO or the end of the quarter of
the IPO. The last column reports the industry-adjusted sample averages. Test statistics are
based on Wilcoxon tests comparing the means of RLBOs and other IPOs.

Table 5. Event-Time Stock Performance

The sample consists of 496 RLBOs between January 1980 and December 2002. The raw returns are the
buy-and-hold returns starting the day after the IPO and ending 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after the IPO
date. The market-adjusted returns are the buy-and-hold raw returns minus the buy-and-hold value-weighted
NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ index computed over the same 12-, 24-, 36-, 48- and 60-month time periods.
Jensen alphas are the intercepts estimated by running firm-specific time-series regressions of monthly firm
excess returns on the value weighted NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ excess returns for 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60
months after the IPO. FF alphas are similar intercepts estimated using Fama-French factors as independent
variables. If the sample firm delists, the raw return, market-adjusted return, Jensen’s alpha, and FF alpha are
set equal to zero after the delisting date. The two-tailed significance levels reported in parentheses below the
means are based on the one-sample t-test and the two-tailed significance levels reported below the median
are based on the one-sample Wilcoxon test. All four stock return measures are expressed in percentages.
Panel B is restricted to firms that remained listed for sixty months after the RLBO; Panel C is limited to
firms acquired within sixty months of the RLBO.

Table 6. Three-Year Market-Adjusted Performance for Sub-Samples

The sample consists of 496 RLBOs* between January 1980 and December 2002. For each IPO,
the returns are calculated by compounding monthly returns for 35 months after the IPO, less
the buy-and-hold return on the benchmark over the same period. If the IPO is delisted before
35th month we compound the return until the delisting date. The last column reports the P-
value of the difference between two sub-samples. Observations are divided by whether the firm
was public or privately held prior to the LBO, the holding period between the LBO and the
RLBO, and the use of proceeds as debt reduction.

Table 6 reports only 368 RLBOs in Panel A, B, C and reports 353 RLBOs in Panel D,
which are smaller than the CRSP matched RLBOs sample of 428. This results from the
missing information on LBOs/IPOs in our sample.

Table 7. Three-Year Unadjusted and Benchmark Performance using Monthly Returns

The sample consists of 496 RLBOs and 5,706 other IPOs between January 1980 and December
2002. Three-year equal- and value-weighted returns for IPOs are computed using alternative
benchmarks. The value-weighted returns in Panel B are formed using the market value of the
firm at the end of the quarter of its IPO. For each IPO, the returns are calculated by
compounding monthly returns for 35 months after the IPO. If the IPO is delisted before 35th
month we compound the return until the delisting date. Wealth relatives are calculated as
W= (1+Ri,T)/ (1+RBench i,T), where Ri,T is the buy-and-hold return on IPO i for period T and
RBench i,T is the buy-and-hold return on the benchmark portfolio over the same period.

Table 8. Three-Year Unadjusted and Benchmark Performance using Daily Returns

The sample consists of 496 RLBOs and 5,706 other IPOs between January 1980 and
December 2002. Three-year equal- and value-weighted returns on IPOs are compared with
alternative benchmarks. The value-weighted returns in Panel B are formed using the market
value of the firm at the end of the quarter of its IPO. For each IPO, the monthly returns are
calculated by compounding daily returns up to the end of the month of the IPO and from then
on compounding monthly returns for 35 months. If the IPO is delisted before 35th month we
compound the return until the delisting date. Wealth relatives are calculated as (1+Ri,T)/
  (1+RBench i,T), where Ri,T is the buy-and-hold return on IPO i for period T and RBench i,T is the
buy-and-hold return on the benchmark portfolio over the same period.

The Size and Book-Market Portfolio require RLBO sample to have data/information on
Size and Book-to-Market ratio. We drop those RLBOs that have missing Book-to-Market
ratio. The difference between monthly and daily results mainly comes from micro-

Table 9. Five-Year Unadjusted and Benchmark Performance using Monthly Returns

The sample consists of 496 RLBOs and 5,706 other IPOs between January 1980 and December
2002. Five-year equal- and value-weighted returns on IPOs are computed using alternative
benchmarks. The value-weighted returns in Panel B are formed using the market value of the
firm at the end of the quarter of its IPO. For each IPO, the returns are calculated by
compounding monthly returns for 59 months after the IPO. If the IPO is delisted before 59th
month we compound the return until the delisting date. Wealth relatives are calculated as
W= (1+Ri,T)/ (1+RBench i,T), where Ri,T is the buy-and-hold return on IPO i for period T and
RBench i,T is the buy-and-hold return on the benchmark portfolio over the same period.

Table 11. Calendar-Time Market-Adjusted Performance

The sample consists of 496 RLBOs and 5,706 other IPOs between January 1980 and
December 2002. We form the calendar-time portfolio according to the IPO date and then
calculate average monthly excess return for each Calendar year, adjusting by equal- and
value-weighted market returns (NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ). Returns are computed for
each year for firms whose IPO occurred within the last 35 months. The returns are
average monthly returns.

The sample consists of 496 RLBOs and 5,706 other IPOs between January 1980 and December
2002. Portfolios of RLBOs and other IPOs are formed by including all issues that were done within
three years. RMRF is the value weighted market return on all NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ firms (RM)
minus the risk free rate (RF) that is the one-month Treasury bill rate. SMB (small minus big) is the
difference each month between the return on small- and large-capitalization firms. HML (high minus
low) is the difference each month between the return on a portfolio of high book-to-market stocks
and the return on a portfolio of low book-to-market stocks. Equal- and value-weighted IPO
portfolios are formed at the IPO date or first available date for market values for IPOs. The robust t-
statistics are reported in the parentheses.

            Table 13. Multivariate Regression Analyses of RLBOs

            The sample consists of 496 RLBOs between January 1980 and December 2002. The dependent
            variable is the natural logarithm of the three-year wealth relative (Wi,T =(1+Ri,T)/ (1+RBench i,T),
            where the benchmark is the value-weighted buy-and-hold return of the market). The independent
            variables include the natural logarithm of the buyout firm’s capital under management and age at
            the RLBO date, a dummy variable denoting whether the chairman of the firm is from the buyout
            group, the percentage of board controlled by the buyout group, the buyout firm’s equity
            ownership after the firm’s IPO, the logarithm of the market capitalization after the IPO, the debt-
            to total asset ratio after the IPO, and underwriter reputation. All variables except for the

Figure 1. Distribution of Geometric Average Unadjusted Returns within Three Years
after RLBO

The sample consists of 496 RLBOs between January 1980 and December 2002. The
figure shows the geometric average returns of RLBOs in the first through thirty-sixth
month following the RLBOs. If the IPO is delisted before 36th month we calculate the
geometric average return until the delisting date. The bar shows the geometric returns
distribution of RLBOs and the line shows the normal distribution.

Figure 2. Average Monthly Market-Adjusted Return by Year t after the RLBO

The sample consists of 496 RLBOs between January 1980 and December 2002. The
figure shows the average excess return of RLBOs in the first through fifth years
following the RLBOs. The portfolios are rebalanced monthly. The benchmark portfolio is
S&P 500 Index in Panels A and B; and the matched size and book-to-market portfolio in
Panels C and D. The value-weighted returns in Panels B and D are formed using the
market value of the firm at the end of the quarter of its IPO.
