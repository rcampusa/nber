       This paper examines the optimal labor         contract in   a   small open   economy

with   incomplete markets under      international    price uncertainty. The effect

on employment,    wages,   and profits of different realizations of the state of

nature   is   studied and agents' preferences concerning the implementation of
a tariff are    determined.      The implicit contract equilibrium is shown to be

ronstrained Pareto optimal; unanticipated tariff policy cannot be Pareto

improving     over free trade.

                  TARIFFS IN AN ECONOMY WITH INCOMPLETE
                         MARKETS AND UNEMPLOYMENT


1.   Introduction
      The     threat of unemployment is   one   of the most popular arguments in
favor of protectionism. Although international trade economists have

dedicated much attention to examining the consequences of

protectionist measures in various situations, they have done so far

less for economies in which unemployment exists. This relative absence

of analysis reflects, in large part, the difficulty inherent in the

introduction of unemployment into economic models in a manner both

tractable and consistent with microeconomic foundations. The

literature       that does analyze the interrelations between international

trade and unemployment, does so in economies in which the latter

results from the existence of rigid or slowly adjusting wages (e.g.

Johnson (1965), Lapan (1976), and Neary (1982)) or from the presence

of minimum wages       (Brecher (1974))l.

      This paper seeks to analyze the implications of a tariff in an

economic environment in which the existence of incomplete markets

under uncertainty      leads agents to recur to the factor market, via

implicit contracts, as a way of providing partial insurance against

income instability. As demonstrated by the implicit contracts

literature, unemployment       is then a possibility in some states of

nature.

    As a theory of unemployment implicit contract theory, of course,

has its shortcomings. As Akerlof and Miyazaki             (1980) ahow,

unemployment       results only when the marginal revenue product of labor,

evaluated at full employment, is less than the reservation utility of

a worker. More sophisticated models, however, that allow for asymmetry

in information, risk aversion on the part of the firm, and require

contracts to be incentive compatible are able to generate unemployment

under conditions in which the above inequality is reversed (e.g.

Grossman and Hart (1983), Azariadis (1983)). Overall, the main

contribution of implicit contract theory —          the   perception of

employment and wage—setting as a long term relation that involves risk

sharing     —   seems a valuable   one whose consequences     deserve    to be

explored.

     Although trade under uncertainty has itself been the subject of

several recent studies, these have primarily focused on the relevanre

of the basic theorems of international trade either in the absence of

any risk sharing mechanisms or under the assumption that solely

international risk sharing through international trade in equities is

                                                                 of on
possible. Thus Newbery and Stiglitz (1984) demonstrate, by means

example, the possibility of Pareto inferior trade in an economy in

which risk sharing is inexistent and Helpman and Razin (1978)

establish the standard results of the Heckscher—Ohlin—Saiuuelson model

in a stock market model in which international trade in equities is

permitted.

     With the notable exceptions of Ethier (1982, 1985) and Matusz

(1985, 1986), however, the possibility of agents providing insurance

by entering into implicit contracts has been ignored by trade
                                                                      3

theorists.     Ethier uses the basic result of the simplest contract modei

—   state   invariant wages   — as   a framework in which to explain dumping

and the employment of migrant labor. Matusz examines the validity of

the fundamental theorems of the Heckscher—Ohlin—Samuelson         model with

implicit contracts and the welfare and employment effects of trade in

a Ricardian model with implicit contracts.

     Matuszs    analysis assumes (as does all the implicit contract

literature    to my knowledge) that there is no aggregate uncertainty      in

the economy. Uncertainty results from iid technological shocks to

individual firms that enter the production function in        a

multiplicative      fashion. Consequently all aggregate variables are non—

stochastic.    International trade is not in itself a cause of

unemployment but may, by changing relative prices, influence its size.

In contrast, the analysis undertaken here assumes that uncertainty         is

a product of fluctuations in the terms of trade and hence is aggregate

and a consequence of the openness of the economy. Furthermore, in

contrast with the standard partial equilibrium treatment of implicit

labor contracts,      the level of agents' expected utility and expected

profits is endogenously determined.2

     Several questions are suggested by this approach. It is of

interest to examine how the implicit contract determines factor prices

and employment      as a function of the terms of trade. This leads to an

understanding of how income is divided among agents in "good" versus

"bad" times.    A   next step is to ask how a tariff, imposed after the

equilibrium model of implicit contracts to analyze optimal labor
contracts in the presence of trade unions.

international terns of trade are known, affects the distribution of

income and the level of employment within the economy. An important

question   is   whether tariffs may constitute a Pareto improvement over

free trade. That is, to the extent that import relief legislation

manifests a social desire to provide insurance, is a tariff an

efficient instrument for doing

    Independently of any threat of unemployment, an important argument

for protection is that commercial policy is able to play a role in

providing in trance when domestic markets are incomplete. (This

argument is especially important in the context of developing

economies where market incompleteness is thought to be more

prevalent.)     Eaton and Grossman (1985) show, for example, that in a

sector—specific economy with no risk sharing mechanisms         a marginal

tariff at free trade may increase social welfare. The question then

arises, however, whether a tariff may constitute a Pareto improvement

over free trade in an environment in which some form of domestic

insurance —     in   this case implicit contracts —   exists.
2. The Model

    Consider a small open economy that produces two goods (X1 and X2)

with one factor of production, labor (L). Technology in each sector,         F


and 0, is assumed to be quasi—concave, twice differentiable,         with

F(O)—C(O)—O and F'(O)—G'(O)—.. To simplify notation assume that there

is only one firm in each sector. The economy is populated by two typee


    3For example, article XIX of the GATT and section 201 of the U.S.
Trade Act of 1974 allow tariff concessions (reductions) to be
withdrawn if a product is imported in such quantities so as to cause
serious injury to domestic producers.
                                                                 S


of agents characterized by their objectives, endowments, and attitudes

towards risk: entrepreneurs own firms and maximize expected profits

and 1 risk—averse workers own their labor and maximize expected

                                                                 firm
utility.4 Reflecting the assumption that firms make some sort of

specific investment    in their workers, labor is assumed to be ex ante

mobile and ex post immobile, i.e. once employed in a firm labor is,

for at least the short to medium—run time interval considered here,

firm specific. Workers possess identical utility functions and

identical i'divisible endowments of labor.

    As a result of, for example, an uncertain degree of import

                                                          in the terms of
competition for good X1, the economy faces uncertainty

trade. So that, letting X2 be the numeraire of the economy and P be

the relative price of X1 in terms of X2, P is a random variable      that

fluctuates between    PP.    As has been shown by the implicit contracts

literature, given the above risk preference assumptions it is mutually

advantageous under uncertainty for entrepreneurs and workers to

formulate   a   'contract" specifying the employment level of and the

income to be paid to workers in each state of nature (where each

realization of P, p, is associated with a different state of nature).D

This enables workers to trade—off some of the income instability which

they are subject to as a consequence of a fluctuating marginal revenue

product in a full employment, perfectly competitive environment and


    '. Entrepreneurs are assumed to be endowed with a sufficient
                                                       state of
quantity of good X2 so as to prevent bankruptcy in any
nature.


       The clasic references are Azariadis (1975), Baily (1974), and
Gordon (1974). The implicit contracts literature has been reviewed
recently by Rosen (1985) and Hart and Holmstrom (1986).
                                                                     6


permits the risk—neutral entrepreneur to lower the expected wage bill.

Hence, assuniing that entrepreneurs and workers know the probabillty

distribution h(p) of P, both parties will enter into an implicit

contract.

    Prior to the realization of the state of nature the firm decides

the quantity of workers, N, with which it wishes to contract given the

market level of expected utility, U, that each contracted worker must

receive. Those workers are then offered a contract of the form

                 where i—l,2 denotes the sector to which the firm belongs,
c..(ej.wi)
    is the probability of a contracted worker being employed in state

p, and          is the wage offered in that state.   Workers either work,
         w1
contributing      their total endowment of labor, and enjoy indirect

utility V(w,p), or are unemployed with utility       .   The latter can be

interpreted as the utility derived from the leisure available when

unemployed or from a state—invariant non—tradable consumption basket

of goods obtained by home production during unemployment. I assume, as

in Azariadis      (1975), that firms cannot offer workers unemployment

insurance.6 Furthermore, contracts are assumed to be incentive

compatible so that entrepreneurs are restricted to wages such that

         It is assumed throughout the analysis that this constraint      is
not binding.

    Consider the maximization problem faced by the firm in the sector

that produces the imported good, X1.8 The firm's objective is to

maximize expected profit subject to an expected utility constraint and

an employment constraint. Thus, the firm solves:

        H(P)=.J'h(p)dP, N1


sector one, and    LNe   is the number of workers actually employed in

state p.9

    The first constraint ensures that workers receive expected utility

equal to the competitive level. The utility of a worker conditional        on

state p is the sum of the utility obtained when employed, weighted by

the probability of employment, and the utility derived when

unemployed, weighted by the probability of unemployment. The second

continuum of constraints guarantee that the firm does not hire more

workers, in any state of nature, than the total labor pool with which

it contrac'ed.

    The first order conditions (foc) with respect to w, e, and
                                                               N1

constraint and         the Lagrange multiplier associated with the second

    The first foc determines optimal risk sharing between workers and

entrepreneurs and requires the marginal utility of the wage to be

constant over all states of nature. The second requires the cost of a

marginal reduction in the probability of employment,         pFLN-t-A(V—U),

to exceed or equal the benefit, wN. The first term,       PFLN, measures the

value of the loss in output resulting from a marginal decrease in e.

The term A(V—U) is the amoumt by which the wage bill would have to be

increased in order to restore workers to the same level of utility as

                                                                     —

Nedw/delu where       TJ(p)—Ve+U(1—e). Note that dw/delu is multiplied by

Ne reflecting the fact that all employed workers must receive the

increased wage. An implication of (2—u) is that when the solution is

interior (i.e. when there is unemployment), the wage is greater than

the value of the marginal product of labor.      A   reversal of this

inequality is feasible only in the corner solution (i.e.          at full

employment).
                                                                           9

       The third foc determines the optimal quantity of workers that the

firm should contract. It requires the expected benefit from a marginal

increase in the quantity of contracted workers

both terms since      a contracted worker is not necessarily         an employed

worker and hence the probability of employment is the relevant

variable in calculating expected cost and benefit.

       The maximization problem of the firm in the export sector is

identical to (1) with p replaced by 1 and F by C. The first order

conditions     follow as in (2) with the corresponding modifications.

       Equilibrium   is attained in the economy at       when all workers

receive a contract from one of the two sectors of the economy so that

               and         il2,   or the utility from a contract is

utility of contracting with either sector is equal in equilibrium.)

Existence and uniqueness of equilibrium follows from           (i)   a perfecdy
inelastic supply curve of labor for tii and (ii)         a   downward sloping

demand curve for labor. Appendix      I   proves that the number of workers

that a firm wishes to contract with is a negative function of U.

      Equilibrium    in the labor market is depicted in Figure 1. It is

assumed throughout the analysis that the equilibrium attained is such

that          and hence that all workers receive a contract.

tariff may constitute a Pareto improvement over free trade.

others, the import sector will be at full employment at the higher

realizations of P and the export sector at the lower realizations. In

neither sector is the transition from full employment to unemployment

discontinuous; as p changes gradually, the level of employment does

not jump downwards when unemployment obtains. Since all functions in

(2—fl) are continuous      in p, a downward jump of employment (implying an

upward jump in FL) would require an upward jump in    and hence
                                                   Yp           7>O
which is incompatible with the Kuhn—Tucker condition for unemployment.

       The effect of a marginal increase in p on employment in the import

sector when unemployment exists is derived by differentiating          (2—li)

with respect to p and using Roy's identity, yielding:


                           dL1/dp— —(FL—Cl)/pFLL                      (8)

the sign of which depends on the magnitude of consumption of good
                                                                  X1

by an employed worker in sector one relative to the marginal product

of labor in that sector. Throughout the analysis it shall be assumed

that


                                 FL>Cl                               (9)

so that employment is an increasing function of the terms of trade.

    The ambiguity in (8) can be understood in the following fashion.

(2—u) states that when unemployment exists, the cost to the firm of a

marginal decrease in the probability of employment           should equal the

marginal benefit.    A   marginal increase in   p   increases this cost by FL
                                                                      12

thus creating an incentive to increase e and hence employment             in that

state of nature. It also, however, increases the narginal benefit of

lowering e by C1 since the increased price of good X1 implies that

employment in that state of nature is less attractive and hence that

the firm's wage compensation to workers for a lower employment

probability is smaller, i.e. dw/dpluC. If the increase in marginal

benefit   is greater than the increase in marginal cost,       the firm should

decrease the quantity of labor hired, thus obtaining the "counter—

intuitive' result that employment is, for some range of the terms of

trade, a decreasing function of p.

    In the export sector, differentiation of (2—u) yields:


                               dL2/dpC2/GLL                          (10)

so that employment is    a   decreasing function of p.

    The behavior of employment in both sectors as a function of the

terms of trade is shown in Figure 2.

    The effect of a marginal price increase on profits in sector one

depends on the status of employment in that sector. Differentiating

the profit function with respect to p and using (7) obtains:


              dlrl/dp=(pFL_wl)dLl/dp + F—C1L1    + I1C1L1/R1*       (11)


Noting that    (9) implies that F>C1L1, it follows that     when in the range

of prices in which sector one has full employment a marginal increase

in p causes sector one profits to increase. When the economy has

unemployment,    dL1/dp>O, so
                              that    a   marginal increase in p has an

ambiguous effect on profits.

    In the export sector (sector 2), differentiation of the profit

function with respect to p yields:

                                  —
          d7r2/dp(CL—w2)dL2/dp        C2L2 + ,112C2L2/R2*          (12)
                                                                               13

  indicating that under full employment profits move in the
                                                            opposite
  direction to the wage and that with
                                      unemployment profits may increase
  or decrease with the terms of trade.

      The effect of slightly higher realizations of P on the
                                                             conditional

 utility of workers in sector one,
                                   U1(p),

            U1(p)=V(w1,p)e   +   (l—e)                                 (13)
 likewise depends on whether the sector is at full
                                                   employment.

 Differentiating    (13) and using (7) yields

           dU1/dp= _(VwlClel)/Rl* +      [(V—)/N1].dL1/dp              (14)
 so that under full employment workers' conditional
                                                    utility is a

 decreasing   function of p. Equation (14) makes it clear that,
                                                                although
 it is not possible to sign (7), the effect on
                                               V(w,p) of           a   higher
 [lower] realization of P and the associated wage change warranted
                                                                   by
 the contract is negative [positive]      .   This   is a consequence of the

 optimal risk sharing condition which requires the marginal
                                                            utility of
 income to be constant over states of nature.

     With unemployment the sign of (14) is
                                           ambiguous since it depends
 on whether the net negative effect of a
                                         price increase—wage change on

utility outweighs the positive effect on utility of an increase in

 the probability of employment.
                                Although (11) and (14) cannot be

unambiguously    signed when unemployment exists, multiplication of (11)

by   V/N   and recalling from (2—u) that
                                         PFL_w__(V_U)/Vw yields:

                    (Vu/Ni)• dir1/dp—dU1/dp     + (F_ClLl)Vw/Nl         (15)

indicating that, given a price increase, profits necessarily             increase
if workers' utility falls and that workers'
                                            utility increases if
profits fall. Therefore, it is impossible for a price increase to

simultaneously make both parties to the contract worse off.

Alternatively,   a price decrease cannot make both oarties better off
                                                                         14


      Setting expression (14) equal to zero it is possible to solve for

the income transfer (dv1) that sector one workers would require in

order to be just as well off as prior to the price change.

                                    —
                                        [(V_)/Vw]dLi/dP)dp             (16)

where (14) has previously been multiplied by N1 to include the effect

of the price change on the conditional utility of all workers in

sector one. Note, however, that dv1 is multiplied by L1 respecting the

restriction that only employed workers may receive income transfers.

      Setting (11) equal to zero yields the transfer (dz1) required by

entrepreneurs in sector one to keep profits constant

                                    + F—C1L1 +                          (17)
            dzl=_j(pFL_w)dLl/dp                       1C1L1/R1*)dp
Hence,

                                                    <0                  (18)
                        L1dv1/dp-fdz1/dp1—--(F—C1L1)

Thus, if compensation is allowed, agents in sector one would prefer a

higher to a lower price for good X1.

      The conditional utility of workers in sector two, however,

unambiguously decreases with a price increase regardless of the status

of employment

                                     + [(V—U)/N2].dL2/dp               (19)
          dU2/dp= _(Vw,2C2e2)/R2*

since, unlike the case for sector one workers, the probability of

eniploymerit is a decreasing function of p.

      Performing the same compensation exercise as for sector one agents

yields:

                                        +                               (20)
                L2dv2.{c,2C2L2)/R2*             [(V—T)/V].dL2/dp)dp
and
                                            —
                dz2—((GL_w2)dL2/dp              C2L2 + tI,2C2L2/R2*)     (21)


Hence,
                                                                  15


                  L2dv2/dp+dz2/dp=C2L2>O                         (22)

so   that, if compensation is allowed, agents in sector two would prefer

a lower to a higher price for X1.

      The results derived in this section differ from those of Jones

(1971) sector—specific model or the Heckscher—Ohlin—Samuelson     model.

Under full employment in both sectors the economy behaves more along

the lines predicted by the Stolper—Samuelson theorem.   A   price increase

pits all workers against sector one entrepreneurs; the position of

sector two entrepreneurs   is ambiguous. When there is unemployment in

least one sector of the economy, however, various combinations of

agents gaining and losing are possible including outcomes with the

flavor of the sector—specific model in which all agents in sector one

favor the price increase and those in sector two are opposed.



4. Welfare Analysis of a Tariff

     This section analyzes the question of whether a tariff can

constitute a Pareto improvement over free trade. The tariff examined

is imposed by the government after the state of nature is known but

before firms have made their decision as to the particular identity of

the workers to be hired or laid off. This reflects the assumption that

the government is unable to make state contingent transfers, otherwise

the economy could simply proceed to the first best by allowing the

government to play any viable insurance role.

      The tariff is unanticipated. This case is of interest because the

government cannot make state contingent plans and, moreover, ex ante

policies would tend to be time inconsistent. Thus the scenario is one

in which the government knows the unemployment that will result (if
                                                                       16

any) under the particular state of nature that has been realized, and

may choose to impose a tariff.

    The imposition of a tariff implies that firms and workers alter

the original wage—employment decision to that determined by the

contract for the state of nature corresponding to the tariff inclusive

price. That is, it is as if the contract had been written with the

states of nature given by the domestic price level p_p*(l+t), where p'

denotes the free trade relative price of good X1, so that a tariff, as

far as the contract is concerned, merely moves the economy to a stats

of nature corresponding to higher realizations of p*

    The possibility of a tariff improving welfare appears more likeiy

when the economy has unemployment in sector one and full employment in

sector two since in this situation      a   small tariff unambiguously

increases employment and the value of output at free trade prices.

    To analyze whether in this situation a tariff is capable of

permitting a Pareto improvement over free trade, we examine the set sf

constrained Pareto optima described by the solutions to

Max £=V(w1+s1/L1, p*(l+tflL1 + (N1—L1) +                        (23)

           p1(V(w2+s2/N2, p*(l+t))}N2 + p2(G—w2N2+s3) +

              [*(l+t) F—w1L1—s1—s2—s3+TJ
for values of p1O,        i—l,2,3. Different choices for the values of

correspond to different points on the utility—possibility frontiet.

            5s.


sector i, i=l,2 or to entrepreneurs in sector two, i—3, and T is the

tariff revenue.

    Note that the formulation of (23) assumes that the government is

able to engage in lump—sum transfers of income among employed workers
                                                                                  17

and entrepreneurs but not to unemployed workers. This respects the

initial restriction faced by entrepreneurs prohibiting them from

providing unemployed workers with insurance. Insofar as the government

is forced to respect the same restrictions as entrepreneurs, this

avoids one of critiques of this literature in that the government's

conduct of trade policy is not ad hoc assumed to be free of the

constraints           faced by the private market.1°

    It can easily be shown that the free trade equilibrium                      (t—s10)
fulfills the necessary conditions for                a   constrained Pareto optimum.

(Proof that   t=s=0    is a local maximum is presented in Appendix II.)

    The preceding analysis permits us to conclude that free trade is a

constrained   Pareto optimum and hence that a small tariff at free trade

cannot be Pareto improving. The intuition behind this result is as

follows: In many models of incomplete markets (e.g.       Stiglitz

(l982a,.4) the constrained suboptimality of the competitive

equilibrium follows from the fact that competitive agents do not take

into account the effect of their actions on the distribution of prices

in the economy. In these environments prices play a dual role: they

simultaneously allocate goods and distribute risk among agents. Since

the public good nature of prices is not taken into consideration by

agents, the competitive market generally will not induce the optimal

distribution of risk and a set of taxes may be Pareto improving.

    This role for taxes is not available in the present context.

Contracts have already been written in such a way as to provide the

risk—averse agents with the optimal amount of insurance, i.e. the
                                                                           19

marginal utility of the wage is constant over states of nature, and

the underlying distribution of prices is exogenous and hence cannot h

changed by government policy. Thus the effect of the tariff is simply

to move agents along the preestablished contract and to make availabl

the associated tariff revenue.

    Yet another insightinto why a tariff is not Pareto improving may

be derived from          the theory of the second—best. The implicit contract,

as its construction indicates, is optimal given the restrictions

imposed, i.e.   ,    g    ien   the inability of entrepreneurs to insure

unemployed workers. The production inefficiency inherent in the

contract is an outcome of this restriction. The imposition of a

tariff, however, does not create an additional market by which to

bypass this restriction and it introduces an additional consumption

inefficiency. Consequently, it is not to be expected that a tariff ma

be Pareto improving in this economy.



5. Concluding       Remarks

    This paper examines the effect of a tariff in an economy with

implicit contracts. The optimal contract is characterized and wages

and employment are shown to differ in important ways from that

predicted by standard models. Furthermore, it is shown that a tariff

cannot constitute a Pareto improvement over free trade.

    Several directions for further research are suggested by this

approach. Most important is the role of an anticipated tariff or stat

contingent trade policy on the part of the government, assuming that

pre—commitment       is feasible. This would, of course, affect the form of

the contract itself. Another area to explore involves more
                                                              20

sophisticated contract models in which the reasons for the second best

nature of the contract is more firmly grounded in microeconomic

theory, e.g. moral hazard stemming from asymmetric information.
