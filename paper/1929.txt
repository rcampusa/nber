                                   Introduction



      The United States has the largest economy in th. world and develop-

ments in the U.S. economy have a wide ranging impact on economic ac-

tivity in all other countries. Indeed, Otmar Emmlng.r, a past president

of the German central bank, has characterized other countries economic

relationship with the U.S. as being in the sam, boat with an elephant. N
1
    Because the .l.phants shifts In position grossly (pun intended)

affects those who are sitting in the same boat, an understanding of

recent macroeconomic policy and performance in the United States is

valuable to anyone concerned with international economic relations.

      This paper provides an overview of U.S. macroeconomic policy and

performance In the 1980s by first outlining the behavior of key economic

variables and then discussing the policies that have affected these

variables. After gaining some insight into the interaction between these

policies and macroeconomic performance, we can then go on to examine

where macro policy and the U.S. economy may be heading in the next

several years.

       Figures 1 and 2 provide an outline of developments in real economic

activity fros 1980 to 19B. In this period, the economy experienced two

recessions leading to real BNP growth averaging 23% at an annual            rate,
substantially    less than th. postwar average of              The 1980s began

with   the unemployment rite   at 6.3%,   not far from the natural   rate   (full


employment)     level which    most economists   feel resides between five and
sIx    percent. The recession which started in January 1980 and ended in

July 1980 was short but was also sharp. Real GNP declined at a 9'!. annual

rate      for only one quarter, 1980—Il, when credit controls which

restricted business   and consumer loans were iposd on       the   economy. The
result     was that the unemployment rate climbed to 7.8%. The •XCflhiOfl

following the trough in   July   1980 after the credit controls were aban-

doned was the shortest in the postwar period, lasting only twelve

months. A second recession began in July 1981 with output falling for

four straight quarters, and the unemployment rate was driven to double—

digit levels, peaking at 10.7%. The subsequent recovery starting in

November 1982 has been in line with other postwar recoverlesi real 8NP

growth has averaged 4.0% and unemployment declined to near the 7% level

by early 1986.



Prices



        The lackluster real GNP performance in the 1980s stemming from the

two recessions is, however, associated with the most striking dv€iop—

sent In this period, a substantial improvement on the inflation front.

At the start of the 1980s, the inflation rate (the percentage change in

                                    3



the consumer price index over the previous twelve months) exceeded

The high inflation rate was the result of a high core inflation rate due

to high money growth in the 1970s and an upward impulse to the price

level fro. the chirp increase of oil prices in the late 1970s associated

with the fall of the Shah of Iran.4 With the 1960 recession, the infla-

tion rate began to fall, and during the 1981—82 recessIon the decline in

inflation accelerated, leaving the inflation rite below the five percent

level for the first time in ten years. In February and March of 1986,

the CR1 has actually declined for two months running, a feat last

repeated over twenty years ago.



Financial Markets



     Figure 4 depIcts developments in the bond market. The 1960—82

period experienced not only high interest rates on short and long-term

bonds, but also great volatility in these interest rates. In March 1980,

interest rates on three—month U.S. Treasury bills peaked at over 15%,

while those on 20—year U.S. Treasury bonds exceeded 12%. An   extremely
rapid fall   in these rates then occurred, with three—month bill rates



   The CPI series for the period before January 1983 used here is not
   the CPI—U index reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
   Before 1983, the BLSc CR1—U index has serious distortions because
   of its treatment of housing prices. Specifically, it overstates the
   inflation rate when mortgage rates are rising as In 1980 (see
   Blinder (1980)). ThIs problem led the BLS to convert the CR1 index
   to a rental equivalence basis in its treatment of housing starting
   In January 1983. The CR1 series used for the calculations of infla-
   tion in Figure 3 puts the index on a rental equivalence basis before
   1983 in order to provide a more accurate account of inflation in the
   early 1980c. This series was obtained from the Congressional Budget
   Office and Is described in Huizinga and Mishkin (1984).

   For a further discussion of the course of the inflationary process
   in the United States from 1960 to 1980, see Mlshkin (1986), Chapter
   25.

falling by half to 7% by June     of    1980 while long—term rates fell below

10%. Th. rapid fall froc March to June was then followed by an equally

rapid climb in rates, leading to levels of both short arid long—tire

Interest rates above 15% in 1981. The period from 1980 to 1981 suffered

not only fros the highest interest rates on Treasury securities in ill

of 11.8. history, but also from the most volatile rates as well. With the

decline in inflation in 1982, interest rates finally began their fall

from their unprecedentedly high          level.    Currently, the Treasury bill

rate   is around the 6% level, while long—tare government bonds are yiiid
ing less than 8%.

       Although nominal interest rates have fallen to levels found in the

1970;, real interest rates ——         that   Is interest rates adjusted for ex-

pected changes In   the price level          have not. Figure 5 plots estImates

of the real interest rate on three—month Treasury bills from 1970 to the

beginning of 1986. Despite the high level of nocinal interest rates in

the late 1970s, real Interest rates were very low and were even negative

for most of the 1970s. In the 1980s, we have quite a different story.

Real interest rates clirnbed to levels that are unprecedented In the

postwar period, reaching a peak of over 8% In 1981, By the aid           1980s,
although nominal interest rates have fallen below levels found in the

late 1970;, real interest rates have remained higher than at any time in



       These estimates were obtained using procedures outlined in Mishkin
       (1981) which eaki use of the rational expectations assumption.
       SpecifIcally, the real rates in Figure 5 are fitted value; from

       at the beginning of the period. (See Huiinga and Mishkin (1986) for
       an explanation of the choice of explanatory variables.) because of
       evidence in Huizinga and Mishkln (1986) that the stochastic process
       of real rates shifted in October 1979 and October 1982, three
       separate regressions are run for the period January 1953October
       1979, November 1979—October 1982, and November 1982—January 1986.

the postwar period prior to 1979, continuing to exceed 4. These high

real     Interest rates have been of great concern to policymakers

throughout the world, and explaining their unusual behavior is a puzzle

that we will return to later.

       Th. performance of equity markets In the 1980s has become a bright

spot in the economy. As is seen in Figure 6, by the beginning of 1980,

th. real value of common stocks (a. measured by the Standard and Poors

500 index, deflated by the CPI) was substantially below the peak value

reached in the beginning of 1973. DespIte a relatively flat performance

in nominal terms from 1980 to 1982, the increasing pric, level led to

stock prices hitting a trough In real terms by aid 1982p their real

value was less than half that at the peak in 1973. Subsequently one of

the great postwar bull markets began. In real term., stock prices nearly

doubled, leaving their current real value only slightly les. than that

reached at their peak. 3ust in the first three month. of this year,

1986, stock prices have increased by over 10%. This strength in the

value of American equities has been matched by equally strong perfor-

mance in the equity markets throughout the world.



The Foreign Exchange Market and the Current Account



       The developments in the foreign exchange market are Illustrated by

Figure 7 which shows the effective exchange rate index for the U.S.

dollar   ——   that   I., the value of the dollar In terms of a trade—weighted

basket of foreign currencies. By the beginning of 1980, the dollar had

declined 25% from its value during the fixed exchange rate period before

1971. The subsequent rise in the dollar was both prolonged and substan—

tiali the U.S. dollar reached record highs by early 1985, appreciating
                                   6



by over BOX relative to foreign currencies. The strong dollar in this

period his been th. subject of much concern both by American and foreign

policyinakers. One reason has been its effect on the balance of trade in

goods and services between the U.S. and the rest of the world. The

effect of the exchange rate on trade has long lags. Thus, the
strengthening dollar which led to a weakening of U.S. competitiveness

did not lead to substantial current account deficits (Figure 8) until

1983, when the current account deficit reached *40 billion. Since 1983,

the current account deficit has been on the order of *100 billion and

the U.S. has been driven from being a net creditor vii a vie the rest of

the world to being a net debtor. Since early 1985, the U.S. dollar has

declined sharply in value, giving up over half the gains achieved over

the previous five years.     The lower value of the dollar has Increased

American competitiveness and should lead to a decline in the current

account deficit1 But because this takes time, we se. no improvement in

the current account balance through the end of 1985.



     Now that we have examined some of the main economic developments in

the United States during the l9BOs, we now need to turn to the conduct

of macroeconomic policy in order to understand why these developments

have occurred.

                          Macroeconomic Policy



     Probably the most Important feature of economic performance in the

1980s has been a significant decline in the rate of price level in—
                                      7



creases. To first understand this phenomenon we must first look at how

monetary policy was used to quell the inflationary fires in the early

1980s.




Monetary Policy in the early 1980s and the Fight Against Inflation



       Our discussion of monetary policy in the early l9BOs must first

begin with the appointment of Paul Voicker is the Chairman of the Board

of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in August 1979. Before

Volckers ascension to hii post as Chairman, monetary policy had proved

to be highly expansionary and inflationary. Thus when Volcker embarked

on his new job, he was faced with a Federal Reserve that had little

credibility as an agent of price stability and yet the inflation rate

was climbing into double—digit territory and the U.S. dollar was weaken-

ing.     To turn this situation around, Volcker embarked on a bold strategy

to rid the American economy of inflation and strengthen the dollar by

first announcing on October 6, 1979 a dramatic change in the operating

procedures of the Fed.

       Before the change in operating procedures, the Fed paid lip service

to targeting monetary aggregates, but in actuality pursued   a strategy   of

smoothing interest rate fluctuations by giving precedenc. to targets on

the federal funds rate (the overnight, interbank loan rate> which were

only allowed to move within a fairly tight band. The announced change in

the Feds operating procedures suggested that the Fed would now more

aggressively pursue the targeting of monetary aggregates by abandonment

of federal funds rate target.. (Specifically, the target range for the

federal funds rate was widened by more than a factor of five, while the
                                    B



primary operating target became nonborrowed reserves.) Although a stated

goal of the new operating procedures was sore accurate control of money

supply   growth, a monetarist experiment of a gradual reduction in money

supply growth was not carried out because the Fed was not very success-

ful in stabilizing monetary growth. Figure 9 which shows the growth rate

of the Ml monetary aggregate (the percentage increase from one year

earlier) indicates that after October 1979, the fluctuations in money

supply growth increased rather than decreased as might have been ex-

pected from the Feds statements1 What went wrong?

     There arm several possible answers to this question. The first is

that the economy was exposed to several shock; after October 1979 that

made monetary control more difficult. Among these shocks was the ac-

celeration of financial deregulation which added new categories of

deposits such as NOW accounts to the measures of monetary aggregates. In

addition, in March 1980 President Jimmy Carter, as part of hi; new anti—

inflation program, authorized the Fed under the Credit Contr1 Act to

impose credit controls which restricted the growth of consumer and

business loan;. Money supply growth fell sharply immediately after these

controls were imposed and then rose sharply again after the controls

were abandoned in July 1980.

     A second possibl, explanation is that effective monetary control

was not possible using nonborrowed reserves targets under the then

existing system of lagged reserve requirements in which required

reserves for a given week were calculated on the basis of the level of

deposit; two weeks earlier.6




    Mishkin (1986), Chapter 19 has a more extensive discussion of Fed
    operating procedures during this period and how these procedures
    might have led to unstable money growth.
                                   9



     My preferred explanation for the failure of the Fed to accurately

control money growth after October 1979, was that this was never really

the intent of Voickers policy shift, A view that has been confirmed by

discussions with some former Fed officials is that despite Voicker's

statements about the need to target monetary aggregates, he was not

committed to these targets. Rather he was   far   more concerned with using

interest rate movements to wring inflation out of the economy. Voicker's

primary reason for changing the Fed's operating procedure was to free

his hand to manipulate interest rates in order to fight Inflation.

Abandoning Interest rate targets was necessary if he were to be able to

raise interest rates sharply when a slowdown in the economy was required

to dampen inflation. This view of Voicker's strategy suggests that the

Fed's announced attachment to monetary aggregate targets may have been a

smokescreen to keep the Fed from being blamed for the high Interest

rates that would result from the new policy.

     A story consistent with this interpretation of Fed strategy can be

gleaned from the interest rate movements shown in Figure 4. After the

October 6 announcement, short—term interest rates were raised by nearly

five hundred basis points (five percentage points) until in March 1980

they exceeded 15%. With the imposition of credit controls in March 1960

and the rapid decline in real GNP in the second quarter of 1980, the Fed

eased up on its policy and allowed Interest rates to decline sharply.

With the recovery starting in July 1980, Inflation remained persistent,

still exceeding a 10% rate (see Figure 3). Since the inflation fight was

not yet won, the Fed tightened the screws again, sending short—term

interest rates above the 1% level for a second time. Finally, with the

1981—82 recession that led to a large loss of output and high unemploy-

ment, inflation began to come down. With the inflationary psychology
                                   10



apparently broken, Interest rates were now allowed to fall.

    With the scenario outlined above, large fluctuations in coney

supply growth after October 1979 should not be particularly surprising.

Pliny •onetarists have criticized the Fed for the erratic money growth

rates during this period, but there are good arguments supporting the

view that the Fed was correct to pay little attention to monetary ag-

gregate targets in the early 1980s. Market forces, new computer technol-

ogy and financial deregulation a; a result of major bank legislation in

1980 and 1982 were making monetary aggregates less reliable as an In-

dicator of monetary policy. For example the spread of NOW accounts after

the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act

(DIDMCA) of 1980 and the increase of money market mutual fund assets

made Interpretation of the monetary aggregates extremely difficult after

October 1979. Indeed, the Fed embarked on several redefinitions of the

monetary aggregates in the early 1980; in an effort to obtain a more

economically relevant definition of the money supply.

     Another piece of evidence suggesting that monetary targeting was

not appropriate during this period is the behavior of P11 velocity

depicted in Figure 10. BegInning In the 1980;, Ml velocity began to

undergo more substantial fluctuations a; well as large deviation; from

the trend rate of growth established before October 1979. Farticularly

striking is the sharp decline in velocity that starts at the end of 1981

and ends in the first quarter of 1983. This decline It then followed by

another large swing up and down in velocity from 1983 to 198I Looking

at the velocity numbers in the 1980s does not increase ones confidence

in the efficacy of a constant money growth rate rule during this period.

Voicker's pragmatism and reluctance to adhere to monetarist prescrip-

tions cay thus have been called for In the unusual environment of the
                                    11



early l9BOs.




Fiscal Poilcys Were the Reagan Budget Deficits the Source of   High Real

Interest Rates?



       The other major   development in macroeconomic policy in the 1980s
was the tremendous growth in the federal budget deficit resulting from

the fiscal policies of the Reagan administration. Despite the supply—

siders predictions that tax cuts would generate sufficient revenue to

leave the federal budget in balance even if there was no shrinkage in

government spending, the 1981 Reagan tax cut along with continuing

growth in the government sector (mostly stemming from the military

buildup) led to budget deficits in the $200 billion range. As is evident

In   Figure 11, the official budget deficit on a national income accounts

basis jumped from around 2X of GNP in 1980 and 1981 to around SX of GNP

from 1982-85.

       The shift in the behavior of budget deficits Is even more striking

If we are a more careful In defining what an appropriate concept of a

budget deficit should be. An economically relevant measure of a budget

deficit should tell us whether the government is becoming more or less

indebted in real terms, that is, in terms of real goods and services.

Even if the federal government is Increasing the nominal amount of its

debt by running a deficit on an official basis, it real indebtedness

can be falling If increases in the price level sufficiently shrink the

real value of the debt that has been issued previously. An economically

relevant measure of the budget deficit must thus be corrected for the

effect of price level changes on the real value of previously Issued
                                     12



debt (particularly during high inflation periods) and also on changes in

the market value of the debt arising from changes in interest rates.

Figure 11 chow; an adjusted budget deficit measure as a percent of 8NP
which is based on correction; calculated by Robert Eisner.7

        The adjusted budget numbers in Figure 11 indicate that the recent

deficit experience is even sore unusual than the official numbers sug-

gest.     In every year from 1970 to 1985, the official budget numbers

indicate that the federal government was in deficit. However, the pic-

ture is quite different with the adjusted budget numbers from 1970 to

1980, the budget was nearly a; likely to be in surplus as in deficit.

After the Reagan tax cuts, a sharp break in the behavior of the adjusted

deficit occurs; from a       level of only .6% of GNP in 1981, th. deficit

jumps to nearly 6% of GNP in 1982.

        The jump in the budget deficits that we see particularly after 1981

in Figure 11 is often pointed to as the source of the current high real

interest rates found in Figure 5. These high real interest rate; are
                                                                e
often   cited as the cause of the strong dollar from 1981—84,       which, in

turn, stimulated the huge current account deficits from 1983 to 1985.

Should the blame for the high real interest rates and the deterioration

of the (i.E. balance of trade be placed onto the budget deficit?

        Recent research that I have conducted with 3ohn Huizinga sheds some

light on this question.9 Modern monetary theory suggests that regime

changes have an important impact on the stochastic process of many




      The adjusted budget deficit numbers are obtained from Eisner
      (1986b). See Eisner (1986a) for a more extensive discussion of how
      budget deficit numbers should be interpreted.

economic variable,, As we have seen, with the         change   In operating proc.—

durei in October 1979, the Fed changed the method of conducting monetary

policy in order to reverse the inflationary monetary policy of the 70s.

Ii this monetary regime change associated with a shift in the stochastic

process of real interest rates which resulted In the high real interest

rates in the 1980,?

          The answer appears to be yes. When the Fed alters its behavior in

October 1979, there is a statistically significant shift in the stochas-

tic process of real interest rates, In addition, if one asks when the

shift in the stochastic process of real rate actually occurs, statisti-

cal evidence indicates that it corresponds to the October 1979 change in

the monetary policy regime, These results point the finger at Volck.rs

change In monetary policy regime as         a major   factor causing the current

high level of real interest rates.

          The research strategy in my work with Huizinga is one in which e

look      for a clearly definable historical event such as       the   October 1979

change in Fed operating procedures, and then see if there Is a sig-

nificant change in the behavior of a particular economic variable im-

mediately afterwards, Suppose that we know the first event is exogenous,

that is, it occurs as a result of an independent action that could not

possibly be caused by the other economic variable, Then when a sig—

nificant change in the economic variable follows the exogenous event, we

have strong evidence that the first event is           causing the change in
behavior of the economic variable, In a sense then, we are treating the

October 1979 change in the Fed operating procedures as a exogenous event
——   in   other words, a controlled experiment —- and when we see the shift

in the behavior of the real Interest rate, we are ascribing causation

from the monetary regime shift to the change in real rate behavior,
                                     14



     One danger of such a historical—econometric analysis is that it

runs the danger of fitting one historical episode with one tailor—made

theory. Truly convincing evidence that the Feds monetary policy regime

change led to high real interest rates must involve examination of

similar ucontrolled vxperiments in other tim. periods1 We thus focused

on another episode of a monetary regime shift that ha; many similarities

to the October 1979 shift1 At the beginning of 1920, the pursuit of a

real bills doctrine by the Fed led to rapid monetary growth, a sustained

high level of inflation similar to that of the late 1970; and a weak

dollar.    In January and June of 1920, the Fed decided to reverse its

inflationary monetary policy by raising the discount rate sharply ——    by

1   1/4% in January and 1% in June. In the early years of the Fed, chang-

ing the discount rate was the main tool of monetary policy tool, and it

was particularly potent at this time because the total amount of member

bank borrowing from the Fed exceeded the amount of nonborrowid reserve;.

The result of this policy was a rapid disinflation (in fact, a
deflation). This disinflation Is similar to what we have seen in recent

years and thus we might expect to find parallel; between          the two

periods.

      The analysis of the period surrounding 1920 reveals a significant

shift in the ;tochastic process of real interest rates which has many

similarities to the recent experience. For example, the 1920 monetary

regime change and the subsequent disinflation is associated with a

weakening of the correlation of expected inflation with nominal interest

rate movements and a   shift   to a sustained higher level of real Interest

rates. The striking correspondence between the impact of the monetary

regime shifts on real interest rates in 1920 and 1979 provides strong

support for the view that the recent shift in real rate behavior is a

conetary phenomenon. Particularly important in this regard ii that high

budget deficits were not a feature of the 19201,10 thus suggesting that

monetary factors are more important than budget deficits to the recent

behavior of real interest rates.1




Ponetary Policy After October 1982



      On October 5, the Fed announced that it Wi, deemphasizing monetary

aggregate targets, and, as Is clear in Figure 5, the Fed was returning

to its policy of smoothing short—term interest rates. In order to keep

interest rates from rising in 1983, the Fed accommodated a bulge in

money demand by allowing the money supply to grow at rates In excess of

10% (see FIgure 9). The fact that the more rapid growth in the money

supply In 1983 did not lead to a rise in inflationary expectations can

be attributed to Voicker's success with his anti—inflation program and

his hard won credibility as a serious inflation fighter who would not

allow the inflationary fires to reignite.

      By early 1985, the strength of the dollar and the current account

deficits in excess of *100 billion were leading to increasing protec-

tionist pressure in the U.S. Congress. Statements from Federal Reserve

     Although the federal government ran substantial budget deficits In
     the years 1917—1919 as a result of World War I, there were budget
     surpluses in every year from 1920 to 1929.

     Other research analyzing the link between budget deficits and real
     interest rates does not tend to support a strong connection between
     them. See, for example, Blanchard and Summers (1984) and Evans
     (1985>. Note that financial deregulation, investment tax credits and
     oil price shocks were also not present In the 1920s. Thus, the
     correspondence between the 1920s and the 1980s of real Interest rate
     behavior also weakens the case that these were important factors
     affecting recent real Interest rate behavior.

officials indicated that they felt that the dollar was too high and fear

of growing protectionism we; probably a factor in stimulating the Fed to

pursue a sore expansionary aonetary policy to bring the value of the

dollar down. The result has been growth rates of the money supply again

in excess of lOX and a sharp Fall in the dollar.

                         Where Are We Heading?



     It is always difficult to predict the future, but the overview of

past macro policy and performance may provide some clue; as to where we

are heading.

     In recent aonth, there has been som. debate over whether the

sluggish economic growth over the past year requires the pursuit of a

more expansionary monetary policy. This debate has been particularly

acute at the Federal Reserve where it erupted over a decision to cut the

discount rate, with the outcome that, at first, Chairman Volcker, who

opposed the cut, wac overruled by a vote of the Bcard of Governors, an

extremely unusual occurrence.

     Ttere are several factors that will affect the economy'; perfor-

mance and the choice of macro policies. As we have seen, developments in

the foreign exchange market can affect the Federal Reserve's decisions

about monetary policy. The overly strong dollar in early 1985 may have

prompted the Fed to a mars expansionary policy. The dramatic fall in the

dollar since then may work in the opposite direction now. There cur-

rently seem; to be a consensus at the Federal Reserve as well as at

other central banks that the slide in the dollar has proceeded far
                                   17



enough1 Indeed, one reason for Voickers recent opposition to the dis-

count rate cut ii that he felt it would weaken th. dollar if it came

before similar   cuts by other central banks. Given that Voicker was

eventually upheld by the Board and that his chief adversary1     Preston
Miller, the vice—chairman, resigned, it seems reasonable to expect a

less expansionary monetary policy in the coming year.

     The most dramatic economic development In 1986 ha; been OPEC's

inability to prop up crude oil prices with the result that they have

fallen by over 50%. DespIte, ;low growth in real GNP in 1985, we should

recognize that the drop In oil prices is a very favorable supply shock

that should greatly stimulate the economy,

     We can put the analysis of the impact of the favorable supply shock

into a standard textbook, aggregate demand and supply framework. A

direct effect of the oil price shock is a decline in the price level

since gasoline and other forms of energy are an important element of

consumer expenditures1 Indeed, the consumer price index fell    In both

February and March 1986, while the producer price index started falling

in January. In addition, there are indirect effects on the price level

because energy, which is a basic cost of production, has now become

cheaper. One result of the favorable supply shock is then a fall in the

aggregate supply curve, which leads to an expansionary effect on real

output through traditional mechanisms such as a fall in interest rates.

     We must also not forget that the favorable supply shock also has

potential effects on the aggregate demand curve. Because the u.S. is a

net importer of energy, a drop in the price of oil increase; the wealth

of Americans. Indeed, since the beginning of 1986, stock prices have

increased by over 10%, increasing the value of equities by over $300

billion. This sizable increase in wealth will stimulate increased con—
                                    18



sumer spending and so will shift the aggregate demand curve out to the

right.12 This too will lead to increased real output.

      Thu current outlook for the economy is thus a good one. In thu near

future,   the inflation rate should be low as   a result of the oil price

decline, while the economy should undergo further expansion. Does this

mean that we should end our worries about a resurgence of inflation?

Overconfidence on this score is unwarranted. We must remember that       a


halving of the price of oil produces a onceand—for—all lowering of the

pric, level. However, the resulting, permanently lower price level does

not imply that the inflation rate will be permanently reduced. If

monetary policy continues to be expansionary, then the decline in oil

prices will produce only a temporary decline in inflation. Once the oil

price shock has worked its way through th. system, the inflation rate

will begin to reflect the underlying monetary expansion. The rapid rates

of money growth that we have been experiencing in th. last year, If not

reversed, thus present a potential danger to the economy which could

lead to the undoing of the Fed's successful fight against Inflation.
