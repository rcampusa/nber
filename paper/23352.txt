Satisfaction Guaranteed: When Moral Hazard meets Moral Preferences

                                         ABSTRACT

Theorists and policy analysts have convincingly argued that greater trust makes a more efficient
society by eliminating costly contracts or expensive reputations. Concurrently, experiments
suggest that reciprocity is a potent substitute for law when compliance with contracts is
imperfectly enforced. This paper examines these issues within the context of a common trust-
building contract device: satisfaction guaranteed. We find that satisfaction guaranteed indeed
builds trust and improves efficiency. Interestingly, sellers offering a guarantee are more
trustworthy than those who don't, even when honoring it is fully voluntary, but the guarantee only
elicits the trust of buyers when it has legal backing.

1       Introduction
When a buyer cannot verify the quality of a good before it is purchased—Internet transac-
tions being a key example—moral hazard becomes a critical problem. How do buyers know
they will get their money’s worth? Buyers can turn to reputational ratings, but these are
often provided by the sellers, are not representative samples of buyers and, moreover, are
prone to manipulation by sham raters1 . Another innovation is to allow buyers to examine
the good after purchase and, if they are unsatisfied with the quality, they can return the
product for a full refund. This is a practice known as satisfaction guaranteed.
    Satisfaction guaranteed has been a common marketing strategy in the US for years, and
is now also prevalent on the Internet. According to one survey, 95% of retailers have some
sort of policy such that products in “like new” condition are returnable.2 In addition to
“like new” refunds, many retailers also accept used goods, or allow a “trial period.” In the
US, many major online retailers go as far as to include a return shipping labels with the
merchandise—often prepaid—to lower the consumers’ transaction costs of the satisfaction
guarantee. Others are more restrictive, offering a short window of time for refunds, or
charging “restocking fees” upon return. Returns policies are in important component of
modern marketing.3
    The value of satisfaction guaranteed to sellers is easily explained by looking at two games
commonly studied in the laboratory. First is the Trust game (Berg et al., 1995; Van Huyck
et al., 1995) and its cousin the Gift Exchange game (Fehr et al., 1997). This game describes
the fundamental moral hazard problem. Player 1, the buyer, passes money to player 2, the
seller, with the hope of getting something of equal or greater value in return. Whatever is
passed is scaled up (when the buyer passes in the Trust game, and when the seller passes in
the Gift Exchange game), creating a surplus, which the seller can share with the buyer. The
obvious equilibrium in this game is that the seller should return nothing, so should not be
trusted by they buyer. As with the lemons problem (Akerlof, 1970), the market collapses.
    The second game is the Ultimatum game (Güth et al., 1982). In this simple bargaining
game, the proposer offers the responder a split of some surplus. If the responder accepts
the offer then the division is carried out, while if the responder rejects it both sides get
zero. Since something is better than nothing (by assumption), any positive offer will, in

     Che (1996) summarizes a survey of Illinois retailers that report 78% give cash refunds with a receipt,
32% give cash refunds even without a receipt. Twenty-three percent limit the return period, and others limit
returns to merchandise credit. However, fewer than 5% say all sales are final.

Policy Is So Important for Retailers,” Sept. 4, 2012, or Entrepreneur Magazine, “4 Things Shoppers Want

equilibrium, be accepted. This gives the proposer all of the bargaining power; he makes the
smallest possible positive offer and gains virtually all of the surplus.
    Satisfaction guaranteed combines the Trust game with the Ultimatum game. Before
playing the Trust game, player 2, the seller, chooses whether to offer a money back guarantee
to the buyer, player 1. According to classical theory, if player 1 is offered the guarantee,
knowing that she can never be worse off, player 1 will pay the “full price” to player 2. This
creates a surplus which is fully in the possession of player 2. Player 2 then gives back to
player 1 just enough to make it unattractive for player 1 to to ask for a refund. That is,
the seller gives the buyer exactly his money’s worth (or ε more), and keeps virtually all
of the surplus, just like the proposer in an Ultimatum game. Satisfaction guaranteed has
now cured the moral hazard problem, making buyers slightly better off, all while allocating
almost the entire surplus to the seller. If people behave according to these assumptions, then
Satisfaction Guaranteed is good business and should always be adopted by sellers.
    A necessary component of satisfaction guaranteed is that the promise of a refund must be
credible. In order to fortify satisfaction guaranteed,in 1975 the US adopted the Magnusen-
Moss Warrantee Act, which specified that representations such as “satisfaction guaranteed,”
“money back guarantee,” and the like, have legal consequences. Sellers can be sued if they
fail to honor them.4 Indeed, the webpage of the Federal Trade Commission keeps a public
register of settlements with companies that have failed to comply. Nonetheless, one must ask
whether it will it be worthwhile for someone spending a relatively small sum on an Internet
purchase, for example, to file a claim with the Federal Trade Commission. If not, then this
weakens the value of satisfaction guaranteed and restores moral hazard.
    Turning from theory to behavior, we know three things that should cause us to reevaluate
the predictions above. In Trust games many people do actually trust sellers, and some of
these sellers share the surplus equitably. However, enough sellers do succumb to the moral
hazard and, on average, buyers who trust them are slightly worse off. Likewise, responders
in Ultimatum games do not accept all positive offers, but typically reject “unfair” divisions.
An offer of merely 20% of the surplus, for example, is very likely to be rejected, even when
playing for very large stakes. Thus, social preferences and concerns for fair play must be
considered here. The existence of fair sellers means that the moral hazard problem may not
be as severe as feared, and a return policy may not grant as much bargaining power to sellers
as just projected.
    What about enforceability? A large body of evidence shows that many people are averse
   4
    This is distinct from the legally binding “implied warranty of merchantability.” This means that goods
traded must perform for the purpose for which they are sold. This implied warranty binds unless it is
eliminated with language such as “with all defects” or “sold as is.” A satisfaction guarantee, by contrast, is
an explicit promise to refund the price to the buyer.


                                                      2
to lying. Promising a satisfaction guarantee, even if it is not an enforceable promise, may
still be morally binding on many sellers.5 If a desire for honesty interacts with the offer
of a guarantee, then selection into and out of a generous return policy is likely to restore
some value to satisfaction guaranteed. In the end, whether satisfaction guaranteed succeeds
in solving moral hazard and who benefits if it does remain open questions. The important
ingredient is social-preferences; how do concerns for fair play and aversion to lying shift the
bargaining power in the market?
     This paper will report on a laboratory experiments that focuses on the satisfaction
guaranteed game where returned items restore the pre-transaction payoffs. We find that
a satisfaction guarantee that is perfectly enforced will greatly increase economic efficiency.
However, sellers that share too little of the surplus are often rejected, thus undoing many
efficient trades. The net effect, in contrast to predictions, is that buyers are significantly
better off under satisfaction-guaranteed, but sellers profits are about the same with and
without guarantees. This is true even with experience.
     We also allow sellers the option of providing their good with satisfaction guarantee. We
find they overwhelmingly will do so, and those that do not are not trusted by buyers. When
given the choice, therefore, sellers are far better off providing a satisfaction guarantee.
     Finally, we allow fulfilling guarantees to be voluntary and non-binding. This is our most
interesting treatment. We find, as expected, that nonbinding guarantees greatly reduce the
trust put in sellers. This lack of trust is partly justified—of those who seek refunds, only
17% are honored. However, we also found that buyers in this condition trusted too little.
Despite being strategically equivalent to the case where guarantees are not allowed, sellers
in this condition were significantly more generous. In fact, they on average returned quality
that was just as good as those in the condition where the guarantee is perfectly enforced.
Sellers who offer a satisfaction guarantee that is not enforced are more trustworthy, but the
guarantee does not increase the trust put in them by buyers.
     What does this study teach us about how the market cures moral hazard? First we
see that simple and natural institutions, such as refund policies, are highly effective in
generating trust. Second, such institutions without legal constraints may nonetheless come
with moral constraints that result in increased trustworthiness of sellers. Still, without some
legal enforcement even the moral constraints on sellers may not be enough to increase the
trust of buyers. Some oversight, either from governments, courts, or market reputations may
be needed to guarantee the success of “satisfaction guaranteed.”
     The next section will provide a brief review of the US laws on satisfaction guaranteed,

Section 3 presents the experimental design, and Section 4 presents the basic results. Section
5 will discuss what these results imply for contract design and enforcement. Section 6 is a
conclusion.


2     Background
Here we review the econometric and experimental evidence on trust, discuss how guarantees
are enforced in the US, and briefly summarize the theoretical literature on guarantees.


2.1    Trust in the Field
It has long been recognized that greater trust may enhance the efficiency of market exchange.
Knack and Keefer (1997) and Zak and Knack (2001) find that countries whose residents,
when surveyed, are more likely to agree that “most people can be trusted” tend to have
significantly higher growth rates. Several other authors have explored similar constructs of
“social capital” and made similar conclusions.
    Durlauf (2002) surveys this literature and convincingly argues that inferences offered by
Knack and Keefer and others may not be as evident as they suggest. He states social capital
might be more productively studied with controlled experiments. Examples include the
study by the anthropologist Jean Ensminger (2004) that shows a connection between trust in
ultimatum games and market integration of small African villages. Barr and Serneels (2009)
find positive correlations between the trust game and wages earned by workers in Ghana.
A field experiment by Gneezy and List (2006) shows the positive effects of gift exchange in
the labor market don’t last, although later work suggests that the short duration of these
effects may be asymmetric, in that efficiency losses after a wage decrease are not as fleeting
(Kube et al., 2013). These studies indicate the value of institutional details that may help
build trust.


2.2    Trust and Reciprocity in the Laboratory
Fehr et al. (1993) present a non-linear gift-exchange game in which “workers” have increasing
marginal costs of effort and “firms” can encourage effort with efficiency wages. Positive
correlations between wages and effort were observed. Berg et al. (1995), and Van Huyck
et al. (1995) presented very similar models now known as the Trust game. In this linear
game the proposer can pass some of his endowment to the responder, which is tripled along
the way, and the responder can pass money back to the proposer at a one-for-one rate.

                                              4
Evidence from these games is that many people trust and many people repay that trust.
However, on average trust does not pay—proposers earn back about 90% of what they
passed.
    What motivates people in these games? Those who repay trust must do so out of some
concern for altruism and efficiency (Andreoni and Miller, 2002; Ashraf et al., 2016), aversion
to inequality (Bolton and Ockenfels, 2000; Charness and Rabin, 2002; Fehr and Schmidt,
1999; Levine, 1998), an aversion to guilt (Charness and Dufwenberg, 2006, 2010) or an
intrinsic taste for reciprocity (Fehr et al., 1997; Rabin, 1993).6 Those who exhibit trust
could have two motives. First, they could care about the equity and efficiency of outcomes or,
second, they could opportunisticallytake advantage of a fair or altruistic opponent (Andreoni
et al., 2017; Andreoni and Samuelson, 2006). These motives must be balanced against a fear
of betrayal (Bohnet and Zeckhauser, 2004).
    Fehr et al. (1997), and Fehr et al. (1998) make a strong case that responders care about
behaving reciprocally. Using the gift-exchange formats and proportional punishment and
reward schemes they show that players respond as predicted to the behaviors of other sub-
jects. Many have reexamined these findings, and it is a fair summary of the literature to
say that negative reciprocity (punishing bad behavior) is observed consistently and often
with significant effects across most studies, while positive reciprocity is relatively context
dependent (see Jacobson and Petrie (2013) for a recent discussion).7
    Andreoni et al. (2003b) look at environments for sharing a surplus that allow for either
punishment, rewards, or both. In this linear carrot-stick environment they show that neither
punishment of selfish behavior nor rewarding of selfless behavior are strong enough tools to
improve cooperation, but that the two tools in combination are quite effective. This is true
despite the fact that only one tool can be used at a time.8
    Charness and Haruvy (2002) explore preferences in a gift-exchange model and, by varying
the degree of intentionality involved in offers and efforts, are able to identify that altruism,
distributional concerns and reciprocity all have significant contributions to the final outcomes
   6
     Sobel (2005) provides an excellent summary of the literature on trust and reciprocity. He distinguishes
between two notions of reciprocity that are both central to our discussion. First is instrumental reciprocity,
where reciprocity is intended to generate real returns in the future. This need not have any moral basis.
The other notion is intrinsic reciprocity. This is behavior that is chosen for its own reward—reciprocating
may be seen as the right or moral thing to do.
   7
     Engelmann and Ortmann (2002) replicate and expand upon these studies and find, however, that the
existence of positive reciprocity found by Fehr and coauthors is quite sensitive to the parameters and methods
chosen. Furthermore, Charness et al. (2004) find the benefits of Gift Exchange is largely eliminated when
incentives are clarified in a detailed payoff matrix.
   8
     The contrast with the work of, e.g., Fehr et al. (1997) is perhaps surprising. One possibility is that Fehr,
et al. use proportional punishment and reward schemes, making punishing and rewarding more inexpensive
the greater the cheating or cooperating. This is an interesting question for future research.



                                                       5
in these games. Cox (2004) takes a similar approach with the games of Berg et al. (1995).
He builds from dictator to trust games in three steps and again finds significant roles for
altruism, equity, and reciprocity. Gneezy et al. (2000) find that subjects show more trust
when the potential returns are higher, indicating calculated faith in the reciprocity of others.
    In all of these games, the context and costs of the reciprocal opportunities have been
shown to be important. For instance, Andreoni et al. (2002) compared two sequential games
with similar equilibria, but which differed in the cost of equity. They found that people
tolerate inequality more when equality comes at the expense of efficiency.9 A different context
effect is found by List (2006). He conducts a chain of studies that incrementally moves the
gift-exchange game from the lab to the field. With each increment he finds behavior closer
to the prediction of selfish behavior, with lower degrees or reciprocity.
    Engle-Warnick and Slonim (2004) explore trust games that are repeated over time with
the same partner. They find an erosion of trust when end periods are known, but less erosion
when end periods are not known. Their study speaks to the importance of both reciprocity
and reputations, and also to the fragile and temporal nature of trust.
    Some of the most intriguing studies of trust and context relate to how social or formal
enforcement of contracts can build or erode natural amounts of trust. Bohnet et al. (2001),
for instance, argue that both weak and stringent enforcement of contracts achieve the great-
est efficiency. Trust, they argue, is crowded out by institutions that imperfectly enforce
agreements.10 Bohnet and Huck (2004) show that when reputations are used to build trust,
the goodwill carries over to situations where reputations cannot form. Bracht and Feltovich
(2008) find that allowing for voluntary enforcement (by allowing the “investor” to commit a
sum to escrow in a trust game) can lead to efficient outcomes. These disparate findings are
part of the motivation for this paper.


2.3     The U.S. Laws on Satisfaction Guaranteed
The Magnuson-Moss Warrantee Act of 1975 gives the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
the authority to enforce promises of satisfaction guaranteed. It states11 , “A seller or manu-
facturer should use the terms ‘Satisfaction Guarantee,’ ‘Money Back Guarantee,’ ‘Free Trial
Offer,’ or similar representations in advertising only if the seller or manufacturer, as the case
   9
      This finding is evident in many studies, that is, people will prefer more for both subjects to less, even
when relative allocations are uneven. Andreoni and Miller (2002) and Andreoni et al. (2003a) find significant
minorities, however, are willing to “shrink” lopsided allocations toward zero for both.
   10
      Gneezy and Rustichini (2000) find a related result in a field study, although here the enforcement (a
fine) reduces compliance by making clear the price of non-compliance, rather than displacing trust.
   11
      Magnuson-Moss Warrantee Act, Title 16, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Part 239.3, “‘Satisfaction Guaran-
tees’ and Similar Representations in Advertising.”

may be, refunds the full purchase price of the advertised product.” Moreover, the Act makes
it easier for consumers to pursue a remedy for breach of warranty in the courts, and creates
a framework for resolving disputes inexpensively and informally, without litigation.12
    Finding cases of successful consumer action is easy. A recent example of FTC action is
the flaunting of promised refunds by QT Inc., a tele-marketing company, whose promised
satisfaction guarantee permits “consumers to readily obtain a full refund of the purchase
price if they return the Q-Ray bracelet within 30 days.” The FTC ordered QT Inc. to turn
over $22.5 million in net profits and pay up to $87 million in refunds to consumers.13
    Along a similar vein, many states in the US have enacted “lemon laws” to regulate the
sale of automobiles, both new and used, that allow buyers to request “reasonable repair
attempts” after purchase. 14 Again, these laws are intended to strengthen the commitments
made by sellers to ensure the quality of their products.


2.4     Economics Literature on Guarantees
There is a long history of papers written on guarantees, beginning with Heal (1977) who
viewed guarantees as risk sharing arrangements.15 Che (1996) wrote the first theoretical
paper explicitly on consumer return policies.16 He did not consider the moral hazard problem
on the part of sellers, but assumed that consumers are uncertain about their preferences, and
risk averse. He then explored money-back guarantees as a screening method for monopoly
sellers. The guarantee neutralizes risk aversion, promotes sales, and thus allows a monopolist
to identify the high demand consumers ex post. Che shows that guarantees always improve
the welfare of buyers, but monopolists offer too few of them.
    Kessler and Lülfesmann (2004) consider the alternating offers bargaining model of Ru-
binstein (1982) with the option to return the good after purchase. In this model there is
unknown quality prior to purchase and the option for multiple rounds of bargaining. Without
  12
      For more description of the act, go to “A Businessperson’s Guide to Federal Warranty Law” at the FTC
website, http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/warranty.htm.
   13
      This and other complaints, both large and small, are easily found on the Federal Trade Commission
webpage, www.ftc.gov, and at the consumer advocate website see ConsumerAffairs.com.
   14
      These vary from state to state, but a typical law stipulates what is meant by “reasonable repair attempts,”
for instance that a new vehicle under warrantee must be completely repaired or replaced within 18 months
of being purchased. See autopedia.com for information about lemon laws across states.
   15
      A related literature on warrantees also exists. See Cooper and Ross (1985) for the genesis of this
literature. They view warrantees as insurance policies and consider issues of double moral hazard.
   In addition to game theoretic models, there is an extensive literature on money back guarantees in the
marketing literature. See, for instance, Heiman et al. (2002). These papers analyze and compare the costs
of various forms of refund or partial refund policies to the costs of other marketing tools, such as samples
and demonstrations.
   16
      Papers by Mann and Wissink (1988, 1990) considered a non-strategic model of money-back guarantees,
comparing them to product replacements.


                                                       7
guarantees there will be inferior quality, but equal division of the surplus. With guarantees,
the moral hazard problem of the seller is solved and quality improves. However, the guaran-
tee erodes the bargaining power of buyers and allows sellers to negotiate higher prices. The
authors do not consider how social preferences will interact with the pricing and bargaining.


3      Theory and Experimental Design
Consider a game with two players, player 1 acts as the buyer and player 2 the seller. Each
player is endowed with 100 cents. We examine four conditions.
 Condition 1: Trust. In stage 1 player 1 passes x ∈ [0, 100] to player 2. Player 2 receives
    an amount 3x. In stage 2 player 2 observes x and can return any amount y ∈ [0, 3x] to
    player 1. Final earnings for player 1 are π1 = 100 − x + y, and for player 2 are
    π2 = 100 + 3x − y.
    While the most efficient outcome is x = 100, in the subgame perfect equilibrium, player
2 sets y = 0, hence player 1 chooses x = 0.
 Condition 2: Satisfaction Guaranteed. After the basic game of Trust, we now add
    a third “guarantee stage.” In this stage, player 1 has the option of choosing “default
    payoffs” rather than those earned from choices of x and y as calculated in the Trust
    game above. In this case the default payoffs would return both players to their original
    endowment, that is, (π1D , π2D ) = (100, 100).
    The guarantee now alters the subgame perfect equilibrium. In the guarantee stage, player
1 would clearly choose the default if y < x. Hence, in stage 2 a money-maximizing player 2
chooses y = x, or x + ε. Going back to stage 1, any choice of x will yield the same payoff
for player 1, that is π1 = 100 or 100 + ε. Hence, any amount x ∈ [0, 100] is consistent
with subgame perfect equilibrium.17 Note that with money-maximizing preferences, this
multiplicity of equilibria means that a satisfaction guarantee will not assure efficiency.
    What if there are equity concerns? Suppose, for instance, player 1 would prefer the
default of 100 to any amount returned by player 2 that is less than x(1 + α), for some α > 0
which is common knowledge among players. As long as α < 2, then player 2 would most
prefer to return y = x(1 + α) and as a result player 1’s best strategy is to send x = 100.
For any 0 < α < 2, even if α is very small (and as long as player 2 believes α is in this
range), this remains the unique subgame perfect prediction. This means that even a minor
  17
    Note this is also a perfect equilibrium as long as the “trembles” by player 2 are independent of the
amount passed by player 1. If they are increasing in the amount passed, however, then x = 100 could be the
unique perfect equilibrium.


                                                    8
concern for equity combined with a satisfaction guarantee will yield a unique equilibrium
that is completely efficient.
    The Trust and Satisfaction Guaranteed games are illustrated in Figure 1. One can easily
identify the equilibria in this figure. The figure also makes salient two possible competing
versions of equity. First is “equal-payoffs” in which final payoffs of the two players are the
same. This should encourage player 2 to choose y = 2x and encourage players to strive for
the (200,200) payoff. However, one could also justify a “split-the-surplus” notion of equity.
By passing x, player 1 is creating a surplus of 3x for player 2, which shared evenly means
y = 1.5x . When x = 100, this means a payoff of (150, 250). As we will see, both notions of
equity are evident in the data.
 Condition 3: Optional Guarantee. Start with Condition 2 and add a preliminary
    contract stage. In this stage player 2 decides whether he will provide a satisfaction
    guarantee. If he does, the game follows that of Condtion 2 above, and if not it follows
    as in Condition 1. The guarantee, if chosen, is perfectly enforced.
    Recall that a trustworthy seller has nothing to lose by offering a satisfaction guarantee.
By contrast, an opportunistic seller may (or may not) find himself worse off in a situation with
guarantees. As a result, those not offering a satisfaction guarantee will surely be mistrusted
by buyers. In order to avoid revealing oneself as an opportunist, therefore, we expect all
sellers to offer a satisfaction-guaranteed, and thus for this conditions to be strategically
identical to Condition 2.
 Condition 4: Nonbinding Guarantee. This condition adds a fifth and final stage to
    condition 3. In this final stage, those who offer guarantees do not have to honor them.
    In particular, if player 1 asks for a refund, player 2 can honor the guarantee, returning
    players to the (100,100) endowment, or renege on the promise and keep the payoffs as
    they stand.
    This last condition is the most interesting and, for many markets, the most realistic.18
Since guarantees are not enforced, this situation, without social preferences, is strategically
identical the trust game. With social preferences, however, people may actually trust and be
trustworthy and, moreover, be averse to lying (Gneezy, 2005). If, as just discussed, market
forces compel sellers to offer a satisfaction guarantee, then moral forces may compel them to
honor it, in which case they should also tend to return amounts that will keep them honest
and prevent a request for a refund. That is, depending on the strength of preferences of fair
  18
     The design most similar to this that we know of is the “promise condition” of Glaeser et al. (2000).
They gave subjects the chance to make a nonbinding promise to pass back at least what they received, that
is, to promise a return ratio of 1. They found the promise had little effect, and did not improve the amount
returned by player 2s.

play and honesty, even nonbinding guarantees may increase efficiency.


3.1    The Experiment
For each session of the experiment we recruited 20 subjects. All subjects were volunteers from
undergraduate economics courses. There were two sessions for each of the four conditions,
meaning each condition has 40 subjects, 20 in each role, with a total of 160 subjects in the
study.
    Subjects interacted over a computer network. They were first presented instructions
for their game, then answered quiz questions to check their ability to calculate payoffs for
both players’ roles. They were then told their own role, which they kept throughout the
experiment, and began making decisions. Each session thus has 10 player 1’s and 10 player
2’s (called player Red and Blue in the experiment). They played 10 iterations of the game,
each time with a different partner. They were told, truthfully, that they would never play the
same person twice. Each subject participated in only one of the conditions above. Subjects’
instructions are included in Appendix A.
    Each session generally lasted less than one hour. Subjects earned an average of $15
(s.d. 4.80), ranging from $5.13 to $28.00. Subjects’ identities were never recorded, and all
were paid anonymously and confidentially in cash at the end of the study.

4       Results
This section considers the results in light of four questions: 1) Does the satisfaction guarantee
improve efficiency? 2) Who benefits? 3) Will sellers voluntarily commit to a satisfaction
guarantee? and 4) If compliance is voluntary, will social preferences (altruism, fairness,
honesty and trust) be enough to sustain the efficiency properties of satisfaction guaranteed?
    Table 1 presents the mean results for each condition. In what follows we will explore
these data by taking advantage of the panel structure of the data to test for differences across
conditions. The important comparisons will be whether Satisfaction is different from Trust,
whether Optional is the same as Satisfaction, whether Nonbinding is the same as Trust,
and whether offering a guarantee in the final two conditions is “good for business,” both for
sellers and society.


4.1     Does Satisfaction Guaranteed Improve Efficiency?
Table 2 presents analysis of the amount passed by player 1. Since the amount passed is
bounded by 0 below and 100 above, we utilize a two-limit Tobit regressions with random ef-
fects (Wooldridge, 2010). Specification (1) simply looks at the main effects of the conditions.
All the coefficients are significantly greater than zero, and the amount passed is significantly
higher in conditions in which a binding guarantee is available (Satisfaction and Optional)
compared to those in which it is not (Trust and Nonbinding). Column (2) shows separate
estimates for the the effects of the guarantee being chosen by player 2 within the Optional
and Nonbinding conditions, finding that the higher coefficient in the Optional condition from

specification (1) comes largely from effect of Player 2 subjects choosing to offer the guar-
antee. In fact, coefficients outside of the possible range (0 to 100) indicate that when the
guarantee is offered, the median buyer will pass the maximum amount possible, but without
the guarantee, the same buyer passes nothing at all. A similar but less dramatic pattern
occurs with the coefficients on the guarantees being offered in the Nonbinding condition.
Notice too that a guarantee in Optional is not significantly different from a guarantee in
Satisfaction, and a guarantee in Nonbinding is not different from no guarantee in the Trust
condition. No guarantee in either the Optional or Nonbinding, while strategically identical
to the Trust condition, generates significantly lower amounts passed.
    Columns (3) and (4) replicate the analysis of columns (1) and (2), focusing only on rounds
6-10. These regressions lead to similar estimates, with the effects of guarantees being offered
in the Optional and Nonbinding conditions being even stronger.19

     In sum, Table 2 indicates a strong increase in efficiency from satisfaction guarantee when
it is fully enforced, and no effect on efficiency when they are unenforced.


4.2     Who Benefits from Satisfaction Guaranteed?
How does satisfaction guaranteed affect the distribution of payoffs among buyers and sellers?
Table 3 considers return ratios of player 2s, that is, the amount returned divided by the
amount passed, y/x, given that x > 0. A return ratio of 1 means player 1 breaks even, and
who have experience with higher return ratios in prior rounds tend to pass more in later rounds. Analysis
of passes controlling for these effects can be found in Appendix B.


                                                    13
greater than 1 yields a profit. Since return ratios are bounded between 0 and 3, we again
use a two-limit Tobit to evaluate each condition, and restrict the sample to those instances
in which a strictly positive amount was passed by the buyer. Column (1) controls only for
the condition each of the subjects was in, and column (3) does the same but only for rounds
6-10. The coefficients on each of the conditions is significantly greater than zero.
    A concern with columns (1) and (3) is that the random effect may not be independent
of the choice to offer a guarantee in the Optional and Nonbinding conditions. In particular,
player 2s can see the voluntary guarantee as a signal. To address this we conduct a correlated
random effects analysis. Wooldridge (2010, p. 708–710) suggests that adding the mean values
of the interaction of Optional and Guarantee Offered, (Mean of Opt × Guar), or mean of the
interaction of Nonbinding and Guarantee offered (Mean of Nonbind × Guar) as regressors in
the Tobit specification will correct for the correlation between the random effects and the
choice to offer the guarantee.
    The results are shown in columns (2) and (4) of Table 3. Here the interpretation of the
coefficients on Trust and Satisfaction, and their qualitative values, are the same as in (1)
and (3). The coefficients on the whether the guarantee is offered in both the Optional and
Nonbinding conditions can be interpreted as the expected mean amount returned (prior to
censoring) conditional on the seller being the type that never offers a guarantee. Adding the
coefficient on Mean of Opt × Guar, or Mean of Nonbind × Guar, to Guarantee Offered then
shows estimates of how a seller who always chooses to offer the guarantee would act if she
were in each of these situations. It is interesting to note that both when examining all 10
rounds and when restricting the analysis to rounds 6-10, the estimated average return ratio
for a seller who always offers the guarantee in the Optional condition (calculated by adding
the coefficient on Guarantee Offered to the coefficient on Mean of Opt×Guar) is very similar
to the estimated average in the Satisfaction condition (1.577 versus 1.522, respectively, in
rounds 1-10, and 1.581 versus 1.593 in rounds 6-10).
    Table 2 showed that buyers passed significantly more when the guarantee was offered in
the Nonbinding condition than when it was not, despite the two being strategically equiva-
lent. This suggests that they believed the offer of a Guarantee contained some signal value
about the intentions of the seller. Was this belief justified? In Table 3 the fact that the
coefficient on Mean of Nonbind × Guar was significantly greater than zero for rounds 1–10
suggests that it was. The fact that this coefficient becomes smaller and loses significance in
later rounds is also interesting—it suggests that as those who tend to give less learn over
time that the guarantee will cause buyers to pass more, they offer the guarantee more often,
reducing the signal value of the guarantee.
    It has been shown by others that the return ratio can be influenced by the amount sent

(e.g. Glaeser et al. (2000)). In particular, the effects noted in Table 2 may simply be a
result of the different passes by buyers in each of the conditions. We account for these effects
in Table 4. Columns (1) and (3) are similar to the same columns in Table 3, but allow
for different linear effects of passes in each condition. We see that in each condition the
coefficient on the interaction with Pass is significantly different from 0 with p-values of 0.01,
all with magnitudes of 0.003 to 0.006, which are not statistically distinguishable from each
other. This means, for instance, that passing 100 rather than 50 will increase the return
ratio by 0.2 to 0.3 in each condition. In Trust this is not enough to make the predicted
return ratio greater than one when passing 100, while in all other conditions passing 100
is predicted to be profitable. As with Table 3, the coefficient on Satisfaction in Table 4 is
again significantly greater than each of the other coefficients at the 5% level, while none of
the other conditions are statistically different from each other.
    Columns (2) and (4) of Table 4 again make the correction for correlated random effects.
We see that for Optional and Nonbinding those selecting into the guarantee are primarily
responsible for the higher return ratios. In column (4) the coefficients become unstable
because in rounds 6-10, buyers only passed a positive amount six times when the guarantee
was not offered in the Nonbinding condition.
     Table 5 reports the average earnings for the two players. We see that the buyer, player 1,
is far better off under Satisfaction Guaranteed. Earnings increase from 96 to 138 per round,
a rise of 44%. Over the last five rounds the difference is 48%.20 By contrast to player 1
and to the standard prediction, the seller, player 2, is actually worse off over all 10 rounds,
and significantly so.21 However, for just the last 5 rounds, average earnings by player 2 in
 20
      This is significant, with z = −9.47 for all rounds and −6.45 for rounds 6–10.
 21
      z = 1.95.


                                                      16
Trust and Satisfaction are nearly identical, 189 versus 188. Total earnings in Satisfaction
are higher, rising from 290 to 314 overall, and from 288 to 335 for the final 5 rounds. This
is an increase of 8 to 16%. When expressed as a gains-from-trade rather than earnings (that
is, subtracting 200 from the base), this is an increase in the surplus of 26 to 53%.
    The differences between Trust and Satisfaction Guaranteed can be seen in Figures 2. This
shows the frequencies of outcomes over the final five rounds.Each circle is centered on a point
in the data, and the larger the circle the more observations at that point. Figure 2a shows
significant misplaced trust in the Trust condition, and many instances of disappointed player
1s. Figure 2b shows the clear improvement from satisfaction guaranteed. The guarantee
ensures that in none of the observations is player 1 worse off than at the endowment point,
and large numbers of interactions resulted in equitable outcomes of equal-payoffs (200, 200)
and split-the-surplus (150, 250).
    What does this say about the institution of satisfaction guaranteed? Focussing on the
final 5 rounds, this indicates a big gain for player 1, the buyers, no net impact on player 2,
the seller, and a significant 53% increase in realized gains from trade.


4.3       Do Sellers Voluntarily Commit to Satisfaction Guaranteed?
What happens when we allow subjects themselves to determine whether they will offer a
contract with a satisfaction guarantee? We predict, in light of the results above, that all
subjects should offer the guarantee. Table 6 shows that over all rounds, subjects in the
Optional condition offer guarantees 74% of the time, rising to 85% by the final 5 periods.
Nineteen subjects offer guarantees at least 5 of the 10 rounds. Although only 4 of the 20
player 2s offered the guarantee all 10 rounds, 11 subjects offered them in all of the last 5
rounds. In the final round 18 of 20 subjects gave the guarantee.

    This is evidence that subjects are learning they are better off offering a guarantee than
not. Returning to Table 2, we see that in the Optional condition the amount passed is
significantly higher with a guarantee, and that this difference increases by the latter half of
the game. But does the offer of a guarantee really matter to the returns? Table 3 shows
that those offering guarantees more often average significantly higher return ratio than those
who tend not to offer guarantees. Thus, those offering guarantees are both treated better by
buyers, and respond more generously as sellers. Table 5 shows that sellers (player 2s) who
offer guarantees make almost 30% more than those who don’t. Over the last 5 rounds the
gap is almost 75%. Both of these differences are significant.22

      For all rounds z = 9.51, and for the last 5 rounds z = 9.19.

Optional under Guarantee Offered. These numbers are very similar for both players 1 and

2. This is a curious juxtaposition with the finding discussed in the prior paragraph. The
fact that not all people are offering guarantees might suggest that the “cheats” are revealing
themselves, leaving a population of more trustworthy people among those who offer guar-
antees. This appears to not be precisely true—those who offer the guarantee are not more
trustworthy than their counterparts in Satisfaction, but those who do not offer the guarantee
seem less trustworthy.
    The similarities between Satisfaction and Optional conditions can be seen by comparing
Figure 3 below with Figure 2b above. These both show the last five rounds of play. The
similarity in the patterns is striking.23 This will be a difference with the next game.


4.4     Caveat Emptor: Will Nonbinding Guarantees Still Improve
        Efficiency?
We now consider the Nonbinding game, which is the most complex and interesting version
of the satisfaction guaranteed game. Here if the seller chooses to offer a guarantee, and the
buyer requests a refund, the seller can reneg on the promise and deny the refund.
    Begin with the preliminary contract stage. As with Optional, most players offer the
guarantee, with two main differences. First, when the default is not binding, sellers offer it
much more freely. Nine of 20 subjects offered the default all 10 rounds—more than twice
the rate for Optional—and 16 offered it 8 rounds or more. A second difference is on the
opposite extreme. Two of the subjects chose never to offer the default. We asked subjects
in the post-experiment questionnaire to explain their actions, but neither subject gave any
  23
    Both the amounts passed and the return ratios can be shown to be not significantly different between
these two. However, joint tests find significant differences at standard (p ≤ 0.05) significant levels.

insight into this decision.24 When we look ahead to how these two behaved when they
were passed positive amounts, we get a clue. Between the two of them they were offered
positive amounts 11 times (an average positive offer of 54), but only returned a positive
amount 1 time (returned 20 when passed 30 in round 3). It seems, therefore, that neither
had intentions of returning anything they received. Hence, it is possible that these two were
“honest thieves”—they did not want to tell a lie by promising a guarantee that they would
not honor (Gneezy et al., 2013; Hurkens and Kartik, 2009).
    Next look at the actions of player 1. In Table 2 we see the amount passed in the Non-
binding condition is significantly lower than in the Optional and Satisfaction conditions, but
not significantly different from the Trust condition.25 This is true even when the guarantee
was offered.26 Player 1’s actions in Nonbinding are not significantly different from player 1’s
actions in Trust—buyers place no extra trust in a nonbinding guarantee.
    Turning to player 2, we ask whether player 1s should have placed more trust in player
  24
     One subject said nothing, and the other said simply, “Never gave the default option,” which was our
language for the satisfaction guarantee. It is doubtful that these two subjects did not understand the
instructions. Quizzes given before each session required subjects to correctly calculate payoffs in three
examples before moving on to the game (see Appendix A). We are left, therefore, to speculate about their
motives.
  25
     A test for equality of Nonbinding and Satisfaction (Nonbinding and Optional) for all rounds has a p-value
of 0.0034 (0.0418), and for the last five rounds has p-value 0.0012 (0.0035).
  26
     Comparing Satisfaction (Optional with guarantees) to Nonbinding with guarantees, the p-value is 0.0235
(0.0001) in rounds 1-10, and 0.0039 (0.0001) when restricting attention to rounds 6-10.



                                                                     20
2s. Here there is evidence that they should have. Looking at Table 3 the actions of player
2s appear to be between those in Trust and Satisfaction. In fact, average return ratios for
the Nonbinding condition are above 1 when looking at all 10 rounds, indicating a profit
opportunity for buyers. Looking at return ratios under guarantees, those in the Nonbinding
condition are not significantly different different from those in Trust or Optional, but are
significantly less than those in Satisfaction.27
    The actions of player 2s now contrast strikingly with those of player 1s. Player 2s are
much more trustworthy than their counterparts in the Trust condition. Even though they
are not as trustworthy as those in the Satisfaction condition, they are trustworthy enough
that profitable exchanges are possible on average. The promise of a satisfaction guarantee
seems to have the effect of binding sellers to behave more equitably. Unfortunately, player
1s did not take advantage of this honesty.28
    While the average return ratio suggests lost opportunities by player 1, perhaps they
offered less because of a fear of variance, that is, risk aversion.29 Table 6 shows the fraction
of player 2s who offer guarantees, the fraction of those offers that generate a refund request,
and the percent of those requests that are honored. The first column shows that Optional
and Nonbinding conditions are fairly similar, and the second column shows the frequency of
refund requests is also quite similar across Satisfaction, Optional, and Nonbinding. However,
the third column shows a huge difference. Of the 40 requests for refunds in Nonbinding, only
7 were honored. For the last 5 rounds, only 3 of 21 requests actually received a refund.
Looking within subjects, the only subjects who seemed unambiguously honest in their offers
of guarantees were the two subjects who never offered them. Subjects who got more than
one request for a refund all denied at least one of them.30
    What is the net effect on earnings? Table 5 shows that player 1s, the buyers, do far worse
in the Nonbinding condition than in either Satisfaction or Optional. This is even true when
conditioning on the presence of a guarantee. By the last 5 rounds the difference in earnings
between the Trust and Nonbinding conditions is insignificant for player 1s. Looking at player
2s, the sellers, their payoff is nearly exactly the same on average, regardless of the condition.
In sum, the introduction of nonbinding guarantees does little to improve efficiency—overall
  27
     The test of equality between Satisfaction and Nonbiding has a p-value of 0.0103 in rounds 1-10, and
0.0034 in rounds 6-10.
  28
     This conclusion rests, obviously, on the assumption that the return ratios on the amounts passed would
not fall appreciably if larger amounts were passed. Since return ratios are usually higher when amounts
passed are higher, this is likely the case.
  29
     Eckel and Wilson (2004) demonstrate that there is a weak inverse relationship between trust and risk
aversion.
  30
     Only one subject honored all requests, but it’s a trivial case. This subject got a single request. The
amount passed was 3 and returned was 4, so only 5 cents was lost by player 2.

the improvement is not statistically significant.
    The result can again been seen graphically. Figure 4 shows the pattern of outcomes for
the final five rounds of the Nonbinding condition. While containing some of the shades seen
in Figure 2b from Satisfaction, it most resembles the outcomes from Trust seen in Figure 2a.
Note the contrast of this with the surprising results of Bohnet et al. (2001) and Fehr and List
(2004), who show that zero enforcement can be more efficient than imperfect enforcement.
Here, satisfaction guaranteed with no enforcement provides no improvement in efficiency
over no guarantee at all.


5    Trust, Reciprocity and the Law
In this section we address two issues about the interactions of trust and reciprocity with
enforcement. First we consider how much fairness and reciprocity are driving the efficiency
of the satisfaction guarantee. These notions have figured prominently in the work of Fehr
et al. (1997), Fehr et al. (2007), and Brown et al. (2004) for instance, who state that fairness
and reciprocity are potent enforcement devices.
    Second we step back and look at all four institutions above at once and get a more
complete picture of how satisfaction guarantees are altering the behavior and expectations
of both the buyers and sellers.

Figure 5: Probability of Requesting a Refund, and Seller’s Expected Surplus, Conditional
on Return Ratios in the Satisfaction Guarantee Condition


5.1     Fairness and Reciprocity in Satisfaction Guarantee
In Section 3 we made the theoretical point that a satisfaction guarantee will assure efficiency
if buyers will reject trades that, while profitable, do not give a sufficiently fair return. Figure
5 (left axis) shows the probability of requesting a refund in Satisfaction Guarantee condition,
conditional on the return ratio. Letting r be the return ratio, then we see, as expected, all
unprofitable return ratios, r < 1, result in refunds, as do all “break even” return ratios,
r = 1, when the condition is Satisfaction. However, many profitable return ratios, r > 1,
also result in a refund. A seller who chooses a return ratio of 1.2, for instance, will have a
greater than 50% chance of having to give a refund in both the Satisfaction condition and
when the guarantee is offered in the Optional condition. If the buyer passed all 100 to the
seller, such a refund means forfeiting net gains of 180 for the seller and 20 for the buyer.
In the Satisfaction condition, the probability of a refund stays positive until return ratios
exceed 2. So when the guarantees are enforceable, social preferences are playing an imporant
role in driving their use toward efficiency.
    If we think of fairness of buyers as a constraint on sellers, then we can ask, what return
ratio should a money-maximizing seller adopt? As shown in Figure 5 (right axis), the
most profitable return ratio is between 1.4 and 1.7, depending on the condition, a range
including the split-the-surplus ratio of 1.5.31 Even so, these sellers should expect about 10%
of customers at this return ratio to seek a refund. Notice that a supplier who is choosing the
profit maximizing r will average earnings of about 240. This far exceeds the average earnings
  31
    Appendix C confirms this result using regression analysis to solve for optimal return ratios in the two
conditions for which the guarantee was binding. The estimated optimal return ratios fall between 1.55 and
1.65.

in the Trust condition of 194. Given the choice, therefore, adopting a binding institution of
Satisfaction Guarantees seems far superior for sellers than not.
    As with previous research, this confirms that tastes for fair play—when cleverly combined
with a simple marketing innovation—are indeed driving efficiency in the market.


5.2     Voluntary Contracts and Voluntary Compliance
Our four treatments can be paired into two groups that, in the absence of social preferences,
are virtually equivalent strategically. First are Satisfaction Guarantee and the Optional
Guarantee, and second are Nonbinding and Trust conditions. In this section we explore
when and how social preferences might break these similarities.
    Look first at the amounts passed. Figure 6 shows the distribution of the amount passed,
given that guarantees were offered in the Optional and Nonbinding treatments. Here we see
our prediction is borne out. The first two bars over each category compare the Satisfaction
Guarantee with the Optional Guarantee. These two are quite similar. If anything those in
the Optional condition are more generous than those in which the guarantee is required. De-
pending on the test used, the difference between these two conditions is either not significant
or marginally significant.32
    The final two bars over each category in Figure 6 compare Nonbinding Guarantee and
Trust. Again we see the predicted similarity—the two are not significantly different by any
  32
     We test this in two ways, which we use in all the footnotes to follow in this section. First, we organize the
data by subject, finding the average amount passed for each. We then compare the distributions of subjects’
average choices using Mann-Whitney tests (z = 1.89), and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (p-value 0.06).

  33
      Organizing the data by subject, as in the previous footnote, and using Mann-Whitney tests (z = 0.87)
or Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (p-value 0.135) we see that in each case the difference in distributions is not
significant.
   34
      For Trust versus Satisfaction, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS: p-value 0.023) and Mann-Whitney (MW: z =
2.88) both indicate significance. For Trust versus Optional the differences are significant as well (KS: p-value
0.003, MW: z = 3.6). For Nonbinding versus Optional the difference is significant (KS: p-value 0.008, and
MW: z = 2.89), but for Nonbinding versus Satisfaction, the difference is insignificant or marginally significant
(KS: p-value 0.275, MW: z = 1.72).
   35
      A return ratio of 1, for instance, is certain to get a refund request in Satisfaction, but only faces a 28%
chance of a request in Nonbinding. Surprisingly, even unprofitable return ratios have only an 80% chance of
generating a refund request in Nonbinding.
   36
      This contrasts with the “promise condition” of Glaeser et al. (2000). Sellers only promised to send back
at least what they received, and no refunds were possible. This promise, however, did not generate extra
generosity.

                           Figure 8: Distribution of Return Ratios Across Conditions


Consider Figure 8. Here where we look at the distribution of return ratios across treat-
ments, again under the condition that guarantees are offered in Optional and Nonbinding
treatments. As above, we should expect Satisfaction and Optional to be similar, and one can
clearly see that they are.37 Comparing Nonbinding and Trust, however, the comparison is
not as expected. The two are not similar, and the difference is highly significant.38 By con-
trast, the statistical tests comparing the Nonbinding to the Optional treatments—which are
predicted to be different—show the two are nearly indistinguishable.39 This means that the
sellers in the Nonbinding treatment are behaving nearly identically to sellers in the Optional
treatment for whom the guarantee is binding. It appears that those who plan to return less
are less willing to offer a guarantee. One hypothesis is that sellers do not want to face their
own deceit.40 Whatever the reason, we reconfirm the findings of Tables 3 and 4 that offering
a nonbinding guarantee is correlated with more generous return ratios.
    In sum, there is a minor paradox. Those promising a guarantee that they are not required
to honor nonetheless behave statistically indistinguishable from those for whom the promise
is binding. Even so, buyers have little faith in the moral constraints put on sellers by this
promise. As a result, a satisfaction guarantee without any binding enforcement fails to
  37
     While they appear similar in the figure, the difference is marginally significant by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test (p-value .059) and significant in a Mann-Whitney test (z = 2.07).
  38
     A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p-value 0.017) and Mann-Whitney test (z = 2.24) both indicate a significant
difference.
  39
     Kolmogorov-Smirnov (p-value 0.56) and Mann-Whitney (z = 0.22) test indicate only minor differences
between the two.
  40
     In principle this hypothesis can be tested by including a condition in which it is mandatory to offer a
satisfaction guarantee, but optional to honor it. This would presumably remove the moral constraint of
having told a lie. Exploring this and other aspects of guarantees is left to future work.


                                                              26
increase efficiency.


6     Conclusion
This paper was designed to look at a realistic market innovation to promote trust, trade, and
efficiency. We ask whether and how a satisfaction guarantee can improve economic efficiency.
Are moral constraints enough to defeat moral hazard, or does the policy need legal backing?
     The experiment explores satisfaction guarantees in three stages. First, they are manda-
tory and enforced—all sellers must offer and honor them. Second, they are optional, but
fully enforced. Third, they are optional but unenforced, a caveat emptor.
     We find four key results. First, when enforced, satisfaction guarantees can dramatically
increase efficiency and reduce moral hazard. Opposite to predictions from the model without
social preferences, however, sellers are no worse off by offering the guarantees, but buyers
benefit greatly. This suggests that the guarantee is interacting with preferences for fairness
and equity in important ways.
     Second, when guarantees are optional sellers that don’t offer them are not trusted nearly
as much as sellers that do. However, the choice of offering a guarantee was also revealing in
our data; those not offering guarantees were much less trustworthy.
     Third, those who offer a satisfaction guarantee, even if it is nonbinding, are more gener-
ous. In a control condition in which no guarantees are present, buyers lose money on average.
Even when nonbinding guarantees are offered, buyers make money on average. This means
that perhaps another kind of social preference, a taste for honesty, is also engaged when a
satisfaction guarantee is made.
     Fourth, when the guarantee is not binding, buyers don’t trust sellers even though on
average they would be wise to do so. The data also reveals, however, only 17% of all
requests for a refund were actually honored. This result, however, reflects the selection of
sellers more than the trustworthiness of sellers—the average seller was never asked for a
refund.
     What have we learned from this? Within the context of our data and considering both
sides of the market, we must conclude that, at least in this setting, social preferences are an
insufficient commitment device, and external enforcement of guarantees is necessary to gain
efficiency.
     There are several observations,however, that may temper this result. Foremost are repu-
tations and selection. Businesses that routinely flaunt their guarantees may, at the very least,
lose repeat business. Likewise, firms known for honoring guarantees may attract customers.
However, if guarantees can be enforced by reputations, then it suggests that quality can be

                                              27
enforced this way as well. However, quality can be a subjective thing, especially when items
may have many dimensions. A return policy, by contrast, is unidimensinonal and universal:
the refund was granted or not. Thus, a reputation can more easily form around a refund
policy making it a more direct and inexpensive way for consumers to trust sellers.
    A second observation is that our experiment considered only perfect enforcement or no
enforcement. Since the two regimes resulted in identical payoffs for sellers, it would naturally
follow that even imperfect or random enforcement by the government could tip sellers to
honoring their pledges.
    A third observation is that, while satisfaction guarantees predominate US markets, they
are less common in other countries. It could be that the US has stronger enforcement through
the Magnusen-Moss Act, and so achieved a different equilibrium. Alternatively, there could
be different constellations of preferences for equity or tolerance for opportunism in different
parts of the world that affect the degree of moral hazard in the first place.
    This paper also raises the prospect of considering the broader panoply of satisfaction
guarantees. For instance, many firms sell goods with a “free trial offer” or “double your
money back.” How would a this affect the bargain between buyer and seller, and the signal
sent about quality? How can such offers survive two-sided moral hazard, that is, buyers who
“borrow” the items for free and abuse the guarantees. This suggests interesting questions
for future research.
    In sum, this paper illustrates that markets that may be handicapped by moral hazard can
introduce simple innovations, such as satisfaction guaranteed, to increase economic efficiency.
