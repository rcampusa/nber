                                          ABSTRACT

A large literature documents that childhood health shocks have lasting negative consequences for
adult outcomes. This paper demonstrates that the adversity of childhood physical disability can be
mediated by individuals' educational and occupational choices, which reflect their comparative
advantage. We merge records on children hospitalized with poliomyelitis during the 1952 Danish
epidemic to census and administrative data, and exploit quasi-random variation in paralysis
incidence. While childhood disability increases the likelihood of early retirement and disability
pension receipt at age 50, paralytic polio survivors obtain higher education and are more likely to
work in white-collar and computer-demanding jobs than their non-paralytic counterparts.

1        Introduction

A vast body of research documents that adverse early childhood health shocks have lasting negative

consequences on adult health, human capital, and labor market outcomes (Almond et al., 2017;

Currie and Vogl, 2013; Almond and Currie, 2011; Barker, 1990). The estimated long-term impacts

correspond not only to biological processes, but also incorporate any changes in human behavior in

response to the shock. While a burgeoning literature focuses on identifying parental compensating or

reinforcing investments (Almond and Mazumder, 2013; Adhvaryu and Nyshadham, 2016; Sievertsen

and Wüst, 2017; Bharadwaj et al., 2018), comparably less attention has been devoted to the choices

made by the children themselves as they grow up. Moreover, as most studies examine shocks that

impact early childhood well-being on multiple margins (e.g., both physical health and cognitive

development), there is less knowledge about whether individuals’ responses reflect changes in the

comparative advantage across various inputs into the human capital production function (Cunha

and Heckman, 2007; Cunha et al., 2010; Heckman and Mosso, 2014).1

        This paper focuses on a substantial shock to childhood physical health but not cognitive devel-

opment: paralytic poliomyelitis (hereafter, paralytic polio). Our empirical setting is the 1952 polio

epidemic in Denmark’s capital Copenhagen and the surrounding Copenhagen medical district. We

merge unique historical medical records on the universe of children hospitalized for polio in this area

during the epidemic to the 1970 Census and 1980-2013 administrative population register data. We

follow childhood polio survivors as they become adults and into older ages, and study their choices

regarding education and occupation. We test whether the adversity of childhood physical disability

can be mediated by individuals’ educational investments and occupational sorting that reflect their

comparative advantage in cognitive ability relative to brawn.2

        Our empirical approach compares the long-term outcomes of children who are hospitalized with

either paralytic or non-paralytic polio. While nearly all individuals with non-paralytic polio fully

recover from the infection, paralytic polio survivors are likely to suffer lasting disabilities, including

a re-occurrence of symptoms (such as muscle weakness, pain, and fatigue) after a period of physical
    1
     For instance, there is evidence on lasting negative effects of in utero and early childhood exposure to diseases that
impact both physical health and brain functioning, such as influenza (Almond, 2006; Kelly, 2011; Lin and Liu, 2012),
malaria (Cutler et al., 2010; Bleakley, 2010; Barreca, 2010), and pneumonia (Bhalotra and Venkataramani, 2012).

     For a more formal model of how investments in human capital may take into account differences in brawn, see
Pitt et al. (2012).

recovery and stability (“post-polio syndrome”, see, e.g. Groce et al., 2014; Tiffreau et al., 2010;

Frick and Bruno, 1986; Rekand et al., 2000; Ivanyi et al., 1999; Gonzalez et al., 2010; Farbu et al.,

2006; Lønnberg, 1998).

       Our research design relies on the assumption that, conditional on polio infection and hospi-

talization, the incidence of paralysis is uncorrelated with unobservable determinants of individual

outcomes. A small medical literature has documented that there are very few known risk factors

that are associated with paralysis among polio patients (Abramson and Greenberg, 1955; Wein-

stein, 1957; Bunimovich-Mendrazitsky and Stone, 2005; Nielsen, 1999) and we control for those in

our models. Importantly, we show that children’s socio-economic background is uncorrelated with

the incidence of paralysis in our sample.3

       Our analysis focuses on 1,649 children born in 1938-1952 and hospitalized with polio in the

Copenhagen Blegdam hospital, the primary hospital that admitted polio cases from the capital

and the Copenhagen medical district. We find that paralytic polio survivors fare better than their

non-paralytic counterparts along several dimensions. Paralytic patients are more likely than non-

paralytic patients to continue formal education beyond compulsory schooling and less likely to

be employed as unskilled workers at ages 18 to 32. By age 50, individuals who had childhood

paralytic polio are not only more likely to have completed university, but are also in occupations

that have lower physical/brawn requirements and higher computer-skills-related requirements. By

selecting out of manual work and into computer-intensive jobs, paralytic polio survivors end up

in occupations that experienced substantial employment and wage gains over 1960-2010 (Autor

et al., 2003; Deming, 2018). In fact, although most studies find that adverse early childhood health

shocks lower individuals’ earnings in adulthood (see Almond and Currie, 2011 for an overview),

we find no statistically significant differences in wages between paralytic and non-paralytic polio

survivors. Our study suggests that paralytic patients compensate for the large negative shock to

their physical health by making use of their remaining (non-brawn) skills through their educational

and occupational choices. We also, however, document that paralytic polio survivors are more likely

to be dependent on disability insurance than their non-paralytic counterparts, pointing to the fact
   3
    Another concern, which we discuss in Section 4, is selection of individuals into the hospital. Given high public
awareness of the epidemic and universal access to publicly-funded hospitals, we do not expect this to be a severe issue.
We show that our hospital records include almost all registered paralytic and a large share of registered non-paralytic
polio infections in the Copenhagen medical district, implying that selection into hospital admission was minimal.




                                                           3
that today’s society carries the burden of disease from over half a century ago, even if it has been

largely eradicated in developed countries (Philipson, 2000).4

    Selective survival among polio patients may impact the interpretation of our findings. We show

that although in-hospital mortality exclusively affected paralytic patients, it is largely uncorrelated

with individual characteristics among them. Net of in-hospital mortality, paralytic polio patients

are not more likely to die during childhood and young adulthood than non-paralytic patients on

average. However, among patients from low socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds, those with

paralytic polio are more likely to die at all observed ages than their non-paralytic counterparts.

To address the concern that selective mortality among low-SES polio patients drives our long-run

results, we perform a bounding exercise (Lee, 2009). We include all individuals who are missing

in our outcome data because they are either deceased or have emigrated with the most and least

favorable values of each outcome, respectively. Even if we assume that all missing individuals had

the worst possible outcomes, we still find that individuals who had paralytic polio during childhood

choose longer educational tracks geared toward white collar positions early in their careers than

those with non-paralytic polio. However, when we examine educational attainment and occupation

at age 50, the most conservative bounds yield insignificant estimates. Thus, it appears that initial

educational and occupational choices of paralytic polio survivors put them on a higher education

track, but some of the longer-run effects on completed education and occupation may be partially

driven by selective survival.5
   4
     Our evidence builds on a small public health literature on the medium and long-term consequences of polio among
survivors. Most of these studies use small survey samples of (selected) polio survivors, who had paralytic or non-
paralytic polio, and compare their outcomes to those of matched never infected individuals (Lønnberg, 1993; Farbu
et al., 2001; Farbu and Gilhus, 2002; Nielsen et al., 2003, 2016). Studies on 150 to 170 polio survivors in Norway
conclude that “the polio epidemics in the 1950s to a surprisingly little degree influenced social characteristics such as
education, employment and professional life,” even though the survey participants stated that they “regarded their
physical handicap as decisive for their choice of profession” (Farbu et al., 2001, p 503). This finding may be due to
three factors: (a) small sample sizes may be underpowered to detect differences in some outcomes, such as education;
(b) the studies do not distinguish between occupations by their “brawn” content (e.g., the trade and office category
could include manual work in a skilled trade as well as white-collar occupations); (c) the studies rely on survey reports
among polio survivors, and thus sample selection based on health and socio-economic status may bias the conclusions.
Indeed, consistent with the last point, Nielsen et al. (2003) document that Danish (paralytic) polio survivors have a
higher long-term mortality risk than the overall population. At the same time, Nielsen et al. (2016) find that Danish
polio survivors have higher educational attainment but similar total income when compared to matched controls.
   5
     We do not find any statistically significant differences in effects of paralytic polio on educational or labor market
outcomes between survivors from low-SES and high-SES families (similar to some past studies on other child health
shocks, e.g. Currie and Hyson, 1999; Currie and Stabile, 2003).

2        The 1952 Polio Epidemic in Copenhagen

Polio pathology. Polio is a viral disease that is transmitted through oral and fecal channels.

While the vast majority of polio infected individuals do not experience any symptoms, four to

eight percent have mild complaints such as malaise, fever, or headache. One to two percent of

individuals develop specific symptoms (such as stiffness and pain in the back and neck). Almost

all non-paralytic polio patients recover completely. For up to one percent, the illness develops

into paralytic polio, with paralysis of various degrees (Armstrong and Cohen, 1999; Melnick, 1996;

Nielsen, 1999; Horstmann, 1963; Bunimovich-Mendrazitsky and Stone, 2005; Groce et al., 2014).

        Why do some patients develop serious infections that result in paralyses, while others do not?

Existing epidemiological and medical research on the determinants of polio severity remains incon-

clusive. The few factors that have been shown to be associated with the severity of a polio infection

include age at infection, gender, family size and birth order (Weinstein, 1957; Nielsen et al., 2002;

Nielsen, 1999).6 While some small-scale studies have suggested that genetic factors may predict the

risk of paralysis (Van Eden et al., 1983), other studies have not confirmed this relationship (Zander

et al., 1979). In our empirical models, we only exploit the residual variation in paralysis occurrence

net of the observed risk factors.


The 1952 epidemic.           Prior to the introduction of the polio vaccine in 1955, Denmark experienced

several epidemics. The largest epidemics in both the U.S. and Denmark occurred in 1952, with a

total of 34,071 and 5,676 recorded polio cases in the two countries, respectively.7

        This final Danish polio epidemic was centered around Copenhagen, before spreading to other

parts of the country in 1953.8 Suspected polio patients in the capital and the Copenhagen medical

district were referred to a single hospital: Blegdam Hospital. Due to high public awareness of the

symptoms (Warwicker, 2006) and as shown in Section 4, records from Blegdam Hospital cover up

to 90 percent of recorded paralytic and non-paralytic cases of the epidemic for this area.

        In the initial weeks of the epidemic (from July 24, 1952 on), the mortality rate for patients
    6
     One study also suggests that muscular injections and tonsillectomy surgery in the weeks prior to or physical
activity after a polio infection may contribute to the development of paralyses (Von Magnus, 1952). However, the
same study concludes that those factors are of minor importance for explaining variation in polio severity.

   8
     There was also a minor polio outbreak in Denmark in 1961, after the introduction of the first oral polio vaccine,
with 356 cases.


                                                          5
with respiratory paralysis (the most severe form of paralysis) was very high, at about 85-90 per-

cent (Lassen, 1953).9 In late August 1952, one month into the epidemic, the invention of manual

ventilation reduced mortality among patients with respiratory paralysis dramatically (Ibsen, 1954;

Lassen, 1953; Warwicker, 2006).10 In total, 116 paralytic polio patients died at Blegdam hospital

during 1952 (Astrup et al., 1989).11

        After hospital discharge, paralytic polio survivors entered the national rehabilitation system that

aimed to integrate polio survivors into society and the regular labor market. Children were referred

to specialized centers throughout the country for physical rehabilitation and therapy (Gould, 1995).



3        Data and Sample Construction

Polio hospital records.            We use records from the Blegdam hospital that contain the dates of

admission and discharge, type of polio diagnosis, in-hospital mortality, and information on family

structure and the occupation of the household head. Our main SES measure is an indicator for the

household head being an unskilled worker.

        We constrain our sample to individuals admitted and diagnosed with either non-paralytic or

paralytic polio in 1952. Additionally, as data on parental background was only collected for children,

we limit our sample to cohorts born in 1938 to 1952, who were 0 to 14 years old during the epidemic.

        We focus on patients who resided in the capital and the surrounding Copenhagen medical district

during the epidemic.12 We omit 107 children with missing information on parental occupation,

family size, or parity at the time of hospital admission. The hospital records have been linked to

the central Danish Civil Registration System (CPR) and thus contain personal identifiers for those

who were alive and residing in Denmark in 1968. We assume that all hospital records without
    9
      The only treatment was a negative pressure ventilator, the “iron lung.” Its effectiveness was low and the hospital’s
resources of 7 respirators were no match for the unprecedented high number of around 50 daily admissions. Lassen
(1953) notes that the ratio of paralytic to non-paralytic cases was reported to be about 1:2.
   10
      The procedure consisted of tracheotomy with manual bag ventilation through a rubber cuff tube, calling on
hundreds of medical students to ensure round-the-clock ventilation. Among the paralytic patients who survived, only
40 percent required assistance with breathing after one month, and about 14 percent after 10 months (Pallis, 1953).
   11
      These deaths include all patients admitted with polio. In our main analysis sample, we observe 50 deaths of
children in the relevant age group.
   12
      The capital includes the municipalities Copenhagen and Frederiksberg. Suspected cases from the entire island of
Zealand (where Copenhagen is located) were admitted to Blegdam hospital (Warwicker, 2006). However, using data
from the larger geographic area would raise more concerns about selection into hospital admission. Among residents
of the capital and Copenhagen medical district, we observe the vast majority of polio cases in our analysis age group,
as we discuss below.




                                                            6
personal identifiers in 1968 represent patients who died (after discharge from hospital, but at some

point prior to 1968). This is a conservative measure of survival because individuals could be absent

from the register data for other reasons, such as emigration.


1970 Census data.          Using the personal identifier, we merge hospital records to the 1970 Census,

which lets us measure outcomes in young adulthood. We observe individuals’ educational attainment

and occupational status in 1970 (ages 18 to 32). We create indicators for whether individuals have

completed more than compulsory schooling, are enrolled in any educational program in 1970, report

disability pension receipt, or are employed in an unskilled job, as defined in the Census classification.


Administrative outcomes data. We use administrative data on outcomes measured in 1980-

2013. We study survivors’ completed education, employment, occupation, wage earnings, and

disability insurance receipt at age 50. Finally, we add information on the timing of mortality

dating back to 1973. Blue-collar occupations are defined as International Standard Classification of

Occupations (ISCO) 1-digit codes 6-9, which include skilled agricultural and fishery workers, craft

and related trades workers, plant and machine operators and assemblers, and other elementary

occupations, such as cleaners, laborers in agriculture, construction, etc.


Occupations and skills.          We use the detailed occupational data from the administrative registers

in combination with O*NET, a database containing skill requirements for each occupation, to

identify each occupation’s intensity in specific inputs. Using confirmatory factor analysis on the full

set of 52 ability requirements listed in the category “worker abilities,” we obtain for each occupation

a score on the required ability level in four domains: “Cognitive” abilities, capturing verbal and

quantitative abilities, idea generation and reasoning abilities; “Brawn,” which captures physical

strength, speed, gross-body coordination, and flexibility; “Spatial/Vision” which captures visual,

auditory, and speech perception requirements; and “Dexterity,” which distinguishes fine-motor skills

such as finger dexterity from the first “Brawn” factor. We also generate a computer use indicator

based on the average of “interacting with computers” and “programming” requirements.13
  13
    We performed factor analysis on the full Danish population of our analysis cohorts at age 50. See Appendix B for
details and results using skill measures used by Autor et al. (2003); Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and Deming (2018).

Sample means. Appendix Table A.1 presents means of the variables in our analysis sample.

There are statistically significant differences between paralytic and non-paralytic polio survivors

in a number of adult outcomes measured at the 1970 census and at age 50 in the administrative

data. At the same time, out of the 736 paralytic patients in our sample, 50 died in the hospital.

This selective morality may account for some of the observed differences. Thus, in the following,

we more formally examine the differences in outcomes using the empirical methods described below

and discuss the potential impact of selective mortality.



4    Empirical Methods

To examine the impact of the childhood paralytic polio during the 1952 epidemic, we estimate the

following regression using our hospitalizations data for admitted polio cases:


                              Yit = β0 + β1 P araP olioi + Xi0 ρ + γt + εit                         (1)


for each individual i born in year t. Yit is an adult outcome, while P araP olioi is an indicator for an

individual being hospitalized with paralytic polio. We include a vector of individual-level control

variables observed in the hospital records, Xi : indicators for being admitted during the height of

the epidemic (August-December 1952), being male, a first-born, coming from a family of more than

two children, residing in the capital, and having the head of household classified as an unskilled

worker. To control for known age effects on the probability of developing paralysis, we also account

for year of birth fixed effects, γt . εit is an unobserved error term.


Identifying assumptions.        To identify the causal effect of being exposed to paralytic polio, we

rely on the assumptions that among patients hospitalized for polio, the incidence of paralysis is

uncorrelated with unobservable characteristics that also impact outcomes, and that there is no

differential selection into hospitalization across paralysis status.

    Column 1 in Table 1 shows results from a regression of paralytic polio status on individual level

and geographic characteristics. Residence in the capital is negatively correlated with the likelihood

of being diagnosed with paralytic polio in our sample. This finding suggests that among inner-

city residents, a greater share of suspected polio cases were admitted to hospital for observation.


                                                    8
Our main measure of individuals’ socio-economic background, an indicator for the head of the

patient’s household being an unskilled worker, does not predict the likelihood of being diagnosed

with paralytic polio. Moreover, in our sample, child gender, family size, birth order, and admission

in January-July 1952 (before the height of the epidemic) are all uncorrelated with paralytic polio.

         Column 2 in Table 1 shows that individual-level characteristics appear to also have little rela-

tionship with the likelihood of in-hospital mortality, although we do find that individuals residing

in the capital are less likely to die in the hospital than individuals outside the capital (which may

be due to an over-representation of non-paralytic cases from the capital). To address this issue, we

have estimated all our main models using only polio patients who are capital residents, finding very

similar results (available upon request).

         Finally, to show that it is unlikely that our results are driven by selective hospital admission, we

compare our raw hospital records to aggregate statistics of paralytic and non-paralytic polio cases for

the capital and Copenhagen medical district (Hamtoft, 1953).14 As Appendix Table A.2 illustrates,

our records contain around 90 percent of all paralytic polio cases that were registered for individuals

aged 0 to 14 during the epidemic. Moreover, in the hospital records, we observe all deaths from

paralytic polio that were registered. When comparing the hospital records to aggregate statistics

for all age groups, we cover at least 84 percent of all registered non-paralytic cases. While the non-

paralytic statistic is not available by age, anecdotal evidence suggests higher hospital admission

rates for suspected polio infections in children than adults (Warwicker, 2006). Thus our coverage

of children with non-paralytic polio is likely higher than 84 percent.



5         Results

Table 2 presents our main results for the effect of paralytic polio on educational and occupational

outcomes. Panel A shows that, compared to non-paralytic polio survivors, individuals who had

paralytic polio are 6 percentage points (15 percent) more likely to have completed more than

compulsory schooling and 4 percentage points (22 percent) less likely to be unskilled workers when

they are between 18 and 32 years old. The coefficients on the unskilled background indicator are

opposite-signed for these outcomes, consistent with low-SES individuals being on lower educational

to missing covariates).

and occupational trajectories, regardless of paralysis status. Comparing the magnitudes suggests

that the experience of childhood paralysis may reduce the high-versus-low-SES gap in the likelihood

of going beyond compulsory schooling by about 24 percent.

   In panel B, we find that, by age 50, paralytic polio survivors are more likely to obtain a university

education and are less likely to work in a blue-collar occupation than non-paralytic survivors. At

the same time, paralytic polio survivors are 8 percentage points (50 percent) more likely to be on

disability insurance, and are 5 percentage points (7 percent) less likely to be employed. There is no

statistically significant effect on wage earnings.

   We thus find evidence of greater selection into higher education despite a shortened work life

in paralytic polio patients. In a standard human capital framework, such as Ben-Porath (1967),

a shorter time horizon for earning income should decrease the expected returns, leading to lower

investments in education. Our finding of an opposite effect suggests that there are additional factors

counteracting the reduction in expected returns. The shift in comparative advantage is one such

factor. Another possibility is that paralytic polio survivors derive a higher consumption value from

education, if education compensates for some of the disutility of physical disability (Finkelstein

et al., 2013).

   Our results on selection out of brawn-based occupations, however, appear more consistent with

the comparative advantage channel, due to the explicit link between skills and their use. Panel C

shows that employed paralytic polio survivors are working in jobs that require less physical body

strength, dexterity, or spatial and vision ability at age 50. In terms of percentiles of the entire

population of the same age, paralytic polio survivors work in jobs that are 8 percentiles lower in

skill requirements for physical strength, speed, coordination, and flexibility than their non-paralytic

counterparts. Their occupations tend to not be any higher in the overall cognitive requirement

(column 1 of panel C), despite their higher educational attainment. However, we do find that

paralytic polio survivors hold jobs that are 5.6 percentiles higher in the frequency and intensity of

computer use (column 5 of panel C) than non-paralytic polio survivors.

   Did paralytic polio survivors “benefit” from their polio status because they got a head start on

technological change over the second half of the 20th century? We study this question further by

replicating the skill measures employed by Autor et al. (2003); Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and

Deming (2018), in Appendix Table A.3. While we prefer our comprehensive measures that draw


                                                     10
on the entire list of skill requirements in the factor analysis, these measures are more specific. We

find that the selection out of “brawn” jobs corresponds to a selection out of both routine manual

and nonroutine manual jobs, which were shown in Autor et al. (2003) to have experienced declines

since 1960 and 1980, respectively. We also find that paralytic polio survivors selected into non-

routine analytical jobs based on Deming’s definition using mathematical reasoning. While we see

that paralytic polio are more likely to choose jobs that were growing over this time period, their

comparative advantage is not shifted toward interactive, social or service jobs, which experienced

the greatest gains.


Selective mortality and heterogeneity by parental background. All the results presented

so far are based on samples of survivors until 1970 and age 50, respectively. As mentioned above,

mortality in the hospital only affected paralytic patients. Within that group, there is little correla-

tion between individual characteristics and the likelihood of mortality. Moreover, when we exclude

the 50 patients who die in the hospital, the remaining paralytic polio patients are not more likely to

die during young adulthood than non-paralytic patients (Appendix Table A.4). This average masks

heterogeneity in mortality effects, however. Table 3 shows that paralytic polio patients from low-

SES backgrounds face an increased risk of early mortality.15 This result holds both when including

and excluding in-hospital mortality. By contrast, when we consider the impacts on educational and

occupational outcomes, we cannot rule out that the impacts of paralytic polio are similar across

children from low- and high-SES backgrounds.16

    To address the issue of selective mortality among low-SES individuals, we implement a bounding

exercise analogous to Lee (2009). We include all individuals that leave our data prior to the time

of measurement with either the most or least favorable outcome, and perform our main analysis on

the resulting sample with imputed variables.17

    Table 4 presents the results from this bounding exercise for our census outcomes, while Ap-

pendix Tables A.5 and A.6 do so for outcomes at age 50. We find that the result for continuing

beyond compulsory schooling is robust to the bounds, suggesting that the impacts for educational

admitted individuals, who are not merged to the census or administrative register data.

  17
     We do not impute values for individuals who are observed in the outcome for some measures but not others, e.g.,
have data on their labor market status but are missing on, e.g., education.

investments in young adulthood are not purely driven by changes in sample composition due to

selective mortality of the “weakest” paralytic polio survivors. However, results for outcomes at

age 50 are more mixed, with the most conservative bounds often yielding insignificant effects. The

most robust finding across the lower and upper bounds for this age group is that of an increased

probability of being on disability insurance.



6      Conclusion

Do individuals alter educational and occupational choices in response to childhood physical disabil-

ity? We examine this question in the context of paralytic polio, a crippling disease that impacts

physical health, but not other inputs into human capital production. We leverage multiple sources

of linked data and compare the outcomes of children who were hospitalized with paralytic and non-

paralytic polio at ages 0 to 14 during the 1952 polio epidemic in Copenhagen, Denmark. We study

how these individuals fare in young adulthood (in 1970) and at the peak of their careers around age

50.

      Our results show that, relative to their non-paralytic counterparts, paralytic polio survivors are

more likely to pursue an education that leads to a white collar job, to choose a white collar track

early in their careers, and to obtain higher educational qualifications and work in jobs demanding

computer-related skills and less brawn around age 50. These choices are consistent with a shift in the

comparative advantage of cognitive versus physical skills for individuals affected with paralytic polio.

Indeed, while prior studies show that health shocks during childhood lower individuals’ earnings in

adulthood, we find no differences in wages between paralytic and non-paralytic polio survivors. The

fact that paralytic survivors obtain more education but do not experience any earnings gains is also

consistent with the idea that education has some consumption value for the affected individuals.

      Finally, we find that although there is no evidence of differential mortality between paralytic and

non-paralytic patients overall, the mortality risk for paralytic patients is higher for children from

low-SES than high-SES backgrounds, even in the very long run. Our results suggest that children

from more advantaged backgrounds may be better able to buffer against the lasting health impacts

of childhood disability than their less advantaged counterparts.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors in brackets. The sample in panel A includes children admitted with
non-paralytic or paralytic polio in 1952 who are observed in the 1970 census, at which they are 18-32 years old. The
sample in panel B includes children admitted with non-paralytic or paralytic polio in 1952, who are observed in the
administrative registers at age 50. The sample in panel C includes children admitted with non-paralytic or paralytic
polio in 1952 who are observed in the administrative registers at age 50 and who have a registered occupation in any
of the 5 years around age 50. We limit to children aged 0-14 in 1952 and residing in the Copenhagen medical district.
All regressions control for indicators for a male child, for the child being first-born, an indicator for a large family
(more than two children), an indicator for residence in the capital, and birth year indicators. “> Comp. Edu” refers
to having education beyond compulsory schooling, and “Disab.Ins.” stands for receipt of disability insurance.

B      Factor Analysis for Occupational Descriptors

The administrative registers record occupations at a very detailed 6-digit level. We link these
Danish codes to ISCO-88 4-digit codes. To characterize these almost 800 occupations succinctly
and meaningfully, we use their task requirements in a range of domains. Drawing on O*NET,
a database containing detailed occupational descriptors and skill requirements, we express each
occupation’s intensity in specific inputs.
    O*NET, the Occupational Information Network, https://www.onetcenter.org was developed un-
der the sponsorship of the US Dep. of Labor/Employment and Training Administration. It draws
on information from the US labor market. Nevertheless, researchers apply it in other settings as
well, since the work requirements are comparable in highly developed western countries, including
Denmark. We draw on the following crosswalks to merge the ISCO-88 codes to O*NET’s classifica-
tion: The International Labor Organization (developer of ISCO codes) provides a crosswalk http:
//www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/ from ISCO-88 to ISCO-08, and the
US Bureau of Labor Statistics offers a crosswalk www.bls.gov/soc/ISCO_SOC_Crosswalk.xls from
ISCO-08 to SOC 2010 (Standard Occupational Classification), which leads to the O*NET classifica-
tion through O*NET’s own crosswalk. http://www.onetcenter.org/taxonomy/2010/soc.html/
2010_to_SOC_Crosswalk.xls
    We focus on O*NET’s descriptions of worker abilities (part of worker characteristics), which are
described as “enduring attributes of the individual that influence performance.” O*NET lists the
required level of a skill that is needed or required to perform the occupation, and its importance,
on 52 abilities that cover cognitive as well as sensory, psychomotor, and physical abilities. We
aggregate the descriptors in O*NET with confirmatory factor analysis on the level ratings, using
the full Danish population of the birth cohorts in our analysis when they are 50 years old.
    The occupational descriptors are produced with the following procedure:
    1. Obtain the Danish population sample of 50-year-olds from the birth cohorts in our analysis
       sample, keep their Danish occupation codes. This sample will be used twice.
    2. Generate a crosswalk from Danish occupation codes in the administrative registers to O*NET
       codes.
       (a) Connect Danish occupation codes to ISCO-88.
             i. The administrative registers record occupations at a very high level of aggregation
                (6-digit ISCO codes, Danish ’88 version).
            ii. Use the first 4 digits of the Danish codes to use the higher level of aggregation in
                ISCO-88 4-digit codes. While the vast majority of all Danish 4-digit codes correspond
                exactly to ISCO-88, the Danish version contains some higher-order aggregation (3-
                digit codes) that do not have an official correspondence to ISCO-88 (14%).18 To
                attribute an ISCO-88 to these occupations, we determine the most frequent 4-digit
                occupation that occurs in the population within the same 3-digit code. Merge the
                popuplation sample to the official ISCO-88 list to identify non-matches. Then tab-
                ulate the frequency to obtain the mode of 4-digit codes, and link the Danish 3-digit
                occupation to this empirical mode within the 3-digit group.
           iii. After attributing ISCO-88 codes to all Danish codes, collapse data on Danish code
                and ISCO-88 level to keep only the crosswalk.
       (b) Connect ISCO-88 to ISCO-08 (from 2008, more recent than ISCO-88). The International
           Labor Organization (developer of ISCO codes) provides a crosswalk19 from ISCO-88 to
  18
     An example is Danish code 2110, “Work within physics, chemistry, astronomy, meteorology, geology, and geo-
physics,”, where ISCO-88 lists 2111 “physicists and astronomers,” 2112 “meteorologists,” 2113 “Chemists,” etc. Those
lower-order categories also exist in the Danish classification.

            ISCO-08.
        (c) Connect ISCO-08 to SOC 2010. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics offers a crosswalk20
            from ISCO-08 to SOC 2010 (Standard Occupational Classification)
        (d) Connect to the O*NET classification through O*NET’s own crosswalk.21

 3. Read in the ability measures (levels) from O*NET (The Occupational Information Network,
    https://www.onetcenter.org)

 4. Use the population sample to obtain a population distribution of O*NET measures, by merging
    the crosswalk to the population, then merging to the O*NET ability measures.

 5. Perform exploratory factor analysis on the entire set of ability measures. We performed initial
    analyses on levels and importance measures either separately or jointly, and on the products
    of these two within type (example: one entry is given by the product of “Stamina, level” times
    “Stamina, importance”). Determine the number of factors to retain, with rules-of-thumb from
    scree plots and eigenvalues. Ultimately decided on using the levels only, and using a four-factor
    structure.

 6. For the set of levels of all measures given by O*NET for abilities, retain 4 factors. Rotate
    the loadings obliquely using the promax rotation. We report the rotated factor loadings in
    Table B.1.

 7. Predict scores on these factors, and collapse the data by occupation codes.

 8. Merge the skill scores to the polio sample’s occupations via the Danish occupation codes.
