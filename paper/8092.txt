1. Introduction

       This study investigates the short run response of stock prices to the arrival of

macroeconomic news. The particular news event we consider is the Bureau of Labor

Statistic (BLS)'s monthly announcement of the unemployment rate. We establish that the

stock market‚Äôs response to unemployment news arrival depends on whether the economy

is expanding or contracting. On average, the stock market responds positively to news of

rising unemployment in expansions, and negatively in contractions. Since the economy

is usually in an expansion phase, it follows that the stock market usually rises on bad

news from the labor market.2

       We next provide an explanation for this seemingly odd pattern of stock price

responses. Campbell and Mei (1993) point out that, conceptually, three primitive factors

determine stock prices: the risk-free rate of interest, the expected rate of growth of

corporate earnings and dividends (hereafter, ‚Äúgrowth expectations‚Äù), and the equity risk

premium. Thus, if unemployment news has an effect on stock prices ‚Äî which it clearly

does ‚Äî that must be because it conveys information about one or more of these

primitives.

       We begin our explanation by determining whether the pattern of stock price

responses can be explained solely by the information about future interest rates that is

contained in the unemployment news. If this were the case, stock and bond prices would

respond in the same way (save, possibly, for differences that arise due to differences in

their durations). They don‚Äôt. During contractions stock prices react significantly and

negatively to rising unemployment, but bond prices do not react in any significant way.

Since bond prices don‚Äôt respond during contractions, it must be the case that
                                                                                           4


unemployment news contains little or no information about future interest rates in that

business cycle phase. Since stock prices do respond significantly during contractions, it

must also be the case that the unemployment news contains information about growth

expectations and/or the equity risk premium in that business cycle phase.

       During expansions, things are rather different. Both bond and stock prices rise

significantly on news of rising unemployment. Given the bond response, it must be the

case that during expansions, bad labor market news causes expected future interest rates

to decline. This could also be what causes stock prices to rise during expansions, but

needn‚Äôt (since growth expectations and the equity risk premium could be changing also).

       The next step to understanding the pattern of stock price responses over the

business cycle is to examine the effect of news arrival on the other two primitive factors:

growth expectations and the equity risk premium. We must use proxy measures for both

variables since neither is directly observable.

       In brief, we find no evidence that proxy measures for the equity risk premium are

affected by unemployment news in any significant way. However, we do find evidence

that growth expectations change in response to the unemployment news. Specifically, we

find that unemployment news is helpful in predicting the actual growth rate of the Index

of Industrial Production (IIP) ‚Äî our proxy measure for growth expectations ‚Äî over

several months following an unemployment news release.           Rising unemployment is

always followed by slower growth.          But this relationship is much larger during

contractions than it is during expansions. Thus, if (as is widely believed) equity investors

are rational agents who study the real sector data, they would be expected to revise their

growth expectations more significantly during contractions than during expansions.
                                                                                           5


       Next, we construct two portfolios of stocks. Stocks in the first group consist of

public utilities with earnings that are less sensitive to fluctuations in macroeconomic

growth than is the average stock. Stocks in the second group consist of cyclicals with

earnings that are more sensitive than the average stock. The price effect that arises due to

revisions in the growth expectations should be small for utility stocks and large for

cyclical stocks when compared to stocks in general. This is exactly what we find. For

cyclical stocks, growth revisions are relatively more important than for the average stock.

Therefore, the difference between the cyclicals‚Äô price response patterns in contractions

and expansions is even more pronounced that the S&P 500‚Äôs. Their price responses have

the same signs as the S&P 500, which also depend on business cycle phase, but are larger

in absolute magnitude. For utility stocks, growth revisions are relatively unimportant

compared to the average stock. Therefore, interest rate effects dominate and the utilities

respond in much the same manner as do government bonds. Like bonds (but unlike the

S&P 500 and the cyclical stocks) the utilities either rise on rising unemployment, or are

unaffected.

       These findings complete our explanation of stock price responses to the

unemployment news. As mentioned above, rising unemployment is always bad for

growth, and presumably for investors‚Äô growth expectations. During expansions the bad

news effect of rising unemployment (a downward revision in growth expectations) is not

sufficiently strong to cancel out the good news effect (a downward revision in expected

future interest rates). Consequently, stock prices respond positively to an increase in

unemployment.      During contractions, the relative importance of the two effects is

reversed.     The bad news effect of rising unemployment on growth expectations is
                                                                                       6


relatively strong. However, interest rates do not respond significantly to unemployment

news during contractions. Therefore, the good news effect of falling interest rates is

weak or nonexistent. The net effect is that during contractions the bad news effect

dominates and stocks fall on news of rising unemployment.

       Related literature

       Our study differs from previous work in this area in a number of ways. We

investigate only the unemployment rate announcement and do not rely on private forecast

data. Hence, we are able to employ much longer time series than used previously. We

compare the differences in the price responses for both stocks and bonds, and for stocks

with different earnings/dividends growth characteristics. Perhaps most important, we

investigate the relative magnitude of earnings growth rate revisions and interest rate

effects, conditional on the state of the economy.

       McQueen and Roley (1993) also found that there is a strong relationship between

stock prices and macroeconomic news, such as news about inflation, industrial

production, and the unemployment rate based on their own definition of business

conditions. However their purpose was to demonstrate the state dependence of stock

price responses to all macroeconomic news. Krueger (1996) studied the market

rationality of bond price responses to labor market news. His focus was on market

reaction to the availability of more reliable information, as the unemployment data were

revised. His study found (as we do) that market prices were strongly affected by the

unemployment announcements. Fleming and Remolona (1999) analyzed the response of

U.S. Treasury yields across the maturity spectrum to different types of macro-economic
                                                                                       7


announcements using high frequency data over four-and-a-quarter years. They found that

the yields on intermediate term bonds were more sensitive to unemployment news.

       Veronesi (1999), based on theoretical arguments, showed that bad news in good

times and good news in bad times would generally be associated with increased

uncertainty and hence an increase in the equity risk premium investors require for

investing in stocks.

       Jagannathan and Wang (1993) found that monthly stock returns are negatively

correlated with the per capita labor income growth rate.       Jagannathan, Kubota and

Takehara (1998) report similar findings using Japanese data. Since most of the variation

in per capita labor income arises from variation in hours worked and not the wage rate,

these findings are consistent with the unconditional positive correlation between the

growth rate in unemployment and stock returns that we find in our data set.

       The Rest of the Study

       Very briefly, the rest of the study proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the

data set, and the empirical methods for forecasting unemployment rates. Section 3.

examines the effect of unemployment news on the S&P 500 stock index portfolio returns

and on government bond returns. Section 4 examines how unemployment news affects

growth expectations and the equity risk premium. Finally, Section 5 summarizes and

concludes.

   2. Data and Methodology

       Unemployment Announcements

       Although there are a variety of macroeconomic information releases we could

have considered, we chose the unemployment rate because it is viewed as newsworthy. It

has frequently been the reference point of Federal Reserve policy and the target of wide
                                                                                          8


speculation on Wall Street. Perhaps no economic report exerts as much impact on

speculative prices or is as closely followed by market participants. In addition, and

important for our purposes, this release has a long and accurately dated time series.

       The monthly unemployment announcements used in this paper cover the period

from February 1948 through December 1995. The announcements were usually made at

8:30 am on a Friday, although during earlier years some announcements were made on

other days. All announcement dates, Friday or not, are included in our study. On

announcement days, the Department of Labor releases other information besides the most

recent unemployment rate. This includes the total number of employed and its

distribution across regions and industries. It also releases revisions of past unemployment

announcements for the previous three months, after which the announcement is

considered final. It also releases employment totals, weekly and hourly earnings and

weekly hours worked. This study focuses on unemployment rate announcements only.

       McQueen and Roley (1993) and Kreuger(1996), used forecasts made by Money

Market Services International (MMS) to identify the surprise element of the

unemployment rate announcement.         We do not follow this procedure since MMS

forecasts have only been available since November 1977, whereas our data set goes back

to January 1962. Seeking to employ as much data as possible, we used our own time-

series models to forecast the unemployment rate announcement and its unanticipated

component.

               Measuring Unemployment News

       Our focus in this paper is to examine how stocks respond to unemployment news.

For that purpose we need a model to measure the anticipated and the unanticipated
                                                                                           9


(news) component of the unemployment figures that are announced every month. We

use the following statistical model to forecast the unemployment rate change on

announcement dates:



DUMPt = b0 + b1 ‚ãÖ IPGRATE t ‚àí1 + b2 ‚ãÖ IPGRATE t ‚àí 2 + b3 ‚ãÖ IPGRATE t ‚àí4
                                                                                     (1)
           + b4 ‚ãÖ DUMPt ‚àí1 + b5 ‚ãÖ DTB3t + b6 ‚ãÖ DBAt + et ,

where, DUMPt is the change in the unemployment rate, IPGRATEt is the growth rate of

monthly industrial production, DTB3t is the change in the 3-month T-bill rate and DBAt

is the change in the default yield spread between Baa and Aaa corporate bonds, all for the

period t-1 and t. The unemployment rate is very persistent so our forecasts are based on

the first differences3.

        Note that for these (and most of the other) regressions presented in this paper,

both heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation are present in the residuals. We therefore

compute hetereoscedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) standard errors and t-

statistics with the Bartlett kernel. The bandwidth parameter is chosen to match the

degree of autocorrelation in the residuals, where the length of autocorrelation is first

estimated by the Yule-Walker method. For many regressions (especially daily stock

returns), autocorrelation is not an important factor, thus only White t-statistics are

reported.

        Forecasts for the change in the unemployment rate from month t-1 to month t

were constructed by first estimating equation (1) using monthly observations up to month

t-1. Adding back the unemployment rate at month t-1 to this forecast gives us the

predicted unemployment rate in month t.
                                                                                         10


       Actually, equation (1) was estimated in three different ways. The first estimation

method is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù, in the sense of achieving the smallest out-of-sample forecast errors.

In this case, we used final release numbers for unemployment and industrial production

and we also included a dummy variable which took on the value 1.0 during contractions,

and 0.0 during expansions. This procedure could be criticized on two grounds. First, it

takes account of the information conveyed by the state of the economy. However, it can

be argued that agents do not necessarily know the state of the economy at the time a

forecast is made ‚Äî since the NBER‚Äôs announcement of an official turning point typically

comes months after the date. To address this criticism, our second estimation method

omits the business cycle dummy variable that allows the intercept for contractions to be

different than that for expansions. As shown in Table 1 (method two) this results in a

small but significant bias in the forecasts ‚Äì the average forecast error for the model is

different from zero -- which is not present with method one.

       A second criticism of our forecasting procedure relates to the use of final release

data for both the unemployment rate and the IIP. Since the final release numbers come

out about 3 months after the initial release, forecasts made in this way could not have

been made in real-time. In view of this criticism, our third forecasting method uses final

release figures for the unemployment rate and the IIP, but only employs data available up

to one year before the estimation date. Then we employ the estimated parameters and the

initial release numbers of the unemployment rate data to construct our estimate of the

unemployment surprise. With this very conservative method, we can be sure we are

using only information that was available to investors at the time the forecast was made.
                                                                                          11


As can be seen from Table 1 (method three) this method also has a small but significant

bias in the forecasts.

        As shown in Table 1, the three forecasting methods have the expected properties:

method one results in smaller forecast errors than method two; and method two results in

smaller errors than method three. We feel that these three estimating methods span the

space of ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù real-time unemployment forecasts. That is, estimates by the first

method are undoubtedly better than market participants could actually have made, and

estimates by the third method are clearly worse. What is most important for present

purposes is that none of the results that follow are particularly sensitive to the choice of

estimation methods.

        Properties of Unemployment News

        We classified every sample month as an expansion or contraction month, using

the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)‚Äôs reference dating. The properties

of the unemployment rate forecasts for each method are in Table 1. During the 408

month period February 1961 to December 1995, he US economy was in an expansion

during 351 months and in a contraction during 57 months. There were 5 contractions and

6 expansions. The average duration of a contraction was 11 months and the average

duration of an expansion was 59 months. Unemployment was higher at 6.8% during

contractions and lower at 6.1% during expansions. On average the unemployment rate

increased by 0.2% per month during contractions and declined 0.04% per month during

expansions. The forecasted changes in unemployment rates are smaller in expansions

than in contractions. For Method 1 the forecast errors are not statistically significantly

different from zero.     The average unanticipated change in the unemployment rate
                                                                                       12


(forecast error) was ‚Äì2 basis points during contractions and ‚Äì0.4 basis points during

expansions. However, there is a small but statistically significant bias in the forecasts

made using Models two and three ‚Äì the forecasts are biased downward during

contractions and upward during expansions. The average forecast error was 8 basis

points during contractions and ‚Äì3 basis points during expansions for Model 2. The

corresponding numbers for Model 3 were 4 basis points and ‚Äì4 basis points.

       Table 2 shows the distribution of unemployment surprises, when classified

according to whether unemployment increased by less than forecast, or unemployment

increased by more than forecast. When Model 1 forecasts are used, out of a total of 408

months, there are 207 negative surprises (good news) and 201 positive surprises (bad

news). Given the bias in the forecasts made using Models 2 and 3, it is not surprising

that, the split is much less even for these two models.

       To see how our forecasts compared to the predictions of experts, we studied the

period February 1992 to August 1994 during which Fleming and Remolona (1998)

reported statistics for unemployment rate surprises, based on consensus forecasts

published in the Wall Street Journal. Their mean was ‚Äì6.3 basis points with a standard

deviation of 17.1 basis points. The forecast errors for the three models we use have

comparable properties.

       We ignore dividends when computing stock returns ‚Äî daily stock returns are

defined as the percentage change in the S&P 500 stock index. Daily bond returns are

constructed from daily yields. Daily government bond price data were not available to

us, so we converted the daily yields into bond prices. (See Appendix A.)

       Table 3 reports average daily returns on announcement days and non-

announcement days during contractions and expansions. Bond returns are on average

higher in contractions than expansions, and stock returns are higher in expansions than in

contractions. In Table 4 we partition the sample further, computing average daily returns

for both Thursday (day before announcement) and Friday (day of announcement), when

the data are sorted into ‚Äúgood news‚Äù and ‚Äúbad news‚Äù unemployment surprises. For

brevity, we only report results with unemployment forecasts made using Method One.

With the finer sort, a near-perfect pattern emerges in the response of stock prices. In

contractions, average stock returns are positive on good news and negative on bad news.

In contrast, during expansions average stock returns are negative on good news and

positive on bad news.     The only exception to this pattern is on Thursdays during

expansions, where stock prices rise (very slightly) during both business cycle phases.

Bond price responses are much smaller than stock price responses, and show no obvious

state-dependency.

   3.    Regression Results: Stock And Bond Price Responses to Unemployment

   News


   The S&P 500

        In this section, we further investigate the response of the S&P 500 stock price

index to unemployment news arrival using the linear model given in equation (2).



        SPRTRN t = b0 + b1 ‚ãÖ Dt ‚ãÖ ERRUMPt + b2 ‚ãÖ (1 ‚àí Dt ) ‚ãÖ ERRUMPt + ut ,            (2)



where SPRTRNt denotes the return on day t on the S&P 500 index ignoring dividends; Dt

denotes the dummy variable that takes on the value one in contractions and zero

otherwise; ERRUMPt denotes the proxy for unemployment news ‚Äì the surprise

component of the unemployment rate announcement, b0 denotes the intercept, b1 and b2

denote slope coefficients, and ut is the error term.4

                 We estimate equation (2) using data for the period January 1962 to

November 1995. Table 5 presents the estimates when the dependent variables are: the

stock index return on the day prior to the announcement day (Thursday), on the

announcement day (Friday) and on Thursday and Friday taken together. For all of the

three event windows, and for all three estimation methods, a consistent pattern emerges.

The coefficients are negative in contractions and positive in expansions, and are usually

statistically significant. Moreover, in all cases the difference between the expansion and

contraction coefficients is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Also in all

cases, the announcement effect is much larger (in absolute value) in contractions than it is

in expansions.
                                                                                          15


           Reaction of Bond Prices to Unemployment News

           We next turn our attention to the bond market response to unemployment news.

The analogue of equation (2) for the bond market is given by equation (2a) below:



                   BRTRN t = b0 + b1 ‚ãÖ Dt ‚ãÖ ERRUMPt + b2 ‚ãÖ (1 ‚àí Dt ) ‚ãÖ ERRUMPt + ut ,   (2a)



where BRTRNt is the return on the bond of interest on date t, and other variables in (2a)

are defined in the previous section.         In the regressions that follow, the dependent

variables are the return on a hypothetical 1-year government bond, the three month T-bill,

and the 10-year government bond. (See appendix A for a discussion of how we

constructed these returns.) Table 6 shows the bond price responses for all event windows,

forecasting methods, and for contractions and expansions. Notice that under all three

estimation methods, unemployment news has no significant effect on bond prices in

contractions. In expansions, it has a positive and significant effect for the one year and

ten year bonds, but not for the three month T-bill. The difference in responses across the

two states is only statistically significant with Method two, and for the one year bond

return.5

           To summarize results, government bond price responses to the unemployment

news arrival look rather different from stock prices; therefore the former cannot ‚Äúexplain‚Äù

the latter. A further implication of these findings is that the unemployment news must be

conveying information about the other two primitive factors ‚Äî growth rate expectations

and the risk premium investors demand to hold stocks. These two factors may affect

stock prices but not bond prices, and therefore account for the differences in their
                                                                                                    16


response to unemployment news. Next, we examine the role of growth expectations and

the equity risk premium in determining how stock prices respond to unemployment news.



Unemployment News, Growth Expectations, and The Equity Risk Premium




            To see how the three primitive factors influence stock prices, it is convenient to

consider the Gordon constant growth model used for security valuation. Let r be the

interest rate on long term risk free claims, P the price of a security or portfolio, D the last

period dividend, g the expected (constant) rate of growth in D, and œÄ the risk premium

investors require to invest in stocks. Then according to the Gordon model,

            P = D(1+g) / (r + œÄ ‚Äì g).

Let u denote the unanticipated surprise in the unemployment rate (ERRUMP), so that

(dP/P)/du represents the percentage change in the price of the security in response to an

unemployment rate surprise. Then from the Gordon Model it follows that,

    (dP/P) / du = - {P/D}{1/(1+g)}√ó{dr/du + dœÄ/du ‚Äì (-1 + D/P)√ódg/du }

                     ‚âà - {P/D}{ dr/du + dœÄ/du ‚Äì dg/du}                                     (3)

    It will be useful to estimate that part of the change in stock prices that is due strictly

to the change in the interest rate factor r, in response to the unemployment news. Letting

Ps denote stock index price and Pb denote bond price, we define that component of stock

price response that is strictly due to a change in the interest rate factor as (dPs/Ps)/duÔ£¶dg =

dœÄ = 0.0.    From inspection of (3) it is clear that (dPs/Ps)/duÔ£¶dg = dœÄ =   0.0   = ‚Äì (Ps/D)*(dr/du).
                                                                                          17


Here Ps/D is the inverse of the dividend yield, which we have calculated on average from

the CRSP tapes (1962 ‚Äì 1995) to be 27.62 in expansions and 21.1 in contractions.

   The results presented in the last section (Table 6) suggest that for bonds (dPb/Pb)/du >

0 during expansions, which of course implies that dr/du < 0. During contractions, on the

other hand, our estimates of (dPb/Pb)/du are never statistically significant and change

signs depending on the estimation method. Thus it seems reasonable to assume that

during contractions, (dPb/Pb)/du ‚âà dr/du ‚âà 0.0.

   We must next estimate dr/du during expansions. To a first order, dr/du = - Duration *

(dPb/Pb)/du. Assuming a duration of 7.4 for the 10 year government bond, and using the

results from Table (6) we obtain dr/du = - .10, - .10, and - .12, respectively, according to

the first, second and third forecasting models, during expansions. Columns 3 and 4 of

Table 7 shows estimates of the effect on stock returns due to interest rates alone,

(dPs/Ps)/duÔ£¶dœÄ   = dg = 0.0,   as well as estimates of the total stock price response to

unemployment news, d(Ps/Ps)/du (from Table 6). There are three separate estimates of

both variables, one for each of the models used to predict the unemployment rate (See

Section 2.). In contractions there is obviously no predicted stock price change due to

news-induced interest rate changes; e.g. (dPs/Ps)/duÔ£¶dœÄ   = dg = 0.0   = 0.0. However, the

estimated total effect of unemployment news on stock prices, (dPs/Ps)/du is negative,

suggesting that either the risk premium œÄ must be rising, the expected future growth rate

g must be falling, or both.

   During economic expansions, on the other hand, the sensitivity of stock returns to

unemployment news due to its effect on the interest rate alone is about 3. However, the

total effect of unemployment news on stock prices is estimated to be about 1. That is, the
                                                                                          18


predicted effect on stock prices through the interest rate factor is much larger than the

actual combined effect of all the three factors. Thus, during expansions, either the equity

risk premium must be rising, growth expectations must be falling, or both. That is a

logical implication of the observed responses of bond prices, stock prices, and the

Gordon Model.

       Column 5 of Table 7 takes this exercise a bit further and solves for the values of

[(-P/D)(dœÄ/du ‚Äì dg/du)] which are implied by the Gordon equation and the estimated

values of the bond and stock price responses to unemployment news. This exercise

provides an answer to the question, ‚ÄúHow large would the combined risk-premium and

growth rate effect have to be, in order to jointly explain the observed responses in stock

and bond prices?‚Äù Obviously, at this stage we cannot separate the effects of dœÄ/du and

dg/du and for convenience we define dœÜ/du = [(-P/D)(dœÄ/du ‚Äì dg/du)].               Separate

estimates of dœÜ/du are provided for expansions and contractions, and for each of the three

forecasting methods. The main feature to note from Column 5 in Table 7 is that all

estimates of dœÜ/du are negative, meaning that a bad unemployment shock causes the risk

premium to increase, growth expectations to decline, or both. They are also much larger

during contractions as during expansions. Suppose unemployment news has no effect on

the equity risk premium -- i.e., dœÄ/du = 0. Then according to the first estimate, dg/du, the

effect of unemployment news on growth expectations, should be 2.4 times as large during

contractions as during expansions; according to the second method, about 2.4 times as

large, and according to the third method about 1.6 times as large.

   These findings ‚Äî based solely on the stock and bond price responses to

unemployment news ‚Äî make predictions for other primitive variables‚Äô news responses.
                                                                                           19


And these are empirically testable.      In the next section we separately examine the

response of the equity risk premium, œÄ, and the dividend growth expectation, g, to

unemployment surprises.



4. The Equity Risk Premium and Growth Expectations: How They Are Affected by

Unemployment News.



   The Equity Risk Premium: Its Response to Unemployment News

   The equity risk premium is not directly observable and therefore we use two different

proxies for it, both of which have been employed elsewhere in the literature. The first

proxy is a measure of stock price volatility. We assume that market participants know

the future volatility of stocks and use the variance of stock returns during the 10 trading

days following the unemployment rate announcement.6 These results are in Table 8,

where we report results with all three estimation methods. As shown there stock price

volatility is about twice as large in contractions as in expansions, but there is no evidence

of a significant relation between unemployment news and volatility in either state of the

economy. To the extent that this stock price volatility measure is a useful proxy for the

equity risk premium, these results suggest that the equity risk premium is not

significantly affected by unemployment news.

   Next, we use the interest rate spread between Baa and Aaa bonds, which reflects

default risk in the bond market, as a proxy for the equity risk premium. The regression

results are again shown in Table 8, where the change in the yield spread, is the dependent

variable and the unemployment surprise is the independent variable.7 The change in the
                                                                                           20


yield spread is significantly larger in contraction months than it is in expansion months.

However, similar to our findings with stock price volatility, the unemployment surprise

has no statistically significant effect on the change in the yield spread. The relationship is

positive, as expected, meaning that positive surprises in the unemployment rate are

associated with increases in the spread. Also, the relationship is several times larger in

contractions than in expansions. However, the effect is not statistically significantly.

   Actually, the results reported in Table 8 are representative of a much large set of tests

we conducted using different proxy measures of the equity risk premium. In no case, did

we find a statistically significant relationship with the unemployment surprise. However,

the equity risk premium is notoriously difficult to measure at high frequencies, and our

results may simply reflect that problem8.



       Growth Expectations: Their Response to Unemployment News

   There is no direct measure of growth expectations. Therefore, we were obliged to

construct indirect measures and we proceeded in two different ways. The first approach

assumed that equity investors are rational agents, who study the data and make good

forecasts. On that basis, we estimated the true relationship between the announced

unemployment rate (the actual rate, not the surprise component) and subsequent dividend

growth, using the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) as a monthly proxy for corporate

dividends.9 The idea was to see if this real sector relationship is significantly different in

contractions than it is in expansions. If that is true, then that fact should be reflected in

the expectations formation of rational investors.

       Since each month the announcement of the IIP is made around the 15th (about one
                                                                                                21


week after the announcement of unemployment rate), we studied the relation between IP in

the ‚Äúsame month‚Äù and one to four months following the reference month of the

unemployment announcement. We estimated the following equation:




                IPGRATEs = a0 + a1DUMPt + a2(1-Dt)UMPt + vt,
                                                                                               (4)




where IPGRATE is the change in the IIP, s is the number of leads before announcement

dates ( s = t , t + 1, t + 2, t + 3, t + 4) and vt is an error term. The results with (4) are shown

in Table 9, employing all three different estimates of the unemployment surprise. The

coefficients a1 , a 2 in (4) are consistently negative in sign for all five forecast horizons,

and most of the coefficients are significantly different from zero. For expansion periods,

however, the coefficients are much smaller than they are during contractions. It is useful

to compare coefficients in contractions and in expansions, dividing the former by the

latter. Going from the ‚Äúsame month‚Äù to four-month-ahead forecasts, this ratio is: 4.1, 7.2,

9.0, 2.7 and 1.35. This suggests that rational equity investors would be revising their

dividend growth forecasts much more strongly in response to the unemployment

surprises in contractions than in expansions. Since it is widely accepted that investors are

rational, good forecasters, this finding is consistent with the predictions from the previous

section.

        Tests With Different Classes of Stocks: Public Utilities and Cyclicals

        As a second test, we examined the unemployment news responses of different

classes of common stocks. For companies whose dividends are relatively independent of

macroeconomic conditions, revisions in their growth expectations should be relatively
                                                                                          22


less important than for the average stock. For this class of stocks we chose a sample of

89 public utility companies.       For companies whose dividends are relatively more

dependent on macroeconomic conditions, revisions in growth expectations should be

relatively more important than for the average stock. To represent such firms, we chose a

sample from cyclical industries, including 24 transportation equipment and machinery

companies, 30 electronic equipment companies and 35 industrial equipment companies.

All firms in these two samples had 34 years of complete daily stock return data over the

period from July 1962 to December 199510.

       Table 10 shows the results with two-day (Thursday-Friday) returns for the two

stock samples and, for purposes of comparison, for the S&P 500 and for the 1-year

government bond. Turning first to the public utilities sample, we see that like bonds, the

utility stocks respond positively and significantly to the unemployment announcement

during expansions, but exhibit no significant relationship during contractions. For the

public utilities, the coefficient in expansions is only about half that for bonds but this

could reflect the fact that there is some growth revision effect for utility stocks.

       For the cyclical stocks, the pattern of signs is the same as that for the S&P 500.

And, like the S&P 500 results, the expansion and contraction coefficients for the cyclical

stocks are different from one another at a high level of statistical significance. The

individual coefficients tend to be less significant for the cyclical stocks than for the S&P

500. This is to be expected since there are fewer stocks in the cyclical stock portfolio

than in the S&P500 with the result that it has more nonsystematic variance.            The

coefficient of the cyclical stocks is always much greater (in absolute value) than that of

the S&P 500. Specifically, it is more than two times larger both in contractions and
                                                                                           23


expansions, for all three forecasting methods. Overall, this is exactly the pattern of

coefficients one would expect, if revisions in growth expectations were greater for the

cyclical stocks than for the S&P 500.

       The price responses of the public utility stocks are also consistent with this story,

assuming that their growth revisions are relatively less important than those of the S&P

500.   The utility price responses look much more like those of bonds, responding

positively to unemployment surprises in expansions and insignificantly during

contractions. Even the fact that the utility stocks exhibit a smaller positive response in

expansions than do bonds is consistent, since this could be due to the fact that the public

utilities experience at least some revision in forecast growth during expansions.



   5. Summary and Conclusions

       We have documented that on average stock prices rise on bad labor market news

   during expansions, and fall during contractions. This pattern cannot be explained

   based solely on how bond prices react to unemployment news. On average, bond

   prices rise on bad unemployment news during expansions, but do not respond

   significantly during contractions.    Stock price responses during contractions are

   therefore unexplained.

       Logically, there are two factors that affect the price of stocks but do not affect the

price of risk-free government bonds. One is the equity risk premium and the other is the

expected future growth rate of dividends on stocks.           Since stock prices respond

differently from bond prices, unemployment news must contain information about these

two factors in addition to information about interest rates. Since we cannot observe the
                                                                                          24


equity risk premium, we used several different proxy measures for it. However, we

found no evidence that any measure of the equity risk premium is affected by

unemployment news.

       Next, we investigated changes in growth expectations. To jointly explain the

documented pattern in stock price and bond price responses, growth expectation revisions

would have to exhibit a particular pattern: specifically, they would have to be much

larger during economic contractions than during economic expansions.             We found

evidence that this is true, based on tests in which unemployment rate announcements

were used to forecast the actual growth rate in the Index of Industrial production, (a

proxy for the growth rate in corporate dividends). On average, rising unemployment is

followed by a much greater reduction in IIP growth during contractions than during

expansions. If shareholders are rational, good forecasters, as is widely believed, their

expectations revisions should reflect the same state-contingent pattern revealed in the real

sector data.

       Then, employing data for public utility and cyclical stocks, we obtained

independent supporting evidence that unemployment news contains relatively more

information about growth expectations during contractions than during expansions. We

found that utilities stocks (whose dividend growth is relatively independent of the state of

the economy) are priced much like bonds.           That is, their price responses to the

unemployment news are largely driven by changes in interest rate expectations. Cyclical

stocks (whose dividend growth is relatively most dependent on the state of the economy)

exhibited price responses with the same pattern as the S&P 500, but with even greater

differences between expansion and contraction phases of the business cycle.
                                                                                            25




       Future Research

       The facts we have reported raise two fundamental questions that are not addressed

in this study. First, ‚ÄúWhy is the response of bond prices to unemployment news so

dependent on the state of the economy?‚Äù And second, ‚ÄúWhy do changes in the rate of

unemployment have a much larger (lagged) effect on real activity during contractions

than during expansions?‚Äù        There is a large literature on state contingencies in

macroeconomic relationships (for example, Hamilton (1989) or Neftci (1984)), but such

issues are beyond the limited scope of this study.

       The facts we have reported also have interesting and potentially important

implications for asset pricing factor models that need to be further investigated, too.

‚ÄúFactor models‚Äù are widely used in security valuation and risk management, and ‚Äúfactor

betas‚Äù, (i.e. the sensitivity of stock price changes to macro-economic news), play a

central role in such models. In several of these models factor betas vary over time in a

systematic and stochastic fashion.11 Hence it is natural to seek an explanation for this

time variation, especially the systematic component of it. Campbell and Mei (1993) have

shown that it is convenient to decompose the information in a given macroeconomic

factor into the three primitive types of news that are relevant for valuing any stock. We

have shown that the amount of the different primitive types of news in an unemployment

rate announcement (which is, itself, a specific macroeconomic factor) depends on the

state of the economy. This would lead the corresponding factor beta of a stock also to

depend on the state of the economy. Clearly then, the sensitivity of stock returns to the

same type of macroeconomic news will change over time too. This is because other
                                                                                             26


things such as the state of the economy are not the same. Whether ‚Äúother things‚Äù can

best be captured in the linear factor model by introducing other factors (such as the past

growth rate in output) ‚Äî or alternatively by modeling the stochastic process governing

time variation in factor sensitivity ‚Äî is an issue for future research.

       In sum, all we claim for this study is that we have provided an explanation of the

odd pattern in stock price responses to unemployment news, during both phases of the

business cycle. This explanation is consistent with many features of the data and, if there

is another such explanation in the literature, we have not seen it.
                                                                                          27



Appendix A: Data

Unemployment rate announcements

         The unemployment rate report along with wage earnings, weekly hours and
employment is the first indicator of economic trends announced in each month. They are
often used to construct other macroeconomic variables such as personal income, industrial
production and productivity, that are announced late in the month.
         We obtained unemployment announcement dates for the period from 1957 to 1995
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These announcements were usually made at 8:30am on
the first Friday of the following month. Fridays were chosen as the usual announcement days
after 1970, and of 306 announcements made after 1970 only 11 were non-Fridays and 295
were Fridays. A distribution of all announcement days in our sample (376), when daily stock
prices were available, is: 10 on Tuesdays, 17 on Wednesdays, 39 on Thursdays and 310 on
Fridays.

The S&P 500 index returns

        Data for the daily S&P 500 Index after July 2, 1962 and for the monthly S&P 500
Index are from CRSP. Data for the daily Index before July 2, 1962 are from G. William
Schwert and Robert Stambaugh. The S&P 500 Index return is constructed from these indices.
Stock prices for the sampled utility stocks and cyclical stocks are from CRSP. To identify
cyclical stocks we searched under three SIC categories as listed in Compustat: 3500-3599 (for
industrial machinery and equipment), 3600-3699 (for electronic and other electric equipment),
3700-3799 (for transportation equipment).

Monthly returns

        Let SPWEDt be the level of the S&P 500 Index on the Wednesday before the
announcement is made for month t. Let SPFRI t be the S&P Index level on the announcement
day. (Both are closing prices.) We define the monthly return after the announcement by:
                                          SPWEDt +1 ‚àí SPFRI t
                            ANMEXTt =                          .
                                               SPFRI t
For instance, if t is April 1978, then the unemployment rate for April 1978 was announced on
May 5, 1978. The unemployment rate for May 1978 was announced on June 2, 1978 (two

Business cycle definitions

        We use the National Bureau of Economic Research‚Äôs (NBER‚Äôs) dating of business
cycles, which is published on their web site. For our sample period, from 1962 to 1995, there
were 351 expansion months and 57 contraction months. Table A.1 provides a summary. The
NBER states that a recession is a recurring period of decline in total output, income,
employment, and trade, usually lasting from six months to a year, and marked by widespread
contractions in many sectors of the economy.

The 3-month T-Bill, 1-year and 10-year Treasury bond with constant maturity

        Data for historical yields on the 3-month T-Bill traded on the secondary market, and 1-
year, 10-year Treasury bond yields with constant maturity are from the Federal Reserve
Board. The daily changes of yields are used to construct the 1-year and 10-year government
bond returns. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond with constant maturity is interpolated
by the U.S. Treasury from the daily yield curve. Such a yield can be found even if there is no
outstanding security that has exactly 10 years remaining to maturity. The returns for the 10-
year government bond are constructed from a duration model.
        Returns for the 3-month T-bill and 1-year government bond are constructed by
converting yields to prices. For the one-year government bond, the following formula for
                                    10,000 ‚àí p 365
the bond equivalent yield: rbey =              √ó      is used. For the 10-year government
                                          p        n
bond, we compute daily returns from daily yield changes, using the approximate relation
                                                dp          dy
between the change in yield and the price:         = ‚àíD ‚ãÖ        . The duration of the 10-year

government bond is assumed to be 7.4. For the 3-month T-bill, we convert quoted yields
                                                    10,000 ‚àí p 360

Appendix B: Forecasting unemployment rates

         To get the surprise component in the announcement of unemployment rate, we
required forecasts of the change in the unemployment rate. The variables used to forecast
unemployment rates include the growth rate of industrial production, the past unemployment
rate, inflation, stock and bond returns. We found that past changes of the unemployment rate,
the growth rate of industrial production, and bond market variables are good predictors of
unemployment rates. However, the inflation rate and stock market returns are not. We
followed the Box and Jenkins (1976) method, and used the SAS ARIMA procedure to pick
the best ARMAX model. The criteria include the AIC (Akaike‚Äôs Information Criterion), SBC
(Schwarz‚Äôs Bayesian Criterion), and the t-statistics for those coefficient estimates.
Specifically, we looked for a model that had the lowest AIC and SBC values, with all
regression coefficients being statistically significant. The final model we used to forecast the
unemployment rate is presented in the paper. The estimation method is simple OLS.
         To obtain the forecasts, we first estimated coefficients month by month as more
observations were added (Our forecasts started in 1962.01 using the first 60 months of data).
The monthly forecasts of the change in the unemployment rate (called DUMPFt ) are the
fitted values of DUMPt in the above model.

     * Means and Standard errors for the means (in paraenthesis) are reported. ‚Äù*‚Äù denotes significance at the 5% level. DUMP is the change of unemployment rate. DUMPF is
     the predicted value for the change of unemployment rate. ERRUMP is the unanticipated component of unemployment rate, i.e., DUMP ‚Äì DUMPF.

     ** In this table and in many of the tables that follow, the unemployment rate surprise is estimated in three different ways (which are discussed in more detail in the main
     body of the draft.) With ‚ÄúMethod One‚Äù, final release data are employed for both the Index of Industrial Production and the unemployment rate announcement for the
     purposes of estimating the equation used to predict unemployment. This equation also contains a dummy variable for the state of the economy so that, in effect, these
     estimates are state-dependent. With ‚ÄúMethod 2‚Äù, the data are exactly the same as with method one, but the state-of-the-economy dummy variable is omitted. With ‚ÄúMethod
     3‚Äù, no state dummy variable is included in the estimation and different data are employed. The forecasting equation uses only final release data which were, as of the
     announcement date, at least one year old. This forecast of the unemployement rate is then combined with the current period preliminary unemployment rate release to
     compute the surprise component. As discussed in the draft of the paper, the first two estimates are probably ‚Äútoo good‚Äù in the sense that actual forecasters could not have
     done as well in historical real time. The third estimating is clearly ‚Äútoo bad‚Äù in the sense that historical forecasts could have made more precise forecasts employing only
     those data which were available. As will become clear, choice of the forecasting method has limitated quantative effect on our results and no qualitative effect on our
     conclusions.

1.   The authors benefited from comments from workshop participants at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Federal
     Reserve Bank of Atlanta, McGill University, University of Akron, University of Vienna, and Frank Diebolt, Wayne
     Ferson, Narayana Kockerlakota, and Ross Levine. We particularly benefited from discussions with Gordon Alexander.
2.   For example, on December 6, 1974, the Labor Department released substantial bad news: the unemployment rate had
     risen from 6.0% to 6.6%. Around the announcement, the S&P 500 index declined by about 3.6 percent. However, it is
     just as easy to find cases in which the stock market rose sharply in response to bad unemployment news. On August 3,
     1984, the Labor Department announced that the unemployment rate had increased from 7.2% to 7.5%, and around that
     announcement the S&P 500 index gained 5.4 percent. It is no coincidence that the first case occurred during a
     contraction and the second during an expansion.
3.   Regression model 1. can be expanded to include Friday and day of the week dummy variables to account for the fact that
     announcements were not always made on Fridays. We chose not to report these results since inclusion of these variables
     did not affect our results in any substantial way.
4.   Note that unemployment news is not observed. Hence we use a forecasting model to construct a proxy for it. The use of
     a proxy gives rise to the well known ‚Äúerrors in variables‚Äù problem, meaning that the estimated slope coefficients will be
     biased towards zero. The classical solution for the errors in variables problem is to use an instrumental variable that is
     correlated with the proxy but uncorrelated with that part of the stock index return that is orthogonal to the proxy. We
     have not been able to identify such an instrument and thus this bias is to some degree present in our estimates.
5.   We did, however, find structural changes in the reactions of short-term interest rates. When the data are partitioned into
     sub-periods, the reaction to unemployment news was not significant before 1979, but was significant after 1983. We
     chose 79 and 83 as break points because according to the common view the 79‚Äì82 period was rather unusual. For
     brevity, these results are not presented
6.   The nature of the relation between volatility and the risk premium is still subject to debate. While French, Schwert and
     Stambaugh (1987) and Campbell and Hentschel (1992) find a positive relation, Glosten, Jagannathan and Runkle (1993)
     find a negative relation. Backus and Gregory (1993) show that a negative and time varying relation between expected
     return and volatility is not necessarily inconsistent and rational expectations. Whitelaw (1999) convincingly argues that
     such a relation, in addition, is also consistent with aggregate consumption data in a representative agent framework.
     Since we want to examine the hypothesis that unemployment news and the equity premium are unrelated, the sign of the
     correlation between the equity premium and future volatility does not matter, as long as the correlation is not zero.
7.   Because of the long time-series we are employing these interest rate spread data were only available to us on a monthly
     basis. Thus, DBA is actually the change in the monthly spread over the full month of the announcement date. Since the
     announcement is the first Friday of each month, this means that about one fourth of the days included in the spread
     computation occurred before the announcement date and three quarters after it. If anything, this measurement problem
     could bias our results towards insignificance.
8.   We also investigated two other proxies for the equity risk premium. One was the bond default risk premium constructed
     by Ibbotson and Associates and the other was a commercial paper yield spread: the three month commercial paper rate
     minus the three month Treasury Bill rate. Neither of these two proxy measures was significantly associated with the
     unemployment surprise variable at usual confidence levels.
9.   The correlation between the annual rate of growth in dividends and the IIP is only.247. However, it is well known that
     dividend payments are intentionally smoothed, even at annual frequencies. The correlation between quarterly earnings
     growth and IIP growth is a more respectable .464. Unfortunately, we know of no better proxy variable for dividends
     which is observable at monthly intervals.
10. This selection procedure undoubtedly introduces a ‚Äúsurvivor bias‚Äù in the samples, but there is no obvious harm in that for
    present purposes.
11. For example, Bollerslev, Engle and Woodridge (1988), Ferson and Harvey (1991, 1993, 1999) and Ferson and
    Korajczyk (1993) empirically examine linear beta pricing models where the betas are allowed to vary over time.
    Jagannathan and Wang (1996) and Harvey (1999) follow Chen, Roll and Ross (1986) and use macroeconomic variables
    as factors, but allow factor betas to vary over time. Cochrane (2000) shows how time varying beta models can be
    examined using the stochastic discount factor approach.
