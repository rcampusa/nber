Is Peer Review in Decline?

                                             ABSTRACT

Over the past decade there has been a decline in the fraction of papers in top economics journals written
by economists from the highest-ranked economics departments. This paper documents this fact and
uses additional data on publications and citations to assess various potential explanations. Several
observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the Internet improves the ability of high-profile
authors to disseminate their research without going through the traditional peer-review process.

1     Introduction

For the past half-century or more peer-reviewed journals have played a central role in the
evaluation and dissemination of scientific research. The Internet has enhanced scientific
communication in many ways, and there is considerable excitement around new institutions
for disseminating research.1 A more sobering thought, however, is that new technologies
can also be disruptive.
    This paper begins with some documentation of recent trends in economics publish-
ing. Roughly, the trends involve economists from top-ranked departments publishing fewer
papers in many top journals. This could be a welcome change, but is also potentially trou-
blesome: one way in which the Internet could be disruptive is that it could allow high-profile
researchers to disseminate their work without subjecting it to peer review, which in turn
could lead to a broader unraveling of the peer-review system. The majority of the paper is
then devoted to analyses of several additional data sources with the goal of understanding
better what may be causing the observed trends.
    The facts part of this paper documents two main facts:

    1. Economists in top-ranked departments now publish very few papers in top field jour-
      nals. There is a marked decline in such publications between the early 1990’s and
      early 2000’s.

    2. Comparing the early 2000’s with the early 1990’s, there is a decline in both the
      absolute number of papers and the share of papers in the top general-interest journals
      written by Harvard economics department faculty.

Although the second fact just concerns one department, I see it as potentially important
to understanding what is happening because it comes at a time when Harvard is widely
regarded (I believe correctly) as having ascended to the top position in the profession.
    The “decline of peer review” theory I allude to in the title is that the necessity of going
through the peer-review process has lessened for high status authors: in the old days peer-
    1
      Among the new institutions in the economics profession are the working paper archives like RePEc
and SSRN, new electronic-only journals like Economics Bulletin, Theoretical Economics, and the BEPress
journals, and NAJ Economics, which aims to provide peer review without publication. Economics is also
influenced by general tools, including Google Scholar. Electronic archives have achieved greater success in
several other disciplines.


                                                    1
reviewed journals were by far the most effective means of reaching readers, whereas with
the growth of the Internet high-status authors can now post papers online and exploit their
reputation to attract readers.
      Many alternate explanations are possible. I focus on four theories: the decline-in-peer-
review theory and three alternatives.

  1. The trends could be a consequence of top-school authors’ being crowded out of the
        top journals by other researchers. Several such stories have an optimistic message, e.g.
        there is more talent entering the profession, old pro-elite biases are being broken down,
        more schools are encouraging faculty to do cutting-edge research, and the Internet
        is enabling more cutting-edge research by breaking down informational barriers that
        had hampered researchers outside the top schools.2

  2. The trends could be a consequence of the growth of revisions at economics journals
        discussed in Ellison (2002a, 2002b). In this more pessimistic theory highly productive
        researchers must abandon some projects and/or seek out faster outlets to conserve
        the time now required to publish their most important works.

  3. The trends could simply reflect that field journals have declined in quality and have
        become a less attractive place to publish.

      The majority of this paper is devoted to examining various data sources that provide
additional details about how economics publishing has changed over the past decade. These
are intended both to sharpen understanding of the facts to be explained and to provide tests
of auxiliary predictions of the theories. Two main sources of information are used: data on
publications and data on citations. The publication data include department-level counts
of publications in various additional journals, an individual-level dataset containing records
of publications in a subset of journals for thousands of economists, and a very small dataset
containing complete data on a few authors’ publication records. The citation data include
citations at the paper level for 9000 published papers and less well matched data that is
used to construct measures of citations to authors’ unpublished works, to departments as
a whole, and to various journals.
  2
      Kim, Morse and Zingales (2006) argue for the latter hypothesis and provide empirical evidence.


                                                     2
      The analysis part of the paper contains numerous small analyses of these auxiliary data
sources. Each is designed to provide information relevant to one or more of the theories.
I hope that readers will also find some of them to be of independent interest. Among the
interesting observations from the publication data are that the facts appear to pertain to
economists in top departments, rather than reflecting general trends among top economists,
and that economists in top departments continue to publish at a high rate in many other
outlets. The citation analyses provide some evidence that economists in top departments
are less reliant on journals for the dissemination of their work: Harvard economists are
garnering a large number of citations to their unpublished research; and the citation benefit
of publishing in top general interest journals appears to be small for members of several
top departments.
      Keeping track of the various facts and which ones favor which theories is difficult. I
provide a summary table and refer to it repeatedly in Sections 4 and 5 to help with this,
but the nature of the paper makes it a bit unwieldy. No one theory fits all the facts. The
decline-in-peer-review theory appears to do relatively well. There are also multiple sources
of support for the slowdown theory.
      This paper belongs to a growing literature on publication processes and academic pro-
ductivity.3 Ellison (2002a) develops a theoretical model of the peer review process in which
quality standards are endogenously determined. McCabe and Snyder (2005) develop a
model of journals as certification intermediaries. Ellison (2002b) documents the increased
time costs of going through the peer-review process and notes several other trends. Azar
(2007) discusses incentive effects of these time costs. Kim, Morse, and Zingales (2006) exam-
ine whether being in a top economics department provides a productivity benefit reflected
in increased published output in good journals. It develops an extensive database and ex-
ploits the movement of faculty across universities to estimate a model with individual- and
department-decade fixed effects and finds that the productivity benefit of being in a top
department declined from the 1970’s to the 1990’s and was gone by the latter decade. Oyer
(2006) is related: it uses initial-year job-market tightness as an instrument for obtaining
an intial placement in a top department and finds that there is a causal effect of better
initial placement on published output (and on long-term placement). It does not explic-

      Colander (1989) and Gans (2000) contain nice surveys of the literature at different points in time.

itly consider changes over time, but can be regarded as obtaining a somewhat contrasting
conclusion because its sample is largely from the 1990’s.
    The citation analysis presented here is related to the literature on the determinants of
citations to academic research. Some of the noteworthy papers on the economics discipline
are Stigler and Friedland (1975), Laband (1986), and Laband and Tollison (2000).
    The basic facts about the two trends are presented in Section 2. Section 3 discusses
potential explanations for the facts. Section 4 contains additional analyses of publication
records. Section 5 contains the citation analyses. I review the various findings and attempt
to bring them together in Section 6. I conclude that the decline-of-peer-review theory is
probably the most important and that the growth-of-revisions theory probably also plays
some role.


2     Two Facts

In this section I document the two facts highlighted in the introduction.
    The primary data used in this section are counts of publications in eighteen economics
journals by the faculty of ten economics departments.4 The departments are the top ten
in one particular published ranking. They are listed in Table 1 in the order of their NRC
rating and I will also use the NRC ratings at times to separate them into “top 5” and
“6-10” groups.5 The journal set includes five general interest journals and thirteen field
journals. When I discuss “recent trends” in publishing, I am refering to differences between
the contents of journals in 2000-2003 and the contents of the same journals in 1990-1993.
Except where otherwise noted, publication counts in this paper assign each author partial
credit for coauthored papers, e.g. a three-authored paper with one author who is a faculty
   4
     The publication counts I present are always for regular faculty in the economics departments at these
universities. They do not include publications by graduate students or visitors to these departments, nor
publications by faculty members whose primary affiliation is in some unit other than the economics depart-
ment. Due to limitations in Econlit the data do not include the identity or affiliation for all authors other
than the first when papers have four or more authors.
   5
     The ranking used to choose the ten schools was not the NRC’s, so my 6-10 group will not necessarily
coincide with the NRC’s. Many departments appear in the top five and top ten of different rankings.
My choice of which schools to collect data for was somewhat arbitrary. To reduce the risk of offending
anyone who thinks that their department should have been included, I have chosen to withold the identity
of one department, which I label School Z. The choice of which schools to place in the top five is less
consequential. I’ll present department-by-department breakdowns in several tables, and find that the main
results are robust to alternate definitions of the “top five”.

member at Princeton will count as one-third of a paper by Princeton.

2.1      Field journal publications

In this section I discuss Fact 1:

         Fact 1 Comparing the early 2000’s with the early 1990’s, there is a decline in
         the share of papers in the top field journals (and the absolute number) written
         by faculty members from the top five economics departments. Economists in
         these departments now publish in top field journals at a rate of about 1 paper
         per faculty member per decade.

       Table 1 presents counts of publications in thirteen field journals.6 The set of journals
was chosen to include the most widely-cited field journals and to include at least one journal
from most of the major fields of economics. The list of journals can be found in the table.
The left columns present counts of 1990-1993 publications, and the right columns present
2000-2003 publications.
       The “decline” part of Fact 1 comes through clearly in the top row of the table. It
indicates that members of the top five economics departments published 86.4 papers in
these journals in 1990-1993 and 71.2 papers in 2000-2003, an 18% decrease.7 Moreover,
this decline in publication counts came during a period when many of the journals were
substantially increasing the number of papers they published. If one looks at the share of
papers by top five departments, the decline is more dramatic: the 2.7% share in 2000-2003
is about one-third less than the 4.0% share of 1990-1993.
       The “levels” part of Fact 1 is perhaps even more striking. The total of 71.2 papers
by five departments over a four year period is about 3.5 papers per department per year.
These departments have about 40 faculty members on average, so this is a publication rate
of less than one paper per faculty member per decade.
       The breakdown for top-five departments shows that the pattern is fairly consistent
across departments within the top five. All top five schools show a decline in field jour-
   6
     The counts omit papers in special issues of the journals and papers that are three or fewer pages in
length.
   7
     Coauthorship rates have increased over the period. Despite this, an unweighted count that gives each
author full credit for a paper still shows a decline: unweighted counts are 136 in 1990-1993 and 126 in
2000-2003.

nal publications in the share measure. All but MIT are below the one-paper-per-faculty-
member-per-decade output rate. The journal-by-journal breakdown for the top five schools
shows that publications are down fairly consistently. The top five share has declined by
more than 50% at five journals. Only two journals, Journal of Finance and Journal of
Public Economics, have an increase in the top-five share.
       The data on the other top ten departments and the journal-by-journal breakdown indi-
cate that the pattern is somewhat broader than just what is noted in Fact 1. Publications
by Yale and Berkeley, which are top-five departments in some rankings, are also down in
both the count and share measures.
       The pattern at the other three departments – Pennsylvania, Northwestern, and School
Z – is different, but in a way that is not as different as it first appears. The data on aggregate
publications in the 13 field journals shows that these departments are not reducing their
publications and that they now publish more papers in the top field journals than do most
of the top five schools. If one looks further into the journal-by-journal detail, however, one
finds a common pattern. The departments have increased their publication counts at three
of the more theory-oriented (and more widely cited) field journals – Games and Economic
Behavior, Journal of Economic Theory, and Journal of Monetary Economics – and reduced
publications at the others.
       I would summarize the additional data as indicating that the decline in field journal
publications extends to a broadly-defined top five and may extend even further if one omits
the more theory-oriented field journals.

2.2      Top general interest journal publications

In this section I discuss Fact 2:

         Fact 2 Comparing the early 2000’s with the early 1990’s, there is a decline
         in the number of papers in the top general-interest journals written by faculty
         members from the Harvard economics department.

       Table 2 presents publication counts for the “top five” general-interest journals.8 The
first row of Table 2 looks very different from the first row of Table 1. One big difference
   8
    The counts omit special articles like presidential addresses and also omit all papers in the Papers and
Proceedings issues of the American Economic Review.


                                                    7
is that there is no substantial decline in publications by the top five departments. The
total number of papers published by these journals has declined, so the top-five share has
actually increased from 13.4% to 14.4%. A second striking difference is that the counts and
shares in Table 2 are much larger than in Table 1. The top-five departments publish more
than twice as many papers in the five general-interest journals as they do in the thirteen
field journals. Their share is more than five times as large in the general-interest journals.

Table 2: Publications by members of six highly-ranked departments in five top general-
interest journals

        Fact 2 is apparent in the department-by-department breakdown. In the early 1990’s
Harvard and Princeton were well ahead of the other departments. Between the early 1990’s
and the early 2000’s, Harvard’s top general-interest publications had declined by about
one-third (or by 28% if one uses the share measures).9
        Publication counts are roughly constant at most of the other top-five departments. All
of them have at least a small increase in the share measure. Stanford shows a large increase
from a low initial level. Again, these conclusions are fairly robust to how one defines the
top five: Berkeley and Yale also have roughly constant general-interest publication counts.
Despite the decline, Harvard remains ahead of all departments other than Princeton and
MIT.
        Harvard’s journal-by-journal breakdown is distinctive. Publications in Econometrica,
Journal of Political Economy, and Review of Economic Studies are down by more than 50%.
Publications in the Quarterly Journal of Economics have stayed roughly constant. They
now account for more than 45% of Harvard’s top general interest publications. Harvard
would rank ninth among the ten schools if one omitted QJE publications from the counts.


3        Potential Explanations

In the introduction I mentioned four theories that one might give to account for the two
facts. In this section I describe each mechanism in a little more detail and comment on
how it comports with the facts described above.

3.1       Decline in the Importance of Peer Review

Journals serve two roles: they disseminate papers and provide quality certification. The
Internet aids dissemination in many ways: papers are posted to authors’ websites and
working paper archives; e-mail is used to inform potential readers about papers; Internet
search tools help readers find papers; journals have been made more accessible; and so on.
Many of these are substitutes for traditional journal dissemination, so the primary role
of journals may increasingly be to provide quality certification.10 A shift in the role of
    9
     Counts giving full credit for papers whether coauthored or not give a similar picture. Harvard’s un-
weighted publication count declines from 86 to 56. The other top five departments increase from 184 to
222.
  10
     Azar (2007) reports that working papers grew from 3% of the citations in the AER and Econometrica
in 1960 to 14% in 2002. Given that the majority of citations are now to papers that are more than ten years


                                                    9
journals could lead authors from top schools to withdraw from publishing in many journals
for two reasons. First, highly-regarded and highly-visible authors will be able to make
their work widely known (and widely read) without publishing it in journals. Such authors
receive diminished dissemination benefits from journal publication. Second, highly-regarded
authors may traditionally have been publishing in journals mostly for the dissemination
benefits. Consider questions of the form:

      Which do you think is of higher quality: a paper by Author X that just
      appeared in Journal Y or the same author’s most recent working paper that
      has yet to be submitted for publication?

If the answer to this question is not clear, then Journal Y is providing little in the way
of quality certification benefits to Author X.
    This story can naturally fit each of the main facts described in the previous section. For
many faculty in top departments, the fact that a paper is published in a top field journal
will only have a small impact on potential readers’ beliefs about the paper’s quality and
will only provide minimal career-concerns benefits. Hence, a decline in the dissemination
role should lead to a decrease in field journal publications. My impression is that even the
most highly regarded economists in the profession still receive a reputational benefit (which
helps both with disseminating the particular paper and for career-concerns reasons) from
publishing in the top general interest journals. However, even in this case, certification
benefits are likely smaller for high-status authors and the dissemination benefits may be
smaller for authors who can make their work widely known without publishing it in a top
journal. The decline in Harvard’s general-interest publication could reflect that it has a
disproportionate number of very-high-status economists and that its faculty are uniquely
visible.

3.2    Top Department Quality/Productivity

The share of papers in top journals written by faculty in a given department is a measure
of the output of that department relative to the profession as a whole. Hence, our facts
could be explained as a consequence of a relative decline of the departments considered.
Several plausible mechanisms could account for such a decline.
old, working papers account for a substantial fraction of the citations to recent works.


                                                     10
   First, the traditionally top-ranked departments may have been less successful in attract-
ing and retaining the most productive economists. This could be due to relative increases
in salaries and working conditions at economics departments at various competing employ-
ers: other top economics departments, business schools, and at institutions (e.g. foreign
schools) that are attractive to particular faculty members. Anecdotally, I know that MIT
has seen a large share of its top new Ph.D’s take jobs in business schools over the last
decade and has lost several faculty to and failed to entice many more faculty away from
other departments.
   Second, the top-ranked departments could have been as successful as ever in assembling
the most productive economists, but still had their share of output decline because of
changes in the productivity distribution. For example, this would be the case if the number
of economists trying to publish in top journals has increased or if there is a flattening of
the productivity distribution.
   Third, the top-ranked departments could be as strong as ever in their productivity
share, but still see a decline in their output share because of changes in the distribution
of resources. For example, Kim, Morse and Zingales (2006) argue that improvements in
communication technology have reduced barriers that made it more difficult for faculty
outside the top schools to do cutting-edge research. Another potential source of resource
reallocation is increased attention paid, for example, by the United Kingdom, to top-journal
publications. This might increase resources allocated to producing top-journal publications
either via direct shifts in resource allocations, or indirectly as faculty increase the share of
their effort devoted to publishing in top journals.
   These stories are all plausible, but I regard the decline-in-top-department-quality theory
as not fitting the facts outlined in the previous section as neatly as the other theories. In
particular it does not seem so natural that a decline in top department quality would reduce
field journal publications but not top general-interest publications. One could hypothesize
that economists at the top five departments have reacted to increased competition by
concentrating more on general interest publications or that barriers to doing field journal
work have come down more than barriers to doing general interest work, but it is not obvious
why these should be true. The theory also seems hard to reconcile with the Harvard’s
decline in top general interest publications. Harvard hired a large number of highly regarded

                                              11
and highly productive faculty between 1993 and 2001 and is commonly perceived to have
ascended to the top position in the profession during this period.11

3.3      The Slowdown

The title of Ellison (2002b) emphasizes the “slowdown” of the publication process. An
important observation of that paper, however, is that publication does not simply take
longer in calendar time – the process also requires more effort from authors. The slowdown
continued through the 1990’s at both general interest and field journals. Hence, it is poten-
tially relevant to why behavior might have changed between the early 1990’s and the early
2000’s.12
       The increased burdens of publishing in top journals should affect economists’ submission
strategies for two reasons analogous to the substitution and income effects of consumer
theory. First, economists would be expected to substitute away from journals at which the
process became more time consuming and/or more arduous toward outlets where this did
not occur. Second, aggregate time constraints may lead economists to publish fewer papers
in peer-reviewed outlets. The papers they choose not to publish (or not to write) would
presumably be those for which the benefit to publication (per unit time required) is low.
       Table 1 of Ellison (2002a) indicates that the 1990’s slowdown was most severe at the
top general interest journals (other than the QJE). Mean submit-accept times at the top
non-QJE general interest journals increased from 17.5 months in 1990 to 24.1 months in
1999.13 The QJE’s mean submit-accept time was reduced from 22 months to 13 months.
Mean submit-accept times at the seven top field journals for which data is available show
a smaller increase: from 14.8 months in 1990 to 16.4 months in 1999.
       The publication counts for the top general-interest journals are consistent with the
hypothesis that the slowdown is an important determinant of the observed changes. There
is a shift in publications away from the other general interest journals toward the QJE.
The decline in field journal publications relative to general interest publications could be
attributed to the income effect. Economists at top schools publish a nontrivial fraction of
  11
     Harvard’s hires in this period include Philippe Aghion, John Campbell, Drew Fudenberg, Oliver Hart,
Elhanan Helpman, Michael Kremer, Ariel Pakes, Ken Rogoff, Jim Stock, and Jeremy Stein.
  12
     Azar (2005, 2007) points out first responses have also slowed and first-response times should have a
substantial impact on submission decisions because most initial submissions are rejected.
  13
     These are unweighted means across journals.


                                                   12
their papers in top general interest journals, so it is plausible that increases in the time-
cost of publishing in general interest journals could lead them to spend less time trying
to publish papers in field journals. The decline of Harvard’s general interest publications
is a little harder to fit into this theory. The direction of the change makes sense, but it
is harder to argue that the slowdown alone should result in Harvard dropping below some
other departments in general interest publications.

3.4      Field Journal Quality

Journals provide two main benefits to authors: they disseminate research, and they provide
a quality certification that can bolster the author’s reputation. Each benefit will be reduced
if the average quality of papers in a journal declines.
      It is plausible that field journals suffered a relative decrease in quality over the period
studied for a few reasons. First, Ellison (2002b) notes that citations to articles in field
journals did not grow as rapidly as citations to articles in general interest journals. Recent
articles in nine top field journals received only 30% as many citations as articles in the top
general-interest journals in 1998, down from 52% in 1990. Second, many top journals are
for-profit operations that have raised prices substantially in recent years. This has reduced
their availablility and led to discontent that may be affecting submissions.14
      The decline-in-field-journal-quality hypothesis fits well with the observation that most
top departments are reducing publications in field journals but not in the general interest
journals. A separate explanation would be needed to account for the reduction in Harvard’s
general interest publications.

3.5      Summary

Throughout this paper I’ll try to organize my discussion of the coherence between the vari-
ous theories and the evidence by referring to Table 3. Each column of the table corresponds
to one of the theories discussed in this section. The rows corresponds to the various pieces
of evidence considered. The first row is concerned with Facts 1 and 2. Here, my summary
is that each of the theories could explain the facts, but that the decline-in-top-department-
quality is somewhat problematic.

    The remaining rows of the table summarize the coherence between the theories and the
various data items presented in sections 4 and 5. I will refer back to this table and discuss
these summaries at the end of each subsection.


4     More Publication Data

In this section I present additional publication counts. They provide a more detailed view
of the changes that have occurred and bear on which theories might be most important.

4.1     Departmental publication counts
4.1.1    Journal-specific declines and the slowdown

If top authors are withdrawing from publishing in top journals due to the slowdown of
the publication process, then one would expect that there would be a greater decrease in
top-school publications at journals that have experienced more severe slowdowns. Figure 1
shows how these variables are related across journals: the difference between the journal’s
1999 and 1990 submit-accept time (in months) is on the x-axis and the change in the share
of papers by authors in the top five economics departments is on the y-axis.15
    The top general interest journals are marked by solid boxes. The QJE obviously stands

BE Press’s macroeconomics and theory journals may be a tangible consequence of this discontent.
  15
     The submit-accept time data is from Table 1 of Ellison (2002a). In three cases (JIntE, JLE, and JF)
data on 1990 are missing in Ellison (2002a) and the graph instead uses one half of the 1980-1999 difference
as the x variable.




                                                    14
out in both dimensions: it has sped up rather than slowing down; and the share of papers
by authors at the top five departments has increased dramatically. The two general interest
journals that lost top-department authors, Econometrica and Review of Economic Studies,
do not stand out in the figures for having slowed down more than the others during the
1990’s. It may be relevant, however, that they are the two slowest journals in 1999.

Figure 1: Cross-journal heterogeneity: Change in top school publications (early 90’s-early
00’s) vs. Change in review times (1990-1999)

                    The field journals are marked by outlined boxes. Journal of Public Economics and
Journal of Urban Economics have sped up over the course of the 1990’s (and were the two
fastest journals in 1999). Neither shows a decline in its top-school share. Six field journals
slowed down by more than three months, and five of the six show substantial declines in
their top-school shares. The Journal of Finance is an exception to this pattern.
                    Overall, I would conclude that the cross-journal pattern appears to be consistent with
the slowdown being a factor contributing to the observed declines in top-school publications.

                        Table 4: Publication counts for “invited” journals


4.1.2      Publication counts for other outlets

Table 4 presents publication counts for six widely-read journals that publish many invited
papers and/or have review processes that are less burdensome than those at standard jour-
nals. Top-school shares are quite large for all of these journals. The NBER Macroeconomics
Annual’s top-five share is larger than the QJE’s. The other journals’ top-five shares are
comparable to or larger than those of the top general interest journals. They are much
larger than the top-five shares of the field journals we discussed in Section 2. Looking
across decades within each journal, there is a large decline in the number and share of
Brookings Papers by economists in top departments.16 Beyond this, however, the general
pattern appears to be that publication counts are rougly constant across the decades. Har-
vard’s publication counts would not stand out if I had given a department-by-department
breakdown: they are slightly above the average of the other top-five departments at each
journal; and are roughly constant across decades (apart from a decline at Brookings Papers).
       Twelve of the thirteen field journals discussed earlier published at least one special issue
  16
    The large decline in the number of published articles in part reflects the discontinuance of the journal’s
microeconomics series.

       Table 5: Publication counts for special issues of field journals and invited journals


between 2000 and 2003.17 Most often, these issues are a collection of papers presented at
a conference. The review process usually differs from the procedure for regular issues:
authors are often contacted personally and invited to submit papers; and the review and
revision process must fit within a tighter time frame. Invariably, journals state that papers
in special issues were peer-reviewed and subject to the same standards that the journal
applies to all papers. Whether standards are really the same is subject to debate.
       Table 5 reports counts of “special” articles in the thirteen field journals. The first row
gives counts for the top five deparments and the second row for departments 6–10. The
primary observation I would emphasize is that special issues of field journals do not look
like regular issues of field journal issues: the top-department share is approximately three
times as large, and there is no substantial decline in top-five publications across decades.
Harvard’s publication counts again would not stand out in a department-by-department
breakdown: Harvard published 6 articles in field-journal special issues in 1990-1993 and 8.1
in 2000-2003.
       I see the data in this subsection as problematic for the decline-in-top-department-quality
theory in a couple ways: economists in top departments appear to be as strong as ever in
their ability to garner slots in invited journals and special issues of field journals; and
there is nothing to suggest that that Harvard’s decline in general-interest publications is
due to its having a more severe dropoff in productivity. The data seem supportive of the
slowdown theory in that we are seeing economists from top departments publishing as
they always have in outlets that have not been subject to the slowdown. The data are also
somewhat at odds with the decline-in-field-journal-quality story in that there is no evidence
  17
    This includes cases where a journal publishes a set of “special” papers and some regular papers in the
same issue. To maintian consistency across time the Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series is treated as a
separate journal throughout the period and not counted as part of the Journal of Monetary Economics.




                                                   17
that economists who have the opportunity to publish in special issues are dissuaded by a
reduction in dissemination and prestige benefits.

4.1.3   Business school publication counts

One reason that could be given for why top economics departments may have declined
relative to the profession as a whole is that more top economists may now be working in
business schools. To provide some evidence on this I collected publication counts like those
in Section 2 for three top business schools: Chicago, Northwestern-Kellogg, and Stanford.
Although these schools publish a large number of top-journal papers, the data do not
support the hypothesis that economists in business schools might be increasingly crowding
economists from economics departments out of the top journals.
   Table 6 presents the data. The Chicago GSB had a very high general-interest publication
count in 2000-2003, but the aggregate count for the three business schools was higher in the
earlier period. Although Kellogg and Chicago both have more field journal publications in
2000-2003 than any of the economics departments studied, again, the aggregate count for
2000-2003 is less than the same figure for 1990-1993. I conclude that these business schools
do not appear to be a source of increasing competition.

                                        1990-1993              2000-2003

                Table 6: Publications by faculty of three business schools

   In Table 3 I summarize the evidence from this section by putting – signs in the top-
department-quality and field-journal-quality columns and a + sign in the slowdown column.
The – for top department quality reflects both the business school evidence and the fact

                                            18
that top departments are not publishing fewer papers in invited journals and special issues
of field journals. The – for field journal quality also reflects top department economists’
willingness to publish in special issues of field journals. The + in the slowdown column
reflects the (albeit weak) support provided by the scatter plot of changes in top-department
shares versus changes in the length of the review process.

4.2       Author CV data

An obvious question to ask about the decline in top-journal publications is where the papers
are going: Are economists in top departments publishing fewer papers? Are they publishing
more in other outlets? If so, where are they publishing? Answering such questions is
difficult, however. Complete publication lists can only be obtained by gathering CVs, and
even then it can be hard to classify publications in nonstandard outlets.
       For this paper, I present a smaller analysis of the setting that I thought would potentially
be most informative. I collected CVs for Harvard faculty members who were both (a)
tenured and (b) less than forty years old in the fall of 1993 and the fall of 2003. Harvard is
a leader in withdrawing from top journals, and this design also lets me make comparisons
for which age/experience differences will not be a potential confounding factor.
       Table 7 summarizes the publication records. Each row gives publication counts for a
four-year period for a single economist. The top part contains 1990-1993 counts for the
1993 young senior faculty. The bottom part gives 2000-2003 counts for 2003 faculty. The
second column gives a simple publication count not adjusted for coauthorship. The other
columns show the location of the publications and, as in the rest of this paper, give partial
credit for coauthored papers.
       The counts in the second column indicate that there has not been a decline in total
number of publications.18 Young senior faculty at Harvard are still publishing an astounding
number of papers! The third and fourth columns count QJE and other top general-interest
publications. The aggregate decline in non-QJE general interest publications indicates that
the decline in general interest publications I discussed in Fact 2 is present even in this
remarkably productive group of economists.
  18
     This is defined roughly as all items on the authors’ vitae that are not very short (< 4 pages), comment-
like, or published in the popular press (or other outlets that do not publish academic research). The 2003
group is also well ahead in coauthorship-adjusted publications.

                    Table 7: Publications by young senior faculty at Harvard


       The fifth column shows that there is also a large decline in top field journal publications
in this analysis of groups at comparable career stages. A natural question is whether this is
simply due to the new generation’s having shifted to other field journals or to general inter-
est journals like Review of Economics and Statistics and Journal of the European Economic
Association. The answer to this appears to be no. The sixth column reports counts of arti-
cles published in other peer-reviewed economics journals.19 The average is approximately
constant. Moreover, the breakdown suggests that one outlier may be obscuring a similar
downward trend on these publications: economist H is responsible for most of the “other”
peer-reviewed publications (and also for most of the top field journal publications). Looking
at the sums of the fifth and sixth columns we see that four of the six 1993 young senior
faculty published at least 3.3 articles in non-top 5 peer-reviewed journals in 1990-1993 and
the lowest total is 1.5. In 2000-2003, the median is 1.0.
       Publications in invited journals are higher in the latter period. The final column illus-
trates the most dramatic change: per capita publications in outlets that are not traditional
peer-reviewed economics journals jump from 1.1 to 7.5! The majority of these “other”
  19
     This is defined roughly as all articles published in journals listed in Econlit other than those in my top
five, 13 field, and invited sets.


                                                      20
publications are article-like items in conference volumes or other edited volumes. Some
are articles in policy-oriented journals in other fields, and some are survey-like articles in
traditional economic outlets, e.g. Econometric Society World Congress volumes.
       The main impression I take away from this analysis is that Harvard’s young senior
faculty appear to be spending an increasing fraction of their time writing articles that are
not being published in peer-reviewed journals. In my summary Table 3 I have put +’s in
the columns for the decline-in-peer-review and slowdown theories and a – in the column for
the decline-in-top-department-quality theory. I do so because I see the data as suggesting
that the Harvard faculty could publish more in peer-reviewed journals if they decided to
redirect their efforts to (a) perform/write more of their research in a way that would make
it publishable in peer-reviewed journals and/or (b) spend less time doing research and more
time navigating the peer-review process.

4.3      Author-level publication database

Another natural question to ask about the two basic facts is whether they are facts about
departments or individuals: are the declines in publications by the top departments a
reflection of a more widespread decline in publications by highly-regarded economists, or
is there something about the departments themselves that is important? In this section, I
develop some evidence on this question by analyzing a database containining information
on individual authors’ publication records.
       I collected partial publication records for all authors who published a paper in a top
general-interest journal in the 1980’s or the 1990’s. For each author-decade the data include:
(1) the number of top general-interest papers published in the decade; (2) the number of
top general-interest papers published in the first four years of the next decade; and (3) the
number of top field-journal papers published in the first four years of the next decade.20 I
think of the number of general-interest publications in a decade as a proxy for the author’s
status/productivity at the end of the decade. I use the other variables to examine whether
high status/high productivity authors are now publishing less in top journals.
       The data suggest that Facts 1 and 2 are facts about top departments. Figure 2 presents a
  20
    The data on general interest publications do not include short papers and special papers such as presi-
dential addresses. The field-journal counts do not include articles in special issues.




                                                    21
simple illustration. Authors with a nonzero number of (coauthorship-adjusted) top general-
interest publication in each decade were divided into six bins on the basis of decade-specific
top general-interest publication counts: (0,1), [1,2), [2,3), [3,4), [4,5), and [5, ∞). The
top panel of the figure examines field journal publications: the squares give the mean
number of 2000-2003 field journal publications for authors whose 1990-1999 general-interest
publications fall into each bin; and the triangles give 1990-1993 field journal publications
as a function of 1980-1989 general-interest publications. The data indicate that the top
departments’ decline in field journal publications is not attributable to broader decline in
field journal publications by high status/highly productive economists. The top two bins
show higher field journal output in the 2000’s. The means for the other bins are very
similar.21
       The bottom panel presents corresponding data on general-interest publications. Fact 2
is that these were lower in the early 2000’s for economists at Harvard. One could imagine
that this was attributable to Harvard having a disproportionate share of the very high-
status economists. Again, the figure indicates that this does not appear to be the case, at
least if status is adequately proxied by prior-decade general-interest publications. Means
are similar for all bins except for the highest one, and the highest bin has higher output in
the later decade.22
       Table 8 presents a related regression analysis. In each decade I constructed four variables
on the sample of all economists who had multiple publications in the top five general-
interest journals in the decade: a count of the economist’s general interest publications in
the decade, a count of the economist’s university’s publications in these journals in the
decade, and counts of the economist’s publications in the general interest and field journal
groups in the first four years of the next decade.23
  21
      None of the differences are statistically significant. In the lower bins this is because the differences are
very small (standard errors on each estimate are approximately 0.02). In the two highest bins this is because
the bins contain few economists: 48 and 51 in the earlier decade and 35 and 22 in the later decade. The
relative paucity of economists in the later decade could also affect the interpretation of the gap if it were
significant.
   22
      Here, the difference in means is significant in the highest bin.
   23
      All counts are weighted for coauthorship. The school-level variable is set to the maximum count for all
of an author’s affiliations for authors who have different affiliations on different papers. Unlike in previous
analyses, this variable is defined at the university level, and I make no attempt to separate economics-
department faculty from the many others authors with the same university affiliation. The restriction of the
sample to economists having multiple general-interest publications reflects a data limitation for the earlier
decade: Econlit does not contain affiliation data prior to 1989. I obtained affiliation data from Markus

           Table 8: Publications as a function of author and school characteristics

    The first two columns report coefficients from negative binomial regressions of the au-
thor’s field journal publications in the first four years of a decade on author- and school-level
publication counts for the preceding decade. The results bolster the view that the pub-
lication decline noted in Fact 1 is a top school phenomenon rather than a top author
phenomenon. The author-level variable indicates that authors with impressive publication
records are not withdrawing from publishing in field journals. The school-level variable,
which was insignificant in 1990-1993 is negative in 2000-2003 indicating that authors from
top schools are now publishing less in field journals than are authors from less prestigious
schools who have comparable publication records.
    The third and fourth columns report similar regressions examining general-interest pub-
lications in 1990-1993 and 2000-2003. Again, there is nothing to suggest that authors with
strong publication records are withdrawing from publishing in general-interest journals. The
school-level variable is positive and significant for both decades. It is somewhat smaller in
the second decade, but this difference is not significant.
    The fifth and sixth columns examine the robustness of the above regressions to the
Möbius, who collected it for papers beyond an author’s first in a decade for use in Möbius and Rosenblat
(2004). The restriction of the sample in the second decade is designed to make the regressions comparable,
but some potential differences remain: the maximum over schools is potentially taken over a larger set in
the second decade and school-level counts are higher because they are not missing for first publications. To
minimize the latter difference, the school counts are normalized to have a maximum of one in each decade.

sample selection: they reestimate the models in the second and fourth columns on the
full sample of authors with at least one general interest publication in the 1990’s. The
coefficients on the author-level variables are similar to those reported earlier. The school-
level variable is now unrelated to field journal publications.
         This evidence in this section is problematic for both the slowdown and decline-in-field-
journal-quality theories. Under the slowdown theory, one would have expected that the
authors who were publishing the largest number of general-interest papers would have been
most affected by the slowdown and would have experienced the largest decline in field
journal publications. In the decline-in-field-journal-quality theory one would probably have
expected that authors with the strongest publication records would be most likely to regard
diminished field journals as not worth publishing in. The data are consistent with a version
of the decline-in-peer-review theory in which it is being in a top department, rather than
having a strong publication record, that enables an author to attract attention for his or
her work without publishing it in a top journal. In my summary Table 3 I’ve put –’s in the
slowdown and decline-in-field-journal-quality columns and a + in the decline-in-peer-review
column. It should be understood that this + is only supporting one possible variant of the
theory.


5         Citation Data

Citations are an obvious source of information on the dissemination of research. They
are also used as a quality metric. The citation data discussed below was compiled by
collecting all citations made in 1994 and 2004 by twenty-one journals: the five top general
interest journals; the thirteen field journals; and three of the “invited” journals (Journal of
Economic Perspectives, Journal of Economic Literature, and the Papers and Proceedings
issue of the AER.) This has several benefits relative to relying on ISI citation counts: it
avoids some of the problems with intertemporal comparability caused by the proliferation
of journals; it provides some focus on important citations; and it allows me to construct
measures of citations to unpublished as well as published works. Obviously, a number of
limitations remain and new limitations are introduced.24
    24
     Most prominently, the raw data from which citations are tabulated only includes the last name and
initials of the first author. I deal with this differently in different parts of the analysis, but many of the

5.1    Journal citation counts

Journal-level citation counts are obviously relevant to the decline-in-field-journal-quality
theory. The top panel of Table 9 reports per-article citation counts for recent articles from
1994 and 2004. More precisely, the entry for Journal X in the 1994 column is the number
of times that 1994 articles in the 21- journal set cited an article in Journal X from 1984 or
later, divided by the total number of articles Journal X published in 1984-1993.25

 Table 9: Per article citation counts for recent articles in various journals: 1994 and 2004

    The bottom panel of Table 9 summarizes this data by reporting means for each journal
category and also provides comparable figures that only count citations that appear in one
“counts” reported below should in no way be thought of as aggregations of accurate counts of individuals’
citations.
   25
      The raw data do not distinguish between regular AER articles and those in the Papers and Proceedings
issues, nor do they distinguish between citations to articles in the Carnegie-Rochester series and articles
in the Journal of Monetary Economics after the former’s incorporation into the latter. In each case, I
apportion all references between the two components by using the relative frequencies for articles that can
be definitively matched to an article in one of the two components.

of the top five journals. The 21-journal counts portray the field journals as declining in
influence relative to both the top general interest journals and the invited journals. This
is not a very robust result, however. In the 5-journal counts the field journals are gaining
slightly on the invited journals and falling only slightly farther behind the general interest
journals.
       There is heterogeneity within each category of journals. The QJE had a huge increase in
citations and became the most-cited general-interest journal. REStud and AER also made
substantial gains to achieve near-parity with Econometrica and JPE. All six “invited”
journals show gains from 1994 to 2004. The heterogeneity here is that whereas most of the
gains are relatively small, the NBER Macroeconomics Annual shows a large increase. It is
more cited on a per-article basis than any general-interest journal. There is no consistent
trend in the field journal category: five journals gain and eight journals lose citations. The
set of five field journals that gained in citations includes the two field journals that had an
increase in their top-five author shares across decades and two that did the next best at
holding on to their top-five authors.
       In Table 3 I’ve recorded this section as providing support for the decline-in-field-journals
theory because both the overall decline in field-journal citations and the relationship be-
tween which journals lost top-department authors and which journals lost citations are
consistent with this theory. The strength of the support can be regarded as weak, both
because the patterns themselves are not very strong and because the causation could run
in the other direction.

5.2       Departmental citation counts

Departmental citation counts were tabulated in a two-step process. I first produced counts
of all citations to each last name-initial pair. I then computed each department count as
the sum over all last name-initial pairs that corresponded to the last name-initial of one of
their faculty members. This has several obvious limitations.26 I hope that measurement
errors are largely orthogonal to the comparisons I will be making across departments and
  26
     Three of the main ways in which this calculation departs from the idea are: authors are getting credit
for citations made to other economists who share their last name-initial; authors are getting no credit for
coauthored papers on which they are not the first author; and the departmental faculty lists only include
faculty members who published a paper in one of the five general-interest or thirteen field journals in a
four-year period and therefore omit citations to faculty members who do not meet this criterion.


                                                    27
over time.
       Table 10 reports average citations per faculty member for ten departments and for other
authors with a recent publication in a top general interest or top field journal. The first
two columns tabulate all citations made to each author in 1994 and 2004 (in the set of
21 journals and subject to the caveats above). One fact that stands out is that Harvard
is doing extremely well in citations. Its citations are up by 65% from 1994 to 2004.27 It
has moved from fourth on the list to first. Authors from the other top departments are
not doing as well. The other top-five departments as a whole experienced a decline in per
author citations. Authors from departments 6-10 gained 15% on average. Authors from
other schools gained 10%, reflecting in part that the 21 journals considered make more total
citations in 2004 than in 1994.

         Table 10: Departmental citation counts: average citations per faculty member


       One frequent concern that comes up in discussing citation counts is that the usual counts
are dominated by citations made by obscure journals. The focus in this paper on citations
  27
     A bit less than one-third of the per-author growth is due to the decrease in the denominator. Part of
this could be an artifact of omitting nonpublishing authors from the calculation.



                                                   28
in 21 journals should alleviate this concern, but I address it further by reporting, in the
third and fourth columns, citation counts that only include citations appearing in one of
the top five general interest journals. These give a similar picture: Harvard’s citations are
way up; citations to the other top five departments are down; citations to departments 6 –
10 and to other authors are up slightly.28
       Citations obviously measure lifetime achievement and need not be closely related to
recent productivity. To provide something closer to a measure of the impact of authors’
recent research, the fifth and sixth columns provide tabulations that only include citations
to items (published or not) cited as dating to the previous four years, e.g. the 1994 column
reports 1994 citations to items with dates in 1990-1993. Here, Harvard is the only top-five
department showing a (now small) per capita increase. Departments 6-10 and other authors
also show declines in this measure.
       An important factor in summarizing this data is that the patterns at Harvard are
different from those at the other top five departments. Hence, the data lead to conflicting
conclusions. The Harvard data are more consistent with a decline in the necessity of peer
review than with a decline in relative department quality. The opposite is true of the data
on the other departments. In Table 3 I have indicated this by placing +/– symbols in both
columns.

5.3      Paper-level citation database

In this section I use data on citations at the paper level to enrich the above descriptions
and to address additional questions. I focus on how citations covary with the journal in
which a paper is published and with the author’s institution and whether there is a change
over time in these relationships.
       My paper-level database includes 1994 citation counts for all papers published in 1990-
1993 (in one of the 23 journals studied) and 2004 citation counts for all papers published in
2000-2003. I examine how citations are related to journal- and author-characteristics using
negative binomial regressions, e.g.

                 Citesi ∼ Poisson(µi )
  28
   It may be interesting to note that here again, Yale and Berkeley look like the top five and Pennsylvania,
Northwestern, and School Z look somewhat different.

with i is a Γ(θ, θ)-distributed random variable. This can be thought of as similar to
estimating a simple regression with log(Citesi ) as the dependent variable.29 The dependent
variable Cites in the 1990’s (2000’s) regression is the number of citations that each paper
published in 1990-1993 (2000-2003) received in 1994 (2004). In the base model, the main
explanatory variables are dummy variables for the type of journal (top general interest is
the omitted category) and dummies for whether the author is in a top five or 6-10 ranked
economics department. Three paper characteristics (in addition to year dummies) are
included as control variables: the log of the order in which the paper appears in its issue;
the length of the article; and the number of authors.
    Coefficient estimates and standard errors for the base model are presented in the first
two columns of Table 11 with t-statistics in parentheses. The estimated coefficients on
the control variables bring out several interesting and potentially relevant facts. First, the
order in which a paper appears in its journal issue is a significant predictor of citations.30
This indicates that editors are able to predict which articles are likely to be more influential
and/or that more readers look at articles that appear earlier in a journal issue. Second,
the coefficient on the NumAuthor variable indicates that papers with more authors are
more widely cited.31 One possible interpretation of this result is that citations reflect how
extensively authors “market” a paper as well as the paper’s inherent quality. The coefficients
on the age dummies indicate that knowledge of papers diffuses sufficiently quickly so that
three-year old and four-year old papers are cited at about the same rate.
    AuTop5School is the fraction of a paper’s authors who are faculty members in a top five
economics department. Papers by authors in the top departments are more widely cited in
each decade. This could be attributed to authors in top departments’ having an advantage
in marketing papers or to differences in average quality (that are not fully reflected in how

journals order papers within an issue). I find a similar effect for department 6–10 authors
in the early 1990’s, but not in the 2000’s.
       FieldJournal and InvitedJournal are dummy variables for papers appearing in field and
invited journals. Papers in both types of journals are less cited on average than papers
appearing in top general-interest journals. The coefficient estimates of about -0.9 indicate
that papers in field journals receive approximately 60% fewer citations than papers in top
general-interest journals. This difference appears to be fairly stable over time (again not
providing much support for the decline-in-field-journal-quality theory). Invited journals are
also well behind top general-interest journals, but appear to be gaining somewhat.
       The regressions in the third and fourth columns of Table 11 add interactions between the
journal (Top 5, Field and Invited) and author affiliation (Top 5, 6–10, Other) classifications.
The coefficient on AuTop5School now measures the extra citations that accrue to authors
from top-five departments when publishing in the top general-interest journals. Papers by
authors from top departments were substantially more widely cited than other papers in
top general-interest journals in the 1990’s, but this effect has declined in the last decade
and is no longer statistically significant. This could reflect a decrease in dissemination
advantages or a decrease in relative quality.
       A comparison between the coefficients on the Field Journal × Department Category
interactions indicates that papers by authors in top five departments receive many more
citations than other papers in the same field journal.32 This is consistent with the hypothesis
that authors from top schools are better able to gain attention for their work without
publishing it in top general interest journals.33 Note, however, that the estimates on the
InvitedJournal interactions do not follow this pattern.
       One aspect of these findings that is a little puzzling is that they suggest that citations to
papers by economists in top departments are now not very sensitive to where the paper is
published (the causal effect of publishing the same paper in a field journal must be less than
e−0.27 if the general-interest papers in our sample are of higher quality than the field journal
papers). This must be reconciled with the finding that authors from top departments are
publishing fewer papers in these journals. Two possible lines of argument are that top-five
  32
    To make this comparison one also needs to add in the AuTop5School coefficient.
  33
    Part of the gain in citations could also be due to a selection effect: the decline in field journal publications
could be due to top-department authors only publishing their best field-journal papers in those outlets.

authors may be primarily publishing in top general interest journals to promote their fields
or maintain their reputations, and that the citation penalty from publishing in nonjournal
outlets may also be getting smaller.
   A striking result of the previous section was that Harvard is doing relatively well in
citations in a period when it is doing relatively poorly in top-journal publications. This
naturally raises the question of whether this is due to gains in per-article citations out-
weighing the drop in top-journal publications, or whether it is due to Harvard’s garnering
more citations on papers that are not in top journals. The fifth and sixth columns of Ta-
ble 11 address this question by adding dummies for each top-ten school. The regressions
also include (unreported) journal dummies and interactions between top-department and
journal-class dummies. Hence, the coefficients on the school dummies reflect the citations
accruing to papers the school published in top general-interest journals relative to other pa-
pers in the same journal, and citations accruing to papers the school published in field and
invited journals relative to papers in those journals by members of other top departments.
The school dummies from these regressions are reported separately in Table 12.

              Table 12: School dummies from paper-level citation regression

   The results indicate that Harvard’s strong recent citation performance is not due to
citations to its top journal publications: the point estimate on the Harvard dummy is
smaller in the later period than in the earlier period and indicates that Harvard is not


                                             33
gaining relative to MIT, Princeton and Chicago. The standard errors are such that the
cross-coefficient comparisons are not statistically significant, but this does not really matter
for the above conclusion – the sample here is the full set of papers in the 23 journals in
2000-2003, which was the period for which Harvard was shown to be doing well in the final
column of Table 10.) I conclude that Harvard’s relatively strong citation record must be
attributable to its receiving many citations for papers that are not in top journals.34
       The fifth and sixth columns also provide some evidence that results noted earlier are
robust by showing that they hold across departments and do not go away when a full
set of journal dummies is included. For example, the regressions again indicate that top
departments are receiving many citations for their field journal publications, and show that
the pattern of getting fewer citations for top general interest publications appears to be
consistent across schools.
       One conclusion of this section seems fairly clear: the data seem inconsistent with the
notion that authors in top departments are shunning field journals because these journals
are getting worse and no longer provide sufficient dissemination. The other conclusions are
less clear. Several observations are consistent with the idea that authors at top schools may
increasingly be able to attract attention without publishing in top journals. The significance
of the number of authors and the author’s institution in the citation regressions provides
evidence that nonjournal dissemination has always been important. Both the fact that
Harvard’s strong recent citation performance appears to be due to citations to papers not
published in top journals and the fact that the general interest-field journal citation gap
is narrowing for authors at top schools suggest that the importance of publishing in the
best journals is declining over time. I put a +/– in the decline in peer review necessity
column, however, because the results on relative citations of general interest and field
journal publications is awkward to reconcile with top departments’ concentrating their
effors on publishing in general interest journals. The evidence is also mixed on the decline-
in-top-department-quality theory. The citation declines on general-interest publications
could be taken to suggest a quality decline, but the opposite results on citations to papers
in field journal have the opposite implication.
  34
    These unpublished papers, of course, may include papers that will eventually be published in top
journals.

6    Conclusions

I started this paper by pointing out two trends: economists in several highly-regarded
departments are publishing fewer papers in the top field journals; and Harvard’s economics
department is also publishing fewer papers in the top general interest journals.
    Several pieces of evidence bolster the view that one factor contributing to these trends
is that the role of journals in disseminating research has been reduced. One is that the
citation benefit to publishing in a top general-interest journal now appears to be fairly
small for top-department authors. Another is that Harvard authors appear to be quite
successful in garnering citations to papers that are not published in top journals. The
fact that the publication declines appear to be a top-department phenomenon (as opposed
to a prolific-author phenomenon) suggests that a top-department affiliation may be an
important determinant of an author’s ability to sidestep the traditional journal system.
    Other potential explanations for the trends also appear to be relevant. The slowdown
of the publication process continued through the nineties. It is natural that this would
lead authors to cut back on the number of papers they subject to peer review and that
the best papers would be given highest priority. The fact that top-department authors
continue to publish in special issues of field journals (and that we see many publications in
invited journals and nonjournals) suggests that the arduousness of the publication process
is playing a role in deterring submissions.
    The changes that have occurred over the past decade are modest in magnitude. Econo-
mists at top departments are still spending a great deal of effort publishing in top peer-
reviewed journals and publishing many papers there. One could imagine, however, that
much larger changes will be seen in the near future. Technologies for disseminating papers
will continue to improve. More top economists may realize that the publication hassles
they have been enduring are not necessary. The peer-review process may also be subject to
unravelling: as more top economists withdraw from the process, the signal that publication
in a given journal provides is devalued, and this may lead to further withdrawals. Even
a partial unravelling could have a significant impact on the course of economic research.
For example, if only the top general-interest journals maintain their stature, then more
economists may concentrate on “general interest” research and decline to make the kinds of


                                              35
incremental contributions to sophisticated literatures that appeal relatively more to those
who are experts on a topic. Indeed, another potential line of explanation for the facts
presented here is that top departments may be focusing on projects that are of greater
“general interest” but of less interest to specialists in any particular field.
   One could imagine that new institutions may arise and perform many of the same
functions as the current peer-review system more efficiently. Given how central peer-review
has been to academic research over the past century, however, the thought that the current
system might collapse before any successor is clearly established is troubling.
