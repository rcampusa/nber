                                           ABSTRACT

Using novel data on White House visitors from 2009 through 2015, we find that corporate
executives’ meetings with key policymakers are associated with positive abnormal stock returns.
We also find evidence suggesting that following meetings with federal government officials,
firms receive more government contracts and are more likely to receive regulatory relief (as
measured by the tone of regulatory news). The investment of these firms also becomes less
affected by political uncertainty after the meetings. Using the 2016 presidential election as a
shock to political access, we find that firms with access to the Obama administration experience
significantly lower stock returns following the release of the election result than otherwise similar
firms. Overall, our results provide evidence suggesting that political access is of significant value
to corporations.

1. Introduction

Access to political decision-makers is a scarce resource because politicians have limited time and

can only interact with a limited set of people. Gaining political access can be of significant value

for corporations, particularly since governments play an increasingly prominent role in

influencing firms. Governments affect economic activities not only through regulations, but also

by playing the role of customers, financiers, and partners of firms in the private sector. There is

ample anecdotal evidence suggesting that firms benefit from gaining access to powerful

politicians. 1 Therefore, gaining and maintaining access to influential policymakers can be an

important source of competitive advantage for companies. Yet despite the importance of political

access for firms, the allocation of political access across firms and its effects on firm value

remains underexplored.




In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of firms with political access as well as the

valuation effects of political access for corporations. Using a novel dataset of White House

visitor logs, we identify top corporate executives of S&P 1500 firms that have face-to-

face meetings with high-level federal government officials. We examine two fundamental

questions associated with political access. First, how prevalent is political access–in the literal

form of meetings with influential policymakers–and what are the characteristics of firms with

 For example, a Wall Street Journal (2015) article claims that Google executives’ frequent visits to the White
House were instrumental in Federal Trade Commission’s decision to drop its antitrust investigation of the
company. As another example, commenting on the close ties between General Electric and the federal
government, a Washington Examiner (2010) article notes that “Obama wants cap-and-trade, GE wants cap-
and-trade. Obama subsidizes embryonic stem-cell research, GE launches an embryonic stem-cell business.
Obama calls for rail subsidies, GE hires Linda Daschle as a rail lobbyist.”

                                                      1
access to politicians? Second, does political access increase firm value, and if so, through what

channels?




Given the influences of governments on firms and the scarce nature of political access,

understanding the allocation of political access across firms has been a central question in

political economy. In order to make a case to a policymaker, one needs to secure the politician’s

attention and convey the messages through direct or indirect communication (Hall and Wayman

1990; Hasen 2012; Lewis et al. 1998; Wright 1990). The existing political economy literature

contends that politicians grant more access to interest groups that made more contributions to the

officials’ election campaigns (e.g., Herndon, 1982; Gopoian, 1984; Kalla and Broockman, 2016).

From a demand perspective, firms with more exposure to government policies should be more

likely to seek political access. Yet, due to a lack of data on firms’ access to politicians, it

remains largely unclear how political access is allocated across firms.




Corporations can benefit from direct interactions with elected officials in at least three ways.

First, political access may enable firms to secure contracts to provide goods or services to

government. Government procurement of goods and services accounts for over 10% of the GDP

in the U.S. Government officials may influence the allocation of lucrative government contracts

towards firms whose executives have interacted with them. Second, companies with direct access

to politicians can seek regulatory relief and influence political decision-making. Companies in

the U.S. are subject to oversight from various regulatory agencies, e.g., the Securities and


                                                 2
Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety

Commission, Food and Drug Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational

Safety and Health Administration, and so on. Since politicians have discretion in granting

regulatory relief, they may provide more regulatory relief to companies that have access to the

politicians. Third, access to politicians may enable companies to gain an informational advantage

about government policies and actions and help resolve political uncertainty. A growing

literature shows that political uncertainty negatively impacts corporate investment (e.g., Julio and

Yook, 2012; Kelly, Pastor, and Veronesi, 2015; Gulen and Ion, 2016). Gaining direct access to

influential policymakers can help companies become better informed about the inner workings of

the government and the policy-making process, which can help mitigate political uncertainties

and improve corporate decision-making. These considerations suggest that access to politicians

should be associated with increased firm value.




We match the names of visitors in the White House visitor logs to the names of corporate

executives of S&P1500 firms during the period from January 2009 through December 2015. We

are able to identify 2,286 meetings between corporate executives and federal government

officials at the White House. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, in terms of the

prevalence and characteristics of firms with political access, we find that about 11.4% of the

firm-years have executives that visit the White House. Since firms with political access are

typically large firms, they account for 40% of the total market capitalization of firms in the

sample. Consistent with the notion that campaign contributions “buy” access, we find that firms

that contributed more to Obama’s presidential election campaigns are more likely to have access


                                                  3
to the White House. We also find that firms that spend more on lobbying, firms that receive more

government contracts, larger firms, and firms with a greater market share are more likely to have

access to influential federal officials.




Second, we find that corporate executives’ meetings with White House officials are followed by

significant positive cumulative abnormal returns (CARs). For example, the CAR is about 0.865%

during a 51-day window surrounding the meetings (i.e., 10 days before to 40 days after the

meetings). We also find that the result is driven mainly by meetings with the President and his

top aides. We find insignificant CARs for cancelled visits, suggesting that the actual incidence of

the meetings matters for firm value.




Third, to alleviate concerns that omitted variables drive both the timing of corporate executives’

meetings with federal officials and stock returns, we exploit the election of Donald J. Trump as

the 45th President of the U.S. as a shock to political access. We find that firms with access to the

Obama administration experience significantly lower stock returns following the release of the

election result than otherwise similar firms. The economic magnitude is nontrivial as well: after

controlling for various factors that are likely correlated with firms’ political activities, such as

campaign contributions, lobbying expenses, and government contracts, the stocks of firms with

access to the Obama administration underperform the stocks of otherwise similar firms by about

80 basis points in the three days immediately following the election. This result helps alleviate




                                                 4
the concern that the observed valuation effects associated with political access are driven by

confounding factors that are correlated with both the timing of the meetings and stock returns.




Last, we identify several channels through which political access enhances firm value. Using a

propensity-score matched sample of firms with political access (treatment firms) and those

without (control firms) and a difference-in-differences approach, we find that treatment firms,

relative to control firms, receive more government contracts following the meetings than before

the meetings. The economic magnitude of this effect is non-trivial. For example, assuming a

profit margin of 12.0% for winning bids in procurement contracts (Bajari, Houghton, and Tadelis,

2014), the profits generated from incremental contract volume due to political access represent a

gain of about 0.09% for the average firm’s stock, which is about 11% of the average 51-day

CAR around White House visits. We also find evidence suggesting that treatment firms, relative

to control firms, secure more regulatory relief following the meetings than before the meetings.

Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that the investment of treatment firms becomes less

negatively affected by political uncertainty after the meetings.




Our paper is related to the literature on the value of political connections. A number of studies

examine the influences of firms’ political activities and connections, such as campaign

contributions, lobbying, and politically connected corporate executives and board members, on

firm outcomes. For evidence in the U.S. context, see, e.g., Ansolabehere et al. (2004),

Jayachandran (2006), Fisman et al. (2012), Duchin and Sosyura (2012), Blanes i Vidal et al.


                                                 5
(2012), Goldman, Rocholl, and So (2013), Akey (2015), and Acemoglu et al. (2016); for

evidence in the non-U.S. or international contexts, see, e.g., Fisman (2001), Khwaja and Mian

(2005), Faccio (2006), Faccio, Masulis, and McConnell (2006), Claessens, Feijen, and Laeven

(2008), and Faccio and Parsley (2009). Most of the existing studies in the U.S. context focus on

the legislative branch and find that, despite the strong legal system of the U.S., companies that

are connected to politicians in the legislative branch, typically inferred from campaign

contributions, are associated more favorable outcomes. The value of political connections to the

executive branch in the U.S., however, is underexplored. Two important exceptions examining

the value of connections with federal officials in the executive branch are Fisman et al. (2012)

and Acemoglu et al. (2016), but they find mixed results. 2




The main contribution of our paper to the literature is two-fold. First, we are the first to use the

data on White House visitors to identify physical interactions between corporate executives and

influential politicians. The detailed information in the visitor log data enables us to provide a

direct measure of political access and provide evidence on the allocation and valuation effects of

political access. Second, our study adds to the understanding of the value of political connections

to executive branch officials in the U.S. Since corporations are often directly affected by

decisions made by executive branch agencies (e.g., the allocation of government procurement

contracts and regulatory enforcement decisions), it is important to estimate the value of ties to

politicians in the executive branch and the channels through which such a valuation effect occurs.

2
  In particular, Fisman et al. (2012) find that the value of personal ties to Vice President Richard Cheney is
insignificantly different from zero, suggesting that U.S. institutions are effective in curbing rent-seeking by
politicians and corporations. Acemoglu et al. (2016), on the other hand, show that political connections are
associated with large increases in stock valuation during the financial crisis.

                                                      6
The evidence in our paper suggests that access to high-level officials in the executive branch can

be an important source of competitive advantage for firms. Our results also illuminate several

channels, including government procurement contracts and regulatory relief, through which

political access affects firm value.




The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and summary statistics.

Section 3 presents the empirical results, and Section 4 concludes.




2. Data and Summary Statistics

As part of its stated commitment to government transparency, the Obama Administration

voluntarily releases records of White House visitors to the public online. According to the White

House, aside from a small group of particularly sensitive meetings (such as visits by potential

Supreme Court nominees) and purely personal guests of the first and second families (i.e., visits

that do not involve any official or political business), the record of every visitor who comes to

the White House for an appointment or to conduct business is released. We obtain the visitor

logs data from the White House website. Each visitor record includes the first name, last name,

and middle initial of the visitor, the date and time of the appointment, the name of the official

being visited (i.e., the visitee), the number of visitors and the location of the meeting. The

information in the visitor records that implicates personal privacy or law enforcement concerns,

including dates of birth, social security numbers, and contact phone numbers, are not released.

Appendix A provides a sample White House visitor record released to the public.


                                                7
To identify corporate executives that visit the White House, we match the names of visitors in

the White House visitor logs to the names of corporate executives in the ExecuComp database

during the period from January 2009 through December 2015. To focus on meetings that offer

more opportunities for private interactions between politicians and corporate executives, we

require that the number of participants at the meeting do not exceed 50. We first identify a list of

White House visitors whose first name, last name, and middle initial match exactly those of

corporate executives in ExecuComp. To ensure that a White House visitor is indeed the

corporate executive identified rather than someone else with the same full name, we use web

searches to check whether the full name is associated with multiple people that are potential

visitors to the White House. For cases in which the full name is associated with multiple

potential visitors, we rely on two additional pieces of information. First, since visitors in the

same White House meeting are likely to have similar backgrounds, we use information of the

other visitors in the same meeting to verify whether a visitor is indeed the corporate executive

identified. We obtain information on other visitors, especially those whose names are more

unique, through web searches. If the other visitors are also corporate executives or in the same

industry or sector, then the visitor in question is likely to be the corporate executive identified.

Second, since federal government officials (i.e., the visitees) typically have a specified area of

responsibility and are likely to meet only with people in that area, we use information on the

visitee’s area of responsibility as an additional check on the reliability of the matching. For

instance, a White House staffer that advises the President on economic policies is more likely to

meet with a corporate executive than with a pastor with the same name.

We are able to identify 2,286 meetings between corporate executives and federal government

officials at the White House during the period from January 2009 through December 2015. Panel

A of Table 1 lists the names of corporate executives that have more than 10 visits to the White

House. The top three most frequent visitors are David M. Cote (Chairman and CEO of

Honeywell International, 30 visits), Jeffrey R. Immelt (Executive Chairman and CEO of General

Electric, 22 visits), Roger C. Altman (Executive Chairman of EverCore Partners, 21 visits). The

frequent visitors are from a diverse set of industries including banking, healthcare, oil, utilities,

communications, consumer goods, and etc. Panel B of Table 1 lists the names of the federal

official that are most frequently visited by corporate executives. The top three most frequent

visitees by corporate executives are Valerie Jarrett (Senior Advisor to the President, 107 visits),

Jeff Zients (Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National

Economic Council, 103 visits), and the President (100 visits).

Table 2 reports the summary statistics for the sample of firms covered by S&P’s ExecuComp

database from 2009 through 2015. The sample includes 11,846 firm-year observations. Firm-

years in which the executives visit the White House account for around 11.4% of the sample,

suggesting that a non-trivial fraction of the firms have political access. Importantly, since firms

with political access are typically larger firms, they account for about 40% of the total market




                                                 9
capitalization of firms in the sample. The number of visits by a firm-year has a mean of 0.318

and a standard deviation of 1.793.




We obtain data on political campaign contributions and lobbying from the Center for Responsive

Politics and merge the CRP data with our firm-year sample by company name. We focus on

political contributions to Barack Obama’s election campaigns (i.e., the recipient is either Barack

Obama or Obama Victory Fund). For firm-years between 2009 and 2012, we use the campaign

contributions in the 2007-2008 election cycle. For firm-years between 2013 and 2015, we use the

campaign contributions in the 2011-2012 election cycle. The average annual political

contributions and lobbying expenses by our sample firms are around $12,000 and $529,000,

respectively. We obtain data on procurement contracts of the federal government of the United

States from the USAspending.gov website, which provides data from the Federal Procurement

Data System (FPDS). The system provides detailed information on any federal contract with a

transaction value of at least $2,500 ($25,000 prior to 2004). The average firm receives $132.9

million worth of procurement contracts from the federal government annually.




Table 2 also shows summary statistics on other firm characteristics. For example, about 1% of

the firm-years are “sin” stocks, namely alcohol, tobacco, and gaming stocks, as defined in Hong

and Kacperczyk (2009). The average firm-year has an asset size of $19.519 billion, a book-to-

market ratio of 0.256, an ROA of 3.4%, and 18.978 thousand employees.

3. Empirical Results

3.1.   Characteristics of firms with political access

Government officials have limited time and attention and can only interact with a limited set of

corporate executives. Political scientists contend that elected officials grant more access to

interest groups that made more contributions to the officials’ election campaigns (e.g., Herndon,

1982; Gopoian, 1984; Kalla and Broockman, 2016). We thus expect the likelihood of political

access increases with campaign contributions. From a demand perspective, firms with more

exposure to government policies should be more likely to seek political access. For example,

firms that receive more government contracts, firms that spend more heavily on lobbying, and

firms that have a larger market share are likely to be more exposed to government policies and

may seek more political access.




We run multivariate regressions to examine which firm characteristics are associated with

political access. We consider the following explanatory variables: campaign contributions to

President Obama’s election campaigns, lobbying expenses, government procurement contracts,

firm size, market share, and other firm and industry characteristics as well as industry fixed

effects and year fixed effects.




Table 3 presents the regression results. The first two columns are OLS regressions with the

logarithm of one plus the number of White House visits as the dependent variable, and the last


                                               11
two columns are probit regressions with an indicator variable for whether the firm’s executives

visit the White House as the dependent variable. We lag the independent variables by one year. It

should be noted that the results are not intended to imply causation, i.e., that some firm

characteristics cause the firm to have political access, but instead they indicate correlation

between firm characteristics and political access. Consistent with the notion that campaign

contributions “buy” political access, the coefficients on the logarithm of one plus campaign

contributions to the President’s election campaigns are positive and highly significant. In terms

of economic magnitude: Model 4 suggests that an interquartile range increase in the log of one

plus the campaign contributions (about 8.01) increases the probability of gaining access to the

White House by 2.40 percentage points, which is economically large compared to an

unconditional probability of 11.4% (as Table 1 shows).




Table 3 also shows that firms that spend more on lobbying, firms that receive more government

contracts, and firms that have a large market share are associated with an increased probability of

gaining access to the White House. These results are consistent with these firm characteristics

being associated with greater exposure to government policies and hence a greater demand for

political access. We also find that larger firms are associated with increased political access,

which may be because of high fixed costs of gaining access to politicians.

3.2.     Cumulative abnormal returns around White House visits

We calculate cumulative abnormal stock returns around corporate executives’ visits to the White

House to evaluate the stock return effects. It should be noted that although the release of the

visitor logs by the White House has a three-month lag, many visits, especially those involving

meetings with the President and his top aides, receive media coverage right around the time of

the visits. Therefore, the stock price reaction may occur relatively quickly. Figure 1 plots the

cumulative abnormal returns from 10 trading days before corporate executives’ White House

visits to 120 trading days after. We calculate abnormal returns as the return in excess of CRSP

value-weighted market returns. On average, the CAR during the 131-day window is around

0.98%.


                                   [Insert Figure 1 about here]




Table 4 reports the cumulative abnormal returns over four different windows surrounding the

date of the visit, 21 (-10 to +10), 41 (-10 to +30), 51 (-10 to +40), and 71 (-10 to +60) days, with

day 0 being the day of the meeting. For example, the average 21- and 71-day CARs are 0.421%

and 1.185%, respectively.




We partition the sample in two ways to examine cross-sectional as well as time-series variation

in the CARs. We first partition the sample by the identity of visitees. We consider three groups

of visitees, the President, the President’s top aids, and other officials. Top aides are White House

staffers that make the maximum annual salary of $172,200. All other staffers are classified as


                                                13
other officials. We obtain the title and salary information of federal officials from the

annual Report to Congress on White House Staff. The abnormal returns are driven mainly by

meetings with the President and the President’s top aides. For example, the average 71-day

CARs for meetings with the President and the top aides are 2.482% and 2.749%, respectively.


                                     [Insert Table 4 about here]




We then partition the sample by year. Figure 2 plots the CARs and the 95% confidence intervals

around the visits for each year from 2009 through 2015. The CARs are significantly positive

during the election year (2012), the first years post-election (2009 and 2013) as well as 2014,

suggesting that access to influential government officials is particularly beneficial during those

years.


                                    [Insert Figure 2 about here]




We also examine the CARs around cancelled visits. Table 5 shows that the CARs around

cancelled visits are insignificant and close to zero. This result suggests that the actual incidence

of the meetings matters for firm value. One caveat is that the sample for cancelled meetings is

relatively small (24 observations), so the result could be due to a lack of statistical power.


                                     [Insert Table 5 about here]




                                                 14
We conduct various robustness tests of the results on the CAR around corporate executives’

visits to the White House. First, we exclude White House visits that are associated with the

President’s advisory board meetings. There is substantial vetting that goes on as part of advisory

board selection, and the White House may know more about people sitting on the advisory

boards and their companies than the markets may know – thus it is possible that people chosen

for advisory boards may be selected from firms that are likely to have above average outcomes.

We identify corporate executives that are members of the President’s advisory boards, including

the President’s Management Advisory Board, the President’s Council on Jobs and

Competitiveness, the President’s Global Development Council, and the President’s Export

Council. We retrieve the dates and locations of advisory board meetings from the White House

website. We are able to identify 91 visits by corporate executives in our sample that are part of

the President’s advisory board meetings. It is useful to note that some of the board meetings have

more than 50 attendees and thus have been filtered out because we require that the number of

participants at the meeting do not exceed 50. The results, reported in Table 6, show that our

results continue to hold after excluding visits that are part of advisory board meetings, suggesting

that the observed positive CARs associated with White House visits are not driven by the

selection process for advisory boards.




Second, we exclude follow-up visits (defined as visits that are within 12 months of the previous

visits). Third, to address the concern that the results may be driven by industry effects, we

compute industry-adjusted stock returns by subtracting from the daily return of each stock the

daily return of the corresponding industry (following Moskowitz and Grinblatt 1999) and repeat


                                                15
the test using the industry-adjusted returns. Last, we repeat the tests using the Fama-French-

Carhart four-factor model to adjust returns. Table 6 shows that the results are robust to these

changes in the sample and alternative specifications.


                                    [Insert Table 6 about here]




3.3.   Stock returns following the 2016 presidential election

The observed valuation effect associated with corporate executives’ visits to the White House

may be driven by confounding factors that are correlated with both the timing of the meetings

and stock returns. For example, corporate executives may choose to visit federal officials when

they possess favorable information about their own firms. In this case, the omitted variable is the

private information of managers, which may bias the observed results.




To alleviate concerns about omitted variables that drive both the timing of corporate executives’

meetings with federal officials and stock returns, we exploit the election of Donald J. Trump as

the 45th President of the U.S. as a shock to political access. Prior to the election, it was widely

held that Hillary Clinton would win the election. For example, the market price in prediction

markets such as the Iowa Electronic Market on the day before the election implies that the

probability of a Clinton presidency was about 80%. Thus, the election of Donald J. Trump as the

President represents a negative shock to firms that had access to the White House during the

Obama Administration. Importantly, the timing of the election is pre-determined, mitigating the

concerns about endogenous timing of political access. If political access is of significant value to


                                                16
firms, firms with greater access to the Obama administration and hence a continuing Democratic

administration should experience lower stock returns when the election result became known. To

test this, we run the following regression:


           𝐶𝐴𝑅𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛾 × 𝑃𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖 + ∑ 𝛾𝑗 𝑋𝑖,𝑗 + 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑦𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖 ,                      (1)


where CARi is the cumulative market-adjusted abnormal returns of stock i during a three-day

window immediately following the release of the election result, i.e., from November 9 to 11,

2017; PoliticalAccessi is either an indicator an indicator that takes the value of one if the

executives of the firm visit the White House at least once during the Obama administration and

zero otherwise or the log of one plus the number of visits to the White House by the firm’s

executives during our sample period; X is a vector containing a similar set of firm-level control

variables including campaign contributions, lobbying expenses, government procurement

contracts, firm size, book-to-market, leverage, sales growth, and stock price run-up before the

election; and Industryi is industry fixed-effects. We aggregate the dollar value of campaign

contributions, lobbying expenses, and procurement contracts during the sample year from 2009

through 2015. We use stock price run-up, measured using the cumulative market-adjusted stock

return during the 40-day window immediately before the election, to control for an anticipation

effect. We cluster standard errors by industry. If the election of Trump constitutes a negative

shock to firms with access to the Obama administration, we expect the coefficient on the political

access variable to be negative and significant.




                                                  17
Table 7 presents the results estimating Eq. (1). Models 1 and 3 only include the political access

variables and industry fixed effects as the explanatory variables. The coefficients on both

political access variables are negative and significant. The economic magnitude is large: for

example, model 1 suggests that the stocks of firms with access to the Obama administration

underperform those of same-industry firms without access by 1.3 percentage points in three-day

CARs. In models 2 and 4 we include firm-level controls as additional regressors. The magnitude

of the coefficients on the political access variables becomes slightly smaller, but remains

statistically and economically significant. For example, model 2 suggests that after controlling

for various factors that are likely correlated with firms’ political activities, such as campaign

contributions, lobbying expenses, and government contracts, the stocks of firms with access to

the Obama administration underperform the stocks of otherwise similar firms by about 80 basis

points in the three days immediately following the election. This result helps alleviate the

concern that the valuation effects associated with corporate executives’ meetings with federal

officials are driven by confounding factors that are correlated with both the timing of the

meetings and stock returns.




Table 7 also reveals a number of interesting patterns. Firms with high stock price run-ups before

the election are associated with lower stock returns after the release of the election result,

suggesting that the market was surprised by the election result. In other words, as the market

increased its belief in a Clinton presidency before the election, stocks that would benefit from a

Clinton administration experienced a positive run-up. The outcome of the election showed that

this belief was wrong, thus resulting in lower returns for those stocks. Moreover, firms that


                                               18
contributed more to Obama’s presidential campaigns and firms that lobbied more during the

Obama administration are associated with lower stock returns, which may be because the market

places a lower value on the benefits of strong connections with Democrats now that the

Republicans are in control. It is worth noting that the negative relation between the CARs and

the political access variables continue to hold after controlling for these variables, suggesting that

the political access events we identify have independent effects on stock valuation.

3.4.   White House visits and real outcomes

Access to powerful politicians may enable firms to secure contracts to provide goods or services

to government, seek regulatory relief, and resolve policy uncertainty. We use a difference-in-

differences approach to examine whether political access influences real outcomes of

corporations. We first use a propensity-score matching procedure to construct a sample of

control firms that are statistically identical in all observable dimensions except that their

executives do not visit the White House. We compute the propensity scores using the probit

model of Model 4 in Table 3. We use a one-to-one nearest neighbor matching with replacement

(Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd, 1997). For each firm whose executives visit the White House

(treatment firm), we identify a control firm with the closest propensity score. This procedure

ensures that a treatment firm is paired with a control firm with statistically the same prior

campaign contributions, lobbying expenses, government contracts, size, market-to-book, year,

industry membership, and etc. We then compare the change in real outcomes around the White

House visits for treatment firms with that for control firms.


                                                 19
A. Government procurement contracts

To examine the influence of political access on the allocation of government procurement

contracts, we compare the change in government procurement contracts around the White House

visits for treatment firms with that for control firms. We calculate the change in government

procurement contracts as the total dollar value of procurement contracts awarded during the 12

months immediately following a White House visit scaled by sales minus that during the 12

months immediately before the visit scaled by sales. We cluster standard errors by firm.




Table 8 reports the results. Treatment firms, relative to control firms, receive more government

contracts following the meetings than before the meetings. The economic magnitude of this

effect is non-trivial. For example, the DiD estimate shows that the change in procurement

contract volume as a fraction of sales around the White House visits is 0.746 percentage points

higher for treatment firms than for control firms. To gauge the effect of the increase of

government contracts on the CAR of treatment firms, we perform a back-of-the-envelope

calculation. We first multiply the DiD estimate for the dollar value of procurement contracts over

sales by the average sales of the firms, which provides an estimate of the incremental contract

volume due to political access. To gauge the pecuniary gains from winning these contracts, we

need to multiply the incremental contract volume by the profit margin on government

procurement contracts. We use the median profit margin of 12.0% for winning bids in

procurement contracts in the U.S. estimated by Bajari, Houghton, and Tadelis (2014). Thus, the

average firm generates $33.90 (=0.00746*$37,870*12.0%) million in profits from incremental


                                               20
contract volume due to political access. Since the average firm has a market capitalization of

$35,879 million, this represents a gain of about 9.45 basis points for the firm’s stock, which is

about 11% of the average 50-day CAR around White House visits.




We then partition government contracts in two ways. First, we group contracts into performance-

based and non-performance-based contracts. Table 8 shows that about two-thirds of the increase

in procurement contracts is due to non-performance-based contracts. Second, we group contracts

into those that are awarded under full and open competition and those that are not awarded under

full and open competition. Again, about two-thirds of the increase in procurement contracts is

due to contracts that are awarded on a non-competitive basis. These results suggest that

government contracts, especially those with higher rents, are a channel through which political

access enhances firm value.


                                   [Insert Table 8 about here]




B. Regulatory relief

Political access may enable firms to obtain special treatment by regulatory agencies. We identify

regulatory relief using a novel approach. We obtain regulatory news from CapitalIQ Key

Developments dataset. We first categorize regulatory news articles as positive or negative based

on the relative fraction of positive and negative words in the articles. We then count the number

of positive and negative regulatory news before and after the White House visits for both

treatment firms and control firms. Specifically, we use the word classification in the General



                                               21
Inquirer’s Harvard Psychosocial Dictionary to categorize words as either positive or negative.

We classify a regulatory news article as positive (negative) if the difference between the

proportion of positive words in the news and that of negative words is in the top (bottom) tercile.

We then compare the change in the number of positive or negative regulatory news for firms

whose executives visit the White House (treatment firms) with that for control firms.




The following is an example of regulatory news concerning our sample firms that is categorized

as positive by our procedure:


       Regions Financial Corp. resolved an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange

       Commission regarding a previous arrangement between AmSouth Bank,

       AmSouth Asset Management and BISYS Fund Services Inc., an outside company

       which provided fund administration and other services to the former AmSouth

       Funds and many other mutual fund families. Regions cooperated fully and

       extensively with the SEC in this investigation and is pleased to resolve the matter.

       The arrangements in question date back to 1999 and involved a portion of the

       administration fee paid by the funds to BISYS being rebated to AmSouth to pay

       for marketing and other expenses related to the AmSouth Funds. The

       arrangements ended in 2004 and AmSouth disclosed the SEC inquiry in 2005.




An example of negative regulatory news:




                                                22
       The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took action against EZCORP, Inc. for

       illegal debt collection practices. These tactics included illegal visits to consumers

       at their homes and workplaces, empty threats of legal action, lying about

       consumers’ rights, and exposing consumers to bank fees through unlawful

       electronic withdrawals. The Bureau ordered EZCORP to refund $7.5 million to

       93,000 consumers, pay $3 million in penalties, and stop collection of remaining

       payday and installment loan debts owed by roughly 130,000 consumers. It also

       bars EZCORP from future in-person debt collection. In addition, the Bureau

       issued an industry-wide warning about collecting debt at homes or workplaces.

       The CFPB found that EZCORP collected debts from consumers through unlawful

       in-person collection visits at their homes or workplaces, risked exposing

       consumers’ debts to third parties, falsely threatened consumers with litigation for

       non-payment of debts, and unfairly made multiple electronic withdrawal attempts

       from consumer accounts, causing mounting bank fees. The CFPB alleges that

       EZCORP violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall

       Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act’s prohibition against unfair and

       deceptive acts or practices.




Table 9 reports the results on the change in the number of positive and negative news articles

around White House visits. The results show that treatment firms, relative to control firms,

experience an increase of 0.036 in the number of positive regulatory news articles during the 12

months immediately following a White House visit relative to that during the 12 months


                                                23
immediately before the visit. Treatment and control firms, however, do not differ significantly in

the change in the number of negative regulatory news. Therefore, the difference-in-differences

estimate in the last row suggests that, compared to control firms, treatment firms experience an

increase of 0.041 in the difference between the number of positive regulatory news and that of

negative regulatory news after the visits than before the visits. These results are consistent with

the hypothesis that political access enables firms to obtain regulatory relief. The economic

magnitude is nontrivial considering that the difference between the number of positive regulatory

news and that of negative regulatory news has a mean of -0.006 and a standard deviation of

0.446.

C. Sensitivity of corporate investment to political uncertainty

Political access may enable companies to better understand the policy deliberation process of

government officials and help firms resolve policy uncertainty. A growing literature shows that

political uncertainty negatively impacts corporate investment (e.g., Julio and Yook, 2012; Kelly,

Pastor, and Veronesi, 2015; Gulen and Ion, 2016). If political access helps firms reduce policy

uncertainty, investment by firms with political access should be less negatively affected by

policy uncertainty after the White House visits. To test this, we run the following regression:


    𝐶𝑎𝑝𝐸𝑥𝑖,𝑡+1 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛽1 × 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑖,𝑡 × 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 × 𝑃𝑈𝑡 + 𝛽2 × 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑖,𝑡 × 𝑃𝑈𝑡 + 𝛽3 ×

                  𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 × 𝑃𝑈𝑡 + 𝛽4 × 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑖,𝑡 × 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽5 × 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽6 × 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 +

                  ∑ 𝛾𝑗 𝑋𝑗 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 ,                                                                (2)



                                                 24
where CapExi,t+1 is quarterly capital expenditure (capital expenditure/lagged total assets) in

quarter t + 1, αi is firm fixed-effects, αt is time fixed-effects, Treat is an indicator that equals one

for firms with political access and zero for control firms, Post is an indicator that equals one if

the fiscal quarter is within 12 months after the White House visit and zero otherwise, PU is the

logarithm of the policy uncertainty index of Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2013), and Xj is a vector

containing firm-level characteristics including Tobin’s q, operating cash flows, and sales growth

(following Gulen and Ion, 2016) and their interactions with the treatment and post dummies. It

should be noted that since we include time fixed-effects (i.e., one dummy for each fiscal quarter-

end), it is unnecessary to include the policy uncertainty index by itself in the regression. We use

the overall policy uncertainty index as well as the news-based policy uncertainty index of Baker,

Bloom, and Davis (2013). We cluster standard errors by firm and by time. The variable of

interest is the triple interaction term Treat*Post*PU. If political access enables firms to reduce

underinvestment due to policy uncertainty, we expect the coefficient on the triple interaction

term to be positive and significant.




Table 10 presents the regression results. The coefficient on the triple interaction term is positive

and highly significant, suggesting that capital investment by firms with political access becomes

less negatively affected by political uncertainty after White House visits. In terms of the

economic magnitude: since the log of the overall policy uncertainty index in our sample has a

standard deviation of 0.259, Model 2 suggests that treatment firms, relative to control firms,

reduce capital investment significantly less (by 0.13 percentage points) after the visits than

before the visits in response to a one-standard-deviation increase in the index. Considering that


                                                  25
quarterly capital expenditure has a mean of 1.5 percentage points and a standard deviation of 3.4

percentage points, the magnitude is economically nontrivial. These results are consistent with

corporate managers receiving valuable information about political decisions at these meetings,

which helps mitigate the negative impact of political uncertainty on corporate investment.

4. Conclusion

In this paper, we use a novel dataset on White House visitors to identify corporate executives’

access to influential government officials. We find that about 11.4% of the firm-years have

executives that visit the White House, accounting for about 40% of the total market

capitalization of firm-years in the sample. Consistent with money buying access, we find that

political access is positively correlated with firms’ contributions to politicians’ election

campaigns. We also find that corporate executives’ meetings with key policymakers are

associated with positive abnormal stock returns. We further find evidence suggesting that

following meetings with federal government officials, firms receive more government contracts

and are more likely to receive regulatory relief (as measured by the tone of regulatory news). The

investment of these firms also becomes less affected by political uncertainty after the meetings.

Using the 2016 presidential election as a shock to firms’ political access, we find that firms with

access to the Obama administration deliver significantly lower stock returns following the

release of the election result than otherwise similar firms that do not have access. Overall, our

results provide evidence suggesting that political access is of significant value to corporations.




                                                 26
Political economists provide contrasting views about the value firms derive from political access.

At one end of the spectrum, gaining access to politicians may enable firms to gain undue

influence over elected officials and extract political favors (see, e.g., Baye, Kovenock, and de

Vries, 1993; Grossman and Helpman, 1994). Under such a view, political access facilitates quid-

pro-quo exchanges between firms and elected officials in which policy favors are exchanged for

private gains to the politicians. At the other end of the spectrum, however, political access may

enable firms to provide policy-relevant information, which in turn helps elected officials to make

more informed decisions on policies that affect the firms (see, e.g., Austen-Smith, 1995, 1998;

Cotton, 2009). Unfortunately, our data do not allow us to distinguish between these two views.

Future research could disentangle these potential explanations.

Table 2: Summary statistics

This table reports the summary statistics for the sample of firms covered by Standard & Poor’s
ExecuComp database from 2009 through 2015. The sample includes 11,846 firm-year
observations. # of White House visits is the number of White House visits by corporate
executives in a year. Political access is an indicator that takes the value of one if the executives
of the firm visit the White House at least once in a given year and zero otherwise. Campaign
contributions is the firm’s total dollar amount of political contributions to Barack Obama’s
election campaigns (i.e., the recipient is either Barack Obama or Obama Victory Fund). For firm-
years between 2009 and 2012, we use the campaign contributions in the 2007-2008 election
cycle. For firm-years between 2013 and 2015, we use the campaign contributions in the 2011-
2012 election cycle. Lobbying expenses is the total dollar amount of lobbying expenses in a year.
Procurement contracts is the total dollar value of government procurement contracts awarded in

gaming (following Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009). Total assets is the book value of total assets.
Book-to-market is the book value of common equity divided by the market value of common
equity. Tangible is the ratio of property, plant and equipment to total assets. ROA is income
before extraordinary items (Compustat item IB) divided by total assets. Book leverage is the ratio
of total debt to the book value of total assets. # of employees is the number of employees (in
thousands). Market share is the firm’s share in the total sales of its industry. Herfindahl index is
the sum of the squares of the percentages of a firm’s sales in its industry.

Table 3: Characteristics of firms with political access
This table presents regression analysis of the characteristics of firms with political access. The
first two columns estimate OLS regressions with the logarithm of one plus the number of White
House visits by corporate executives as the dependent variable, and the last two columns
estimate probit regressions with an indicator for political access as the dependent variable. The
political access indicator takes the value of one if the executives of the firm visit the White
House at least once in a given year and zero otherwise. All regressions include year fixed effects
and industry fixed effects. We cluster standard errors by firm. Numbers in parentheses are t-
statistics based on standard errors clustered by firm. Significance at the 10% (*), 5% (**), or 1%
level (***) is indicated.

Table 4: Cumulative abnormal returns around corporate executives’ White House visits

This table presents cumulative abnormal returns around corporate executives’ visits to the White
House. We consider four different windows surrounding the date of the visit (Day 0). Abnormal
returns are calculated as the return in excess of CRSP value-weighted market returns. Top aides
are White House staffers that make the maximum salary of $172,200. All other staffers are
classified as other officials. Significance at the 10% (*), 5% (**), or 1% level (***) is indicated.

Table 7: Stock market reactions to the 2016 presidential election
This table presents regression analysis of the stock market reaction to the election of Donald J.
Trump as the President of the U.S. on November 8, 2016. The dependent variable the three-day
cumulative abnormal return immediately following the release of the election result, i.e., from
November 9 to November 11, 2016. Abnormal returns are calculated as the return in excess of
CRSP value-weighted market returns. Political access is an indicator that takes the value of one
if the executives of the firm visit the White House at least once during the Obama administration
and zero otherwise. Number of visits is the number of visits to the White House by the firm’s
executives during our sample period. Stock price run-up is the cumulative abnormal return
during the 40-day window immediately before the election. We aggregate the dollar value of
campaign contributions, lobbying expenses, and procurement contracts during the sample year
from 2009 through 2015. See Table 2 for the definition of other variables. All regressions
include industry fixed effects. Numbers in parentheses are t-statistics based on standard errors
clustered by industry. Significance at the 10% (*), 5% (**), or 1% level (***) is indicated.

Inquirer’s Harvard Psychosocial Dictionary to categorize words as either positive or negative.
We classify a regulatory news article as positive (negative) if the difference between the
proportion of positive words in the news and that of negative words is in the top (bottom) tercile.
∆(Positive News Counts) is the number of positive regulatory news articles during the 12 months
immediately following a White House visit minus that during the 12 months immediately before

This table presents regression analysis of the influence of White House visits on the sensitivity of
corporate investment to policy uncertainty. The dependent variable is quarterly capital
expenditure (capital expenditure/lagged total assets) in quarter t + 1. Following Gulen and Ion
(2016), we control for Tobin’s q, operating cash flows, and sales growth. The policy uncertainty
index from Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2013). Treatment is an indicator that takes the value of one
if the executives of the firm visit the White House and zero otherwise. Post is an indicator that
takes the value of one if the fiscal quarter is within 12 months after the White House visit and
zero otherwise. All regressions include firm fixed effects and time fixed effects. We cluster
standard errors by firm and by time. Numbers in parentheses are t-statistics. Significance at the
10% (*), 5% (**), or 1% level (***) is indicated.
