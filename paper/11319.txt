Volatility in an Era of Reduced Uncertainty: Lessons from Pax Britannica

                                            ABSTRACT

Although it has been well established that financial volatility is related to news and macroeconomic

shocks, there has been less emphasis on the importance of underlying economic and political

stability. In this paper we study the behavior of consol returns since 1729 and identify a greater-than-

50% decline in volatility from the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 until the First World War.

News events and macroeconomic variables cannot account for this extended period of reduced

volatility. Underlying political stability under Pax Britannica seems to be a more likely explanation,

however.

         Volatility in an Era of Reduced Uncertainty: Lessons from Pax Britannica


1. Introduction

There is considerable evidence indicating that financial market volatility is related to news.

Significant economic and political events can have dramatic impacts on markets. Patterns in

financial market activity often mimic various measures of public news (Niederhoffer, 1971;

Penman, 1987; Berry and Howe, 1993; Jones, Lamont and Lumsdaine, 1999) and are directly

related to macroeconomic policy moves and other government announcements (Ederington and

Lee, 1993; Fleming and Remolona, 1999; Fair, 2002; 2003). While relationships between

different measures of news and volatility are well established, there is little evidence that news

can explain more than a small fraction of the movement in financial markets ex-post. The

overall proportion of the movement in security prices that can be explained by news is low

regardless of whether the analysis is focused on individual securities (Roll, 1988), the overall

equity market (Cutler, Poterba and Summers, 1989; Talmor, Haugen and Torous, 1991; Mitchell

and Mulherin, 1994), futures markets (Fair, 2002; 2003) or bond markets (Jones, Lamont and

Lumsdaine, 1999). Individual macroeconomic series like inflation and unemployment,

meanwhile, have generally been found to have limited explanatory power in such studies (cf,

Schwert, 1989a). As a result, our understanding of what causes financial market volatility is still

quite limited.

       In this paper we explore the idea that volatility at any point in time is not only related to

single isolated events but also is dependent upon the overall economic and political climate.

Increased stock market volatility during the Great Depression, for example, may reflect not only

increased short-run uncertainty but also more fundamental concerns about whether the capitalist
system itself would survive (Schwert, 1989a; Voth, 2002).1 Stability in financial markets is

scarcely possible if the economic and political regime is under threat. In this paper we use long-

run data on British consols to examine how changes in financial market volatility since 1729

may be linked to stability over the course of Britain’s imperial era. We find a striking decline in

volatility over the 1816-1913 period at the height of Britain’s imperial power, an era of British

preeminence known as Pax Britannica. Greater uncertainty associated with the various conflicts

with France prior to Napoleon’s final defeat at Waterloo in 1815 is reflected not only in large

event-driven moves in consol prices but also significantly higher average volatility than the post-

1815 period. After remaining low during the period of Pax Britannica, volatility then rises again

following renewed global conflict with the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.

         Consols themselves are a well-known textbook case where the bond price is exactly

inversely related to interest rates. This special property follows from their not having a fixed

redemption date but rather promising a fixed coupon payment indefinitely – or, at least, so long

as the British government stood behind its obligation to bondholders. By the end of the

eighteenth century consols were an established bellwether security and remained an important

debt instrument into the early part of the twentieth century (see, for example, Giffen, 1899;

Hargreaves, 1930). Moreover, before Britain’s exit from the gold standard in 1931, nominal

debt obligations were effectively fixed in real terms. Under these circumstances, Barro (1999)

argues that consols, as indexed perpetuities with constant real payouts, are the optimal form of

 By contrast, even the worst nineteenth century US financial panics appear to have produced no lasting volatility
effects (Schwert, 1989b). It remains to be seen whether the increased volatility at the end of the 1990s will prove to
be just another such blip or something more ominous (Schwert, 2002).

                                                          2
debt finance. Barro (1987, p. 225) also points to the absence of “most other governmental

interventions, such as extensive price and interest-rate controls, which often accompany wars.”2

        Amidst the extensive and continuing literature on the impact of the British Empire, its

potential role in bringing stability to financial markets has received surprisingly little attention.

Although it is hard, if not impossible, to fully quantify the effects of the dramatic reduction in

the volatility of consol returns after 1815, we show that consol returns are on average higher

during the 1816-1913 period compared to the British experience before and after this interval.

Moreover, the high level of interest rate stability clearly distinguished British financial markets

from those of the other powers. The growth of bankers’ deposits in London to a level more than

double the combined totals in Paris, New York and the German Empire in the early 1870s

(Bagehot, 1873) itself occurred in the midst of the period of greatly enhanced stability in consol

returns that prevailed until the outbreak of the First World War.3



2. Data

Our series on British 3% consols is drawn from the international database provided by Global

Financial Data, Inc. (http://www.globalfindata.com). Pre-1751 data are based on the perpetual

3% annuities that were first issued in 1726 – with the various series all being combined into 3%

consols under the 1751 Consolidating Act (Neal, 1990, p. 117). The 1751 debt was redeemed

and replaced by new “Goschen” consols that yielded 2.75% from 1889-1903 and 2.5% after

1903. Under the terms of this conversion, first proposed by Chancellor of the Exchequer G. J.

  In addition to Barro’s (1987) analysis of the movement of consols yields over the 1730-1913 period, shorter sub-
periods have been examined by Brown and Easton (1989), Elmendorf, Hirschfeld and Weil (1996), Mitchell, Brown
and Easton (2002) and Ferguson (2003).
3
  The long period of relative quiescence in consol prices after Waterloo also coincides with a period of increased

Goschen in his March 9, 1888 speech, the new consols could be called in at par after April 1923

(for details, see Miller, 1890; Harley, 1976; Klovland, 1994). The old consols had generally

only been redeemable upon receipt of a year’s notice and in lots of not less than £500,000

(Miller, 1890, p. 438). Although consols generally traded below par for most of our sample

period, we allow for the potential effect that expectations of forced redemption may have had on

volatility.4

         We begin with an overview of the evolution of consol prices over the post-1729 period as

depicted in Figure 1. By ending the sample period in 1959 we exclude the inflationary period

that sets in during the 1960s. This means that nominal returns remain roughly equivalent to real

returns over our estimation period and -- in sharp contrast to later developments -- it is unlikely

that inflation expectations exerted more than a negligible influence on investor behavior.

Although a case could also be made for ending the estimation period even earlier, either at the

time of the First World War (Barro, 1987) or with Britain’s final exit from the gold standard in

1931, the results of formal structural break tests suggest no major shift in the series occurs until

the late 1950s.5

         Consol prices trade in a relatively narrow range over the 230 year period. Following

brief spells below 80% of par during such episodes as the Jacobite Rebellion (1745-1746), the

latter part of “King George’s War” with France (March 1748), and the Seven Years’ War (1754-

1763), the consols return to these depressed levels at the beginning of the American Revolution


financial market integration (Sylla, Wilson and Wright, 2004).
4
  While the prices of consols are also subject to the usual ex-dividend effects on the days when the quarterly (or,
until 1884, semi-annual) interest payments were made, we have not corrected for this as it could not be expected to
significantly change the long-run evolution of consol prices over the 230 year sample period that we examine.
5
  Testing for structural breaks in consol prices over the full available sample of 1729-2002 using the Bai and Perron
(1998) and Banerjee, Lumsdaine and Stock (1992) procedures always identifies a single break in the period around
1960. (Testing for breaks in consol returns yields no significant break points.)

and experience a continual decline until 1785. From 1786, when a major debt reduction act was

passed,6 until 1792 we see an uptrend that brings consol prices nearly back to par. The war with

post-revolutionary France (1793-1802) begins another period of increased volatility and price

declines, however, that despite intermittent reverses did not come to an end until the final defeat

of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815.

        The majority of the large shifts in the consol series fall between the Seven Years’ War

and Waterloo. Over that period, Britain and France were essentially competing for world

supremacy and consol prices appear highly sensitive to military events and news signaling the

outbreak or cessation of hostilities. After Waterloo, the consols begin a period of slow increase

and seem to be much less sensitive to military events. The sustained uptrend in consol prices is

briefly interrupted by a sharp decline during the 1819-1820 period, which coincided with a

return to the gold standard, and then another decline beginning in early 1825 and lasting until

mid 1826 that coincided with a banking crisis (Kynaston, 1995; Neal, 1998). From April 1831

until September 1910 the bonds never traded below 80% of par value and frequently traded at

above 100% of par value, peaking at 113.75% of par in May 1897.

        The extended period of strength and stability in consol prices includes, at its center, the

1837-1901 reign of the Queen Victoria at the zenith of the British Empire. This was a period of

remarkable political stability within Britain and worldwide. The most significant drop during the

period occurs over the 1846 to 1850 interval, coinciding with both the 1848 revolution in France

and the Irish potato famine -- and closely following the budgetary problems of the 1840s that


6
 The National Debt Reduction Act that was passed in 1786 established Prime Minster William Pitt’s sinking fund
for the consols. These measures followed a proposal by Dr. Richard Price that was referred to in the King’s Speech
of 1782 and which was the subject of correspondence between Pitt and Price after Pitt became Prime Minister in
1784 (see Hargreaves, 1930, Chapter VI).

saw the reintroduction of the income tax in 1842 under Prime Minister Robert Peel.7 Neither

the Crimean War (1854-1856) nor the American Civil War (1861-1865) appears to have had

effects on consol prices remotely comparable to major pre-1816 military events. Although

Ferguson (2003) argues that European debt series generally remain highly sensitive to war and

political shocks until 1880, our analysis suggests that these effects had already become less

important for British consols by the 1820s. Even large losses like the 10,000 men annihilated by

the Mahdi’s forces in Sudan in 1883, while causing great consternation in England at the time

(see, for example, Farwell, 1972, p. 272), appear to have made no dent in consol prices. From

the 1897 peak, consol prices begin a slow but steady decline, however, with prices bottoming at

less than 50% of par in the early 1920s.8

        The ten largest upward and ten largest downward monthly price shifts are set out in Table

1. Nine of the ten largest monthly price increases occur between 1748 and 1814 and appear to

be associated either with favorable developments in the various wars with France or with major

financial policy changes. There are three shifts in 1761-1762 in the face of British captures of

French territory near the end of the Seven Years’ War9 and there are four further shifts in 1798-

1801 during the further conflict with France following the French Revolution. Additional large

gains occur in 1748 with the conclusion of “King George’s War” against France. The 1797

gains coincide with the easing of credit conditions after the suspension of gold convertibility in

February 1797, while the June 1799 increase occurs in the midst of the first collections from

  The income tax had previously been abolished in 1816 after the conclusion of the Napoleonic wars.
8
  After a temporary recovery following Britain's exit from the Gold Standard in 1931, consol prices renew their
decline until the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. While the existence of capital controls in
and around the war period make it difficult to interpret the changes, some of the gains seen over the 1939-1947
period may reflect a renewed “flight to quality” of funds exiting Continental Europe.

  The February 1762 successes in the Caribbean were themselves closely followed by the initiation of settlement
talks by French emissaries in the early spring of 1762 (Koehn, 1994, p. 15).

Britain’s new income tax as well as Britain’s entry into the Second Coalition against France.10

The imminent first defeat of Napoleon in early 1814 appears to lie behind another large price

increase in January 1814. The single top-ten price increase in the twentieth century occurs in

July 1932. This shift occurs in the month following hefty interest rate cuts in June 1932 that

formed part of the War Loan conversion. As was true in 1797, the easing seems to have

triggered a bond market rally.

         As with the increases, a majority of the ten largest monthly price declines are

concentrated in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Seven of the ten largest shifts

occur between 1778 and 1815. The March 1778 shift appears to be associated with French entry

on the American side in the fight against British rule and further shifts occur in 1792 and 1799

following the outbreak of France’s own revolutionary war. There is another negative shift in

1803 in the year when renewed fighting erupted against Napoleon and a March 1815 shift occurs

at the time that Napoleon reclaimed Paris after escaping from exile on Elba. There are three top-

ten decreases in the twentieth century. The first of these, in January 1915, occurs in the first

month that trading resumed following the outbreak of the First World War. The second shift in

September 1931 appears to be triggered by Britain’s exit from the international gold standard.

The final shift in February 1937 occurs at the time of a new UK Government proposal for a £400

million loan to fund re-armament expenditures (coincident with a Nationalist offensive in the

Spanish Civil War).11 The existence of a 1937 shift but no large shift with the outbreak of the

   The first payments on the new tax were due in June 1799 and Neal (2000, p. 138) emphasizes that, with interest
payments on the 3% consols now guaranteed against income tax revenues, the government was able “to tap into the
profits of European merchants now directing all their affairs from London .. [allowing] huge sums to be raised on the
capital markets.”
11
   The Financial Chronicle (February 13, 1937, p. 991) refers to the capture of Malaga as an event that “broke the
long deadlock in the Spanish rebellion” and also discusses the role played by Italian “volunteers” in the assault on
the city. Re-armament concerns were also rising at the same time, however (see the Financial Chronicle, February

Second World War in 1939 may reflect the interest rate controls -- as well as capital controls --

that were imposed during the war with Germany.12

         The fact that the majority of the largest movements occur before 1816 is consistent with

the enhanced stability of consols during most of the nineteenth century. Figure 2 shows the

monthly percentage changes in the consol series. Volatility clearly seems to decline during the

first quarter of the nineteenth century and is much lower during the second half of century than

in the rest of the sample. There is also a sharp decline in volatility during the period surrounding

the Second World War, which is consistent with the existence of wartime control measures.13



3. Volatility vs. Stability in Consol Prices

The post-Waterloo period of stability is clearly evident in Figure 3, which lays out the

conditional standard deviation of consol returns over the 1730-1959 period. These conditional

standard deviations are derived from estimation of the time series properties of the variance of

consol returns as laid out in Table 2 (column 1) below. The data are modeled as a generalized

autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) process with one autoregressive (AR) term

in the mean equation and the lagged squared residuals and the lagged conditional variance

included alongside a “premium” term that allows for potential callability effects – with the

PREMIUM variable defined as the percentage difference between the log of the bond price and


20, 1937; and The Economist, February 13, 1937 and February 20, 1937), and the sharp downturn in consol prices
more likely reflects budgetary concerns rather than the events in Spain.
12
   Exports from Britain not deemed necessary to the war effort were disallowed and countries exporting to Britain
largely accrued funds that were placed in special accounts and could not readily be remitted outside their own
territory (see Harrod, 1958, Chapter 5). Domestically, rent controls were imposed upon the outbreak of war and
general price controls followed at the beginning of 1940. Brown (1955, p. 211) points out that all this left little room
for interest rates to be affected by expectations of inflation: “Income receivers accumulated funds because their
opportunities for spending on consumer goods and services were curtailed, mainly by rationing and price control.”
13
   By terminating our sample in 1959 we do, of course, miss the ensuing prolonged decline in consol prices that sets

                                                           8
the log of 100.14 We employ a t-distribution (t-GARCH) throughout in order to account for the

fat-tailed innovations typical in financial data (Bollerslev, 1987).15 The ARCH and GARCH

parameters are always significant at the 99% level in the full-sample results shown in Table 2.

We find that the sum of the ARCH and GARCH coefficients is close to one indicating a high

degree of persistence in the conditional variance of consol returns. The premium also has a

negative impact that is significant at the 95% level or better in all the specifications. This

provides some evidence that volatility declines as the probability of redemption increases.

        The high volatility period before Waterloo reaches its peak around the turn of the

nineteenth century, with some of the greatest volatility seemingly arising around the time of the

1789 French revolution. By contrast, the post-1815 period was marked by considerable

domestic political and financial stability with no constitutional crises of the type that emerged in

the late eighteenth century. The decline in volatility after Waterloo is really quite dramatic, with

the extent of the fluctuations falling to less than half of the earlier levels. Although this decline

is briefly punctured by events such as the banking crises of the 1820s, the 1848 revolution in

France (followed in 1854 by the Crimean War), and the outbreak of the Boer War in 1899, the

contrast with the earlier period is unequivocal. The First World War subsequently appears to

trigger another high volatility period. While the fluctuations do not generally match the

magnitudes seen in the early part of the sample, the large “spike” in the standard deviation of the

series at the beginning of the 1930s exceeds anything seen during either of the two world wars.



in with the inflationary trend of the 1960s and 1970s that drove interest rates to higher and higher levels.
14
   We are grateful to an anonymous referee for suggesting this approach to capturing the potential effects of
redemption on volatility.
15
   All models presented in Tables 2 and 3 use t-distributions of approximately 5 to 6 degrees of freedom. We
experimented with changing the degrees of freedom but it did not change the results. Re-estimation using EGARCH
(Nelson, 1991) as a robustness check had no effect on any of the inferences drawn below.

                                                       9
This is consistent with the volatility spike in the interwar period seen in British stock market data

and other major national stock markets (Voth, 2002) including the United States (Schwert,

1989a).

         The sharp decline in the volatility of consol returns after the end of the Napoleonic wars in

1815 itself occurs well in advance of the heyday of the classical gold standard, which is usually

dated from 1880-1913. The low volatility period does, however, appear to correspond well with the

period of Pax Britannica. In order to formally test for the relative importance of Pax Britannica

(PAX: 1816-1913) vs. the classical gold standard (GOLD: 1880-1913) we enter dummies for these

two periods in our conditional variance specification of consol returns, estimated still using t-

GARCH as a (1,1) process.16 We also control for the effects of inflation (INF), allowing for up to a

three-period lag.17 This variable allows for the premise that financial stability is directly tied to

stability in aggregate prices (Bordo, Wheelock and Decker, 2003). Real effects are controlled for by

adding a dummy for whether or not the economy is in a state of recession (RECESS).18 We also

include dummy variables for the Napoleonic Wars (NAP: 1803-1815), the First World War (WWI:

1914-1918) and the Second World War (WWII: 1939-1945).

         Amongst the dummy variables, only the Pax Britannica and Second World War terms are

significant in the full specification given in Table 2 (column 5). Although the premium remains

significant throughout, the inflation terms, the recession dummy, the gold standard dummy and the

based upon Gayer, Rostow and Schwartz (1953) for 1790-1850 and updated from various standard UK statistical
sources for the post-1850 period. This does, however, restrict our estimation period to 1790 on as there are no data
for earlier years.

   The recession dates for 1790-1850 are drawn from Gayer, Rostow and Schwartz (1953, p.348). The later

WWI dummy all have standard errors larger than the estimated coefficients.19 The Napoleon

dummy is also insignificant. The PAX dummy is significant at the 95% confidence level with the

expected negative sign. This confirms the impression of the graphical display in Figure 3 and

suggests that, at least in Britain’s case, the classical gold standard was not the major factor in

explaining the dramatic reduction in the variance of consol returns. If we also restimate the model

over the full 1729-1959 sample without the inflation and recession variables (which are available

only from 1790), we find that the PAX dummy remains significant at the 95% and the WWII dummy

is still significant -- albeit only at the 90% level (Table 2 (column (4)). The premium variable

remains significant at the 99% level, the NAPOLEON dummy is significant at the 90% level while

the inflation terms and RECESS and GOLD dummies are all insignificant.

         Finally, we also re-ran the t-GARCH model over a more restricted 1790-1913 period to

exclude the later upward drift in prices after the outbreak of the First World War. The results in

Table 3 reaffirm the significance of the PAX dummy. The PREMIUM variable also continues to be

significant at the 99% level while the inflation terms and the NAPOLEON, the RECESS and GOLD

dummies are all insignificant.

         As shown in Table 4, the low volatility Pax Britannica period has higher average consol

returns than both the preceding period and the post-Pax Britannica period and only the much shorter

Second World War period features higher nominal returns than those enjoyed between 1816 and

1913.20 Meanwhile, the stability of the British series after Waterloo appears to not only be high

relative to its own past and future but also relative to other national government securities. Table 5


19
   The same holds true if we expand our definition of the classical gold standard to cover the full 1870-1913 period.
Meanwhile, the insignificance of the macroeconomic variables accords with their small explanatory power in prior
analysis of financial data.
20
   Pax Britannica does not feature consistently lower inflation volatility or lower incidence of recession, however.

1949 period for which the French series is available. The French data, like the consols, are taken

from the Global Financial database (http://www.globalfindata.com). Over the whole period for

which rentes data are available, and also over the 1825-1913 period, the standard deviation of the

French rentes is approximately double that of the British consols. Interestingly, the standard

deviation of consol returns before Pax Britannica stands, like the rentes standard deviation, at almost

exactly double the Pax Britannica level.



4. Conclusions

The consol data certainly indicate a period of greater financial stability during the era of Pax

Britannica. The impact of Britain’s leadership may also have been transmitted abroad. It is

telling that Ferguson and Schularick (2004) find that even foreign debt issuers within the British

Empire enjoyed a reduction in borrowing costs compared to countries outside the empire. More

controversially, Kindleberger (1986) goes even further in suggesting that the whole world

system was better off under Britain’s leadership. In any event, we have evidence of a striking

relationship between political stability and volatility of consols, the bellwether financial

instrument of the day. Economic and political stability are unlikely to be divorced from financial

market volatility in other periods as well.

       This line of research is also important to our broader understanding of volatility. Much of

the research on volatility has focused on specific events and specific relationships between

economic conditions and volatility. While such links exist and are important, they fail to explain

much of the underlying volatility in financial markets. Our results suggest that the underlying


                                                  12
political and economic stability better explains an extended period of reduced volatility. In a

similar vein, Voth (2002) finds that the increased volatility surrounding the interwar period was

due to greater political instability. This points to the need for better measures of economic and

political stability and supports their use in future research of volatility over time. In addition,

measuring the underlying stability of industries and the changing probability of important

technological and regulatory changes in those industries may help to better explain volatility in

cross-section studies.

Table 2
GARCH(1, 1) Models of Consol Return Volatility, 1729-1959
The GARCH (1,1) model for consol returns can be written as:

RETURN t = δRETURN t −1 + ε t
ht = ω0 + αε t2−1 + βht −1 + γPREMIUM t + a1INFt-1 + a 2 INFt-2 + a3 INFt-3 + a 4 RECESS t +
a5 NAPt + a6 PAX t + a 7 GOLD t + a8 WWI t + a 9 WWII t

Rt is the rate of return for British consols in month t where return is defined as the natural log of
the consol price in month t minus the natural log of the consol price in month t-1. ht is the
conditional variance of the consol return for month t. The GARCH(1, 1) models are estimated
using maximum likelihood with a t-distribution. We estimated the degrees of freedom to be
approximately 5 - 6 for all the models. The PREMIUM variable is defined as the percentage
difference between the natural log of the bond price and the natural log of 100. The inflation
variable (INF) is defined as the natural log of monthly wholesale prices in month t minus the
natural log of monthly wholesale prices in month t-1. The wholesale price series is based upon
Gayer, Rostow and Schwartz (1953) for 1790-1850 and updated from various standard UK
statistical sources for the post-1850 period. The recession variable is a dummy variable that is
equal to one during an economic downturn and zero otherwise. The recession dates for 1790-
1850 are taken from Gayer, Rostow and Schwartz (1953, p.348). The later recession dates are
drawn from Burns and Mitchell (1946) and Dow (1998). The war dummies are zero-one
indicator variables representing the Napoleonic Wars (NAP: May 1803- May 1815), the First
World War (WWI: August 1914 - November 1918) and the Second World War (WWII:
September 1939 - August 1945). The PAX variable takes a value of one for the period 1816-
1913 and zero otherwise. GOLD is a dummy variable that takes the value of one during the
classical gold standard period (1880-1913). The sample size is 2762.

Table 4
Descriptive Statistics for Consol Returns, Inflation, and Recessions by Period
Monthly Consol Returns are defined as the natural log of the consol price in month t minus the
natural log of the consol price in month t-1. Inflation is the monthly change in the natural log of
the wholesale price series. The recession variable is a zero-one indicator variable that is equal to
one when the economy is in a recession. The sources for the data and further data descriptions
are provided in Table 1 and Table 2.

Table 5:
Comparison of Consol and French Rente Return Standard Deviations
The standard deviations of consol returns and French government 3% rentes over the 1825-1949
period for which the French series is available. The French data, like the consols, are taken from
the Global Financial database (http://www.globalfindata.com). The standard deviation of the
consol returns for the PAX period is only for the period of overlap (1825-WWI) and not for the
entire Pax Britannica period (1816-1913). In addition, the Post-Pax Britannica period ends with
the Rente sample in 1949 instead of 1959.
