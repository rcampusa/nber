                                         ABSTRACT

This is the first study to examine the effect of experiencing a widespread, deadly epidemic on
voting behavior. Using data on elections to the U.S House of Representatives and leveraging
cross-district variation in HIV/AIDS mortality during the period 1983-1987, we document the
effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on votes received by Democratic and Republican candidates.
Beginning with the 1994 elections, there is a strong, positive association between HIV/AIDS
mortality and the vote share received by Democratic candidates. Congressional districts that bore
the brunt of the HIV/AIDS epidemic also saw substantial increases in Democratic voter turnout
and contributions made to Democratic candidates.

     If the Reagan administration bureaucracy manages to mishandle the issue and it

1. Introduction

    On June 5, 1981, the first scientific account of what would become known as human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was pub-
lished by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (1981). Over the next few years,
HIV/AIDS spread quickly through the gay communities of major American cities. By the
end of 1984, HIV had been identified as the cause of AIDS (Gallo and Montagnier 2003) and
the official U.S. death count had climbed past 5,500 (Francis 2012).
    During the early years of the epidemic, local grass-roots organizations such as the Gay
Men's Health Crisis launched prevention programs intended to curb the spread of new infec-
tions (Arno 1986; Chambr´
                        e 2006; Brier 2009; Parker 2011) while AIDS activists demanded
that government officials take action (Elbaz 1995; Chambr´
                                                         e 2006, pp. 115-118). As media
coverage of the epidemic intensified (McCoy and Khoury 1990; Burd 1993) and fear of con-
tracting HIV/AIDS grew among heterosexuals, Congress came under increasing pressure to
respond (Shaw 1987; Padamsee 2018). The Health Omnibus Programs Extension (HOPE)
Act, which appropriated approximately $800 million per year for HIV/AIDS education, re-
search and testing, was passed with bipartisan support in October of 1988 (Molotsky 1988).
    Looking ahead to the November elections of that year, both Democratic and Republican
strategists were convinced that HIV/AIDS would be a key issue (Luther 1987; Weinraub

                                             1
1987). Election-day exit polls, however, suggest that voters cared more about national
security, the economy and crime than they did about healthcare-related issues and the fight
against HIV/AIDS (Blendon and Donelan 1989). Whether the HIV/AIDS epidemic--and
the public health response to the epidemic--had an appreciable impact on the 1988 elections,
or subsequent elections, is an open question.
       In this study, we use data at the congressional district level to estimate the effects
of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on votes and campaign contributions received by Democratic
and Republican candidates to the U.S House of Representatives during the period 1988-
2000. It is, to our knowledge, the first study to estimate the effects of experiencing a
widespread, deadly epidemic on these types of political outcomes. In order to distinguish
the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic from other factors and secular trends, we leverage
cross-district variation in HIV/AIDS mortality during what we characterize as the "treatment
period," 1983-1987. Intuitively, our identification strategy compares the evolution of political
outcomes over time in districts that bore the brunt of the epidemic to those that were
relatively unscathed. From the outset, it is important to note that this identification strategy
is not designed to gauge nation-wide shifts in attitudes or opinions. Such shifts will be
captured by election-year fixed effects. Instead, our interest is in whether the outcomes
under study were impacted by the local intensity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
       A large number of previous studies have examined the effects of economic conditions on
U.S. elections.1 Their results suggest that, as a general rule, Democratic candidates benefit
from higher unemployment, while Republican candidates are punished, perhaps because
American voters view Democrats more capable of handling economic crises (Rees et al. 1962;
Wright 2012; Burden and Wichowsky 2014). There is also evidence, albeit based entirely on
events taking place outside of the United States, that international terrorist attacks increase
   1
     Lewis-Beck and Stegmaier (2000) review early studies on economic conditions and election outcomes.
More recent studies include Anderson (2000); Wright (2012); Burden and Wichowsky (2014); Lindvall (2014);
De la Poza, J´odar, and Pricop (2017) and Helgason and M´  erola (2017). See also Autor et al. (Forthcoming),
who examined the effects of trade shocks on political opinions and voting patterns. They found that con-
gressional districts disproportionately exposed to import competition were more likely to elect a Republican
to the U.S. House of Representatives.

the vote share received by right-wing, nationalistic candidates (Berrebi and Klor 2008; Gould
and Klor 2010; Kibris 2011; Getmansky and Zeitzoff 2014; Peri, Rees, and Smith 2020).2
       The closest study to ours is by Campante, Depetris-Chauvin, and Durante (2020). In
September of 2014, a Liberian national visiting Dallas, Texas was diagnosed with Ebola.
Two nurses who treated him in the hospital also contracted the disease as did a doctor
who had just returned to New York City from Guinea, where he had treated Ebola patients
(Bell et al. 2016). Campante, Depetris-Chauvin, and Durante (2020) showed that these 4
cases received extensive coverage in the U.S. press and caused concern, even panic, among
the general public. They found that concern about Ebola was negatively related to voter
turnout and Democratic vote share in the November 2014 elections; Ebola concern was,
however, essentially unrelated to presidential approval ratings.
       The public health response to the Ebola outbreak in the United States was clearly
effective (Bell et al. 2016). The outbreak was limited in scope and there is no evidence that
its impact on politics extended beyond the 2014 elections. By contrast, the public health
response to HIV/AIDS has been consistently characterized as underfunded and lacking in
urgency (Shilts 1987; Brier 2009; Francis 2012). Today, it is estimated that 1.1 million
Americans live with HIV and that 38,000 new infections occur every year.3 Although the
HIV/AIDS epidemic, now a pandemic (Merson et al. 2008), is acknowledged to have had
profound (and ongoing) socioeconomic effects in the United States (Nelkin, Willin, and
Parris 1991; Timmons and Fesko 2004; Law et al. 2007; Rushing 2018), only a handful of
empirical studies have attempted to document the existence of these effects and gauge their
magnitude.4
   2
      Gasper and Reeves (2011); Ben-Ezra et al. (2013), and Nakajo, Kobayashi, and Arai (2019) provide
evidence that natural disasters can impact voting behavior. Barone et al. (2016); Halla, Wagner, and
Zweim¨ uller (2017), and Mayda, Peri, and Steingress (2018) explore the effects of immigration on election
outcomes. Using data from Gallup World Polls (2006-2018), Askoy, Eichengreen, and Saka (2020) document
a negative association between exposure to an epidemic as a young adult (ages 18-25) and confidence in
political institutions.

nority HIV/AIDS Fund. (https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics).
    4
      A large number of studies provide estimates of the effects of HIV/AIDS on economic growth and devel-
opment in Africa. See Dixon, McDonald, and Roberts (2002) for a review of this literature. Fortson (2009;

     Our results, detailed below, suggest that the HIV/AIDS epidemic benefited Democratic
House candidates at the expense of their Republican counterparts, although these effects took
several election cycles to manifest. During the pre-treatment period, there is no evidence
that the outcomes under consideration were systematically related to HIV/AIDS mortality
rates. Likewise, the epidemic does not appear to have affected voting behavior in the 1988
and 1990 elections. By the mid-1990s, however, HIV/AIDS mortality during the treatment
period is clearly and positively related to the vote share received by Democratic candidates,
Democratic voter turnout, and campaign contributions made to Democratic candidates; as
a consequence, Democratic candidates running in congressional districts that bore the brunt
of the HIV/AIDS epidemic experienced substantial increases in their probability of winning.
     The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we provide
historical context and then briefly describe previous studies that have examined the socioe-
conomic effects of HIV/AIDS. Our data sources, outcomes and identification strategy are
described in Sections 3 and 4. In Section 5, we report our principal results; in Section 6,
we report results from a series of robustness checks and extensions; and in Section 7, we
examine the association between HIV/AIDS mortality and campaign contributions. Section
8 concludes.


2. Background

2.1. The progression and politics of HIV/AIDS

     Before it was recognized as a new disease, HIV/AIDS had made the jump from New
York City to San Francisco and Los Angeles (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
1981; Worobey et al. 2016). Through the early 1980s, these three cities accounted for approx-
imately two-thirds of all reported cases in the United States (Selik, Haverkos, and Curran

2011); Chicoine (2012); Oster (2012); Chin (2013); Karlsson and Pichler (2015), and Chin and Wilson (2018)
provide additional evidence that HIV/AIDS in Africa has influenced a wide variety of socioeconomic out-
comes. Studies using U.S. data have generally focused on sexual behavior and attitudes towards homosexuals
and same-sex relations. These studies are discussed below.

                                                    4
1984; Dutt et al. 1987).
       As HIV/AIDS spread to other U.S. cities and their suburbs, it went from being a
disease that could easily be labeled "the gay plague" to one that affected a much broader
demographic mix, including blood transfusion recipients, hemophiliacs, intravenous drug
users, and the partners of intravenous drug users (Selik, Haverkos, and Curran 1984; Shaw
1987). By 1988, heterosexual men accounted for more than a quarter of new cases and
women accounted for 10 percent of new cases (Ellerbrock et al. 1991); fully 8 percent of
AIDS patients lived in the suburbs or a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA)
with fewer than 250,000 residents (Selik, Haverkos, and Curran 1984).
       The links between HIV/AIDS, homosexuality and drug use, along with the Reagan
administration's focus on shrinking the size of the federal government, complicated and
delayed the public health response. Local AIDS service organizations (ASOs), including
the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York City, the AIDS Project Los Angeles, and the San
Francisco AIDS Foundation, filled the void, providing a range of health, counseling, and legal
services for people with HIV/AIDS.5 Beginning in 1987, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power
(ACT UP) organized rallies and protests across the country, raising HIV/AIDS awareness
and putting pressure on the CDC and National Institutes of Health (NIH) to increase funding
for research.6
       After President Reagan described AIDS research as a "top priority" for his administra-
tion, Congress began to play a more active role (Boffey 1985; Padamsee 2018).7 For instance,
Congress tasked the CDC with developing and distributing an educational brochure about
HIV/AIDS in December of 1987 (Boodman 1988). Approximately 126 million copies of the
brochure were eventually printed and mailed to American households (Davis 1991).8 In Oc-
   5
      In addition, ASOs actively promoted "safe sex" practices and pushed local officials to support AIDS
awareness, research, and treatment (Altman 1985; Panem 1987; Kirp and Bayer 1993; Brier 2009).
    6
      It might be noted, however, that ACT UP's tactics did not always receive sympathetic coverage in the
press (Lupton 1994, p. 99; Petro 2015, pp. 158-161).
    7
      Reagan described AIDS research as a "top priority" at a press conference held on September 17, 1985.
It was the first time Reagan had publicly mentioned AIDS (Boffey 1985).
    8
      The brochure, titled Understanding AIDS, explicitly discussed the risks of anal sex and encouraged
the use of condoms (Boodman 1988). Sixty percent of Americans reported having received the brochure

                                                    5
tober of 1988, Congress passed the HOPE Act, described as the "first comprehensive effort
to combat the AIDS epidemic" (Molotsky 1988). The HOPE Act established the Office of
AIDS Research at NIH and authorized the use of approximately $800 million per year for
AIDS education, home health care, research, and testing (Molotsky 1988; Banks 1989).
     Polls conducted before the 1988 elections show that public opinion on HIV/AIDS, and
how best to combat it, was sharply divided (Singer, Rogers, and Glassman 1991; Rogers,
Singer, and Imperio 1993). For instance, one poll found that 49 percent of Americans
were in favor of mandatory testing for members of high-risk groups, a policy endorsed by
conservatives in Congress, and 47 percent of Americans were against it (Steinbrook 1987).9
According to this same poll, 30 percent of Americans thought that Democrats were more
likely to have effective proposals for combatting AIDS, 19 percent thought that Republicans
were more likely, and 18 percent thought that both parties were equally likely.10
     Although the two major political parties disagreed on how best to combat HIV/AIDS,
exit-polls suggest that the 1988 election did not turn on healthcare-related issues (Blendon
and Donelan 1989). Instead, issues relating to national security, economic prosperity, taxes,
and crime appear to have been foremost on the minds of voters (Blendon and Donelan
1989). One out of 5 voters did, however, report that healthcare was among the issues they
considered when casting their ballot (Blendon and Donelan 1989) and, according to a Gallup
poll conducted in 1987, 68 percent of Americans identified AIDS as the most urgent health



(Davis 1991). Conservative advisers to the president such as Gary Bauer and William Bennett, along with
many Republican members of the House and Senate, argued that that the government should be encouraging
abstinence and heterosexual marriage instead of "safe sex" practices (Brier 2009).
    9
      The poll, conducted in July of 1987 by the Los Angeles Times, also found that 68 percent of Americans
were in favor of criminal sanctions against people with AIDS who remained sexually active, and 29 percent
were in favor of tattooing anyone who was HIV-positive (Steinbrook 1987). William F. Buckley Jr., the editor
of the National Review, had argued the year before that "[e]veryone detected with AIDS should be tatooed
in the upper forearm, to protect common-needle users, and on the buttocks, to prevent the victimization of
other homosexuals" (Buckley Jr. 1986).
   10
      As a general rule, Democrats supported voluntary testing, anti-discrimination protections for HIV-
positive individuals, and expanded funding for research, services, and treatment; conservative Republicans
supported mandatory testing of high-risk populations, abstinence-oriented education, and reporting the
names of HIV-positive individuals to local health departments (Green 2011; Self 2012; Padamsee 2018). See
Self (2012) for a detailed description of the American political landscape in the 1980s.

problem facing the country (Moore 1997).11
       Congress passed The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE)
Act on August 4, 1990. It was signed into law by President Bush two weeks later. The Act
provided emergency assistance to communities most affected by the epidemic and funded out-
patient care (e.g., antiretroviral medications, counseling, and transportation) for uninsured
and underinsured HIV/AIDS patients (Buchanan 2002; Siplon 2002, p. 97). Its passage
reflected a fundamental shift in the politics of HIV/AIDS (Rasky 1990; Bayer 1991): across
the ideological spectrum, there was now broad agreement that the federal government should
take the leading role in the fight against the disease.
       During the 1992 campaign, "gay issues" came to the fore (Walters 2013, p. 34).12
Democrats argued that the Ryan White CARE Act should be fully funded and that HIV-
positive individuals should be protected from discrimination.13 Although Republicans at-
tacked the Democratic presidential candidate, Governor Clinton, as a supporter of homo-
sexual rights and homosexual marriage (Schmalz 1992), there was little appetite within the
party for cutting Ryan White funding.14 When the Act came up for reauthorization in 1995,
its passage was delayed by conservatives, led by Senator Helms and Representative Gin-


  11
       In October of 1987, 53 percent of Americans agreed with the statement, "The government is not doing
enough about the problem of AIDS" (Moore 1997). Ten years later, 51 percent of Americans agreed with
the same statement (Moore 1997). According to a poll conducted in November of 1991, only 29 percent of
Americans rated President Bush's response to the epidemic as "excellent" or "good"; fully 67 percent rated
it as either "fair" or "poor" (Blendon, Donelan, and Knox 1992).
    12
       See also Schmalz (1992) and German and Courtright (1999).
    13
       The Ryan White CARE Act authorized $875 million in spending for the FY 1991 (Siplon 2002, p. 97)
but Congress, which was struggling to trim the budget deficit (Conley 2017), appropriated less than one
fourth of this amount, or $221 million. In addition to pledging to fully fund the Ryan White CARE Act,
the 1992 Democratic platform pledged to "provide targeted and honest prevention campaigns; combat HIV-
related discrimination; make drug treatment available for all addicts who seek it; guarantee access to quality
care; expand clinical trials for treatments and vaccines; and speed up the FDA drug approval process."
    14
       The 1992 Republican platform pledged support for the fight against HIV/AIDS, stating that "[w]e have
committed enormous resources - $4.2 billion over the past four years for research alone, more than for any
disease except cancer." It also emphasized the role of "personal responsibility" and rejected "the notion that
the distribution of clean needles and condoms are the solution to stopping the spread of AIDS." President
Bush argued that current HIV/AIDS funding was sufficient (Schmalz 1992). Mike Huckabee, a conservative
Republican running for the U.S. Senate in 1992, argued that, "[i]n light of the extraordinary funds already
being given for AIDS research, it does not seem that additional federal spending can be justified" (Allen
2007).

grich, who insisted on mandatory testing of newborns (Seelye 1995).15 Eventually, however,
a compromise was reached and the reauthorization Act passed both houses of Congress with
overwhelming bipartisan support (Siplon 2002, p. 90, Padamsee 2018).


2.2. Previous empirical studies

       Most empirical studies on the socioeconomic effects of HIV/AIDS in the United States
have focused on sexual behavior. One of the earliest of these, Catania et al. (1991), examined
condom use among homosexual men living in San Francisco. These authors documented a
nearly four-fold increase in condom use from 1984 to 1988, presumably in response to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic. McKusick, Horstman, and Coates (1985), Martin (1987), Stall, Coates,
and Hoff (1988), and Auld (2006) provide additional evidence that gay men responded to the
epidemic by increasing their use of condoms and decreasing the number of sexual partners.
       Ahituv, Holtz, and Philipson (1996) drew upon data from the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth (NLSY-1979) for the period 1984-1990 to study condom use among young
American adults. These authors found a strong, positive association between AIDS cases
in the respondent's state of residence and the likelihood of using a condom. Francis (2008)
explored whether being exposed to AIDS can affect sexual orientation. Using nationally
representative data from the National Health and Social Life Survey, which was conducted
in 1992, Francis (2008) found a negative association between having a relative who was
diagnosed with AIDS and the likelihood of engaging in homosexual behavior among men;
among women, there was a positive association between having a relative who was diagnosed
with AIDS homosexual behavior.
       Finally, Fern´
                    andez, Parsa, and Viarengo (2019) were interested in estimating the effect of
the HIV/AIDS epidemic on attitudes towards homosexuals in the United States. Using data
from the General Social Survey (GSS) from the period 1973-2002, these authors documented
a substantial shift in public opinion in 1992, the year in which "gay issues" became more
  15
     Senator Helms argued that federal funding for people living with HIV/AIDS should be cut because of
their "deliberate, disgusting, revolting conduct" (Seelye 1995).

                                                  8
visible in politics (Walters 2013, p. 34). Specifically, they found that the percentage of
respondents who approved of same-sex relations went from approximately 20 percent to
well over 30 percent. Regression analysis showed that states hardest-hit by the epidemic (as
measured by the cumulative HIV/AIDS mortality rate through 1992) experienced the largest
increases in approval. The results of Ahituv, Holtz, and Philipson (1996), Francis (2008) and
Fern´
    andez, Parsa, and Viarengo (2019) provide evidence that the impact of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic in the United States extended well beyond homosexual men and intravenous drug
users.16


3. Data

3.1. HIV/AIDS Mortality

       Information on deaths attributable to HIV/AIDS comes from the National Vital Statis-
tics System (NVSS), made available by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
The NVSS contains vital registration data for the United States, including mortality counts
by cause at the county level. We aggregated HIV/AIDS deaths to the congressional dis-
trict level after adjusting for decadal shifts in both county and district boundaries using a
standard areal interpolation procedure.17
       At the start of the epidemic, physicians and medical examiners attributed HIV/AIDS
deaths to a wide variety of causes (including immune disorders, pneumonia and skin cancer),
making it impossible to obtain accurate counts (Kristal 1985). In early 1983, the ICD-9

  16
      See also Chesson, Dee, and Arral (2003) and Lakdawalla and Goldman (2006). Using panel data at
the state-year level, Chesson, Dee, and Arral (2003) found a negative association between AIDS mortality
rates and syphilis incidence rates among men. Using data from a nationally representative study of HIV-
positive patients (the HIV Costs and Services Utilization Study), Lakdawalla and Goldman (2006) found
that providing treatment to HIV-positive individuals was associated with a more than two-fold increase in
the number of their sex partners.

      Specifically, we constructed crosswalk weights based on the overlap between counties and congressional
districts. For instance, if half of County A overlapped with District B, then we assigned half of County A's
HIV/AIDS deaths to District B. Implicitly, this procedure assumes that HIV/AIDS deaths are uniformly
distributed within counties. Crosswalk weights were adjusted to reflect the changing relationship between
counties and congressional districts after redistricting. See Markoff and Shapiro (1973) and Goodchild and
Lam (1980) for early examples of researchers using this procedure.

                                                     9
code 279.1 ("deficiency of cell-mediated immunity") was adopted for HIV/AIDS deaths.18
Although the use of other ICD codes on death certificates was not completely eliminated,
HIV/AIDS death counts became much more accurate with this designation (Chu et al. 1993).
Accordingly, we measure the intensity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic as:

                                                            1987

where population of congressional district i comes from the 1980 Census. In 1987, unique
ICD-9 codes (042-044) and new assignment procedures were adopted for HIV/AIDS deaths
(Chu et al. 1993). The results reported below do not appreciably change if the number
of HIV/AIDS deaths during the period 1983-1986 are used to gauge the intensity of the
epidemic. Likewise, our results are robust to using HIV/AIDS deaths per 100,000 population
in 1987 as our measure of intensity.
       Appendix Figure A1 shows HIV/AIDS mortality rates across U.S. congressional dis-
tricts. These rates are based on equation (1) and use 1982 congressional district boundaries.
The typical district (i.e., the median) experienced 4.8 deaths from HIV/AIDS per 100,000
population. This figure, however, masks substantial cross-district variation in HIV/AIDS
mortality rates. The interquartile range was 2.5 to 10.4, with New York City, San Fran-
cisco and Los Angeles districts experiencing the highest rates. For example, the HIV/AIDS
mortality rate in New York's 15th Congressional District, which includes the East Side of
Manhattan, was 182 per 100,000 population. California's 5th Congressional District, which
includes much of San Francisco, experienced 167 deaths from HIV/AIDS per 100,000 popu-
lation.




  18
    ICD-9 codes, which are based on the International Classification of Diseases (9th Revision), are used
on death certificates to indicate the underlying cause of death.

                                                   10
3.2. The Outcomes

       Data on elections to the U.S. House of Representatives come from records maintained by
Congressional Quarterly. These records contain information on votes received by Democratic
and Republican candidates as well as votes received by third-party and fringe candidates.19
Based on this information, we constructed the following outcomes:

   · The vote share received by the Democratic/Republican House candidate, computed as
        a percentage of the total votes cast in district i and election year t; and

   · Democratic/Republican voter turnout, equal to votes received by the candidate per
        100,000 voting-age population in district i and election year t.20

In addition to voting behavior, we are interested in whether the epidemic affected campaign
contributions made to House candidates. Data on contributions made by individuals (as
opposed to corporations or political action committees) comes from the Database in Ideol-
ogy, Money in Politics, and Elections (Bonica 2016) and cover the period 1979-2000. For
each contribution, we observe the specific date (i.e., day, month and year) upon which it
was transacted, the amount of the transaction, the donor type, and the party of the re-
ceiving candidate. Aggregating to the district-year level, we created two additional types of
outcomes:

   · The dollar value of contributions received by the Democratic/Republican candidate in
        district i and election year t per 100,000 population (measured in 1980 dollars); and

   · the number of contributions (regardless of value) received by the Democratic/Republican
        candidate per 100,000 voting-age population in district i and election year t.



  19
    We combine non-Democratic and non-Republican votes for the sake of simplicity.
  20
     Population estimates are at the county-decade level and are based on 1960-1990 Decennial Census data
from NHGIS (Manson et al. 2019). We aggregated to the congressional district level following the crosswalk
procedure described in footnote 17.

                                                   11
4. Methods

        To explore the political ramifications of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, we leverage cross-
district HIV/AIDS mortality during the treatment period, 1983-1987. Our pre- and post-
treatment periods depend upon the outcome under consideration:


                   [1968, 1982]  [1988, 2000]                    for voting behavior, and
                  Pre-treatment period   Post-treatment period

                   [1979, 1982]  [1988, 2000]                    for campaign contributions.
                  Pre-treatment period   Post-treatment period



        We begin by estimating difference-in-differences (DiD) regressions of the following form:


           Yit = 0 + 1 HIV AIDS M ortality Rate1983
                                               i
                                                    -1987
                                                          × 1[t  1988] + i + t + it ,                                (2)


where Yit measures voting behavior or campaign contributions for district i and year t.21
Congressional district fixed effects, i , control for time-invariant factors at the district level
and year fixed effects, represented by t , capture nation-wide shifts in attitudes and opinions.
Our coefficient of interest is 1 , which measures the effect of an additional HIV/AIDS death
per 100,000 population during the treatment period, 1983-1987, on the outcome, Yit .
        We explore the dynamic effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic by estimating event-study
regressions of the following form:

                                                        b                     2000
 Yit = HIV AIDS M ortality Rate1983
                               i
                                    -1987
                                                             k 1[t = k ] +            k 1[t = k ] + i + t +   it ,   (3)
                                                       k=a                   k=1988




   21
     Although not shown, the HIV/AIDS mortality rate during the treatment period, 1983-1987, unin-
teracted with post-treatment indicator is also on the right-hand side of (2). The uninteracted 1983-1987
HIV/AIDS mortality rate is not perfectly collinear with the district fixed effects, i , because of redistricting
every 10 years. With its inclusion on the right-hand side of (2), 1 is relative to the pre-treatment relation-
ship between Yit and the 1983-1987 HIV/AIDS mortality rate. In a robustness check below, we show that
our results are qualitatively similar if we use a fixed 1983-1987 HIV/AIDS mortality rate based on the 1982
congressional district boundaries.

                                                         12
where the bounds on k depend on the outcome under consideration and are as follows:

                       
                       a = 1968, b = 1980 for voting behavior, and
                       
                      k
                        a = 1979, b = 1981 for campaign contributions.
                       

The k capture the association between Yit and the 1983-1987 HIV/AIDS mortality rate
during the pre-treatment period. If the parallel trends assumption holds, the estimates of
k should be close to zero and statistically insignificant. The k trace out the effects of the
epidemic in the post-treatment period. The interaction between the 1983-1987 HIV/AIDS
mortality rate and the 1982 indicator is omitted.22 All of our regressions are weighted using
the decadal voting-age population and the standard errors are corrected for clustering at the
congressional district level.


5. Results

       DiD estimates of the association between the HIV/AIDS mortality rate and the election
outcomes (i.e., estimates of 1 from equation (2)) are reported in Panel A of Table 1. A
one-unit increase in the HIV/AIDS mortality rate is associated with a .081 percentage point
increase in the vote share received by Democratic candidates. It is also associated with
45 more Democratic votes per 100,000 voting-age population. Although not statistically
significant at conventional levels, a one-unit increase in the HIV/AIDS mortality rate is
associated with a .058 percentage point decrease in the vote share received by Republican
candidates and 5 fewer Republican votes per 100,000 voting-age population.
       At first blush, these estimates may seem trivially small. The typical (i.e., the median)
congressional district experienced an HIV/AIDS mortality rate of 4.8. We estimate that the
vote share of a Democrat running in this district increased by less than half a percentage

  22
     Although not shown, the uninteracted 1983-1987 HIV/AIDS mortality rate is on the right-hand side of
(3). With its inclusion,  and  are relative to the relationship between Yit and the 1983-1987 HIV/AIDS
mortality rate in 1982.

                                                  13
point (4.8 × .081 = .389), which would have changed the outcome of very few elections.23
It is, however, important to note that many congressional districts experienced HIV/AIDS
mortality rates much higher than the median, and, as a consequence, the DiD estimates
for these districts are arguably quite substantial. For instance, Georgia's 5th Congressional
District, which encompasses much of Atlanta, experienced an HIV/AIDS mortality rate of
34.4. We estimate that the epidemic caused an almost three percentage point increase in the
vote share received by Democratic candidates in this district (34.4 × .081 = 2.79).24
       Event-study estimates (i.e., estimates of  and  from equation (3)) are reported in
Figure 1 and Panel B of Table 1.25 The estimates of  are, with only a few exceptions, small
and statistically indistinguishable from zero; consistent with the parallel trends assumption,
there is little evidence that voting behavior was trending differently in districts that would,
during the treatment period, bear the brunt of the epidemic as compared to districts that
would experience relatively few HIV/AIDS deaths. Likewise, in 1988 (the first election year
in the post-treatment period), the estimates of  are small and statistically insignificant at
conventional levels. In fact, the HIV/AIDS epidemic does not appear to have consistently
impacted voting behavior until the 1994 elections.26
       The estimated impact of HIV/AIDS mortality on voting behavior becomes notably
stronger after the 1996 election. By the 2000 election, all of the ^s are statistically distin-

guishable from zero. A one-unit increase in the HIV/AIDS mortality rate is associated with
a .202 percentage point increase in the vote share received by the Democratic candidate, a
.168 percentage point decrease in the vote share received by the Republican candidate, 112

  23
      During the period under study, the typical margin of victory in House races was approximately 30
percentage points. Under two percent of elections were decided by less than one percentage point.
   24
      To take another example, California's 5th Congressional District, which encompassed much of San
Francisco, experienced an HIV/AIDS mortality rate of 167.5, which suggests that the Democratic vote share
increased by 13.6 percentage points between the pre- and post-treatment periods (167.5 × .081 = 13.57).
   25
      For the sake of completeness, we report estimates of the effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on third-party
vote share turnout in Appendix Figure A2.
   26
      In the 1994 elections, a one-unit increase in the HIV/AIDS mortality rate is associated with a .137
percentage point increase in the vote share received by the Democratic candidate, a .122 percentage point
decrease in the vote share received by the Republican candidate, and 80 more votes for the Democratic
candidate per 100,000 voting-age population.

                                                     14
more votes for the Democratic candidate (per 100,000 voting-age population) and 104 fewer
votes for the Republican candidate (per 100,000 voting-age population).
       These estimates suggest that, although it took several election cycles to manifest, the
epidemic eventually benefited Democratic candidates at the expense of their Republican
counterparts. Moreover, it appears as though this benefit was non-trivial in magnitude. For
instance, the vote share going to a Democratic candidate running in the median district had,
by the 2000 election, increased by a percentage point (4.8 × .202 = 0.97) as compared to 1982,
and this same Democratic candidate received 538 additional votes per 100,000 voting-age
population (4.8 × 112 = 537.6).
       The effects of the epidemic documented in Table 1 can be summarized by examining the
association between HIV/AIDS mortality and the probability of the Democratic candidate
winning in election year t and district i. DiD estimates of this association, reported in
Panel A of Table 2, are small and statistically insignificant. Likewise, the estimates of 
are statistically insignificant for the 1988-1994 elections (Figure 2 and Panel B of Table
2). Beginning with the 1996 election, however, the estimates of  become positive and are
clearly distinguishable from zero in a statistical sense. By the 2000 election, a one-unit
increase in the HIV/AIDS mortality rate is associated with a .003 increase in the probability
of the Democratic candidate winning. For a Democratic candidate running in the median
congressional district (i.e., a district that experienced 4.8 HIV/AIDS deaths per 100,000
population), this translates into a .014 increase in the probability of winning (4.8 × .003 =
.014). Democrats running in congressional districts that bore the brunt of the epidemic saw
their chances of winning increase by considerably more than this.27




  27
     A Democrat running in a district at the 75th percentile (i.e., a district that experienced 10.4 HIV/AIDS
deaths per 100,000 population) saw a .031 increase in their probability of winning (10.4 × .003 = .031); a
Democrat running in a district at the 90th percentile (i.e., a district that experienced 23.7 HIV/AIDS deaths
per 100,000 population) saw a .071 increase in their probability of winning (23.7 × .003 = .071).

                                                     15
6. Robustness Checks and Extensions

6.1. Robustness Checks

        Table 3 reports the results of various robustness checks. In the first column, we reproduce
the DiD estimates from Table 1. In the next two columns, we show that neither weighting by
total population (as opposed to voting-age population) nor correcting the standard errors for
clustering at the state (as opposed to the district) level qualitatively changes these estimates.
In column (4), we report DiD estimates fixing the intensity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic
using the 1982 boundaries of congressional districts.28 Again, our results are qualitatively
unchanged.
        In columns (5) and (6) of Table 3, we experiment with using different treatment periods.
Specifically, in column (5) we measure the intensity of the epidemic as the total number of
HIV/AID deaths from 1983-1986, while in column (6) we restrict our attention to HIV/AIDS
deaths in 1987, when unique ICD-9 codes and new assignment procedures were adopted (Chu
et al. 1993). The DiD estimates continue to show that Democratic candidates benefited from
the epidemic at the expense of their Republican counterparts.
        Finally, in column (7) of Table 3, we show DiD estimates winsorizing the HIV/AIDS
mortality rate at the 99th percentile to address the possibility that a subset of districts
with disproportionately high mortality rates are driving our results. The estimates are
qualitatively unchanged with this restriction in place.29


6.2. Effects by Outcomes of Previous Elections

        Next, we explore whether the effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic differed by whether
Reagan carried the district in 1980. The results are reported in Figure 3 and Tables 4A

   28
      In the baseline regression, the 1983-1987 HIV/AIDS mortality rate reflects decadal shifts in congressional
district boundaries due to redistricting.
   29
      In Appendix Figure A3, we replace the replace the HIV/AIDS mortality rate with mortality due to
cardiovascular diseases. We find little evidence that cardiovascular mortality is systematically related to
Democratic or Republican vote shares or voter turnout.

                                                      16
and 4B. The DiD estimates provide little evidence that the effect of the epidemic on vote
share differed across these two types of congressional districts. A one-unit increase in the
HIV/AIDS death rate is associated with a .084 percentage point increase in Democratic vote
share in districts that Reagan lost as compared to a .12 percentage point increase in districts
that Reagan won (Table 4A), but these estimates are not sufficiently precise to reject the
hypothesis that they are equal.30
       The event-study estimates tell a similar story. In general, we cannot reject the hypothesis
that the effects of the epidemic were the same across these two types of districts. Beginning
in 1994, however, there is evidence that the effects of the epidemic were actually more
pronounced in districts that Reagan won. For instance, a one-unit increase in the HIV/AIDS
death rate is, by the 2000 elections, associated with a .447 percentage point increase in
Democratic vote share and 180 more Democratic votes in districts that Reagan won.31 By
contrast, a one-unit increase in the HIV/AIDS death rate is associated with a .141 percentage
point increase in Democratic vote share and 91 more Democratic votes (per 100,000 voting-
age population) in districts that Reagan lost.
       In Figure 4 and Table 5, we focus exclusively on competitive districts, defined as those in
which the Democratic and Republican candidates were separated by fewer than 10 percentage
points in 1980. Just under 17 percent of districts fit this definition. With one exception
(Democratic voter turnout), the DiD estimates for competitive districts are not statistically
significant at conventional levels, while the event-study estimates provide evidence that the
effects of the epidemic manifested earlier, and were more pronounced, in competitive districts.

  30
      Similarly, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the DiD estimates are equal across these two types of
districts when Republican vote share or Democratic voter turnout are on the left-hand side of the regression.
There is, however, evidence that the negative effect on Republican voter turnout is greater in districts that
Reagan won.
   31
      The 91 additional Democratic votes correspond to 0.25 percent of the mean in districts that Reagan
lost. The 180 additional Democratic votes correspond to 0.53 percent of the mean in districts that Reagan
won. These estimates, however, are not sufficiently precise to reject the hypothesis that they are equal. In
Appendix Figure A4 and Appendix Table A1, we explore whether the effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on
the probability of the Democratic candidate winning were different depending on whether Reagan carried
the district in 1980. Again, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the DiD estimates are equal across these
two types of districts.

                                                     17
Specifically, the estimates of  for competitive districts are statistically distinguishable from
zero as early as 1992 and are, without exception, lager (in absolute magnitude) than the
corresponding full-sample estimates.32


6.3. Black vs. White HIV/AIDS Mortality

       In the early years of the epidemic, the media reports focused on white, gay men (Quimby
and Friedson 1989). HIV/AIDS infection and mortality rates were, however, becoming
alarmingly high among African Americans (Bakeman, Lumb, and Smith 1986; Selik, Castro,
and Pappaioanou 1988).33 By 1994, HIV/AIDS was the leading cause of death for black
men ages 25-44 and infection rates among African Americans were higher than for any other
racial/ethnic group (Cohen 1999, p. 23; Alsan and Wanamaker 2018).
       African American AIDS patients often faced different challenges than those facing their
white counterparts.34 Although grass-roots organizations such as The World AIDS Advisory
Task Force and the National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays focused on addressing the
needs of people of color with HIV/AIDS (Brier 2009), political mobilization and advocacy by
church leaders and black politicians did not begin until the early 1990s (Shipp and Navarro
1991; Thomas and Quinn 1993).35
  32
      In the 1992 elections, a one-unit increase in the HIV/AIDS mortality rate is associated with a .004
increase in the probability of the Democratic candidate winning in what we are characterizing as competitive
districts (Figure 2 and Table 2). For a Democratic candidate running in the median district, this translates
into an almost two percentage-point increase in the chances of winning (4.8 × .004 = .0192) as compared
to 1982. In the 1996-2000 elections, a one-unit increase in the HIV/AIDS mortality rate is associated with
a .005 increase in the probability of the Democratic candidate winning competitive districts (Figure 2 and
Table 2).
   33
      According to an analysis conducted by the CDC in 1988, fully 26 percent of the AIDS patients in the
United States were black (Selik, Castro, and Pappaioanou 1988). Our analysis of NVSS data for the period
1983-1987 shows that 30 percent of HIV/AIDS deaths were among black men and women.
   34
      While most AIDS cases among black men and women were related to intravenous drug use, the main
transmission mechanism for white men was through homosexual sex (Selik, Castro, and Pappaioanou 1988).
Environmental and historical factors, such as high poverty rates, lack of adequate housing, and low trust in
the government among blacks contributed to differences in the grass-root organization and political response
to AIDS (Quimby and Friedson 1989; Cohen 1999).
   35
      Misinformation about the origin of the disease and mistrust about the efficacy and goal of different
mitigation policies (such as needle exchange programs and condom distribution) impacted the attitudes of
African Americans towards the disease and delayed the response of black church leaders and black politicians
(Thomas and Quinn 1993; Quinn 1997; Gaston and Alleyne-Green 2013). For an excellent history on
HIV/AIDS black mobilization see Cohen (1999).

                                                    18
       As a first step in examining the role of race in shaping the political response to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic, we calculated separate HIV/AIDS mortality rates for blacks versus
whites and re-estimated equations (2) and (3) with these two measures on the right-hand
side.36 Race-specific DiD estimates are reported in Panel A of Tables 6A and 6B. In general,
they provide little evidence that voters responded to the race of the victim. For instance, a
one-unit increase in the white HIV/AIDS mortality rate is associated with a .124 increase
in Democratic vote share. Although the estimated effect of black HIV/AIDS mortality on
the Democratic vote share is about 40 percent larger, it is not statistically significant and
we cannot reject the hypothesis that these two estimates are equal.37


6.4. HIV/AIDS and Presidential Elections

       In Appendix Table A2, we explore the effect of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on votes received
by Presidential candidates. DiD estimates, reported in Panel A of Appendix Table A2, show
that a one-unit increase in the HIV/AIDS mortality rate in district i and election year t
is associated with a .096 percentage point increase in the vote share of the Democratic
nominee. The estimated effect on Republican vote share is of equal magnitude but has
the opposite sign. The DiD estimates also provide evidence that the epidemic eventually
increased Democratic, but not Republican, voter turnout.
       The effect of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on presidential voting is discernible as early as
1988 (Appendix Table A2 and Appendix Figure A5). From 1988 to 2000, the estimated
effect of HIV/AIDS mortality on Democratic vote share doubles, while the estimated effect on
Democratic turnout increases by approximately 40 percent. By the 2000 presidential election,
a one-unit increase in the HIV/AIDS mortality rate is associated with a .189 percentage point
  36
      In our data, the correlation between white and black HIV/AIDS deaths is 0.71. This statistic, however,
masks substantial geographical variation. For example, blacks accounted for 34 percent of HIV/AIDS deaths
in the South, 38 percent in the Northeast, but only 11 percent in the West.
   37
      Event-study estimates do provide evidence that white HIV/AIDS mortality affected voting behavior as
early as the 1994 elections (Figure 5 and Panel B of Table 6A). By contrast, the estimated effects of black
HIV/AID mortality are smaller and less precise until the 1998 elections. This pattern of results is consistent
with historical accounts describing the lengthy process of mobilizing black politicians and voters around the
issue of HIV/AIDS (Shipp and Navarro 1991; Thomas and Quinn 1993; Cohen 1999).

                                                     19
increase in the Democratic vote share. For Al Gore, the Democratic nominee in 2000, this
translated into a .91 percentage point increase in vote share (4.8 × .189 = .907) in the
median congressional district (i.e., a district that experienced 4.8 HIV/AIDS deaths per
100,000 population).


7. Campaign Contributions

       In this section, we shift our focus from voting behavior to campaign contributions. As
noted in Section 3, contributions to candidates for House seats are measured in 1980 dollars
per 100,000 voting-age population; contributions made by corporations and political action
committees are not included in these totals.38
       DiD estimates provide further evidence that the HIV/AIDS epidemic spurred political
participation to the benefit of Democratic candidates (Panel A of Table 7). A one-unit
increase in the HIV/AIDS mortality rate is associated with a $671 increase in contributions
to Democratic candidates per 100,000 voting-age population. For a Democrat running in a
district that experienced 4.8 HIV/AIDS deaths per 100,000 population during the treatment
period (the median), this translates to an increase of $3,221 as compared to 1982 (4.8 × 671
= 3,221), or about 8 percent of the sample mean. A one-unit increase in the HIV/AIDS
mortality rate is also associated with 0.52 more contributions to Democratic candidates
per 100,000 voting-age population.39 DiD estimates of the impact of HIV/AIDS deaths
on contributions to Republican candidates, although positive, are smaller and statistically
insignificant.40
       Event-study estimates (i.e., estimates of  and  ) provide evidence that the effect of the
  38
      It might be noted that campaign contributions in the 70s and 80s were only a fraction of what they are
today. The results reported in Table 7 and Figure 6 suggest that contributions to Democratic candidates in
districts that were disproportionately impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic increased at the same time that
campaign contributions were, in general, dramatically increasing across the board.
   39
      For a Democrat running in a district that experienced 4.8 HIV/AIDS deaths per 100,000 population
during the treatment period (the median), this translates to two and a half additional donations per 100,000
voting age population as compared to 1982 (4.8 × 0.52 = 2.50), or about a 6 percent of the sample mean.
   40
      For the sake of completeness, we report estimates of the effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on campaign
contributions to third-party candidates in Appendix Figure A6.

                                                    20
epidemic on contributions to Democratic House candidates grew stronger over time (Figure 6
and Panel B of Table 7). In the 1988 election, the first election in the post-treatment period,
a one-unit increase in the HIV/AIDS mortality rate is associated with a $286 increase in
contributions to Democratic candidates per 100,000 voting-age population; 4 years later, it is
associated with a (statistically insignificant) $672 increase in in contributions to Democratic
candidates; by the 2000 election, it is associated with a $1,218 increase in contributions to
Democratic candidates. The number of contributions to Democratic candidates (as opposed
to the dollar value of contributions) exhibit a similar trend, although the estimates of  and
 are not as precise. Finally, there is little evidence that the epidemic affected campaign
contributions made to Republican candidates.41


8. Conclusion

       To date, HIV/AIDS has claimed over 700,000 lives in the United States and more
than a million Americans are currently living with HIV (Kaiser Family Foundation 2019).
The initial public health response to the epidemic has consistently been characterized as
underfunded and lacking in urgency (Shilts 1987; Brier 2009; Francis 2012) but, as HIV/AIDS
spread across the country and affected a broader demographic mix, Congress came under
increasing pressure to respond (Shaw 1987; Padamsee 2018). In the late 1980s and early
1990s, there was progress on the legislative front in the form of the HOPE and Ryan White
CARE Acts, which greatly expanded the role of the federal government in the fight against
HIV/AIDS (Padamsee 2018).
       In this paper, we explore the effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on voting in elections
to the U.S. House of Representatives. To our knowledge, it is the first attempt to explore
the effects of a deadly, widespread epidemic on voting behavior. Leveraging cross-district
variation in HIV/AIDS mortality during the period of 1983-1987, we find consistent evidence

  41
    In the 2000 election, there is evidence of a positive association between HIV/AIDS deaths and donations
to Republican candidates, but neither of the  estimates is significant.

                                                    21
that, by the mid-1990s, the epidemic had increased the number of votes received by Demo-
cratic candidates and the vote share received by Democratic candidates. In addition, we find
that the epidemic increased campaign contributions made to Democratic candidates.
    Combined, these effects translate into substantial increases in the probability of winning.
By the 2000 election, as additional HIV/AIDS death per 100,000 population is associated
with a 1.4 percentage point increase in the chances of winning for a Democrat running in the
median district (i.e., a district that experienced 4.8 HIV/AIDS deaths per 100,000 population
during the period 1983-1987). Democrats running in congressional districts that bore the
brunt of the epidemic (such as California's 5th Congressional District 5, which experienced
167 HIV/AIDS deaths per 100,000 population) saw even greater increases in their chances
of winning.
    Our results are consistent with polling from the late 1980s: Americans thought that
Democrats were more likely than Republicans to have effective proposals for combatting
HIV/AIDS (Steinbrook 1987). They might also be interpreted as evidence that voters are
on track to punishing Republican candidates running in districts that have been hardest-hit
by Covid-19, another deadly disease for which there is, at least as of yet, no effective vaccine
or cure. If Covid-19 continues to claim lives, and if the public-health response at the federal
level is perceived by voters to be inadequate, then substantial shifts in voting behavior are
possible.

Notes: OLS estimates of  and  from equation (3) weighted by voting-age population are shown. The blue line
reports estimates of  and  in districts that Reagan lost in 1980 and the red line reports estimates of  and  in
districts that Reagan won in 1980. The dependent variable in Panel A is the percent Democratic vote in district i
and year t; in Panel B, the dependent variable is the percent Republican vote; in Panel C, the dependent variable
is Democratic votes per 100,000 voting-age population; and in Panel D, the dependent variable is Republican votes
per 100,000 voting-age population. The vertical line indicates the year 1982 and we exclude data from the 1984 and
1986 elections. All regressions include congressional district and election year fixed effects. Dashed lines indicate 90
percent confidence intervals based on standard errors corrected for clustering at the congressional district level.
* Statistically significant at 10 percent level; ** at 5 percent level; *** at 1 percent level.

Notes: OLS estimates of  and  from equation (3) weighted by voting-age population are shown. The sample is
restricted to congressional districts in which the difference between the Democratic and Republican vote share was
less than 10 percentage points in 1980. The dependent variable in Panel A is the percent Democratic vote in district
i and year t; in Panel B, the dependent variable is the percent Republican vote; in Panel C, the dependent variable
is Democratic votes per 100,000 voting-age population; and in Panel D, the dependent variable is Republican votes
per 100,000 voting-age population. The vertical line indicates the year 1982 and we exclude data from the 1984 and
1986 elections. All regressions include congressional district and election year fixed effects. Dashed lines indicate 90
percent confidence intervals based on standard errors corrected for clustering at the congressional district level.

Notes: OLS estimates of  and  from equation (3) weighted by voting-age population are shown. The dependent
variable in Panel A is contributions (in 1980 dollars) to Democratic House candidates per 100,000 voting-age popula-
tion in district i and year t; in Panel B, the dependent variable is contributions (in 1980 dollars) to Republican House
candidates per 100,000 voting-age population; in Panel C, the dependent variable is the number of contributions to
Democratic House candidates per 100,000 voting-age population; and in Panel D, the dependent variable is the num-
ber of contributions to Republican House candidates per 100,000 voting-age population. The vertical line indicates
the year 1982 and we exclude data from 1983 to 1987. All regressions include congressional district and year fixed
effects. Dashed lines indicate 90 percent confidence intervals based on standard errors corrected for clustering at the
congressional district level.

Notes: OLS estimates of  from equation (2) weighted by voting-age population are shown in Panel A and OLS
estimates of  from equation (3) weighted by voting-age population are shown in Panel B. The dependent variable in
both columns is the probability of a Democratic win. The sample in Column (2) is restricted to congressional districts
in which the difference between the Democratic and Republican vote share was less than 10 percentage points in
1980. All regressions include congressional district and election year fixed effects. Standard errors in parentheses are
corrected for clustering at the congressional district level.

Notes: OLS estimates of  from equation (2) weighted by voting-age population are shown in Panel A and OLS
estimates of  from equation (3) weighted by voting-age population are shown in Panel B. The sample is restricted
to congressional districts in which the difference between the Democratic and Republican vote share was less than 10
percentage points in 1980. The dependent variable in Columns (1) and (2) is the percent Democratic or Republican
vote in district i and year t; and in Columns (3) and (4) the dependent variable is Democratic or Republican votes per
100,000 voting-age population. Columns (3) and (4) drop unopposed elections. All regressions include congressional
district and election year fixed effects. Standard errors in parentheses are corrected for clustering at the congressional
district level.

Notes: OLS estimates of  from equation (2) weighted by voting-age population are shown in Panel A and OLS
estimates of  from equation (3) weighted by voting-age population are shown in Panel B. The dependent variable in
Columns (1) and (2) is contributions to Democratic or Republican to House candidates (in 1980 dollars) per 100,000
voting-age population in district i and year t; and in Columns (3) and (4) the dependent variable is the number
of contribution to Democratic or Republican House candidates per 100,000 voting-age population. All regressions
include congressional district and year fixed effects. Standard errors in parentheses are corrected for clustering at the
congressional district level.

Notes: OLS estimates of  and  from equation (3) weighted by voting-age population are shown. The dependent
variable in Panel A is the percent third-party vote in district i and year t; and in Panel B, the dependent variable is
third-party votes per 100,000 voting-age population. The vertical line indicates the year 1982 and we exclude data
from the 1984 and 1986 elections. All regressions include congressional district and election year fixed effects. Dashed
lines indicate 90 percent confidence intervals based on standard errors corrected for clustering at the congressional
district level.

Notes: OLS estimates of  and  from equation (3) weighted by voting-age population are shown, replacing HIV/AIDS
mortality with mortality due to cardiovascular diseases. The dependent variable in Panel A is the percent Democratic
vote in district i and year t; in Panel B, the dependent variable is the percent Republican vote; in Panel C, the
dependent variable is Democratic votes per 100,000 voting-age population; and in Panel D, the dependent variable is
Republican votes per 100,000 voting-age population. The vertical line indicates the year 1982 and we exclude data
from the 1984 and 1986 elections. All regressions include congressional district and election year fixed effects. Dashed
lines indicate 90 percent confidence intervals based on standard errors corrected for clustering at the congressional
district level.

Notes: OLS estimates of  and  from equation (3) weighted by voting-age population are shown. The dependent
variable in Panel A is contributions to third-party House candidates (in 1980 dollars) per 100,000 voting-age popu-
lation in district i and year t; and in Panel B, the dependent variable is the number of contributions to third-party
House candidates per 100,000 voting-age population. The vertical line indicates the year 1982 and we exclude data
from 1983-1987. All regressions include congressional district and election year fixed effects. Dashed lines indicate
90 percent confidence intervals based on standard errors corrected for clustering at the congressional district level.
* Statistically significant at 10 percent level; ** at 5 percent level; *** at 1 percent level.

Notes: OLS estimates of  from equation (2) weighted by voting-age population are shown in Panel A and OLS
estimates of  from equation (3) weighted by voting-age population are shown in Panel B. The dependent variable in
both columns is the probability of a Democratic win. Column (1) restricts the sample to districts that Reagan won
in 1980 and Column (2) restricts the sample to districts that Reagan lost in 1980. Observations will not add to total
since districts that did not exist in 1980 are dropped. All regressions include congressional district and election year
fixed effects. Standard errors in parentheses are corrected for clustering at the congressional district level.
