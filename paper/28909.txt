Illegal Immigration: The Trump Effect

NBER Working Paper No. 28909

JEL No. J15,J6,J61

                                        ABSTRACT

Recent years have witnessed the emergence of increasingly provocative anti-immigrant
politicians in both Europe and the United States. We examine whether the 2016 election of
Donald Trump, who made illegal immigration and border enforcement a centerpiece of his
campaign, reduced illegal immigration into the U.S. We exploit the fact the election result was
widely unexpected and thus generated a large, overnight change in expected immigration policy
and rhetoric. We compare migration flows before and after the election and find that while it
reduced immigration among deported Mexicans and at least temporarily among Central
Americans, it had no effect on the overall inflow of unauthorized Mexican workers.

1. Introduction
         Much of the existing research on immigration has focused on the impact of particular policies
and conditions. However, arguably the greatest change in the political climate regarding immigration
has been the rise of politicians who combine sharp anti-immigration rhetoric with anti-immigrant
policies. This trend was perhaps best exemplified in the U.S. by the election of Donald Trump to the
presidency in 2016, who made illegal immigration and border enforcement a centerpiece of his
campaign. Similarly, Europe has experienced the emergence of politicians who are sharply critical of
legal immigration and especially of refugees (O'Donnell, 2017; Basu, 2018; Davey and Ebner, 2019;
Roth, 2019). Despite these trends, however, little is known about how the rise of these politicians has
impacted immigration in general, or illegal immigration in particular.
         In this paper, we examine the impact of Donald Trump's election on migration flows of
unauthorized immigrants to the U.S. before and after the election on November 8, 2016. The
advantage of using this approach to study this recent political shift is twofold. First, as alluded to
above, the issue of illegal immigration was central to Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. He famously
launched his candidacy with a speech in which he stated that Mexico wasn't "sending us their best"
and that while some were presumably good people, others were rapists and were bringing drugs and
crime. As a result, Trump's election in 2016 generated a significant shift in both political climate and
expected policy regarding immigration. The second advantage of studying the impact of the 2016
election is that few predicted Trump would win. Of the six election forecasts tracked by the New
York Times, the average probability Trump would win was only 11 percent. This meant that not only
did the 2016 election cause a significant change in expected policy and rhetoric on immigration, but it
did so overnight.
         We examine whether this sudden but lasting change in immigration rhetoric and policy
reduced the immigration of undocumented workers from Mexico and Central America. We do so
both by examining the inflows of undocumented workers from Mexico and Central America, as well
as the intentions of those undocumented Mexican workers who were deported from the U.S. to
Mexico.1 In doing so, this paper contributes to a literature that has focused nearly entirely on the


1 We examine effects on inflows rather than outflows (i.e., return migration) because the former is more likely to
respond quickly to the overnight change in expected immigration policy and rhetoric caused by the 2016 election.
Similarly, we do not attempt to measure changes in the stock of undocumented workers in the U.S. This is in part
because the stock of unauthorized immigrants is measured with a significant amount of error in the U.S., and in part
because even large changes in inflows are likely undetectable in the stock given the large number of total undocumented
workers in the U.S. See Hoekstra and Orozco-Aleman (2017) for additional discussion of these issues in the context of
Arizona's SB 1070.

impact of particular policies.2 While these are clearly important, little is known about the joint impact
of both expected policy and rhetoric that characterized both the campaign of Donald Trump and his
presidency. Yet we would argue this was one of the more important changes in the U.S. immigration
policy space in recent years.
        Results using data from a Mexican survey of migrants in Mexican border towns indicate the
election of President Trump had little effect on the overall inflow of undocumented Mexican workers.
In contrast, the data indicate there were large effects among Mexicans who were deported. Mexicans
who were deported just after the election were 20 percent less likely to report (in Mexico) that they
would return to the U.S., compared to those deported just prior to the election.
        In addition, we also show that U.S. apprehensions at the border went down dramatically
immediately following the election, a result driven primarily by reduced border crossing by Central
Americans in the year following the election. Additional findings confirm this, as data on migration
into Mexico demonstrate that the number of Central American migrants destined for the U.S. fell
dramatically following the election. We interpret this as evidence the election reduced the migration
of Central Americans to the U.S.--at least for a year--even while it had little effect on the overall
inflow of undocumented Mexican workers.
        These results demonstrate that different populations can respond to changes in expected
immigration costs to stark changes in expected immigration policy and rhetoric can differ significantly.
In particular, the absence of an overall impact on the migration decisions of undocumented workers
from Mexico--and the apparently temporary nature of the effect on Central Americans--highlights
how large the perceived marginal benefits from immigrating to the U.S. are.


2. Data and Methods
        Much of our data are from the Surveys of Migration across Mexican Borders (EMIF). The
EMIF consists of two surveys, the Survey of Migration to the Northern Border of Mexico (EMIF
Norte) and the Survey of Migration to the Southern Border of Mexico (EMIF Sur).
        EMIF Norte is a cross-sectional survey conducted by Mexican authorities with the objective
of measuring a representative sample of the flow of Mexican migrants across the US-Mexico border.


2For example, researchers have examined the effect of enforcement policies such as Arizona SB 1070 (Amuedo-Dorrantes
and Lozano 2015; Hoekstra and Orozco-Aleman, 2017), E-Verify (Bohn, Lofstrom, and Raphael, 2014), IRCA (Bansak
and Raphael, 2001; Lowell, Teachman, and Jing, 1995; Orreinus and Zavodny, 2003), post 9/11 enforcement measures
(Orreinus and Zavodny, 2009), INS monitoring strategies (Davila and Pagan, 1997), border enforcement (Hanson and
Spilimbergo, 1999; and local enforcement of federal immigration law (Watson, 2013).


                                                         2
It is conducted in eight border cities. Subjects are interviewed in different zones, including bus stations,
train stations, international bridges, and customs inspection points.          Importantly, the National
Population Council estimates that 94 percent of the total border crossings occur through locations
covered by the EMIF (Consejo Nacional de Poblacion 2013). This study uses the surveys of those
who intend to cross the border into the United States within the next 30 days, as well as those of
return migrants who were deported from the United States back to Mexico. These data consist of
individual-level observations, though when looking at total flows we aggregate the data to the monthly
level. Importantly, all of the survey respondents are Mexican citizens.
        In addition, we use data from EMIF Sur, a cross-sectional survey administered by Mexican
authorities on Mexico's southern border. EMIF Sur measures the flows of immigrants across the
Guatemala-Mexico border and the flow of immigrants deported by U.S. and Mexican immigration
authorities to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. In particular, we use data on the monthly
number of individuals from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala who report being destined for the
United States but are deported by Mexico back to their home countries. Importantly, individuals from
these countries make up the vast majority of Central Americans migrating to the United States through
Mexico. In addition, we note that in contrast to the U.S., Mexico deports individuals they apprehend
very quickly; the mean time of detention is 5.8 days and the median is 4 days. This means that
deportations provide us with a good proxy of immigration flows of Central Americans through
Mexico to the United States.
        Finally, we also use data on the total number of apprehensions by U.S. border patrol along the
southwestern border with Mexico. These data include the total number of apprehensions made along
the border, aggregated to the monthly level.
        These data offer several advantages for examining the effect of the 2016 election on illegal
migration. The most important advantage is they enable us to assess the impact on the flow of workers
across the border. As a result, we can avoid inferring changes in migration based on changes to the
stock of a population, as measured by U.S. surveys such as the Current Population Survey. In addition,
these data enable us to assess directly the impact of the election on those known to not have legal
permission to work in the United States. This is true because the EMIF specifically asks individuals
whether they have permission--94 percent state they do not--and because 98.3 percent of immigrants
in the U.S. apprehension data lack legal documentation.
        To estimate effects on the flow of undocumented workers from Mexico to the U.S., we
estimate the following event study model:


                                                     3
             (1)(). = 1 +  3 . + : . + .


where ln(Migrants)t is the natural log of the number of migrants heading to the U.S. (or apprehended
in the U.S. or Mexico) in month t, and PostElectiont is an indicator equal to one if the month was
November of 2016 or later. TimeTrendt is a linear time trend, though we also show estimates without
this variable when there is no clear time trend in the pre-election period. The coefficient of interest
is ß1, which captures the change in log migration after the election relative to before. The identifying
assumption is that absent the unexpected outcome of the 2016 presidential election, the (linear) trend
in migration or apprehensions would have continued. The primary way in which we assess this
assumption is by examining the extent to which immigration followed a linear trend in the years prior.
In addition, in other specifications we also include calendar month fixed effects and controls for U.S.
unemployment rates.
        Finally, we note that while this is a relatively simple research design, we believe it is appropriate
in this setting for two reasons. First, as discussed earlier, the "treatment" in this setting--the change
in expected immigration policy and rhetoric due to Trump's 2016 election win--was both large and
unexpected. There is little question a Trump presidency was expected to be much different with
respect to border enforcement and immigration than a Clinton presidency ­ or for that matter, nearly
any other presidency in recent decades. And as discussed earlier, Trump was a longshot to win.
Second, one can reasonably expect our outcome--the flow of unauthorized immigrants across the
border--to be impacted within weeks if not days of the election, if the prospect of a Trump presidency
were in fact a deterrent. That is because this population had not yet set up residence in the U.S., and
had not yet even attempted the costly and uncertain border crossing. As a result, they in a good
position to change their minds if they wanted to. In contrast, while other undocumented immigrant
populations such as those already in the U.S could well be impacted by the prospect of a Trump
presidency, it is much less clear that they would respond similarly quickly. This makes detecting effects
much more difficult than it is when examining inflows, as we do here.


3. Results
        We begin by addressing the question of how the election affected the flow of undocumented
workers from Mexico into the U.S. Results are shown graphically in Figure 1, which reveals a steady
decline in the number of EMIF survey respondents who state they intend to cross the border with the


                                                     4
U.S. in the next 90 days. The vertical line corresponds to the election on November 8, 2016.
Importantly, there is no evidence of a break in trend following the election, suggesting that the
unexpected presidency of Donald Trump had little effect on migration rates. Corresponding estimates
are in Table 3. The first column controls only for a linear time trend, while columns 2 and 3 add
month fixed effects and controls for U.S. unemployment rates. Estimates are 0.059, 0.068, and -0.01,
respectively; none are significant at conventional levels. In short, there is little evidence the election
reduced the inflow of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico. This result is striking given both the
content and tone of the Trump candidacy as it relates to illegal immigration.3
         We also ask whether the election impacted the subset of undocumented immigrants for whom
the change in political climate might be most salient: those who were detained and deported back to
Mexico. Results are shown in Figure 2, where the outcome is the stated intention to re-emigrate to
the U.S.4 Panel A shows results for all deportees to Mexico, and shows that while re-emigration rates
were roughly constant at around 25 ­ 30 percent in the 2+ years prior to the election, they fell
dramatically immediately following the election to around 15 ­ 20 percent. In order to ensure this
finding is not driven by a change in the composition of those who are deported, in Panels B and C we
show results for only those who were detained prior to November 8, 2016 (i.e., election day) or prior
to the inauguration on January 20, 2017.5 In both cases, re-emigration rates are steady prior to the
election at 25 to 35 percent, but drop off dramatically to 10 ­ 15 percent immediately following the
election. Corresponding estimates are shown in Table 4, where Panel A shows results for all deportees.
Columns 1 ­ 3 show estimates without a linear time trend while adding month fixed effects (column
2) and unemployment rates (column 3). Columns 4 ­ 6 show estimates from similar specifications
that include a linear time trend. Estimates range between -4.6 and -7.0 percentage points, all of which
are significant at the one percent level and represent a decline of approximately 20 percent relative to
the pre-election mean. In Panel B, we show that this estimate is not driven by changes in sample
composition by examining only the reentry rates of those who were detained prior to Trump's
inauguration. Estimates are somewhat larger, ranging from -5.5 to -8.6 percentage points, all of which


3 In appendix Figure A1, we show results separately by first-time and repeat migrants, and show there is little effect for
either subgroup.
4 Importantly, Figure A2 shows the number of deportations remained roughly constant prior the election. This, along

with the fact that individuals are detained for long periods of time in the U.S. before being deported, suggests it is unlikely
any immediate effect following the election could be due to a change in composition, rather than to the election itself.
5 We believe it is unlikely that a change in composition of those deported could drive effects. That is in part because

those who are deported from the U.S. are often detained for weeks or months, and so any change in composition would
take much longer to show up in the data. In addition, the election itself did not change policy. Instead, it signaled that
immigration policy could well change in the following months or years.

are again significant at the one percent level.6 In addition, we note we see no evidence of such an
effect from the 2014 election, the only previous election for which we have data.7
         Next, we address the question of whether the election affected illegal immigration by
examining data on apprehensions from U.S. Border Patrol. The advantage of these data is that they
capture actual crossings by undocumented workers. The disadvantage is that they are necessarily
capturing changes in crossings as well as potential changes in enforcement. While this is of minimal
concern during the period after the election but before the inauguration ­ and possibly even for several
months after that given policy changes take time ­ it could be a larger issue for longer time horizons.
         We begin by showing the data graphically in Figure 3, where Panel A shows results for total
apprehensions and Panel B shows results by region of origin. Results in Panel A indicate there was a
large, abrupt decline in apprehensions beginning around January, 2017, though the apprehension rate
began to increase again around May 2017 and appeared to return to the pre-election trend by the
summer of 2018. Corresponding estimates in Table 5 indicate declines of 39 to 47 percent for models
without a linear time trend (columns 1 ­ 3), and declines of 49 to 57 percent in models with the trend
(columns 4 ­ 6). All six estimates are significant at the five percent level, and five of the six are
significant at the one percent level. Estimates also indicate that in the second year after the election ­
from November 2017 to October of 2018 ­ the number of apprehensions had returned to pre-election
levels (columns 1 ­ 3) or to trend (columns 4 ­ 6).
         Additionally, Panel B of Figure 3 shows that this reduction in apprehensions at the U.S. border
seemed to be driven primarily by a reduction in immigration of Central Americans. In particular,
Panel B of Figure 3 shows that while the trend in apprehensions of Central Americans was increasing
prior to the election, it dropped off dramatically for the next seven months before steadily increasing
one to two years following the election. In addition, we note that the drop in border apprehensions
in the months following the 2016 election was exactly the opposite of the typical seasonal pattern.
This is shown in Online Appendix Figure A3. It shows that while apprehensions usually rise in the
spring, peaking in March (which corresponds to the growing season), following the 2016 election



6 In Table 4 we restrict the sample to January 2014 through December 2017 so that we can keep the sample consistent
across Panels A and B. A shorter horizon is necessary for Panel B, which restrict to the deportations of those who were
detained prior to Trump's inauguration. We note that estimates in columns 4 ­ 6 of Panel A are nearly identical to those
from the longer sample that extends through 2018, which are -0.0499, -0.0535, and -0.0623, respectively.
7 Estimates corresponding to the estimates of -0.0495, -0.0517, and -0.0546 in columns 4 ­ 6 of Panel A of Table 4 are

0.0068, 0.008, and -0.0328 when using data from January of 2013 through November of 2016; none are significant at the
10 percent level.


                                                           6
apprehensions fell before bottoming out in March and April of 2017. This provides further evidence
the decline is not driven by seasonality.
        In order to assess whether the decline in apprehensions shown in Panel A of Table 3 is due to
a reduction in migration of Central Americans, we also examine data on the number of Central
Americans deported by Mexico. Results are shown graphically in Figure 4, which shows large, abrupt
declines in the number of deportations from Mexico to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.
However, consistent with the data on U.S. border apprehensions shown in Figure 3, much of the post-
election decline in Figure 4 seemed to dissipate two years after the election. Corresponding estimates
are shown in Table 6. Estimates indicate a reduction of 1.0 to 1.1 log points, and all are significant at
the one percent level. This represents a reduction from around 7,000 immigrants per month to a low
of 2,000, with levels returning to around 7,000 two years after the election. We note, however, that
the persistence of this decline depends entirely on whether one assumes the pre-election trend was
increasing, as fit by the model estimated in Table 6, or if one believes instead that the reversion to
2016 levels implied the effect was temporary. Our own interpretation is that while there is strong
evidence of a large decline following the election, we are more agnostic about whether this was
temporary, which we view as probable, or persistent, which we view as possible.
        Finally, we note that the reduction in migration of undocumented Central Americans and
deported Mexicans is also consistent with the dramatic reduction in the number of individuals who
arrived at the southwest US border seeking humanitarian protection under U.S. law. These are
individuals formally classified as "inadmissible aliens" and include those who are encountered at the
southwest U.S ports of entry seeking lawful admission into the United States, but are either determined
to be inadmissible or withdraw their application and return to their country of origin. This result is
shown in Figure 5, with corresponding estimates in Online Appendix Table A1. Results indicate the
number of inadmissibles at the U.S. border fell by around 60 percent following the election, and
persisted for at least two years.
        In summary, results indicate that despite the fact that the 2016 election resulted in the
unexpected win of a candidate who made border enforcement a focal point of his campaign--and did
it in an arguably hostile way--it had little effect on overall illegal immigration by Mexican citizens. In
contrast, we do see reductions for two groups: a persistent reduction in the reentry rates of those
deported back to Mexico, and at least a temporary reduction among unauthorized immigrants from
Central America.

4. Conclusion
        While there has been much interest in understanding the determinants of immigration--
including and especially illegal immigration--previous work has focused on the impact of factors such
as economic conditions and specific immigration policies. In contrast, little was known about the
impact of the recent wave of provocative anti-immigration politicians in general, or Donald Trump in
particular. In this paper, we examine how the surprise 2016 election of Donald Trump and the
corresponding change in expected immigration policy and rhetoric impacted illegal immigration flows
into the United States.
        Results provide evidence of a mixed response. On the one hand, there is little evidence that
the election of Donald Trump reduced the overall inflow of undocumented Mexicans. This is
surprising given the hostility that President Trump had shown throughout his campaign toward
unauthorized immigrants in general, and to those from Mexico in particular. The lack of an overall
response suggests the expected costs to unauthorized immigrants even under President Trump were
small relative to the benefits of working in the United States. However, we do find the election
reduced reentry among Mexican immigrants deported from the U.S. Estimates indicate those
deported just after the election stated they were 20 percent less likely to reenter the U.S. than those
who were deported just before the election. In addition, apprehension data from the U.S. Border
Patrol and deportation data from Mexico indicate that the election led to a dramatic, but likely
temporary reduction in illegal immigration of Central Americans to the United States.
        Collectively, these findings indicate that while the 2016 Trump election did not deter illegal
immigration by Mexican nationals, it did deter illegal immigration by Central Americans, at least
temporarily. The election also generated a persistent 20 percent reduction in intended re-entry rates
among Mexican citizens who were deported. This mixed response highlights how sensitivity to a
broad shift in immigration policy and rhetoric can differ across immigrant populations. In addition,
the lack of a broad and sustained impact on unauthorized migration flows demonstrates how large the
expected benefits are relative to the expected costs for the marginal migrant, and highlights the limits
of policy in reducing illegal immigration.

Notes: Panel A shows all apprehensions by U.S. border patrol along the southwest border with Mexico. Apprehensions
refer to the physical control or temporary detainment of a person who is not lawfully in the U.S., which may or may not
result in arrest. The break in the line is due to missing data for those time periods.
