     This paper examines the effects of the level and length of unemployment

insurance    (UI) benefits on unemployment durations.       The paper particularly

studies individual behavior during the weeks just prior to when benefits

lapse.   Higher UI benefits are found to have a strong negative effect on the

probability of leaving unemployment.          However, the probability of leaving

unemployment rises dramatically just prior to when benefits lapse.          When the

length of benefits is extended, the probability of a spell ending is also very

high in the week benefits were previously expected to lapse.          Individual    data

are used with accurate information on spell durations, and the level and

length of benefits.     Semiparametric      estimation techniques are used and

compared to alternative approaches.         The semiparametric approach yields more

plausible    estimates and provides useful diagnostics.


                                       2.    Theory

     Unemployment behavior with finite duration UI has been analyzed in
several ways.    Mortensen   (1977) uses a dynamic search model.      In his model,

individuals maximize the present value of expected utility, where utility is a

function of income and leisure.        There is no saving in the model; individuals

consume their income.    A stationary known wage offer distribution is assumed

and the arrival rate of job offers is constant over time for a given search

intensity.    Mortensen's escape rate or hazard is proportional       to s[l-F(wfl,

where s is the search intensity, w is the reservation wage and F is the

cumulative distribution of wage offers.         The hazard rises with search

intensity because the arrival rate of job offers increases.          The hazard also

rises as the reservation wage declines since the probability of an offer being

acceptable rises.     a is shown to increase as one gets closer to when benefits
                                             2

lapse, while    w   decreases as exhaustion approaches.1      Both derivatives imply

that the hazard rises up until the point of UI exhaustion.           After exhaustion,

the environment Lacing an unemployed individual does not change implying a

Constant hazard.        The time pattern of the hazard is shown in Figure    1, where    T

is the    length of UI benefits.2
     Moffitt and Nicholson (1982) use a version of the static labor-leisure

model of individual choice.         In this model people have preferences over two

goods, income and unemployment.        Unemployment has utility because of its

leisure value and because one can search.           The new job wage is fixed and a job

can be found at any time.        At the time of job loss, an individual chooses

income and weeks of unemployment subject to a budget constraint.           The budget

constraint has a convex kink at the week of benefit exhaustion because

unemployment ceases to be subsidized.        Figure 2 shows the budget constraint.
  is the wage,      R   is the fraction of the wage replaced by UI benefits and T is

the length of benefits.        An indifference curve through the kink point can have

an implied marginal rate of substitution equal to any value between the slopes

of the two budget constraint segments.           Thus, many people will maximize their

utility   by returning to     work the week benefits lapse.    Moffitt and Nicholson




     1The reservation wage is determinedby the equality between the value of
being employed at one's reservation wage and being unemployed (equation 9(a)
in Mortensen (1977)). The reservation wage must decline as exhaustion
approaches since the value of being unemployed drops. Search intensity is
determinedby the equality of the marginal cost of search (lost leisure) and
the marginal benefit of search (equation 9(b) in Mortensen (1977)). Since the
marginal benefit of search increases when the value of unemployment declines,
search intensity increases.

     2The figure is drawn assuming the marginal utility of leisure is
independent of income. If leisure and income are complements (substitutes),
the hazard is discontinuous at T and higher (lower) after T than shown.
                                            3

then argue informally that the random nature of job finding will cause a

clustering of observations around the exhaustionpoint.

     The two models make very different assumptions but have similar

predictions.     In the Mortensen model the individual is uncertain when a job

will be found and what the wage will be.         One remains unemployed until a

sufficientlyhigh paying job is found.           In the Moffitt and Nicholson model one

can find a job at a fixed wage anytime.         The model emphasizes   the leisure

value that a period of not working may have if one optimizes over a long

period of time such as a year.        This explanationmakes more sense if        there   is

a significant    demand for home production or it is difficult to take a vacation

once a new job has begun.3         Both models similarly predict a rising hazard as

the UI exhaustion point approaches.         Because of the stationarity assumptions,

Mortensen's model implies a monotoriic increase in the hazard as exhaustion

approaches.     The Moffitt and Nicholson model is less precise but a rise in the

hazard around the exhaustion point is implied.

     There are several aspects of UI unemployment spells that are not captured

by these models.    The length of UI benefits often changes in the course of an

unemployment spell.     In   the   sample studied below about 47 percent of UI

recipients    experienced a change in their length of benefits.        Second,

individuals may make arrangements        to return to a job several weeks before they

actually do.     Third, recall is quantitativelymore important than new job

finding for most UI    recepients.     Using data from two states, Corson and

Nicholson    (1984) and Katz and Meyer (1987) find that about 60 percent of

spells end in recall.    Katz (1985) provides a clear discussion of search with



     3lmplicit in this discussion is the assumption that the search
requirement for UI receipt can be satisfied at low cost.
                                         4

 recall and infinite length unemployment     insurance.   However, recall dates

 likely depend on individual or typical UI benefit lengths.      If workers are

bound to firms by implicit contracts, moving costs, specific human capital, or

other reasons, firms have an incentive to base recall decisions on the
                                                                       length
of UI benefits.

     Mortensen (1987) provides a model which has this characteristic.       He

analyzes a joint wealth maximizing model of job separations with firms facing

transitory demand changes and limited duration of unemployment benefits. The

discrete change in the flow value of being unemployed when benefits are

exhausted yields the prediction that many firms may recall laid-off workers

around the benefit exhaustionpoint.



                                     3. Data



     The data are from the Continuous Wage and benefit History (CWBH) UI

administrative    records used by Moffitt (l985a, 1985b).    Males from twelve

states during the period 1978-1983 are examined.      The advantage of CWBH data

is accurate information on weeks of UI receipt,
                                                pre-unemployment      earnings, the
UI benefit, and the potential duration of benefits over time.       The importance
of accurate data is highlighted by the large degree of measurement error that

has been found in the weeks unemployedvariable in some household surveys.4


     4poterba and Summers (1984) and Sider(l984) examine the Current
Population Survey.  Using data matched across two consecutive months, Poterba
and Summers check if the reported length of continuingunemployment spells
increases by four to five weeks in the course of a month.
                                                           Allowing for a
three-week margin of error they find that only 57 percent of responses are
consistent.  Sider studies the distribution of reported incomplete
unemployment spells. He finds a pronounced tendency to report round numbers
such as 26 and 39 weeks. This clustering cannot be due to UI since these are
incomplete spell lengths.
                                         5

Additionally,    the UI parameters, benefit level and duration, are often missing

from other data sources.     The CWBH data provide accurate information on these

key variables.

        The disadvantage of the data is that only information on weeks

compensated by the UI system is available.      Individuals are censored when

their benefits lapse, so behavior beyond the exhaustion point cannot be

examined,     Also, an individual may not receive UI continuously;    weeks may be

skipped during which benefits are not received.5        The spell of benefit receipt

may be more useful than the unemployment     spell when unemployment is briefly

interrupted but followed by more unemployment.        The spell of benefit receipt

                                                                             The
may do a better job of grouping together periods of similar behavior.

random sample, while the second oversamples      from states and time periods that

are more likely to have unchangingbenefit lengths.

        The Moffitt dataset contains 4,626 observations.     Two exclusions6 leave

3,365 observations which are analyzed.       Descriptive statistics for the sample

1977 dollars).     The mean weekly benefit is 104.2     .70 is the mean UI

     61,227 observations have missing data on age, schooling, dependents or

percent.     The average number of weeks of benefits received is
                                                                 just over 13.
     A    more complete illustration of the pattern of weeks of UI receipt and

censoring can be seen in Table 2 and Figure 3.            Table 2 gives the empirical

hazard for the data.       The empirical hazard is the fraction of spells ongoing

at the start of a week which end during the week.8 In Figure 3 there are

several    periods when the empirical hazard is       noticeably higher than

surrounding periods.' The high hazard         in   the first several weeks     is probably

caused by    the   high frequency of recalls in the early weeks of unemployment.9
The hazard is higher between 25 and 29 weeks and then again between 35 and 38

weeks.     These jumps   are probably caused by UI exhaustion.       An examinationof

Table 3 provides some evidence on this point. Table 3 reports the
distribution of two measures of the length of UI benefits. Initial length is
the number of weeks of benefits an individtal is entitled to when his spell
begins.     Since benefit lengths often change in        the course of   an   individuals
spell,    the maximum length is also reported.        The rises in the hazard are

roughly coincident with weeks when benefits commonly lapse.              However the

timing of some of the peaks in the hazard is inconsistent with the earlier

theories.    The peak at 26 for example        cannot be caused by benefits running

out after 26 weeks.      Such individuals would be censored at 26        so   we would   not
observe   the end of   their   spells.   This is discussed in    more detail    later.


     8More formally,     the                                 t
                         empirical hazard for week (Ht), is the number of
failures during the week (Dt), divided by the size of the risk set at the
beginning of the week. The size of the risk set at the beginning of week t
(Rt), is just the number of people whose spells have not ended or been
censored at the beginning of week t. Algebraically, Ht — Dt/Rt. C. is the
number of observations which are censored at the beginning of week     C—       .

     There are several causes for the variability in benefit lengths seen in

Table 3.     First, there is variability across states in the length of regular

benefits provided.         During the sample period, Louisiana typically provided 28

weeks, Pennsylvania        provided 30 weeks, while most other states provided 26

weeks of benefits.         Second, benefits were extended during periods of high

unemployment    under several federal programs.      The Extended Benefits program

extended benefits 50 percent beyond state durations, up to a maximum of 39

weeks, whenever the insured unemployment rate was above a trigger level.              In

1981, the system changed from a state or federal trigger to a higher, state

only trigger.      Two other programs provided supplemental benefits.       At the

beginning of    tl-&e   sample period, the Federal Supplemental    Benefits program

provided up to a total of 65 weeks of benefits,         Beginning in the Fall of 1982

he   Federal Supplementary       Compensation program provided up to 62 weeks of

benefits.    These first two sources of variation are quantitatively the most

important.     Lastly, within a state at a point in time the length of benefits

may depend on an individual's work history.         The distribution of benefit

lengths reported in Table 3 reflects all of these factors.

     I initially examine the effects of finite length UI benefits

nonparametrically       and without explanatory variables.   Table 4 gives an

empirical hazard analogous        to the Kaplan-Meier estimator.    Figure 4 displays a

graph of the hazard.        The time axis is time until benefits lapse rather than

time since a spell began.        There is a noticable   rise in the hazard about five

weeks before benefits lapse.        The hazard also jumps dramatically the week

before benefits end.        For the other weeks there is no discernable trend,

except a somewhat lower hazard when exhaustion is more than nine months away.

                                  4.   Duration Nodels

     Several aspects of Table 4 point to the need for more sophisticated

modeling.     The hazard is high at 24, 25, 36, 37, and 38 weeks before

exhaustion.    This is due to the large number of people with initial durations

of 26 and 39 weeks, and the higher baseline hazard in the first few weeks of

unemployment    as seen in Figure 3.     Additionally,   the Kaplan-Meier hazard

assumes that the sample is homogeneous, i.e., that there is no heterogeneity

which depends on either observable or unobservable factors.         However one

expects that the characteristics       causing a lower hazard will be more

concentrated among the remaining individuals as one approaches        exhaustion.

For example, the remaining observations are likely to be disproportionately

high benefit, nonwhite, and older.       This sorting effect may mask a much larger

increase in the hazard as exhaustion approaches.         These problems are

potentially solved by using a duration model.        If the effect of time since the

beginning of a spell is handled in a flexible manner it should account for the

higher hazard just after 26 and 39 weeks until exhaustion.         Similarly,   one can

look at the pure effect of getting closer to exhaustion, holding other

explanatory variables    constant.

     The importance of time dependent covariates and censoring in the data

make a duration model especially useful.        The theories of unemployment

behavior with UI discussed earlier, imply that the hazard should increase as

exhaustion approaches.    It is difficult to allow for this with explanatory

variables   constant over time.      The initial duration of benefits does not

reflect future extensions.     The maximum duration of benefits is an endogenous

variable since benefits have a higher probability of being extended if an
                                        9

unemployment spell lasts longer)0     This suggests using a (not necessarily

linear) function of time until exhaustion      to account for the length of

benefits.   Regression approaches to this problem are further plagued by the

censoring of over a quarter of the spells.      The biases from censoring   are

discussed extensively by Welch (1977) in the context of UI studies.

Greene(l98l) and Chung and Goldberger(1984)     derive the magnitude of the bias

under certain assumptions.   Alternatively,    one can assume a shape for the

distribution of spells and use Tobit type techniques, but estimates are very

sensitive to the assumed shape.11    A duration model can be less parametric

about the shape of the distribution and still allow censoring.

      The estimation approach used here is an extension of Prentice and

Cloeckler   (1978) which is discussed extensively in Meyer    (1986).   The shape of

the hazard is nonparametrically   estimated.    In this respect the approach is

similar to the method used successfully by Moffitt (1985a))-2 However, the

approach taken here has several advantages.      The estimates are parameters     of a

continuous time hazard model and thus retain an easy interpretation.        Second,

the probabilites   of surviving each period are constrained to lie between 0 and

I.   Third, there is a large literature discussing the importance of allowing


     10Consider the case where the initial length of benefits is the same for
all individuals and assume that the length of benefits does not affect the
length of spells.  If benefits have a positive probability of being extended
each period, the expected value of the maximum duration will be a monotonic
function of the dependent variable.

     11Moffitt (l985b) examines two unemployment spell data sets and finds the
estimates to be quite sensitive to the distribution assumed. An alternative
approach which would eliminate the distributional assumption would involve
slightly modifying semiparametric estimators for Tobit models such as Powell
(1984).

     12Green and Shoven (1986) use an approach close to Moffitt'a in their
examination of mortgage prepayments.

for unobservable differences         across people)-3                  These differences are usually

called unobserved heterogeneity.               It   is      relatively easy to test for

heterogeneity and estimate it parametrically                       in this model.                 The distribution

of the heterogeneity component can be nonparametrically                             estimated as well.

Formally,    let Ti be the length of individual                    i's unemployment spell.                  Then the

hazard for individual i at time           t,    i(t)           is defined by the equation

                                            5.   Results

       The effects of unemployment insurance are measured using functions of the

benefit level and the time until benefits lapse.                 The log of weekly benefits

and pre-Ul income are included in most specifications.                 Similar results are

obtained when the level of benefits and income are used and when the UI

replacement    ratio is tried.      High benefits are expected to decrease the hazard

because they lower the opportunity cost of search and leisure.                  High previous

earnings are expected to raise the hazard since the cost of unemployment in

terms of lost wages is higher and because high earnings are likely correlated

with unobserved job finding ability.              The other UI variables are UI 1 to

UI 41-54 which form a spline in time until benefit exhaustion.                  The

coefficient    on UI 2-5 is the additional effect on the hazard of having moved 1

week closer to exhaustion when one is 2-5 weeks away.                  The coefficient on UI 1

is the additional effect on the hazard when one moves from 2 to 1 week from

exhaustion.    Thus,     the effect of moving from         6   weeks away to 1 week is 4

times the UI 2-5 coefficientplus the UI 1 coefficient.                   The other UI

coefficients have analogous interpretations.

       Formally,   let   r   be the number of weeks until benefits lapse.             Then

UI 1     1 if r — 1, and
         0 otherwise

UI 2-5 —   min(6-r,4)        if    5, and
            0 otherwise

UI 6-10 —   min(ll-r,5) if           10, and
            0 otherwise,

and similarly for the remaining variables.

       The theories discussed in Section 2 predict that the exhaustion spline

coefficients should be positive.            The prediction depends on the stationarity
                                          13

of the offer arrival function and the wage distribution in Mortensen (1977).

If the stationarity assumptions are relaxed, the predictions of the model are

indeterminant.     However, one might well find that the exhaustion affect

dominates    in the weeks just before exhaustion, implying positive coefficients

for these spline segments.     In Moffitt and Nicholson (1982) the prediction for

the segments far from exhaustion depends on the distribution of preferences.

Thus, the most robust prediction seems to be positive coefficients on the

segments close to exhaustion.

     The results are reported in Tables 5 through 9.         The coefficients on the

explanatory variables    are in Tables 5 and 6.   The simpler specificationsare

discussed first, then the more sophisticated ones.         The weekly benefit and

after-tax weekly earnings coefficients have the expected signs and are

precisely estimated.    High wages and low benefits increase the hazard.           Using

the coefficient estimates    from specification   (1),   which are typical, a 10

percent increase in benefits at the mean is associated with an 8.8 percent

decrease in the hazard.     The time until exhaustion spline coefficients are

jointly highly significant;    two of the coefficients     are significant

individually.    The point estimates indicate that moving from 54 to 41 weeks

from exhaustion increases the hazard by 32 percent.        Between 41 to 6 weeks the

hazard is basically flat, but the point estimate is a small decrease in the

hazard.     From 6 to 2 weeks until exhaustion the hazard rises 67 percent, and 1

week away the hazard rises an additional 97 percent.         Cumulatively,   the hazard

more than triples as one moves from 6 weeks to I week until exhaustion.

     The coefficient on the state unemployment rate has the expected sign and

is significantly   different from zero.    In specification (1), the implied

effect of a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is         •a   2.4
                                             14

percent reduction     in the hazard.   The hazard falls almost monotonicallywith

age.    Those 17-24 have the highest hazard while those 55 and over have the

lowest.

       Table 7 illustrates the value of the baseline hazard parameters as a

diagnostic tool.      Even with the time until exhaustion spline included in the

specification,    spikes in the hazard remain at 26, 28, 32, and 36 weeks.            The

spikes may be caused by individuals arranging to be recalled or begin a new

ob   well before benefits run out.      If benefits are extended in the intervening

period,   the result would be a higher hazard after common UI exhaustion points.

       This hypothesis is tested by adding a variable equal to I in week t,            if
earlier in the spell it was expected that benefits would lapse at c.15            The

variable is used in specification      (3)   and specifications    (5) through (8).     The

coefficient    always has a large asymptotic t-statistic.         The point estimates

imply a four- to five-fold increase in the hazard in the week benefits were

expected to lapse.     When the benefits expected to lapse variable is included,

the spikes at 26, 28, and 36 are no longer present, and the one at 32

declines.     This result can be seen by comparing Table 7 with Table 8 and Table

9.   The estimates provide support for the hypothesis that early in spells some

firms and employees    plan when unemployment will end.16 This finding accords

with the Moffitt and Nicholson model in which the length of the unemployment

spell is selected when unemployment begins.        An alternative explanation for


     15it is assumed that changes in UI benefit lengths are not foreseen. To
predict changes, an individual would need to predict unemployment rates and
congressional actions. As long as the prediction is not perfect, one would
expect an effect of the old exhaustiondate on the hazard.

     l6i originally included separate variables for recent changes in the
length of benefits (in the last 8 weeks) and changes that took place anytime
during the spell. The coefficient on the within the rast 8 weeks variable was
always larger but never significantly different from the other coefficient.
                                            15

the result might be that some people eligible for extended benefits do not

claim them, despite the simplicity of the procedure and the financial reward.

     The second advantage of nonparametric          estimationof the baseline hazard

is consistency of covariate coefficientswhen the shape of the baseline hazard

is not known.     Despite lack of theoretical support for any particular shape,

numerous authors have fitted models with a Weibull baseline hazard.

Specifications    (2)    and (6) impose a Weibull baseline, allowing a comparison of

techniques.     Likelihood ratio tests of the null hypothesis of a Weibull

baseline reject, indicating that the Weibull model is misspecified.                The

chi-square statistics with 36 degrees of freedom are 93.93 and 53.32 for

specifications    (2)    and (6), respectively.17     Note that the Weibull assumption

is a much better approximation when the benefits expected to lapse variable is

included.

     There is some evidence that the Weibull assumptionhas biased tha

coefficiants,    particularly those on the time-varying covariates.           In

specification (1) the unemployment rate coefficient is negative and

significant,    while in the Weibull model of specification       (2)    it is positive.

Two of the coefficients of the UI exhaustion spline also change sign, but they

are insignificant       using either estimator.     The coefficients on time-constant

covariates are very close in the two sets of estimates.           These results confirm

intuitive   arguments about the effects of misspecifying the baseline hazard.

Since the time pattern of the hazard has been misspecified,             coefficients     on

time-vsryingcovariates, which depend on the time pattern of the hazard, are



     17The critical values at the .05 and .01 level are 51.00 and 5362,
respectively.   Specification (2) is rejected at conventional significance
levels.   Specification (5) is rejected at the .05 level, but just passes at
the .01 level.
                                          16

more likely to be biased than other coefficients.       This result has also been

found in some preliminaryMonte Carlo experiments.

     Specifications (4) through (9) include state fixed effects.         Fixed

effects are included because omitted state characteristics      may affect both

unemployment and the generosity of state UI systems.       The omission of fixed

effects in this situation would bias estimated UI responses)-8       Several

authors have found variables which are correlated with both unemployment and

the generosity of UI programs.      Medoff (1979) finds that the layoff subsidy

from incomplete UI experience rating is higher for union establishments than

nonunion establishments,       Unionizationalso leads to greater use of layoffs

independent of the UI subsidy.      Adams (1986) finds that the UI subsidy per

worker to employers is correlated with the diversifiability of state

employment,   the skewness of state unemployment rates, and several industrial

characteristics.    However,    it is unclear whether the correlations   found by

Medoff and Adams reflect the political economy of UI legislation or the

effects of UI on employment and layoff patterns.1'9

     A   comparison of specifications    (3) and (7) overwhelmingly supports the

presence of state fixed effects.      The likelihood ratio test statistic    is

217.78 and is distributed chi-square with 11 degrees of freedom under the null

hypothesis of no fixed effects.2°       There is some evidence that the endogeneity


     1'8The omitted state characteristics are assumed to be constant over the
sample period so that fixed effects estimates are consistent.

     19The latter view is adopted by Deere and Miron (1986) who argue that the
distribution of State employment by industry is shaped by UI laws.

     20The critical values at the .05 and .01 level are 19.68 and 24.72,
respectively.  The states with the lowest hazards all else equal are Nevada,
New Mexico, and Wisconsin. Missouri, North Carolina, and South Carolina have
the highest hazards.
                                          17

 of state UI laws biases the UI benefit coefficient in the estimates without

 fixed effects.   Specifications   (3) and (7) are identical except for the use of

 fixed effects in (7).    In the fixed effects specification            the coefficient on

benefits drops 29 percent in absolute value to     -   .60.    All other fixed effects

specificationshave similar coefficients in the         -   .50 to   -   .60   range, except

specifications (4) and    (5).   The coefficients in specifications               (4)   and   (5)

have a slightly different interpretationbecause of the large unobserved

heterogeneity variance.    The inclusion of unobserved heterogeneity tends to

increase the absolute value of coefficients,     even though expected duration

elasticities may not change much.21 The exhaustion spline and benefits

expected to lapse variables do not appreciably change.

     The introductionof state fixed effects dramatically changes the state

unemployment rate coefficient.      The unemployment rate is the monthly CPS state

unemployment rate interpolated to give a weekly series.             In the specifications

with a nonparametric baseline but without state fixed effects (specifications

(1) and (3)), the coefficient on unemployment is negative.                These

specificationsestimate the unemployment coefficient using variation in

unemployment across states as well as over time.           On the other hand, state

fixed effects specifications     controL for the state level of unemployment and



      21The coefficients reported are always the
                                                 logarithmic derivatives of the
hazard with respect to the covariates. Even when these logarithmic
derivatives are the same, elasticities of other measures of
                                                             spell length may
change.   This rescaling effect is discussed in Lancaster (1979, 1985).  In a
hazard model with no time-varying regressors, no censoring, and a Peibull
baseline hazard, Lancaster (1985) derives the asymptotic bias from omission of
heterogeneity.   He finds that all coefficients are biased towards zero by the
same proportion.   However, elasticities with respect to the expected value of
the log of duration are unbiased.   With censored data and
covariates the appropriate elasticity to report is unclear.time-varying
                                                              A good approach
might be to report the elasticities of the probability of a spell lasting a
given number of weeks, for a representative path of the covariates.
                                          18

only use the time-series variation in unemployment to estimate the

coefficient.     In the six specifications with state fixed effects

(specifications    (4) through (9)), the state unemployment rate coefficient is

positive and almost always significantly different from zero.

        These results imply that across state and over time variation in

unemployment have opposite effects for this time period.        States with higher

unemployment rates, all else equal, have longer unemployment spells.           However,

a rise in the unemployment rate over time for a given atate is associated with

a shortening of unemployment spells in that state.        An explanation for this

result is that layoffs are countercyclical;      in recessions the fraction of

unemployment due to layoffs rises.22 Layoff spells also tend to be shorter.

Thus,    it would not be surprising if the average duration of unemployment

spells fell.    As mentioned earlier, layoff spells are particularly

concentrated among UI recipients.      Furthermore, Dynarski and Sheffrin (1987)

find similar results for a sample of household heads during 1980-81 from the

PSID.     They find that the aggregate U.S. unemployment rate is negatively

correlatedwith unemployment duration, with and without controls for

demographic characteristics,     industry and occupation.    Because the aggregate

unemployment rate is used, Dynarski and Sheffrin have analyzed the effects of

time-series variation in the unemployment rate.        Thus, their estimates    accord

with the coefficients from the sample studied here.

        Allowing for unobserved heterogeneity does not change the conclusions

about the effects of UI.      Three specifications    ((4), (5) and (8)), include

gamma distributedunobserved heterogeneity.       The coefficients on UI benefits,

the time until exhaustion spline, and the variable for benefits previously


        22See Feldstein   (1975) and Lilien (1980).
                                             19

expected to lapse, are similar in the heterogeneity and no heterogeneity

specifications.   The UI variables always show strong effects in the directions

found earlier.    In two specifications,       (4) and (5), the variance of the

heterogeneity is significantly different from zero.23 In several other

specificationsno heterogeneity is found.            This result is puzzling, however in

Monte Carlo experiments Ridder and Verbakel (1983) find that a zero estimated

variance is not uncommon.          They find this result even when the estimated and
true models are identical.          1 have also found this result in some preliminary

Monte Carlo experiments.

     Specifications   (5)    and (7) allow a direct comparison of estimates with

and without heterogeneity.         The coefficients   in the heterogeneity

specification tend to be larger in absolute value as suggested by Lancaster,

but among the UI coefficients only the benefit zoefficient is
                                                              appreciably
larger.  The spline in time until benefit exhaustion, and the benefits

expected to lapse variable, are barely affected.            The estimated baseline

hazard becomes decidedly upward sloping however, when gamma
                                                            heterogeneity is
allowed.   Compare Tables 8 and 9 to see this result.

     Separate specifications analogous to (8) were estimated for the two

subsamples discussed in Section 3.         The estimates    for the random sample are

shown in specification      (8).    The estimates   for the sample with mostly constant

benefit lengths are shown in specification          (9).   In the random subsample,

benefits have a smaller effect than in specification (5), but similar to

specifications (6),   (7)   and (9).     The effect of approaching the week benefits

lapse is more pronounced, but the benefits expected to lapse effect is


     23The asymptotic t-statistics for specifications (4) and (5) are 3.89 and
4.05, respectively.  The critical values in a one-taled test at the .05 and
.01 levels are 1.64 and 2.33, respectively.
                                             20

slightly smaller.     The constant benefit length subsample also gives estimates

similar to earlier ones, except the time until exhaustion spline is U-shaped

as in Moffitt (1985).


                 6.   Some   Cownts    om the Results snd Conclusions

      In   the preceeding pages, all of the simpler specifications        are rejected

in favor of specification (5).         For this reason, estimates from specification

(5)   are used to summarize the results.          The coefficient on the UI benefit

level is precisely estimated and implies that a 10 percent increase in

benefits is associated with an 8.8 percent decrease in the hazard.            The

coefficient suggests a relatively large disincentive effect of UI.            Somewhat

smaller estimates are obtained when the same model is used on the random

subsample in specification      (8).   The benefit coefficient implies that a 10

percent increase in benefits is associated with a 5.3 percent decrease in the
hazard.    Since specification (5) hes a much larger heterogeneity variance,              the

two specifications    may lead to similar expected duration elasticities.           One

should note that the estimates only apply to the hazard prior to exhaustion.

Higher benefits may lead to a higher hazard after exhaustion as suggested by

Mortensen (1977).

      The time until exhaustion spline coefficients are jointly highly

significant;   three of the coefficients are individually significantly

different from zero an conventional levels.           The point estimates imply chat

moving from 54 to 41 weeks until exhaustion raises the hazard by 46 percent.

The hazard is essentially flat between 41 and 6 weeks, but the point estimates

imply a small decrease in the hazard.        Between 6 and 2 weeks before benefit

exhaustion the hazard rises 109 percent.           One week away the hazard rises en

additional 95 percent.       Cumulatively,   the hazard more than quadruples as one
                                        21

moves from 6 weeks to 1 week until exhaustion.     The pronounced rise in the

hazard as exhaustion approaches supports the models of both Mortensen (1977)

and Moffitt and Nicholson (1982).

     While the spike in the hazard just before exhaustion is striking, few

spells last sufficiently long to be affected by the spike.          Almost all of the

effect of UI on mean spell lengths comes from the level of benefits.            Here the

estimated effect of the benefit level is toward the high end of the

distribution of recent estimates.   A consensus of the previous estimates of

the effect of a ten percentage point increase in the replacement ratio might

be a one-half to one week increase in the length of spells.24           Here the

estimate is around one and one-half weeks.     The results also differ from those

of Topel (1983, 1984) who argues that the key mechanism by which UI raises the

unemployment   rate is the increased incidence of temporary layoffs rather than

the lowered exit rate from unemployment.

     Larger estimated effects are a plausible result of better data on spell

length and the level and length of benefits.     In the   Ct'S   data used by Topel,

one must make an educated guess whether or not an individual is receiving

benefits and then impute their level.    Difficulties with the       Ct'S   length of

unemployment spell variable were mentioned in Section      3.    However, the

estimates are sufficiently different from most other estimates          that a further




     24Hamermesh (1977) concludes that "the best estimate--if one chooses a
single figure--is that a 10-percentage point increase in the gross
replacement rate leads to an increase in the duration of insured unemployment
of about half a week when labor markets are tight."   Danziger, Haveman and
Plotnick (1981) eport a wide range of estimates, but suggest that Moffitt and
Nicholson (1982) offers the most reliable estimates. Their study found that a
10-percentage point increase in the replacement rate was associated with about
a one week increase in the average length of unemployment spells. The
etimates in Solon (1985) imply between a half a week and a full week increase
in mean durations from a 10-percentage point increase in the replacement rate.

examination seems warranted.    The sources of variation     in benefit      levels in

the 12 state CWBH data are norilinearities in the benefit schedules

(especially different minima and 5axima across states)        legislative changes

during the sample period, and the erosion of real benefit levels due to

inflation between legislative changes.        Differences in the   average   benefit
generosity across   states is absorbed by the state fixed effects in the

specifications,   and pre-Ul weekly earnings are included as an explanatory

variable.

     Within a given state at a point in time, the benefIt level is usually a

simple nonlinear function of previous earnings.       T'nus, it has beer, argued,

most notably in Welch (1977), that effects of the benefit level on

unemployment cannot be separated from the effects of previous earnings.             hile
I believe it is extreme to apply this criticism to the data set used here, as

a check on these estimates I plan to examine
                                             unemployment spells in           the
months around changes in   State UI laws.

       alnitial length is the number of weeks of benefits an
individual is entitled to when his spell begins.

       bMaximium length is the maximum number of weeks a person
becomes entitled to in the course of his spell. Maximum length
exceeds initial length whenever benefits are extended.

    aThis empirical hazard differs from the Kaplan-Meier
hazard with the time axis reversed for two reasons. First,
people begin with different lengths of benefits. Second,
the time until benefits lapse does not always decrease by
one each week, since the length of benefits often changes.
Thus, the accounting identity given in footnote 8 will not
hold and a person may appear more than once in the ri•sk set
for a given week.

    aThe confidence intervals are calculated using a
suggestion in Kalblfleisch and Prentice (1980).   The
hazard estimates and the standard errors are trans-
formed to insure that the confidence intervals lie
between 0 and 1. The normal approximatton used to
calculate confidence intervals is more reasonable
for the transformed hazard, especially for values of
