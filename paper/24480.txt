Ambulance Utilization in New York City after the Implementation of the Affordable Care
Act

                                         ABSTRACT

Expanding insurance coverage could, by insulating patients from having to pay full cost,
encourage the utilization of arguably unnecessary medical services. It could also eliminate (or at
least diminish) the need for emergency services through increasing access to preventive care.
Using publicly available data from New York City for the period 2013-2016, we explore the
effect of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on the volume and composition of ambulance
dispatches. Consistent with the argument that expanding insurance coverage encourages the
utilization of unnecessary medical services, we find that, as compared to dispatches for more
severe injuries, dispatches for minor injuries rose sharply after the implementation of the ACA.
By contrast, dispatches for pre-labor pregnancy complications decreased as compared to
dispatches for women in labor.

1. Introduction

        There is strong evidence dating back to the RAND Health Insurance Experiment that

expanding health insurance coverage leads to increased health care utilization (Manning et al.

1987). For instance, shortly after qualifying for Medicare, individuals are more likely to be

admitted to the hospital and more likely to have elective procedures (Card et al. 2008).

Researchers have also documented increased health care utilization after state Medicaid

expansions (Finkelstein et al. 2012), the 2006 Massachusetts universal coverage initiative (Miller

2012a), the 2010 dependent coverage expansion under the Affordable Care Act (Antwi et al.

2015), and the 2014 expansions of private and public coverage under the Affordable Care Act

(Sommers et al. 2015; Wherry and Miller 2016).

        These findings are of obvious importance to policymakers and healthcare experts, but

there is also a great deal of interest in estimating the effect of insurance coverage on the use of

avoidable and/or unnecessary medical services. This effect could, in theory, be either positive or

negative. On the one hand, by insulating patients from having to pay full cost, expanding

insurance coverage could encourage the utilization of these services (Arrow 1963). On the other

hand, expanding coverage could increase access to preventative care, eliminating, or at least

diminishing, the need for subsequent spending.

        One potentially fruitful approach to testing whether insurance expansions encourage or

discourage the use of avoidable/unnecessary medical care is to focus on emergency services. An

increase in the use of emergency services following an insurance coverage expansion likely

reflects ex-post moral hazard, while a reduction would be consistent with the hypothesis that

newly insured individuals are receiving better preventive and/or curative care in office-based

settings.



                                                  1
        The current study examines changes in emergency medical service (EMS) dispatches in

New York City after the implementation of the 2014 provisions of the Affordable Care Act

(ACA). These provisions dramatically increased insurance coverage through a combination of

insurance market reforms, mandates, subsidies, and Medicaid expansions that took effect in 2014

(Sommers et al. 2015; Courtemanche, Marton, et al. 2017; Frean et al. 2017, Courtemanche et al.

2018). 1 Previous studies provide evidence that emergency department utilization increased due

to the randomized Oregon Medicaid expansion (Taubman et al. 2014), but fell after the 2006

Massachusetts reform, specifically among visit types that are preventable by primary care

(Kolstad and Kowalski 2012; Miller 2012b). However, this is the first study to investigate

whether the 2014 provisions of the ACA affected the use of emergency services, and the only

study to examine the association between insurance expansions and the composition of EMS

dispatches.

        Detailed data on New York City EMS dispatches allow us to stratify by specific call

codes used in the ambulance dispatches. These codes indicate the dispatcher’s best assessment

of the patient’s diagnosis based on the information available at the time of ambulance dispatch

and can be used to explore whether the ACA led to changes in the composition of EMS

dispatches.



1
  The insurance market reforms included prohibitions on denying coverage or pricing based on health, aside from
limited adjustments for age and smoking status. The mandates involved tax penalties for individuals without
insurance coverage and large employers who do not provide it. The law expanded Medicaid to 138 percent of the
Federal Poverty Line and subsidized private coverage via Marketplaces out to 400 percent, with the Medicaid
expansion becoming optional for states after a Supreme Court decision. These provisions took effect in 2014 with
the exception of partial early Medicaid expansions in some states. One potential concern with using data from New
York City is that the New York state Medicaid program was already relatively generous prior to 2014. Nonetheless,
health insurance coverage in New York state rose by two percentage points between 2013 and 2014, with half of this
increase coming from Medicaid (Courtemanche et al. 2016), which is comparable to estimates of the increase in
health insurance coverage for the country as a whole and suggestive of a “woodwork effect”. In other words, it
suggests that New Yorkers who were already eligible for Medicaid did not enroll in the program until the ACA took
effect, perhaps because of outreach efforts or because of publicity surrounding the new law (Frean et al. 2017).


                                                        2
        We begin our analysis by evaluating whether, relative to EMS dispatches for more severe

injuries, EMS dispatches for minor injuries increased after the implementation of the ACA.

Because EMS dispatches for minor injuries are difficult to justify on medical grounds, any such

increase can be ascribed to ex-post moral hazard. 2 Graphical evidence and difference-in-

differences regression results suggest that dispatches for minor injuries increased substantially

after the implementation of the ACA, while dispatches for more severe injures did not

significantly deviate from their pre-treatment trend.

        In the second half of our analysis, we focus on EMS dispatches for pre-labor pregnancy

as compared to EMS dispatches for women in active labor. Unlike minor injuries, pregnancy

complications are clearly linked to manageable health conditions such as depression, diabetes,

high blood pressure, HIV and obesity (NIH 2010; ACOG 2012, 2015). Moreover, there is strong

evidence that pregnant women who are covered by health insurance are more likely to seek

prenatal care as compared to their counterparts who are not covered (Currie and Gruber 1996). 3

Consistent with the preventive/curative care hypothesis, graphical evidence and difference-in-

differences regression results suggest that dispatches for pre-labor pregnancy complications

decreased immediately after the implementation of the ACA. By contrast, EMS dispatches for

women in labor continued uninterrupted on their pre-treatment trend. This pattern of results




2
 Theoretically, EMS dispatches for minor injuries could go down because access to insurance also lowers the price
of office-based care. However, the reduction in absolute price is much larger for ambulance services, which
commonly cost up to $2000 out-of-pocket (https://www.howmuchisit.org/ambulance-ride-cost/). For evidence that
EMS dispatches for minor injuries are medically unnecessary, see, for instance, Smith et al. (2001). These authors
showed that diverting nonurgent 911 calls to a telephone consulting nurse did not affect patient outcomes. See also
Cooke et al. (2004), who reviewed the research on diverting patients away from emergency departments. Further,
work by Moskatel and Slusky (2017) shows substitution from ambulances when ride sharing services enter a market,
suggesting that the advanced care capabilities of ambulances are not needed for many ambulance dispatches.
3
 Prior to the implementation of the ACA, fully 22 percent of women of childbearing age (i.e., ages 15-44) in the
United States were uninsured (March of Dimes 2009). While women were more likely to qualify for Medicaid after
becoming pregnant, there is strong evidence that the ACA increased coverage for pregnant women (Palmer 2018).

                                                        3
suggests that the effect of expanding insurance coverage on EMS dispatches can differ

dramatically depending upon the type of medical emergency.



2. Data

           EMS Incident Dispatch Data (EIDD) are a census of all ambulance dispatches in New

York City collected by the New York City Fire Department and were obtained through the New

York City Open Data portal. 4 Under Local Law 11, passed in 2012, all public data collected by

New York City must be made available through a single web portal.

           Other municipalities and the federal government have taken steps to make the data they

collect available to researchers and the public. For instance, under an executive order issued by

the Obama administration on May 9, 2013, “the default state of new and modernized

Government information resources shall be open and machine readable.” 5 However, because

current federal policy is based on an executive order, it could easily be amended or rescinded by

the current or subsequent administrations, while the New York City data availability rules are

written into law and cannot easily be changed from one administration to the next.

           Ambulances in New York City use a computer system to track ambulance dispatches (as

opposed to paper run-sheets), and EIDD contains detailed information about each incident,

including dispatch time and locational information (aggregated to the zip code level before being

made public so as to comply with HIPAA protections). EIDD are currently available for the

period January 1, 2013 through July 30, 2016, allowing us to explore the short-term effects of the

2014 ACA provisions.

    The New York City Open Data portal can be found at https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/.

 The Presidential Executive Order was issued on May 9, 2013, “Making Open and Machine Readable the New
Default for Government Information”

                                                          4
           In addition to time and location, the EIDD includes the initial “call code” for each

dispatch. When someone calls 9-1-1 and reaches an EMS dispatcher in New York City, the

dispatcher asks a series of questions to triage the call based on type and severity. The answers to

these questions are fed into a computer algorithm (effectively a decision tree), which assigns a

call type and associated severity. 6 Although this designation is not an official diagnosis and does

not necessarily reflect the actual condition of the patient, it can be thought of as a reasonably

accurate assessment based on the information provided immediately prior to ambulance

dispatch. 7 Each call type has an associated severity code that ranges from 1 to 9, with 1 being

the most severe and 9 being the least severe.

           The EIDD contain 114 unique call codes, but the 10 most common call codes account for

76 percent of all dispatches, and the 25 most common codes account for 95 percent of all

dispatches. Our interest is in whether and how the composition of call codes changed following

the implementation of the ACA in January of 2014.



3. Graphical Evidence

           Figure 1 plots percent changes in the volume of all EMS dispatches in New York City

between January 1, 2013 and July 30, 2016 relative to the final quarter of 2013 (baseline), when

New York City dispatched 308,000 ambulances. The vertical black line denotes the last quarter

before the implementation of the ACA, which increased insurance coverage (due to the opening

of the ACA exchanges and Medicaid expansion) and mandated that emergency services

  All dispatchers in New York City are also trained Emergency Medical Technicians, and have the ability to override
the algorithm’s triage designation based on their best medical judgement
7
    This information comes from direct conversation with the OpenData Help Desk


                                                        5
(including ambulance rides) be covered by all health plans as an “essential health benefit.” 8 The

volume of ambulance dispatches grew steadily after the implementation of the ACA, with some

seasonal variation. The volume of EMS dispatches reached a high of 357,856 in the 3rd quarter

of 2015, or an increase of 15 percent relative to baseline.

            Although interesting, it is difficult to ascertain how much (if any) of this increase in total

EMS dispatches was due to the ACA and how much was due to other factors such as population

growth and economic activity. We begin our exploration of this question in Figure 2, which

compares EMS dispatches for minor injuries (which are clearly subject to ex-post moral hazard),

to dispatches for other types of injuries (which are presumably less subject to ex-post moral

hazard). By making this comparison, we are, in effect, removing any underlying trends common

to both types of injuries. Again, percent changes in dispatch volumes relative to the final quarter

of 2013 (i.e., baseline) are shown. 9

            Utilization of ambulances for minor injuries followed the same general trend as other

injuries prior to the implementation of the ACA. Then, in the 1st quarter of 2014, the two trends

diverged, with minor injuries becoming relatively more frequent. By the 2nd quarter of 2015,

there was a 150 percent increase in dispatches for minor injuries relative to baseline. Although

we cannot discern which of these dispatches were medically unnecessary, it is reasonable to

speculate that much of this increase was the result of ex-post moral hazard given that more

severe injuries exhibited no upward trend whatsoever.




8
    These benefits are defined in Section 103(b) of the Affordable Care Act.
9
  Minor injuries are coded as a 7 on the EIDD severity scale, major injuries are coded as a 3 on this scale, and
injuries that are neither minor nor major (simply designated as “injuries” by the EIDD) are coded as a 5. Together,
these three types of EMS dispatches comprised 16.7 percent of total EMS dispatches in New York City during the
period under study.


                                                            6
         In Figure 3, we compare percent changes relative to baseline in the volume of EMS

dispatches for two pregnancy-related emergencies: active labor and pre-labor obstetric

complication. 10 During the period under study, dispatches for these two types of emergencies

comprised 0.9 percent of total EMS dispatches in New York City. Although the EIDD does not

disclose what specific medical conditions are included in the obstetric complication category, a

recent analysis of pregnancy-related EMS transports suggests that these cases are most likely

vaginal bleeding, ruptured membranes, ectopic pregnancy, and pregnancy-related hypertension

(McLelland et al. 2016), which can often be treated by a woman’s primary care provider or

avoided through proper case management (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists

2013, 2014), eliminating, or at least reducing, the need for EMS transport.

         The volume of dispatches for women in labor held relatively stable over the observed

period, with a slight downward trend beginning roughly a year after the ACA came into effect.

By contrast, dispatches for pregnancy complications followed a very different pattern:

specifically, there was a decrease in dispatches for pregnancy complications beginning the

quarter before implementation, which became more pronounced after implementation. This

“pre-treatment” decrease in dispatches for pregnancy complications is consistent with evidence

that health insurance coverage also began to rise in the 4th quarter of 2013, at least in Medicaid

expansion states (Long et al. 2014). 11 Within three months after implementation, dispatches for

pregnancy complications had fallen by over 40 percent, and within 6 months they had fallen by



10
   Active labor is coded as a 5 on the EIDD severity scale and denotes a woman in active labor requesting medical
transport. Obstetrical complications do not include miscarriages and are coded as a 2 on the EIDD severity scale.
11
   Specifically, Long et al. (2014) found that, in Medicaid expansion states, the uninsured rate dropped from 16% in
the 3rd quarter of 2013 to 15% in the 4th quarter of 2013 (and to 12% in the 1st quarter of 2014). This decrease in the
uninsured rates did not occur in states that did not to expand their Medicaid programs, and could have been due to
pre-implementation outreach efforts and individuals realizing that they were already eligible for Medicaid and did
not have to wait until January 1, 2014 to sign up.

                                                           7
over 60 percent. After 6 months, the volume of dispatches for pregnancy complications held

steady (at a little under 500 per quarter), with perhaps a slight downward trend. The fact that

much of the reduction in EMS dispatches for pregnancy complications occurred so rapidly after

the ACA came into effect suggests that it was driven by already pregnant women receiving better

prenatal care and better treatment for preexisting chronic health conditions such as diabetes, high

blood pressure, and HIV.



4. Difference-in-Differences Regression Strategy

         In this section, we turn our attention to producing more rigorous estimates of the effects

of the ACA on the composition of EMS dispatches. Specifically, using a difference-in-

differences regression design, we compare the volume of dispatches for minor as compared to

more severe injuries before and after the implementation of the ACA. Because the dependent

variable is a count, we estimate baseline Poisson regression models of the form:



           ln 𝜆𝜆𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 �𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑦𝑦 � + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑦𝑦 ,   (1)



where 𝜆𝜆𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 represents the expected number of dispatches for call type c, in dispatch zone z,

month m, and year y. 12 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 is an indicator that distinguishes between dispatches for minor




12
  When a 9-1-1 call is received, it is first handled by a Police Communications Technician, who determines the
nature of the call, and then hands it off to an appropriate dispatcher: police, fire or EMS. The city is divided into
separate EMS dispatch zones, each with its own ambulance fleet (See NYC’s “Anatomy of a 9-1-1 call for more
detail: http://www.nyc.gov/html/911reporting/html/anatomy/call.shtml). Given that there are 2 possible call types,
31 dispatch zones in New York City and 42 months of data, each regression has 2,604 observations (2 x 31 x 42 =
2,604). As noted by Card and Dahl (2011), an advantage of the Poisson regression model is that including fixed
effects does not lead to an incidental parameters problem. Table A1 provides descriptive statistics for the variables
used in the analysis.


                                                                  8
injury and dispatches for more severe injuries. 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑦𝑦 is the interaction of 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 and

an indicator for calls made in 2014, 2015 or 2016. Our coefficient of interest, 𝛽𝛽1, is the

difference-in-differences estimator. It represents the pre- vs. post-ACA change in expected

dispatches for minor injuries as compared to more severe injuries.

         We also report Poisson estimates of the following regression model:



     ln 𝜆𝜆𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 �𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑦𝑦 � + 𝛼𝛼2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐 + 𝛼𝛼3 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑦𝑦 ,   (2)



where 𝜆𝜆𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 again represents the expected number of dispatches for call type c, in dispatch zone

z, month m, and year y. In this model, however, call type is either pre-labor pregnancy

complication or woman in active labor. 13 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐 is an indicator that distinguishes

between these two types of dispatches, and 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑦𝑦 is the interaction of

𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐 and an indicator for calls made in 2014, 2015 or 2016. Our coefficient of

interest, 𝛼𝛼1 , represents the pre- vs. post-ACA change in expected dispatches for pregnancy

complications as compared to women in active labor. Because both types of dispatches involve a

pregnant woman, the difference-in-differences estimator accounts for the influence of

unobserved shocks to the local pregnancy rate. Moreover, to the extent that ex-post moral hazard

manifests in both EMS dispatches for pre-labor pregnancy complications and EMS dispatches

for women in labor, it isolates the effect of better prenatal care and treatment for preexisting

chronic health conditions.




13
  Again, given that there are 2 possible call types, 31 dispatch zones in New York City and 42 months of data, each
regression has 2,604 observations (2 x 31 x 42 = 2,604).


                                                                    9
4.1. Difference-in-Differences Regression Results

           Poisson estimates of equations (1) and (2) are reported in Table 1. Standard errors are in

parentheses and are adjusted for clustering at the call type-zone level. In general, the Poisson

estimates reported in Table 1 are consistent with the graphical evidence described in the

preceding section.

           In the first column of Table 1, we report baseline estimates of equation (1). The estimate

of 𝛽𝛽1, is 0.46, which suggests that, as compared to dispatches for more severe injuries, dispatches

for minor injuries increased by 58 percent (e.46 - 1 = .584) after the implementation of the ACA.

By contrast, the estimate of 𝛽𝛽3, is .01, which suggests that the volume of dispatches for more

severe injures did not appreciably change after the implementation of the ACA.

           In column (2) of Table 1, we augment the baseline model by controlling for pre-treatment

dispatch trends by call type. 14 The estimates of 𝛽𝛽1 are remarkably robust to this modification,

lending support to the argument that they reflect ex-post moral hazard. Specifically, even

controlling for pre-treatment trends in dispatch counts by call type we find that, relative to

dispatches for other types of injuries, dispatches for minor injuries increased by 60 percent after

the implementation of the ACA.

           In the remaining columns of Table 2, we turn our attention to pregnancy-related

dispatches. The estimate of 𝛼𝛼1 in column (3) is -.97, which suggests that, as compared to active

labor dispatches, EMS dispatches for pre-labor complications fell by 62 percent (e-.97 - 1 = -.621)


14
     With the pre-treatment trends in dispatch counts by call type, the estimating equation becomes:

                        ln 𝜆𝜆𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 �𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑦𝑦 � + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑦𝑦 + 𝑍𝑍̂𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐

where 𝑍𝑍̂𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 comes from Poisson models in which monthly dispatches by call type are regressed on dispatch zone
indicators and a linear trend using only pre-ACA data. 𝑍𝑍̂𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 is the predicted count of dispatches for each call type-
zone-month. In other words, these predictions are from the pre-treatment dispatch trend projected into the post-
treatment period. See Repetto (2018) for further description of this approach.

                                                                         10
after the implementation of the ACA. The estimate of 𝛼𝛼3 is -0.13, which suggests that

dispatches for women in active labor deceased after the implementation of the ACA by 12

percent (e-.13 - 1 = -.122). This decrease in EMS dispatches for active labor, although much

smaller than the decrease we observe for pregnancy complications, is statistically significant at

conventional levels and suggests that the ACA may have slightly reduced the demand for

emergency services among women in active labor. When equation (2) is augmented with pre-

treatment time trends, we find that EMS dispatches for pre-labor complications fell by 71 percent

(e-1.24 - 1 = -.711) relative to active labor dispatches after the implementation of the ACA in

2014. 15



4.2. Event-Study Analyses

           As a final robustness check, we conduct an event-time analysis, which allows us to

explore pre-treatment trends by call type and whether the effect of the ACA gained strength over

time. Specifically, we replace the interaction of Minor and Post in equation (1) with a series of

its leads and lags, tracing out the evolution of minor vs. more severe injury dispatches during the

period under study and allowing us to test the parallel trends assumption.

           Figure 4 plots the event-time coefficients for each quarter as well as a 95 percent

confidence interval around each coefficient. It provides some evidence, albeit tentative, that

minor injuries were falling relative to more severe injuries prior to the implementation of the

ACA. However, immediately after implementation, minor injury dispatches began to increase.

By the 2nd quarter of 2015, we observe an 84% increase in minor vs. more severe injuries relative




15
  In Appendix Tables 1 and 2, we provide OLS and Negative Binomial estimates of equations (1) and (2). The
results are qualitatively similar to those reported in Table 1.

to the 4th quarter of 2013 (baseline), which is consistent with evidence that coverage gains from

the ACA grew considerably in 2015 (Courtemanche et al. 2018).

       In Figure 5, we plot the event-time coefficients for pregnancy complication vs. active

labor dispatches. These two types of dispatches appear to have been on similar trends through

the 3rd quarter of 2013. Beginning in the 4th quarter of 2013, there was a pronounced decrease in

dispatches for pregnancy complications relative to active labor dispatches, which is consistent

with evidence that health insurance coverage in Medicaid expansion states also began to rise in

the 4th quarter of 2013 (Long et al. 2014). The decrease in dispatches for pregnancy

complications gained momentum after the official implementation of the ACA, and by the 4th

quarter of 2014 there was a 71 percent decrease in pregnancy complication calls relative to active

labor calls. After the 4th quarter of 2014, dispatches for pregnancy complication calls began to

increase relative to active labor calls, albeit modestly.



5. Conclusion

         Uniquely detailed data from New York City allow us to examine two valuable case

studies of how utilization of EMS services responded to the ACA’s large-scale expansion of

health insurance coverage. The policy implications are mixed. To the extent that unnecessary

care grew relative to similar but more essential types of care (such as minor injury dispatches

relative to other injuries documented above), the ACA seems to have had the unintended effect

of increasing medical spending on the so-called “flat of the curve,” i.e. spending with dubious

medical value. This growth in utilization could also have the further unintended effect of

creating ambulance system congestion if the increased utilization pushed the ambulance system

past its capacity (Courtemanche, Friedson et al. 2017). By contrast, our analysis of pregnancy-



                                                  12
related dispatches illustrates that coverage expansions do not always increase avoidable

emergency spending. Moral hazard can be offset by improving access to preventive services and

providing better care for chronic conditions.

         While previous studies have examined how the use of emergency services responds to

coverage expansions, this literature has focused almost entirely on emergency room (ER) visits.

We offer a different perspective by using novel data to study ambulance utilization. Our results

indicate that the same forces that influence ER use are also at work in the decision to call for an

ambulance. Our finding of increased dispatches for minor injuries echoes Taubman et al.’s

(2014) result that ER use rose among winners of the Oregon Medicaid lottery, while our finding

of reduced dispatches for pregnancy complications are consistent with the declines in ER visits

for preventable conditions observed after the Massachusetts reform (Kolstad and Kowalski 2012;

Miller 2012b).

         For EMS providers, our results suggest that the optimal response to changing utilization

patterns will depend on the pre-policy case mix. The nuanced changes in New York City

dispatch patterns following the insurance coverage expansion under the ACA highlights the

value of providing easy-to-access public data at the municipal level. Such data will make the

task of responding to future policies considerably easier, allowing for flexible local responses to

each unique case mix and situation.
