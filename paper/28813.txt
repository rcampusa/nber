                                          ABSTRACT

Standard measures of bodyweight (overweight and obese, for example) fail to reflect
technological progress over time - and in particular, recent progress disproportionately promoting
longevity at higher bodyweights (and differences in access to it). This paper builds on the
pioneering work of Hans Waaler (Waaler, 1984) and Robert Fogel (Fogel, 1994) to empirically
estimate how technological progress, and differential access to it, have fundamentally
transformed the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and longevity in high-, middle-,
and low-income countries. Importantly, we show that the combined effect of technological
progress and access to it across countries is so profound that the share of national populations
above mortality-minimizing bodyweight is not clearly greater in countries with higher overweight
and obesity rates (as traditionally defined) - and in fact, relative to current standards, a larger
share of low-income countries' populations can be unhealthily heavy.

   Bodyweight has been rising around the world for centuries. Historically, innovation

in agriculture has reduced the real price of calories (Ankli, 1980), fueling increases

in human stature (Fogel, 1994; Fogel and Costa, 1997; Floud et al., 2011). Early

gains in bodyweight reduced chronic malnutrition, promoting immune resilience and

dramatically raising life expectancy in Western nations (Fogel and Costa, 1997; Sen,

1982; Drèze and Sen, 2013). However, the continued rise in bodyweight - and obesity

- has more recently been treated with alarm because of accompanying chronic disease

morbidity and mortality (Fontaine et al., 2003; Yach et al., 2006; Popkin and Gordon-

Larsen, 2004; Ebbeling et al., 2002). In lower-income countries today, which confront

a simultaneous "double burden" of undernutrition and obesity, rising bodyweight is a

mixed blessing, helping some and harming others (Shrimpton and Rokx, 2012; Strauss

and Thomas, 1998; Biswas et al., 2020). Approximately two billion people globally are

overweight or obese, a number projected to rise (Roberto et al., 2015).

   Clinically, whether a particular bodyweight is healthy is a complex question de-

termined by more than just weight and height. For example, body mass index (BMI,

or the ratio of weight in kilograms to height in meters squared) does not discriminate

between fat and muscle mass (Heitmann et al., 2000; Ortega et al., 2016). Nonetheless,

at the population level, BMI is a widely used summary statistic. According to the World

Health Organization, for adults, a BMI less than 18.5 indicates underweight, between

18.5 and 25 indicates normal weight, between 25 and 30 indicates overweight, and 30 or

above indicates obesity (WHO, 1995). Population increases in BMI above 25 or 30 are

therefore generally considered markers of deteriorating health (Di Angelantonio et al.,

2016).

   There are several important problems with this approach. First, these BMI thresholds



                                           2
are somewhat arbitrarily defined. Second, they do not reflect genotypic differences in

body fat distribution (WHO, 2000; Mehta et al., 2013; Nakagami et al., 2003; Bodicoat

et al., 2014). Third, and importantly, health technology is changing in response to

population anthropometrics in ways that promote longevity among those considered

overweight or obese. Several studies now find that BMI in the overweight range is not

associated with increased mortality risk (Flegal et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2019; Gu et al.,

2006), particularly among the elderly (Winter et al., 2014; Berraho et al., 2010).

   A superior approach to relying on fixed thresholds across countries and over time is

to use iso-mortality curves - pioneered by Hans Waaler (Waaler, 1984) and promoted

by Nobel laureate Robert Fogel (Fogel, 1994; Fogel and Costa, 1997) - as a tool for

understanding the changing population health consequences of anthropometric status.

Estimated using detailed data on both anthropometric status and mortality risk, iso-

mortality curves - or Waaler surfaces - relate mortality to height and weight. They

do not impose bright-line thresholds on the joint distribution of height and weight.

Moreover, they can be estimated separately for different populations at different points in

time, and changes in their shapes and locations can generally be interpreted as reflecting

technological progress and access to health technologies, moderating the relationship

between anthropometric status and longevity.

   In this paper, we estimate new iso-mortality Waaler surfaces for three different con-

temporary environments: the United States (a high-income country), Mexico (a middle-

income country), and Indonesia (a lower-income country) using detailed individual-level

longitudinal data. These countries represent different technological regimes, broadly

defined, for longevity at different heights and weights - and varying access to health

technology. They also provide an update to Fogel's (1994) estimates (obtained using a



                                             3
sample of 50-64 year-old Norwegians observed between 1963 and 1975) with data re-

flecting technological progress in recent decades that has disproportionately focused on

obesity-related chronic diseases (Bhattacharya and Packalen, 2011). The data require-

ments for this approach are stringent; few representative surveys measure individual

anthropometric characteristics and follow the same individuals over time, recording

subsequent deaths. We analyze data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in

the U.S., the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) in Mexico, and the Indonesian

Family Life Survey (IFLS) in Indonesia. We standardize the construction of our lon-

gitudinal, individual-level samples across these surveys over the period 2002 to 2016,

focusing on adult populations at ages in which chronic diseases commonly emerge (ages

50-79). Bodyweight and height are objectively measured in the IFLS, while in the HRS

and MHAS they are self-reported 1 .

    Within these Waaler surfaces, a minimum risk curve traces the bodyweight that

minimizes mortality risk at each height, with mortality risk increasing at bodyweights

both to the left and right of the curve. Supplement Figure B1 first shows how average

combinations of weight and height at middle and older ages (50-79) have changed in

recent decades (from 1995 to 2014) relative to the original minimum risk curve estimated

by Waaler (1984) and Fogel (1994). In the United States, average height has remained

constant over time, while average bodyweight has increased. Thus, the U.S. was already

to the right of Fogel's minimum risk curve in 1995, rising to a point further above it

in 2014. By contrast, Mexico's and Indonesia's height and bodyweight have both risen

steadily over the same period, moving Mexico above Fogel's minimum risk curve and

Indonesia towards it. However, these national averages mask underlying heterogeneity
    1The objective measurement of height and weight in HRS started in 2006 for a subsample of the
individuals. To maintain comparability across waves we use self-reported measures throughout the entire
analysis period.

in their distribution, which we consider below.

   Figure 1 presents age-adjusted Waaler surfaces for the United States, Mexico, and

Indonesia, estimated separately for men and women in each country using our samples

of contemporary data. The colored curves represent level sets of mortality risk, spaced

in equal increments/decrements of absolute risk. Each panel also shows a corresponding

minimum risk curve. Reflecting both technological differences and varying access to

health technology, the location and shape of these Waaler surfaces and minimum risk

curves differ considerably across countries (and between women and men). Arguably

the most striking difference is between the Indonesian Waaler surfaces and those for the

U.S. and Mexico. The Indonesian minimum risk curve reflects an absolute mortality risk

above those for the U.S. and Mexico - and at all heights, the mortality risk for Indonesian

men and women is minimized at substantially lower bodyweights.

   Figure 2 shows the minimum risk curves corresponding to the Waaler surfaces in

Figure 1 together with Fogel's original minimum risk curve. For a given height, the

weight that minimizes mortality risk is lowest in Indonesia for both men and women.

The corresponding values are substantially higher in Mexico and higher yet in the

U.S. For example, for a 1.83 meter (approximately 6 feet) tall male, the minimum

mortality weights are 64 kg (in Indonesia), 89 kg (in Mexico), and 96 kg (in the U.S.),

corresponding to BMIs of 19.1, 26.6, and 28.7, respectively. These differences across

countries are less pronounced for women - for example, for a 1.73 meter (approximately

5 feet 7 inch) tall female, the minimum mortality weights are 69 kg, 76 kg, and 80 kg,

with corresponding BMIs of 23.1, 25.4, and 26.7, respectively. Notably, relative to a

BMI of 25 (the WHO threshold for overweight), these minimum risk bodyweights are

consistently lower in Indonesia and considerably higher in Mexico and the U.S.



                                            5
    We next analyze the distribution of anthropometric status in these three populations

with respect to our estimates of their minimum risk curves. Figure 3 shows a heat

map of the joint distributions of height and weight, separately for men and women,

in each country using 5x5 unit cells (in cm of height and kg of weight) together with

the corresponding minimum risk curves. The figure also shows the implied number of

averted deaths over a 4-year horizon if all individuals in each population were to move

to her/his minimum risk bodyweight (holding height constant). These averted deaths,

weighted to obtain implied national totals, are shown to the left of the minimum risk

curve for those gaining weight and to the curve's right for those losing weight.

    For each country, we then compute ratios of the share of each national population

above mortality-minimizing bodyweight to the share of each national population con-

sidered overweight by contemporary (WHO) standards (BMI>25). If contemporary

standards defining unhealthily high bodyweights matched bodyweights above mortality-

minimizing levels, these ratios would be 100% for each country. Instead, we find them

to be 52.6% in the United States, 56.8% in Mexico, and 151.4% in Indonesia. 2 Strik-

ingly, these ratios suggest that technological progress promoting longevity at higher

bodyweights - and access to health technology - vary so profoundly across countries

that, relative to current international standards, unhealthily high adult bodyweight is

underestimated in Indonesia (a country with a relatively low overweight/obesity rate: 17

and 4 percent) and overestimated in the U.S. and Mexico (countries with relatively high

overweight/obesity rates: 41 percent/29 percent and 43 percent/21 percent, respectively).

    Our study has at least four limitations. First, our estimates rely on the correlation
    2The shares are computed as ratios of the total number of individuals (men and women aged 50-79)
whose weight is greater than the optimum for their height as indicated by our Waaler minimum mortality
curve (33,608,854 individuals for the U.S., 7,356,378 for Mexico and 12,361,973 for Indonesia) over the
total number of individuals who are overweight or obese (63,850,227 for the U.S., 12,951,129 for Mexico
and 8,186,011 for Indonesia).

between anthropometric status and mortality risk over the subsequent four years. Chronic

diseases at the end of life are often associated with weight loss, which could contribute

to a positive correlation between low bodyweight and mortality (Banack and Stokes,

2017; Kalantar-Zadeh et al., 2014). However, our use of a long lag between measured

anthropometric status and mortality mitigates this limitation to some extent (because

most weight loss approaching death occurs during the year that a patient dies). Second,

our approach requires imputation of bodyweight for some individuals when there are

long intervals between data collection. The longitudinal datasets that we use to track

obesity ­ the Health and Retirement Study and its sister studies around the world ­

are the gold standard for individual-level panel data tracking health. In Indonesia and

Mexico, however, there are longer intervals between waves than in the U.S., where data is

collected every two years. To address this issue, we use standard interpolation methods

to impute information between waves. Without imputation, our results are qualitatively

similar, but noisier. Third, we attribute the observed differences in minimum risk curves

across countries and over time to technological differences in detection and treatment

along with differences in access to medical care. Our interpretation is consistent with

the fact that treatment for diseases associated with obesity - such as heart disease -

have improved over time (Ritchey et al., 2020). It is also consistent with the economics

literature, which emphasizes technological change as a primary cause of bodyweight

change over time (Lakdawalla et al., 2005; Lakdawalla and Philipson, 2009). However,

there may be other explanations which we do not consider that contribute to our findings.

Finally, data limitations prevent us from systematically examining important dimensions

of morbidity correlated with anthropometric status.

   Health-specific technological change over time has been dramatic. It has focused



                                           7
particularly on the emerging population health needs of wealthy countries over the

past half-century, fundamentally transforming the relationship between bodyweight and

longevity (Bhattacharya and Packalen, 2011). Moreover, access to these technologies

varies greatly across higher- and lower-income countries, leading to substantial cross-

country differences in the bodyweights that maximize health (or minimize mortality

risk). Current bodyweight classification standards such as "overweight" (BMI 25-

30) and "obese" (BMI 30+) do not reflect the moderating role of this technological

progress or differences in access to health technology. Incorporating the changing

role of technology is critical for understanding the population health implications of

evolving anthropometric status around the world. Higher bodyweights, even conditional

on height, do not unambiguously indicate a decline in population health status.

A     Data

A.1    Data sources

The data sources in the analyses are the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) for

the United States, the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) for Mexico, and

the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) for Indonesia. We use harmonized ver-

sions of the HRS and MHAS available through the Gateway to Global Aging platform

(https://g2aging.org/). The HRS and MHAS data are longitudinal surveys repre-

sentative of national populations aged 50 years and older in each survey year. Both also

include respondents' spouses or partners (regardless of age). The IFLS is a longitudinal

household survey conducted less frequently and including a larger age range (individuals

aged 26 years and older. It is not nationally-representative, but instead is representative

of 13 major Indonesian provinces, accounting for 83% of the total Indonesian popula-

tion. Beginning in 2007-08, the IFLS was redesigned to collect information on health

and retirement behavior comparable to the HRS family of surveys.

    All three longitudinal surveys include individual-level information on height, weight,

and mortality as well as a wide-range of socio-economic and demographic characteris-

tics. Bodyweight and height are objectively measured in the IFLS, while in the HRS

and MHAS they are self-reported. The objective measurement of height and weight

in HRS started in 2006 for a subsample of the individuals. To maintain comparability

across waves we use self-reported measures throughout the entire analysis period. In

our analyses, we focus on anthropometric measures, demographic characteristics, and



                                            17
deaths (including dates of death). Table A1 summarizes the main features of the three

data sources.

A.2      Data selection and sample construction

Our final samples are restricted to individuals ages 50-79 years. The HRS and MHAS

do not sample individuals younger than 50, and there are few individuals in any of our

data sources ages 80 years and above. We note that the age range of our samples differs

from Fogel (1994), who focuses on individuals ages 50 to 64 years using data collected

by Waaler (1984). Waaler (1984) combined information on height and weight obtained


                                                        18
from the State Mass Miniature X-ray Examination carried out between 1963 and 1975

in Norway with the death register data for years 1963-1979 from the Norweigan Central

Bureau of Statistics.

   We pool all available waves of each survey conducted between 2000 and 2016

(separately by country and gender - yielding 6 subsamples). The timing of HRS,

MHAS, and IFLS waves differ, as Table A1 shows. HRS waves are conducted every

other year, so we use a total of 9 waves between 2000/01 and 2016/17. MHAS waves are

conducted less regularly, with a substantial interval between the second and third wave

in particular, yielding 4 waves total. Three IFLS waves were conducted between 2000

and 2016.

   We exploit the longitudinal nature of each survey to track individual respondents

over time. Given that different surveys were fielded at different times (and with different

intervals), we apply a "rectangularization" procedure to each. Specifically, for years in

which no data was collected, we interpolate missing information on weight and height at

the individual level using nearest neighbor imputation until each individual either dies or

exits from the survey. Our samples are necessarily unbalanced because new 50-year-olds

enter the survey and dying/exiting individuals leave the survey over time.

   Unlike Waaler (1984) and Fogel (1994), our longitudinal rectangularized data allow

us to control for the time lag between measurement of height/weight and death. This

is important because in addition to chronological age, time to death is also associated

with the onset and subsequent rate of weight loss (Alley et al., 2010). Several studies

suggest that pre-existing occult disease may be produce higher mortality at lower levels

of body mass index (BMI) (Allison et al., 1999). We therefore exclude height and weight

measurements within 4 years of the time that we analyze death/survival, producing a



                                            19
consistent temporal separation between anthropometric measurement and the time we

observe death (or survival) in all of our samples.

     Finally, to remove undue influence of outliers (which may in part also reflect mea-

surement error), we trim the bottom and top percentile of the BMI distribution from

each of our six sub-samples. In the MHAS and IFLS data, we also top-code the top and

bottom percentile of the weight and height distributions.

     Descriptive statistics for each sample are presented in table A2.

subsequent waves, the missing information on weight and height at the individual level is interpolated with the nearest neighbourhood
imputation. Individuals are followed until death or attrition from the sample. Weight and height data from the four years prior to when
survival or death is observed are excluded (to account, in part, for weight loss approaching the time of death). The top and bottom
percentile of the BMI distribution are trimmed from the MHAS and IFLS samples because the top and bottom percentiles of height
and weight are top-/bottom-coded. The statistics in the first panel refer to raw data relative to the waves carried out, while the second

B.1    Evolution of body weight over time

Figure B1 relates the minimum risk curve derived by Fogel (1994) based on Waaler

(1984) sample of Norweigen males, to average heights and weights over time for males

ages 50 - 79 years in the HRS, MHAS and IFLS. In the United States, average stature

(or height) has generally remained constant over time, while average bodyweight has

increased - already to the right of Fogel's minimum risk curve in 1995, and systematically

moving further above it by 2014. In Mexico and Indonesia, average stature has steadily

risen over time, and average bodyweight has as well - in Mexico, starting near the

minimum risk curve and rising above it over time, and in Indonesia, moving towards it

(but still remaining below it as of 2014).

C     Methods

C.1    Estimation

Following Fogel (1994), we estimate iso-mortality curves as a function of weight and

height. However, unlike Fogel (1994), we estimate these relationships using individual-

level data, separately for men and women, controlling for age and treating each year

as an independent cross-section. Specifically, for each country and gender sub-sample,

we estimate probit models for mortality as a function of height and weight using the

following general specification:




 Deathit =  + 1 Hit -4 + 2 Hit
                            2
                               -4 + 1Wit -4 + 2Wit -4 + Wit -4  Hit -4 +  Ag eit +
                                                2
                                                                                          it   (1)


    Deathit is the death of individual i in period t , Hit -4 and Wit -4 are height in meters

and weight in kilograms measured four years prior to period t (we include squared terms

of each and an interaction between them as well), Ag eit is age in years, and        it    is an

idiosyncratic error term clustered at the individual level. The estimates are computed us-

ing sampling weights. Table C1 presents probit marginal effects of coefficient estimates

in the six models respectively.

    We use coefficient estimates for each country and gender to predict individual mor-

tality risk on a smooth grid of height/weight combination in intervals of whole cen-

timeters/ kilograms holding age constant at 60. We use these predictions to plot the

three-dimensional surfaces shown in Figure 1 in the body of the text, with colors cor-

responding to different level-sets of mortality risk. Additionally, we also use these

predictions to generate minimum risk lines. These minimum risk lines are defined by

 N otes : The data come from Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in the U.S., the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) in
Mexico, and the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) in Indonesia, waves between 2002 and 2016. Each dataset is rectangularized
by filling in the data between two subsequent waves, the missing information on individual weight and height is interpolated with
nearest neighbourhood imputation. Individuals are followed until death or attrition from the sample. Weight and height data from
the four years prior to when survival or death is observed are excluded (to account, in part, for weight loss approaching the time of
death). The top and bottom percentile of the BMI distribution are trimmed from the MHAS and IFLS samples because the top and
bottom percentiles of height and weight are top-/bottom-coded. The estimates are based on a probit response surface, with weights
and heights products of maximum 2nd order for each dataset and gender separately. The controls include age in years. Standard errors
are clustered at the individual level. The estimates are computed using sampling weights.

the locus of (height, weight) pairs that minimize mortality risk at each height; in practice,

we use 5-centimeter intervals of height to construct the minimum risk curve shown in

Figure 2.

   We compute standard errors of the minimum probability estimates along each min-

imum risk line using block bootstrap procedure with 1,000 replications. Minimum

probabilities with the standard errors are presented in Figure C1.


C.2    Implied mortality reduction calculations

Given each country by gender minimum mortality risk line, we compute the implied

mortality reduction implied by our estimates (or curves) if all individuals were to move

to her/his mortality-minimizing weight (holding height constant). Specifically, we use

our probit estimation framework to generate predictions at observed weights and at risk-

minimizing weights (given height), taking the difference between the two. We show

these numerical results separately for individuals in each 5-centimeter height interval -

and separately and among those below and above the minimum risk curve - in Figure 3.

   The figure's color grid represents two-dimensional histograms of the joint distribution

of height and weight in each sample, grouping sample density into bins of 5-centimeter

height by 5-kilogram weight intervals. The color gradient ranges from light blue to

magenta, reflecting lowest to highest relative frequencies, respectively, in the most

recent survey year. We use sampling weights in these calculations to recover the implied

number of individuals in each country-age-gender population (with population totals of

44 million men and 48 million women ages 50-79 in the US in 2016; 9.5 million men

and 9.9 million women in Mexico ages 50-79 in 2014; and 19.6 million men and 20.1

million in Indonesia in 2014.

N otes : The data come from Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in the U.S., the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) in
Mexico, and the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) in Indonesia, waves between 2002 and 2016. Each dataset is rectangularized
by filling in the data between two subsequent waves, the missing information on individual weight and height is interpolated with
nearest neighbourhood imputation. Individuals are followed until death or attrition from the sample. Weight and height data from
the four years prior to when survival or death is observed are excluded (to account, in part, for weight loss approaching the time of
death). The top and bottom percentile of the BMI distribution are trimmed from the MHAS and IFLS samples because the top and
bottom percentiles of height and weight are top-/bottom-coded. Each panel pictures minimum probabilities defined by the locus of
(height, weight) pairs that minimize mortality risk and their standard errors computed using block bootstrap procedure with 1,000
replications, using estimates of probit response surfaces together with sampling weights, described in Supplement C.
