                 Expectations and New Information



                              ABSTRACT


     This paper analyzes the relationship between forward exchange rates,

future spot rates and new information. A stochastic model of exchange

rate determination is used to formally show how unanticipated changes in

the exchange rate determinants (or "news") affect the spot rate. The

empirical analysis indicates that "new information" plays an important

role in explaining the market forecasting error, or difference between

the spot rate and the forward rate, determined in the previous period.

1. Introduction

   Since a floating exchange rate system was adopted by the major industrial

countries in 1973, there has been an increased interest in studying the pro-

cess of exchange rate determination. In particular, most of the work on the

determination of floating exchange rates has been focused on the explanation

of the large fluctuations that these rates have displayed in the recent period,

and on the poor performance of forward rates as predictors of future spot

rates.-' The analysis of the extent and causes of the volatility of ex-

change rates under a floating system, and of the degree of efficiency of

foreign exchange markets, is important in order to assess the desirability

of government intervention in managing, or even pegging, exchange

   Recently, it has been suggested (i.e., Dornbusch, 1978, 1980; Frenkel,

1981a; Frenkel and Mussa, 1980; Mussa, 1982) that the behavior of exchange

rates is affected in an important way by new information that is made avail-

able to economic agents in every period. The notion that new information

affects exchange rate behavior is directly derived from the fact that exchange

rates are the relative price of two assets, and as such, are determined by

expectations about future events. This paper investigates the role of new

information in the determination of exchange rates behavior. In particular,

it analyzes the relationship between forward rates, future spot rates, ex-

change rate market efficiency, and new information. The empirical evidence

presented in this paper indicates that new information partially accounts

for the poor performance of forward rates as predictors of future spot rates.

However, the results also suggest that there are still elements, in addition
                                                  3/
to Unews ,   that   affect exchange rates behavior.—

      The plan of the paper is as follows: Section 2 analyzes the role of new

information in exchange rate behavior using a simple stochastic model of ex-

change rate determination. Section 3 presents empirical results regarding

market efficiency and new information for the pound/dollar, DM/dollar,

French franc/dollar and lira/dollar rates. Section 4 contains some con-

cluding remarks.


2. Market Efficiency, New Information and the Exchange Rate

     An important implication of the asset view of exchange rate determination ——

as developed by Dornbush (1976), Frenkel (1976), and Mussa (1976), among others ——

is   that the exchange rate market, as any other asset market, is efficient.'

A market is "efficient" when prices reflect all available information, in-

cluding the economic model relevant for describing the determination of

their equilibrium values. A direct implication of efficiency is that the

expectations people have about all the future values of the underlying de-

terminants of the exchange rate are fully reflected in the forward rate, and

that the spot rate reflects all the information available at the time it is

set. This means that new information that is made available in subsequent

periods will result in corrections of the market forecasts about the future

spot rate. The new information made available in a certain period will also

have an effect on the difference between the spot rate, as set in that period,

and the forecast the market made about it in the previous period, when the

information was not available.

     It has recently been suggested that the divergence between the expected spot

rate for period t+1 (as set in t) and the actual spot rate in t+l, or market

forecasting error, can be partially explained by the fact that the spot rate

in t+l reflects new information that was not available in t. According to
                                           —3—


 this view, in every period economic agents will use the "news" to revise

 their forecast about the future spot rate.-'

     In this section, the relationship between forward rates, future spot

rates, and new information is formally derived from a simple stochastic model

of exchange rate determination.' The model is presented in equations (1)

through (8):



                      f_s                                                           (1)


          E(s+1) =                                                                  (2)

          r p + w; r =           p   + w                                            (5)

           d
          m_P=ay_bi;
                                      d*  **
                                           * **
                                     m_p=ay_bi                                      (6)


          m =   m1    +   X   + v + n—ni; tn =      mi +   A + v +        —


               = y0 + gt + u y = y +gt+ u                                           (8)



where s is the natural logarithm of the spot rate;            is the log of the forward

rate; i and      are the nominal interest rates on one period bonds denominated

in domestic and foreign currency respectively; Pt and p are the log of domestic

and foreign price levels; r and r are domestic and foreign interest rates,

which are assumed to be equal to a constant term (p and p )       plus   a random ele-

ment (w and w); m andm are the log of nominal quantities of money at home

and abroad; and y and y are the log of domestic and foreign real output re—
                                    *      *       *          *
spectively. On the other hand, w, w, v, v, n, n, u and u are independent,
serially uncorrelated random shocks, with zero mean and constant variances.
                                     —4—


    Equation (1) is the interest arbitrage condition, and indicates that asset

holders will be indifferent between holding bonds denominated in domestic or

foreign currency as long as the interest rate differential is equal to the

expected rate of appreciation.-7' Equation (2) introduces the simplifying

assumption of risk—neutral agents, which is made for convenience. If, al-

ternatively, risk-averse agents are assumed, equation (2) could be modified

by adding a risk premium term to       Equation (3) is a deviation from PPP

equation. This expression is general enough to allow for a number of as-

sumptions with respect to the degree to which PPP holds. If, for example,

it is assumed that PPP holds permanently (in level terms), d will be equal

to zero.-' Equation (4) is the traditional Fisher equation for the domestic

and foreign interest rates respectively.-2' Equation (5), on the other hand,

indicates that in each country the real interest rate is equal to a constant

element (p and p*) plus a serially uncorrelated random term (w and w).

Equation (6) depicts the demand for money equations in each cQUn1rT. This

forniulation of the demand for money does not include random shocks beyond

those induced by interest rates and real incomes. This, however, is of no

consequence for the final results. Equation (7) represents the money supply

processes. According to this equation, in every moment in time the rate of

growth of money will diverge from its long—run rate of growth (A) both by a

permanent shock (vs) and a temporary shock (n). Finally, equation (8) de-

picts the process of real income. In order to simplify the exposition, it

has been assumed that in each country real income evolves according to a

random walk with trend, where the random element (un) is independently dis-

tributed from all other shocks in the model)'

    The solutions in this model for s and f1(Ei(s)) can be used to find

an expression for the market forecasting error (s-.-f1) that is explicitly

related to unanticipated changes in exchange rates determinants, or "news".
                                                     —5—


In order to simplify the exposition, it is assumed that there are random

deviations from PPP, so that equation (3) can be written as s—p+p =                   x,
where x can be shown to be a serially uncorrelated random element. / _p_/

Assuming that the information set in period t               includes   the model, and the

past and current values of all relevant variables, and using the well—known,

undetermined coefficients technique to solve difference equations, the

following expression for the spot rate is obtained:--'

                                                                              *
             *          *           a                                             *

s   =
        (a00)     + (m_m)
                                         *
                                            u Ci-- w
                                             —       1     —   b
                                                                       +     a
                                                                            (*) u
                       1    *           b        *
                  +
                      (*) w + (*)
where a =
                 [b(p—ag)—ay0+bX]
                                        and c = [b*(p*_a*g*)_a*y        +   bA]
This expression is similar to those obtained by most stochastic asset—view

models of exchange rate determination (i.e., Barro (1978), Driskill (1981),

Saidi (1980)). It indicates that the spot rate will respond with a unitary

coefficient to increases in the stocks of money differentials, and will be

affected by the different stochastic shocks that enter the model. In par-

ticular, it indicates that unexpected real shocks on income at home (un) will

drive the exchange rate down, while the opposite will be true when u rises.

On the other hand, an unexpected shock on the domestic real interest rate will

generate an appreciation on the exchange rate. Finally, equation (9) indi-

cates that a temporary unexpected monetary shock at home will provoke a move-

ment of the exchange rate in the opposite direction. The reason for this is

that since temporary shocks do not affect the future level of the quantity of

money (m+i), people expect E(mt+i) to decline in relation to m, and thus

they expect an appreciation of domestic currency.

        From equation (9), and using the property of serially uncorrelated random

shocks, the following expression for the forward rate for t+l, as determined
                                              —6—


in t, is found:

                             *                               *        *         *
      =
          E(st1)   =   (a—ct) + m+i —   v1    —            — m+i   + v1 +ni                 (10)


      From (9) and (10) it is possible to find an expression that relates the

forward rate to the future spot rate. Writing (9) for period t+l and sub-

tracting (10):


5t+1 =       + [v+1 +

                                        *
                                              w+
                                                  a*
                                                       —
                                                           ii
                                                            *
                                                             a              *
                                                                          - V1
             —
                 (i:*)+1
                   1
                         +        1
                                        w1   + (r-*)       u1]                              (11)


According to equation (11), the future spot rate (s+i) will differ from

the forward rate determined in the current period by the term in square

brackets. This expression summarizes the effect of "news" about unantici-

pated (as of t) changes in money, real income and real interest rates on

the exchange rates. In particular, equation (11) indicates that "news"

can help explain the market forecasting error, or divergence between s1

and         According to (11), "news" about a permanent increase in the domestic

quantity of money (v+i) will have a positive effect (over and above the

market forecast) on the spot rate in period t+l. News about a temporary

increase of the quantity of money at home                       will also have a positive

effect on the exchange rate over and above the rate forecast in the previous

period. However, this effect will be less than proportional, since agents

know, under the assumption of full current information, the temporary nature

of this shock. Equation (11) also indicates that "news" about unexpected

changes in the real interest rate will have a negative effect on the fore-

casting error. The reason for this is that unexpected changes in the real

rate have negative effects on the spot exchange rate while, due to the as—
                                       —7—


surnptions of the present model, they do not affect the expected exchange

rate for t+l as set in t. Finally, according to equation (11) "news"

about unexpected increases in real income will have negative effects on the

forecasting error. The opposite effects are true with respect to "news't

regarding the behavior of foreign money, real income and real interest

rate.

      Equation (11) also indicates that the market forecasting errors across

different exchange rates will be correlated. Since all of these rates are

expressed in terms of a common currency (the US dollar for example), equation

(11) for different exchange rates will have a common element:

  *          1   *        1   *      a       *
        —
            l+b't+l   + (i4*)wt+l + (r*)ut+i].

This relationship between the "newst' component of different rates can be in-

corporated into the empirical analysis of exchange market efficiency.

      There are at least three ways to empirically test (11):   (1) We can

directly incorporate unexpected changes of exchange rate determinants to

the right hand side of the traditional market efficiency equation. This has

been done by Frenkel (198la), who used the residuals from a forecasting equation

for nominal interest rates differentials as an additional independent variable

in market efficiency equations. Dornbusch (1980), on the other hand, has

included unexpected changes in the current account and real output —— computed

as deviations from OECD forecasts —— as a measure of "news" in his regression

analysis. (2) A second way to test (11) is to use non—linear, full—information

methods, testing simultaneously for market efficiency and rational expecta-

tions. This has recently been done by Hartley (1981) in the context of the
                                         —8—



simple monetary model.-' (3) Alternatively, equation (11) can be tested

using seemingly unrelated regressions (SURE) methods that recognize that the

unexpected changes of exchange rate determinants that appear on the right

hand side of (11) correspond to the error terms in forecasting equations

for these determinants)-" The next section of this paper presents results

obtained from using the seemingly unrelated regressions methods for the

pound/dollar, DM/dollar, French franc/dollar and Italian lira/dollar rates.


3.   Empirical Results

     In this section empirical results from the analysis of market efficiency

and "news" for the pound/dollar, French franc/dollar, DM/dollar and Italian

lira/dollar rates are presented. In most empirical work on efficiency of the

exchange market, the following equation has been fitted:-7'


                = a   + bf +                                                   (12)



where, under the assumption that the forward rate determined in t is an un-

biased predictor of s1, a0, b1.O and             is a white noise process. The

results obtained, however, have been only partially favorable to the market

efficiency hypothesis. In general, the b's have been estimated in imprecise

ways, and the market efficiency hypothesis has been rejected for some rates

and accepted for others.

     According to the model presented in Section 2, however, the market f ore—

casting error term         in equation (12) will have a specific form, which can

be exploited in tests of market efficiency. Specifically, equation (11) in-

dicated that          can be expressed as a linear function of unanticipated

changes of domestic and foreign money, domestic and foreign real income, and
                                                  —9—


of unanticipated changes in domestic and foreign real interest rates. As-

suming, for simplicity, that all unanticipated changes in the quantity of money

can be summarized in                from (12) the market forecasting error term can be
          18/
written as:—



     = cxv+i       +           +           +
                                                **         **   +
                                                                     **
                       a1u+1       a2w+1                + a1u       ct2w+1                     (13)



where, as before, v41 represents unanticipated changes in the quantity of

money, u1 reflects unanticipated changes in real income and w41 represents

unticipated changes in the real interest rates. As usual, an asterisk refers

to the respective variables for the foreign country. As shown in Section 2,

the a's (and a*Ts) will depend on the structural coefficients of the model.
                                                                             *       *
According to equation (11), it would be expected that a,                         and a2 should be

positive, while a*, a1 and a2 should be negative.

    Using (13), the market efficiency equation can be rewritten in the fol-

lowing way:


     = a +
              bf   + [av÷1 + a1u+1 +
                                                a2w41 + ct*v, + a1u+1 + c4w*÷l]                (14)


                       *              *                   *
    Since                                      w1 and w1 are forecasting error terms
            v1,
from the monies, real income and real interest rates equations, it follows

that the estimation of (14), taking into account the cross—error covariance

between this equation and the forecasting equations, would yield more eff 1—

cient results from an econometric point of view. In particular, it would be

expected that using Zeliner's seemingly unrelated regressions (SURE) method

    Under the assumption made in Section 2 of uncorrelated random shocks,

the covariance matrix of the system given by the market efficiency equation

(14) and the forecasting equations for money, real income and real interest

rates at home and abroad will be of the following form:-"

and a is the covariance between errors x and y. As may be seen, E will only

have non—zero elements in the first row, the first column and the principal

diagonal.

    The estimation of (14) using SLTRE should improve the results obtained when

OLS are used. In particular, if "news" is the main reason why forward rate

and futufe spot rates differ, the use of SURE, that explicitly takes "news"

into account, should result in a strong acceptance (non—rejection) of the

efficiency hypothesis. Alternatively, if the improvement in the market ef-

ficiency results is not significant once "news" is taken into account, it

will be an indication that elements besides new information play an important

role in the process of exchange rate determination.

    Before the market efficiency tests using the SURE procedure can be im-

plemented, it is necessary to determine the specific form of the forecasting

equations for the domestic and foreign quantities of money, real income and

real interest rates. In order to simplify the analysis, it was assumed that

the forecasting equations for these variables can be represented by vector

autoregressive processes that include own lagged values and lagged values of

all other variables for that country. In all these processes, 6—month lags

were used for every variable. Then the residuals from these equations were
                                         —11—


checked to make sure that they were white noise. For the case of real in-

terest rates, I used the ex—post rate defined as the annualized Euromarket

one—month nominal rate minus the corresponding inflation rate. The sources

of the data used are given in the appendix.

    In Table 1 the exchange rate market efficiency tests for the pound/dollar,

franc/dollar, DM/dollar and lira/dollar, using monthly data and OLS, are

presented. In addition to equation (12), I report the results obtained from

the OLS estimates of:


    s1 =   a + b     + c        + u41                                           (16)



The rationale for fitting this equation is that if the exchange rate market

is efficient and t   contains   all the available information for forecasting

s1, the inclusion of            should not add to the explanation of      The

empirical analysis of the exchange rate market efficiency was started in

July of 1973 in order to avoid the effects of the "turbulent" first half of

1973 (see Frenkel and Levich, 1977).

    As may be seen from Table 1, when OLS is used the market efficiency

hypothesis is not very successful. While it is not rejected for the pound!

dollar and DM/dollar rates, it is rejected for the franc/dollar and lira/dollar

rates. For the pound/dollar and DM/dollar rates both the individual hypotheses

a=O and b=lO and the joint hypothesis a0 and bl.O cannot be rejected at the

5% level. On the other hand, for the franc/dollar and lira/dollar rates, when

OLS are used, both the individual and joint hypotheses of efficiency are re-

jected.     For all the cases the D.W. statistic indicates the absence of

first order autocorrelation, and the analysis of the autocorrelation functions

of the residuals (up to 24 lags) show no autocorrelation of higher order.

Finally, the OLS estimation supports the hypothesis that         adds no ex—
                                      —12—


planation to s+1 once     has been included, since for all cases its coeffi-

cient is not significant. In Table 2 the results from the estimation of

equation (14) using SURE, which incorporates the cross—error structure between

the market efficiency equation and the exchange rate determinant forecasting

equations, are reported. The case of the lira/dollar rate is of special in-

terest, since, in opposition to the OLS estimates, the hypotheses aO and

b1.O can no longer be rejected. This means that when SURE is used it is not

possible to reject the hypothesis that the market for the lira/dollar rate

has been efficient. For the case of the pound/dollar and DM/dollar rates the

previous result that does not reject efficiency is confirmed, while for the

franc/dollar rate the SURE results reject, as in the OLS case, the hypothesis

of market efficiency.

    In Table 3 the estimated values of the a's parameters of the "news."

component of the exchange rate forecasting error are presented. These

parameters are estimated by dividing the corresponding cross—error covariance

by the estimated variance of the forecasting error of the relevant exogenous

variable. As may be seen, however, only in eight out of twenty—four cases,

the a's have the expected signs.

    In Table 4 the results obtained when (12) was estimated, taking into

account the cross—error structure between the rates for the different cur-

rencies, are presented. From these results, it is clear that the incorporation

of this information increases the statistical efficiency of the tests. In

.this case the hypothesis that a0 and b1.O cannot be rejected for any of the

rates. However, the point estimates of the coefficients are still well below

the hypothesized value of one.

    Equation (14) was also estimated incorporating unanticipated changes in

monies, real incomes and real interest rates as additional right hand side

variables.     The results obtained, not reported here due space considera-

tions, tend to confirm the results reported in Table 2: While in the liraf

dollar rate the efficiency hypothesis cannot be rejected any more, the coeffi-

cient of unanticipated changes is frequently of the wrong sign and insigni—

    The results reported in this section indicate that, as the asset—view

of exchange rate determination suggests, new information about exchange rate

determinants play an important role in explaining exchange rate behavior.

The empirical analysis reported in this paper has been centered on incor-

porating the role of new information in tests of exchange rate market ef-

ficiency. The results were particularly successful for the lira/dollar

rate, and when the cross—error structure across rates (Table 4) was taken

into account. However, the fact that, even when "news" was taken into ac-

count, efficiency was still rejected for the franc/dollar rate, and that the

ci's from the SURE model were frequently of the wrong sign, indicate that

"news" about money, income and real interest rates probably do not account for the

whole story. In particular, it is probable that, as Hansen and Hodrick

(1980, 1981) have recently suggested, there is a non—constant risk premium

that, in addition to news, affects exchange rate behavior,


4. Concluding Remarks

    In this paper a model of the determination of the exchange rate in the

short run, under a floating system, was derived. The model assumes rational

economic agents, and stresses the role of expectations in the determination of the

exchange rate. The model also stresses the role of new information on the ex—
                                      —14—

planation of exchange rate movements. In particular, it suggests. that the

market forecasting error (the difference between the actual spot rate and

the expected future spot rate determined in the previous period) can be ex-

plained by unanticipated changes in exchange rate determinants, This

proposition of the model was tested using Zellner's seemingly unrelated

regressions procedure in tests of exchange market efficiency, The results

obtained indicate that once the role of "news" is allowed into the estimation

of exchange rate equations, the efficiency of these tests improves. When

efficiency tests were performed and the role of "news" was incorporated,

it was not possible to reject the efficiency hypothesis for 3   out of 4 rates.

In addition, when the efficiency equation was estimated incorporating the

cross-error structure for different rates, the null hypothesis that the ex-

change market is efficient could not be rejected for any of the rates con-

sidered in this study. In general, these results tend to confirm previous

findings (Dornbusch, 1980; Frenkel, 198la) that indicate the new informatiQn

plays an important role in the explanation of observed market forecasting

errors. However, the fact that when the role of "news" is incorporated ef-

ficiency is still rejected for one rate (dollar/franc) suggests that there

are still elements, besides "news", that affect exchange rate behavior. A

likely candidate for this role is a variable risk premium.

                                            FOOTNOTES
     *
         I   would like to thank John Bilson, Michael Darby, Jacob Frenkel and Arnold

  Harberger for helpful comments. I am also indebted to an anonymous referee

  who made many helpful suggestions. All remaining errors are my own.

 1.          See, for example, the essays collected in Frenkel and Johnson (1978),

 Frenkel (1980, 1981a), Nussa (1982), Dornbusch (1978, 1980), Frankel (1979),

 Artus and Young (1979), Frenkel and Mussa (1980), Genberg (1981) and Isard

 (1981). For a review of the forecasting properties of recent exchange rate

 models, see Neese and Rogoff (1981).

 2. On the optimal degree of exchange rate management in a stochastic setup,

 see Frenkel and Aizenman (1981). See also Fischer (1976) and Boyer (1978).

 3.          It is possible that, as suggested by Hansen and Hodrick (1980, 1981) a

non—constant risk premium term plays an important role in exchange rate be-

havior. This has also been suggested by Frenkel and Razin (1981). It is

important, however, to stress the idea that a non—constant risk premium would

play a role in addition to "news".


4. For a general description of efficiency in asset markets, see Fama (1976).

Levich (1979) and Kolhagen (1978) provide surveys on efficiency and the ex-

change rate. For empirical studies concerning the efficiency of the exchange

market, see, for example, Bilson (1981), Frenkel (1981a), Frankel (1980),

and Hansen and Hodrick (1980).

5.           See, for example, Dornbusch (1978, 1980), Frenkel (1981a), Edwards (1981),

Isard (1981), Hartley (1981), and Mussa (1982).

6. For a detailed discussion of the model, see the Appendix. See also Edwards (1981).


7. This assumes that there is perfect capital mobility and that domestic and

foreign bonds are perfect substitutes. Notice, however, that we are ab—
                                          —22—


stracting from the problem of political risk. See Aliber (1973), and Dooley

and Isard (1980). This expression also abstracts from the taxation issues

discussed in Levi (1977).


8. See Isard (1981) for a model that assumes risk averse agents.

9. The empirical evidence available suggests that during the recent floating

system, there have been large deviations from PPP in the short run. See,

for example, Dornbusch (1978, 1980), Frenkel (198la, 1981b), Isard (1981)

and Darby (1980).

10. These expressions do not consider the effects of income taxes or nominal

interest rates. For a discussion of this issue, see Darby (1975).


11. While   this   assumption greatly simplifies the exposition, it does not alter

the results. In Edwards (1981), the model is solved under more realistic

assumptions with respect to y.

12. This is only a simplifying assumption that captures the fact —— documented

by Darby (1980), Dornbusch (1978, 1980), and Frenkel (1981a, 1981b), among

others ——   that   there are short—run deviations from PPP. In Edwards (1981)

 the model is solved under the (more realistic) assumption that deviations

 from PPP follow an AR of order one. It is interesting to note that a direct

 implication of this assumption is that deviations from PPP are related to

 differentials in real interest rates across countries. This property is also

 present in the work of Frankel (1979, 1981) and Isard (1981), who also derive

models of exchange rate determination based on real interest rates differentials.


13. Some authors ——     especially   Roll (1979) and Roll and Solnik (1979) ——

 have indicated that in order to avoid unexploited profit opportunities,

 deviations from PPP (dc) should follow a random walk. However, as Darby (1980)

 has indicated, this need not be the case if, due to unexpected stochastic

 shocks, and to the existence of adjustment costs that impede instantaneous
                                          —23—




  reallocation of capital, real interest rates are allowed to temporarily

  differ across countries. In the model presented in this paper, it is as-

  sumed that real interest rates can temporarily differ across countries only

  due to the unexpected random shocks (w and w). In fact, the expected

  real interest rates are assumed to be equated across countries (i.e., E1(r) =

  E1(r).       See Edwards (1981) for further details.


 14. If it is assumed that there is incomplete current information, the solu-

  tion of the model becomes more difficult. The reason for this is that ——

  as pointed out by Barro (1980) —— when incomplete information and an economy—

 wide capital market is assumed, these types of models do not have a closed

  form solution. For a discussion on this issue, see Edwards (1981).


15. There are several problems, however, with this procedure. First, it has

 the usual problems associated with methods that test two hypotheses jointly.

 If the hypotheses are rejected, it is not possible to know which one of them

 has failed.     Second —— as indicated by Cumby, Huiziriga and Obstfeld (1981) ——

 in   a full—system full—information estimation, the misspecification of a

 single equation will lead to inconsistent estimates of all the systemT s para-

 meters. And, third, estimations using this procedure can turn out to be

 very complicated and costly. In the case discussed in Section 3 of this paper,

 this method requires that for each rate we use full—information maximum

 likelihood with 108 cross—equation restrictions. As an example of the prob—

 lems, Hartley (1981) has indicated that, in his less complex case, the estimation

 procedure failed to converge in many cases. Preliminary attempts made by this

 author to use this method have also resulted in non—convergence.


16. One of the advantages of this method is that the misspecification of one

of the forecasting equations will not affect the consistency of the market
                                          —24—




 efficiency equation estimators.

17. See, for example, Kolhagen (1978), Levich (1979), Bilson (1981), Frankel

 (1980) and Frenkel (1981a).


18. This simplifying assumption allows us to have only one term   for   unanti-

 cipated money in the forecasting term (13).

19. As mentioned in Section 2, this is only one of the alternative ways of

 testing for the role of "news" in this model.

                                                 *        *                 *
20.   Alternatively, we can assume that                        w1 and
 are the error terms from reduced forms of forecasting equations for money,

 real income and real interest rates in the domestic and foreign country,

respectively. This approach has been followed by Hartley (1981). See, also,

Edwards (1981).
