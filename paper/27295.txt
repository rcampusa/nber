Wall Street vs. Main Street QE

JEL No. E52,E58

                                         ABSTRACT

The Federal Reserve has reacted swiftly to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has resuscitated many of
its programs from the last crisis by lending to the financial sector, which we refer to as “Wall
Street QE.” The Fed is now proposing to also lend directly to, and purchase debt directly from,
non-financial firms, which we label “Main Street QE.” Our paper develops a new framework to
compare and contrast these different policies. In a situation in which financial intermediary
balance sheets are impaired, such as the Great Recession, Main Street and Wall Street QE are
perfect substitutes and both stimulate aggregate demand. In contrast, for situations like the one
we are now facing due to COVID-19, where the production sector is facing significant cash flow
shortages, Wall Street QE becomes almost completely ineffective, whereas Main Street QE can
be highly stimulative.

1      Introduction

The Federal Reserve has acted swiftly and dramatically to support the US economy in
response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Many of its recent actions represent a resus-
citation or extension of facilities and tools it deployed to combat the Financial Crisis and
Great Recession of 2007-2009, which involved lending to, or purchasing assets from, financial
firms. The Fed has also introduced a set of new tools that have significantly expanded its
sphere of influence. In particular, in March 2020, it announced intentions to lend directly
to non-financial firms and to purchase debt issued by such firms. Direct interaction with
non-financial firms marks a significant break with central banking tradition, and is likely to
invite more controversy than the myriad tools the Fed developed to fight the last crisis.
    This paper represents a first attempt to asses the efficacy of the Fed directly lending to
non-financial firms as opposed to interacting only with financial intermediaries. We do so in
a macroeconomic model that contains the minimum number of necessary frictions to study
central bank balance sheet policies; the rest of the model is fairly standard. Financial inter-
mediaries are modeled as in Gertler and Karadi (2013) and Sims and Wu (2020b). These
intermediaries hold long-term bonds issued by non-financial firms, who are required to float
debt to finance their expenditure on new physical capital. The bond market is segmented in
that households cannot directly hold these long-term bonds. Intermediaries face an endoge-
nous leverage constraint that results in excess returns of long-term bonds over the short-term
policy rate. Central banks can purchase long-term bonds directly from intermediaries, which
eases their leverage constraint. This allows them to purchase more long-term bonds, which
in equilibrium results in higher bond prices and more aggregate demand. We refer to this
type of asset purchase by the central bank from a financial intermediary as “Wall Street
QE.”
    The main modeling contribution of this paper is to allow the central bank to directly
lend to, or more precisely purchase bonds from, non-financial firms. We refer to such direct
purchases/lending as “Main Street QE.” Without additional constraints relative to those de-

                                              1
scribed in the paragraph above, Main Street QE is isomorphic to Wall Street QE. To account
for the unique features of the ongoing crisis, we introduce an additional constraint that re-
stricts the amount of credit a non-financial firm can secure as a function of its cash flows. This
seems particularly relevant in the current environment, where government-mandated lock-
downs and significant changes in consumer behavior have resulted in the near-evaporation of
cash flows for many non-financial firms. When this “cash flow constraint” is binding, Main
Street QE can be a highly effective way to stimulate economic activity because it loosens
the constraint facing non-financial firms and allows them to continue to issue debt to finance
investment. Conversely, Wall Street QE becomes almost completely ineffective in this sit-
uation. Even though asset purchases from financial intermediaries free up space on their
balance sheets, intermediaries remain unwilling to purchase bonds issued by firms with low
cash flows.
   In a quantitative version of our model, we compare and contrast the two types of QE
against the backdrop of the Great Recession as well as COVID-19. We model the Great
Recession of 2007-2009 as a situation in which intermediaries were constrained, but non-
financial firms were not. We show that Main Street and Wall Street QE are equivalent ways
to stimulate aggregate demand in such a scenario. For the current COVID-19 crisis, we
assume that both intermediaries and firms face binding constraints. In this situation, Wall
Street QE is almost completely ineffective at stimulating variables like output, labor, and
consumption. In contrast, Main Steet QE becomes far more stimulative. Viewed through
the lens of our model, and in light of the circumstances the economy is now facing, the Fed’s
recent actions to lend directly to non-financial firms could have a substantial positive impact
on aggregate demand. More generally, our analysis provides a simple yet powerful message.
It is not sufficient for a central bank to lend freely to combat an economic crisis. It is just as
important for the central bank to lend freely to where constraints are most binding. In the
Great Recession, this was the financial system. In 2020, it is non-financial firms.
   The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents some brief background


                                                2
on central bank practices and provides some details concerning the Federal Reserve’s recent
actions. Section 3 presents the key ingredients of our model and discusses the potential
differences between Wall Street and Main Street QE. Section 4 presents quantitative results
from our model. Section 5 concludes.



2     The Fed’s Emergency COVID-19 Responses

In this section, we provide a brief description of some of the new facilities the Fed has set
up, and some of the actions it has taken, in response to the COVID-19 crisis. We frame
our discussion in an historical context by beginning with a brief description of consensus
views regarding central bank interventions and highlight how recently instituted programs
represent a significant departure from the historical consensus view.
    Dating back to at least Bagehot (1873), a prevailing view among monetary economists is
that central banks ought to lend freely to solvent but illiquid banks to support the free flow
of credit in a crisis. Traditionally, central banks around the world, and in particular the Fed-
eral Reserve in the United States, only directly interacted with commercial banks who fund
themselves with demand deposits. This practice of only interacting with commercial banks
changed during the Financial Crisis of 2007-2009. Partly in response to the size and scope
of the crisis, and partly as a consequence of the evolution of credit intermediation outside
of the traditional, regulated banking sector, the Federal Reserve significantly widened its
sphere of interaction. During that crisis, the Fed created various lending facilities to extend
credit directly to a variety of non-bank intermediaries, such as investment banks, insurance
conglomerates, and money market mutual funds, to name but a few. These non-bank in-
termediaries are sometimes referred to as members of the “shadow banking” system. While
not banks in the legal sense of not funding themselves via demand deposits, they engage in
liquidity and maturity transformation, perform the essential tasks of credit intermediation,
and are just as susceptible (if not more, given the lack of deposit insurance) to run dynamics



                                               3
as traditional commercial banks. In addition to direct lending, during and after the Great
Recession the Federal Reserve also massively expanded the size of its balance sheet via the
purchase of large quantities of non-traditional assets – chiefly longer-term Treasury securities
and agency mortgage backed securities (MBS).
       While controversial at the time, extension of credit beyond the regulated banking sector
to other types of financial firms seems rather natural given that roughly two-thirds of credit
intermediation in the United States now happens outside of commercial banks. Large scale
asset purchases, more commonly known as quantitative easing (QE), were deployed as an
antidote to the problems of the zero lower bound (ZLB) on policy rates. Many have found
QE to be a reasonably good substitute for conventional policy at the ZLB (e.g. Wu and
Xia 2016, Swanson 2018, and Sims and Wu 2020a). Even before the current crisis, most
observers expected QE to become a regular component of central banks’ toolkit (Brainard
2019).
       In response to the economic calamity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, within
the span of a few weeks in March 2020 the Fed swiftly lowered the target Federal Funds
Rate down to zero; increased its overnight repo operations to stabilize short-term funding
markets; re-instituted dollar swap agreements with foreign central banks; used moral suasion
to encourage banks to take advantage of the Fed’s discount window; revived the Money Mar-
ket Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility,1 the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary
Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility; and announced
intentions to resume large quantitative easing purchases (a first announcement of $700 billion
split between long-term Treasuries and agency MBS, later amended to an unlimited amount,
or so-called “QE-infinity”). While massive in both scope and size, all of these actions rep-
resent natural extensions of the Fed’s actions in 2007-2009. In particular, they only involve
the Federal Reserve interacting with financial firms.
   1
    Technically, the MMMLF is new to the current crisis, but is very similar to the Asset-Backed Commercial
Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility and the Money Market Investor Funding Facility, both
established in 2008.



                                                    4
   The newer, and far more controversial, actions by the Fed in response to the COVID-19
crisis involve direct lending to non-financial firms. These new facilities include the Primary
Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF), the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility
(SMCCF), and the Main Street Lending Program (which consists of three related facilities,
the MSNLF, MSPLF, and MSELF). The PMCCF and SMCCF will purchase corporate
bonds either directly from non-financial firms (PMCCF) or indirectly on secondary markets
(SMCCF) through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In total, the present size of these two
programs is $750 billion. Through the different facilities associated with the Main Street
Lending Program, the Fed plans to make another $600 billion in credit directly available to
small- and medium-sized non-financial firms.
   All of these new programs involve the Federal Reserve taking on a significant degree of
credit risk, which itself represents a departure from most previous Federal Reserve actions.
The PMCCF and the different facilities associated with the Main Street Lending Program
are further differentiated from prior Fed actions in that they involve direct lending to non-
financial firms. While the SMCCF entails the assumption of significant credit risk, the Fed
is purchasing ETFs on secondary markets, and hence not directly supporting the activities
of non-financial firms the way it is with the PMCCF and the Main Street Lending Program.
In that sense, the SMCCF can be considered a straightforward extension of “traditional”
QE operations, wherein the Fed purchases previously issued government and agency-backed
debt securities, but is now also purchasing privately-issued securities carrying some credit
risk. The direct extension of credit to non-financial firms, in contrast, is quite different.
   For simplicity, we refer to the extension of credit or purchases of assets on secondary
markets, including the traditional QE programs instituted during the Great Recession, as
“Wall Street QE” because it involves the Fed interacting with financial firms. In contrast,
we label the extension of credit or purchases of assets directly from non-financial firms as
“Main Street QE.” Although our model abstracts from some nuances in these programs, our
objective is to understand whether and under what conditions Main Street QE differs from


                                               5
Wall Street QE. We also aim to provide insight into which type of QE is best-suited for the
current COVID-19 crisis.



3     Model

In this section, we lay out the principal ingredients of our model. Along most dimensions,
the model is similar to Sims and Wu (2020b). In the main text, we describe only those
aspects of the model that are most relevant for studying Wall Street and Main Street QE.
The rest of the model details are relegated to Appendix A.
    Before proceeding with details, we begin with a broad, high-level overview of the model.
The production side of the economy consists of a representative wholesale firm, a repre-
sentative new capital goods firm, a continuum of retailers, and a representative final goods
firm. A representative household consumes, saves via a one period deposits, and supplies
labor to labor unions. A continuum of labor unions repackage household labor for resale
to a competitive labor packer. The wholesale firm purchases labor from the labor packer
and accumulates its own capital, purchasing new capital from the representative new capital
goods firm. The wholesale producers sells its output to retailers, who repackage wholesale
output for resale to the final goods firm. Price and wage stickiness are introduced at the
retail firm and labor union levels, respectively, which allows us to work with a representative
household and a representative wholesale producer.
    Financial intermediaries engage in maturity transformation between the one-period de-
posits of the household and the long-term bonds issued by the wholesale firm; they are struc-
tured as in Gertler and Karadi (2013). Markets are segmented in that the household does not
have access to these long-term bonds; they can only be purchased by financial intermediaries.
To the extent to which intermediaries are balance sheet constrained, a spread between yields
on long-term bonds and short-term deposits will emerge. Similarly to Carlstrom, Fuerst
and Paustian (2017), we assume that the wholesale producer must issue long-term bonds



                                              6
to finance a fraction of its investment. Both this constraint, as well as the balance sheet
constraint on intermediaries, are key features in Sims and Wu’s (2020b) model.
   In addition to setting the short-term nominal interest rate, the central bank in our model
can purchase long-term bonds either from financial intermediaries or directly from the whole-
sale firm. We label the former as “Wall Street QE” and the latter as “Main Street QE.” As
in Sims and Wu (2020b, 2019), “Wall Street QE” can be effective by relaxing the endoge-
nous leverage constraint facing financial intermediaries – by purchasing long-term bonds, the
central bank frees up space on intermediary balance sheets to purchase private bonds, which
results in more investment. The main difference in our model relative to the setup in Sims
and Wu (2020b) is that, similarly to Drechsel (2019), we introduce a constraint that limits
the amount of debt the wholesale firm can issue as a function of its current cash flows.
   “Main Street QE” involves the central bank directly lending to the firm, which relaxes its
cash flow constraint and allows it to issue more debt and thereby finance more investment.
When firms are cash flow constrained, as they likely are now in the midst of the COVID-
19 pandemic, Main Street QE can be highly effective. At the same time, Wall Street QE
becomes ineffective – even though this type of QE frees up space on intermediary balance
sheets to buy private debt, they remain unwilling to do so when firms have very low cash
flows.


3.1      Wholesale Firm

The wholesale firm produces output according to:


                                     Yw,t = At Ktα L1−α
                                                    d,t .                               (3.1)

   At is an exogenous aggregate productivity shifter, Kt is the stock of physical capital
chosen the previous period, and Ld,t is labor input. The parameter α ∈ (0, 1) captures
capital share of income. The wholesale firm accumulates its own physical capital, which



                                              7
obeys the law of motion:


                                      Kt+1 = Ibt + (1 − δ)Kt .                           (3.2)

New physical capital,Ibt , is purchased from an investment goods firm at Ptk . Labor is hired
at nominal wage Wt from the labor packing firm. Output is sold to retailers at Ptw .
   The wholesale firm faces two constraints. First, it must finance a fraction, ψ, of its
expenditure on new capital goods by floating long-term bonds. These long-term bonds are
modeled as perpetuities with decaying coupon payments as in Woodford (2001). One unit
of bonds issued today obliges the firm to a coupon payment of one dollar in the next period,
κ dollars in two periods, κ2 dollars in three periods, and so on, where κ ∈ [0, 1]. New
bond issuances trade at market price Qt . Let Fw,t−1 denote the total coupon liability due
today from past issuances. It is straightforward to show that, at time t, the total value
of all outstanding bonds is Qt Fw,t , while the quantity of new issuances can be written as
Fw,t − κFw,t−1 . What we call the investment constraint is therefore:


                                   ψPtk Ibt ≤ Qt (Fw,t − κFw,t−1 ),                      (3.3)

and is the same as in Sims and Wu (2020b).
   The second constraint facing the wholesale firm is that the amount of bonds that it
can issue, Qt (Fw,t − κFw,t−1 ), is constrained by current cash flows, defined as revenue less
payments to labor. This definition follows Drechsel (2019). We refer to this constraint as a
cash flow constraint:


                        Qt (Fw,t − κFw,t−1 ) ≤ ϕ Ptw At Ktα L1−α
                                                                          
                                                             d,t − Wt Ld,t ,             (3.4)

where ϕ is an exogenous parameter.
   We assume that the “investment constraint,” (3.3), is binding in both of the scenarios
we study: the Great Recession and COVID-19. In contrast, we think about the cash flow


                                                  8
constraint, (3.4), as only binding in extreme circumstances. In particular, the cash flow
constraint was arguably not relevant in the 2007-2009 crisis, which had its origins in the
banking system. But in the present environment in the midst of a public health crisis,
mandated lockdowns and changes in consumer behavior likely make the cash flow constraint
(3.4) binding.
   Nominal dividends for the wholesale firm are:


             Dw,t = Ptw At Ktα L1−α             kb
                                d,t − Wt Lt − Pt It − Fw,t−1 + Qt (Fw,t − κFw,t−1 ),                 (3.5)

or, in real terms:


                            α 1−α                      Fw,t−1 Qt (Fw,t − κFw,t−1 )
              dw,t = pw                       kb
                      t At Kt Ld,t − wt Lt − pt It −         +                     ,                 (3.6)
                                                        Pt             Pt

where pw     w                                                                    k     k
       t = Pt /Pt is the inverse price markup, wt = Wt /Pt is the real wage, and pt = Pt /Pt

is the relative price of capital measured in consumption goods. The firm’s objective is to
                                                                                         β t u0 (Ct )
maximize the present discounted value of real dividends, discounted by Λ0,t =             u0 (C0 )
                                                                                                      ,   the
stochastic discount factor of the household, subject to the law of motion for capital, (3.2), the
investment constraint, (3.3), and the cash flow constraint, (3.4). The first order conditions
are:


                                                       α −α
                                    wt = (1 − α)pw
                                                 t At Kt Ld,t                                        (3.7)

                                       λ1,t = pkt (1 + ψλ2,t )                                       (3.8)

                                                        α−1 1−α
             λ1,t = Et Λt,t+1 (1 + ϕλ3,t+1 )αpw
                                                                                   
                                              t+1 At+1 Kt+1 Ld,t+1 + λ1,t+1 (1 − δ)                  (3.9)

              (1 + λ2,t − λ3,t )Qt = Et Λt,t+1 Π−1
                                                t+1 [1 + κQt+1 (1 + λ2,t+1 − λ3,t+1 )]             (3.10)

   In these expressions, λ1,t is the Lagrange multiplier on the capital accumulation equation,
λ2,t ≥ 0 is the multiplier on the investment constraint, and λ3,t ≥ 0 is the multiplier on the



                                                 9
cash flow constraint. Πt+1 is the gross inflation rate. (3.7) is the labor demand expression;
this condition looks entirely standard. (3.8) is the first order condition for investment and
relates the price of new capital goods to the multiplier on the capital accumulation constraint.
λ2,t ≥ 0 throws a wedge into the usual relationship that the multiplier and the price of capital
would be the same. (3.9) is the first order condition for physical capital. λ3,t+1 ≥ 0 functions
like a subsidy to the return on physical capital; having more capital eases the cash flow
constraint in subsequent periods. (3.10) is the optimality condition for the choice of Fw,t ,
how many long-term bonds to issue. λ2,t and λ3,t enter this optimality condition in the same
way but with opposite signs.


3.2    Financial Intermediaries

Financial intermediaries are structured as in Gertler and Karadi (2013) and Sims and Wu
(2020b). Here, we sketch out the principal ingredients.
   In the background, there are a mass of intermediaries indexed by i. Intermediaries
stochastically exit with probability 1 − σ at the end of each period. Exiting intermediaries
are replaced each period by an equal number of newly-formed intermediaries who begin with
startup real net worth of X. Intermediaries will differ in terms of the level of net worth,
depending on how long since they were formed. But assumptions in the model guarantee
that the value of an intermediary is linear in net worth – so these intermediaries are simply
scaled versions of one another. This ensures that intermediaries behave identically with
respect to their choices of assets to hold. For the purposes of the exposition in the text, we
therefore drop i indexes and think about there being a representative intermediary.
   Intermediaries fund themselves with deposits from the household Dt and accumulated
net worth Nt . On the asset side of the balance sheet, they can hold bonds issued by the
wholesale firm Ft , bonds issued by the government Bt (these take the same form as bonds
issued by the wholesale firm, trading at market price QB,t ), and reserve balances with the

where lower cases represent real terms: ft = Ft /Pt , bt = Bt /Pt , ret = REt /Pt , dt = Dt /Pt ,
nt = Nt /Pt .
   Assuming an intermediary survives across periods, in real terms its net worth evolves

where RtF and RtB are the holding period returns on private and government bonds, respec-
tively, and Rtre is the gross interest rate on reserves, set by the central bank. The holding
period returns satisfy:


                                                   1 + κQt
                                           RtF =           ,                               (3.13)

                                                     QB,t−1

   So long as there exist excess returns (e.g. RtF − Rt−1
                                                      d
                                                          > 0), a financial intermediary’s
objective is to maximize its terminal net worth. Discounting is by the stochastic discount
factor of the household adjusted to reflect the probability of future exit. Let Vt be the value
of an intermediary in period t that is continuing to period t + 1. This value satisfies:


                      Vt = max (1 − σ) Et Λt,t+1 nt+1 + σ Et Λt,t+1 Vt+1 .                 (3.15)
                           ft ,bt ,ret


   If there were no constraints, an intermediary would purchase assets up to the point of
eliminating excess returns. We introduce a costly enforcement constraint to prevent that.
In particular, we assume that, at the end of a period, an intermediary can default and

                                                   11
abscond with a stochastic fraction, θt , of its corporate bonds and a fraction, θt ∆, of its
government bonds, where 0 ≤ ∆ ≤ 1. Creditors recover the rest of the intermediary’s assets
in default, including all of its reserves. To prevent default from occurring, creditors impose
an endogenous leverage constraint on intermediaries of the form:


                                   Vt ≥ θt (Qt ft + ∆QB,t bt ) .                       (3.16)

   This constraint ensures that it is more valuable for an intermediary to continue on as an
intermediary as opposed to defaulting and absconding with assets. Let λt be the Lagrange
multiplier on the constraint. The first order conditions for the intermediary are:

where Ωt satisfies:


                                      Ωt = 1 − σ + σθt φt ,                            (3.20)

and φt is a modified leverage ratio and satisfies:


                                        Et Λt,t+1 Π−1         d
                                                    t+1 Ωt+1 Rt
                           φt =                                                        (3.21)

                                                t+1 Ωt+1 (Rt+1 − Rt )

   One can show that Vt = θt φt nt . When the constraint binds, the modified leverage ratio
equals:


                                            Qt ft + ∆QB,t bt
                                     φt =                    .                         (3.22)
                                                   nt

   (3.17) reveals that, in equilibrium, Rtre = Rtd . This arises because an intermediary is


                                                12
unconstrained in the amount of reserves it can hold. In contrast, if λt > 0, there will be
excess returns on corporate and government bonds. The magnitude of these excess returns
will differ by the factor ∆, which is an exogenous parameter.


3.3    Fiscal Policy

The government consumes an exogenous and constant level of output each period, G. It
finances this spending through a combination of lump sum taxes, debt issuance, and a
remittance from the central bank, Tcb,t . In nominal terms, its flow budget constraint is:


                    Pt G + BG,t−1 = Pt Tt + Pt Tcb,t + QB,t (BG,t − κBG,t−1 ).                (3.23)

   Government bonds are perpetuities with decaying coupon payments and are structured
identically to the bonds issued by the wholesale firm. They trade at price QB,t . Tcb,t is
a transfer from the central bank, discussed below. We assume that the real amount of
government bonds outstanding is fixed at b̄G , so bG,t = BG,t /Pt = b̄G,t . Assuming constant
(real) government debt is a simplification that avoids complications arising because of a
breakdown of Ricardian Equivalence due to balance sheet constraints facing intermediaries.
Lump sum taxes automatically adjust, given the level of G, the price of debt QB,t , and the
fixed real outstanding debt b̄G , to ensure that (3.23) always holds.


3.4    Central Bank

The central bank sets the interest rate on reserves according to a traditional Taylor-type
rule. For now, we ignore constraints imposed by the ZLB.


  ln Rtre = (1 − ρR ) ln Rre + ρR ln Rt−1
                                      re
                                          +

                             (1 − ρR ) [φπ (ln Πt − ln Π) + φy (ln Yt − ln Yt−1 )] + sR εR,t . (3.24)




                                               13
As shown above, in equilibrium Rtre = Rtd , so we could equivalently model the central bank
as directly setting the short-term deposit rate.
   The central bank can hold privately-issued or government-issued bonds on its balance
sheet. These assets are financed via reserves, which the central bank can freely set. In real
terms, the central bank’s balance sheet is


                                   Qt fcb,t + QB,t bcb,t = ret .                       (3.25)

   We allow the amount of central bank private bond holdings, fcb,t to be split into two
components. We will refer to these as “Wall Street QE” (or traditional QE), qet for short,
and “Main Street QE,” or qeM
                           t :




                                      fcb,t = qet + qeM
                                                      t .                              (3.26)

qeM
  t involves direct purchases of long-term bonds from firms, whereas qet involves purchases

of long-term bonds from intermediaries. We will discuss why these different kinds of pur-
chases might matter in Subsection 3.5.
   We simply assume that qet and qeM
                                   t obey exogenous AR(1) processes:




                           qet = (1 − ρqe )qe + ρqe qet−1 + sqe εqe,t ,                (3.27)

                          qeM
                            t = (1 − ρqe )qe
                                            M
                                              + ρqe qeM          M
                                                      t−1 + sqe εqe,t ,                (3.28)

In (3.27)-(3.28), we assume that the AR(1) parameters and shock standard deviations are
the same. This is not necessary, but makes our subsequent analysis more transparent. We
also assume that the central bank holds a constant quantity of real government bonds, b̄cb .
This is again not central to our analysis; government bond purchases have identical (albeit
smaller, to the extent that ∆ < 1) effects as private bond purchases from intermediaries; for
further discussion, see Sims and Wu (2020b).



                                                14
   The central bank potentially earns an operating profit from its holdings of long-term
bonds relative to its cost of issuing reserves. This operating profit is remitted to the govern-
ment each period and satisfies:


                 Tcb,t = RtF Π−1                B −1                re   −1
                              t Qt−1 fcb,t−1 + Rt Πt QB,t−1 b̄cb − Rt−1 Πt ret−1         (3.29)


3.5     Wall Street vs. Main Street QE

We refer to purchases of bonds – either private or government – from intermediaries as
“Wall Street QE” since it involves an interaction only with the financial sector. We refer to
direct asset purchases from the wholesale firm as “Main Street QE.” This section highlights
mechanisms through which each of them works and contrasts the two policy tools.
   Main Street QE works through the wholesale firm’s cash flow constraint. In particular,
to allow for direct lending, we modify (3.4) as follows:


      Qt (fw,t − κΠ−1                 M     −1 m           w     α 1−α
                                                                                 
                   t fw,t−1 ) − Qt (qet − κΠt qet−1 ) ≤ ϕ pt At Kt Ld,t − wt Ld,t .      (3.30)


The new cash flow constraint says that net bond issuance to be absorbed by intermediaries
cannot exceed some multiple of current cash flows. Though the wholesale firm takes qeM
                                                                                     t

as given and hence it does not affect the first order conditions presented above, the distinc-
tion between (3.4) and (3.30) is important when contrasting between Wall Street and Main
Street QE. Direct bond purchases, qeM
                                    t , loosen the cash flow constraint because fewer of the

wholesale firm’s bonds need to be absorbed by intermediaries. This allows the firm to issue
more debt and increases its investment even when its cash flows are low. This situation
seems especially relevant in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis.
   Wall Street QE works the same as in Sims and Wu (2020b) by loosening the enforce-
ment constraint facing intermediaries when the cash flow constraint, (3.30), does not bind.
Purchases of private bonds are more effective than government bonds to the extent to which


                                               15
∆ < 1, but this difference is not important for thinking about the intuition for how such
purchases can stimulate the economy. Asset purchases by the central bank from intermedi-
aries involves a swap of assets where a constraint applies (corporate or government bonds)
for another asset, reserves, which is irrelevant for the enforcement constraint facing an in-
termediary. This swap thus loosens the constraint facing an intermediary, allowing it to
purchase more private and government bonds. In equilibrium, this results in higher bond
prices, Qt and QB,t , and correspondingly lower yields. Since we assume that the wholesale
firm must float debt to finance investment, a higher bond price encourages the issuance of
higher-valued debt and hence more investment. This works to stimulate overall aggregate
demand.
   If there is no cash flow constraint facing the wholesale firm (i.e. if (3.30) does not bind),
the distinction between purchases of bonds from intermediaries and direct purchases from
firms, or what we label as qet and qeM
                                     t , is irrelevant – both would have the same effects and

would work through intermediary balance sheets.
   However, when the cash flow constraint binds, Wall Street QE without Main Street QE
becomes ineffective. To see this, combine (3.4) with (3.3):


                                                 α 1−α
                             ψpkt Ibt ≤ ϕ pw
                                                                    
                                           t At Kt Ld,t − wt Ld,t                        (3.31)


Private investment is simply restricted by current cash flows and does not directly depend
on the bond price Qt . The mechanism through which Wall Street QE works is therefore not
present, and absent general equilibrium effects, it would be completely ineffectual. Indeed,
in quantitative simulations in the next section, we show that Wall Street QE is almost
completely ineffective at stimulating output when firms are cash flow constrained.
   Main Street QE, in contrast, is highly effective because it directly loosens the constraint
facing the wholesale firm and permits higher investment and more aggregate demand. To
see this, combine (3.30) with (3.3) – in other words, allow for Main Street QE:



                                              16
                                        α 1−α                          −1 m
                    ψpkt Ibt ≤ ϕ pw                              M
                                                        
                                  t At Kt Ld,t − wt Ld,t + Qt (qet − κΠt qet−1 )                   (3.32)

Increases in qeM
               t here directly loosen the constraints facing the firm, resulting in more in-

vestment and aggregate demand.



4         COVID-19 vs. the Great Recession

In this section, we quantitatively analyze the effects of Wall Street and Main Street QE in
the two environments: the most recent COVID-19 crisis and the previous Great Recession.


4.1        Calibration

We begin by assigning values to the different parameters in the model in Table 1. Many of
them are chosen based on consensus values from the extant literature.
        Parameters governing preferences and technology are fairly standard. The unit of time
in the model is a quarter. We follow Sims and Wu (2020b) in calibrating parameters related
to financial intermediaries, with one exception. In particular, we set the decay parameter
for bond coupon payments to κ = 1 − 16−1 . This implies a four year duration of long-term
bonds in the model, which aligns with the maturity lengths associated with the different
facilities that are part of the Main Street Lending Program as well as SMCCF. We set the
AR(1) parameter for both Main Street and Wall Street QE to ρqe = 0.97. The size of the
QE shocks we consider amount to about a one-third expansion in the size of the central
bank’s pre-Great Recession balance sheet, which is roughly in-line with the sizes of recent
Fed interventions.2 For the situation in which the cash flow constraint on production firms
is binding, we set ϕ = 0.30.
    2
     Because the model is solved via a linear approximation, we do not need to specify parameter values
for other exogenous processes, and impulse responses are just proportional to the size of the QE shocks we
consider.

4.2       Great Recession

We begin by using our model to think about the experience of the US during the Great
Recession of 2007-2009. Since that crisis had its origins in the financial sector, we think of
the Great Recession as being characterized by intermediaries being constrained, but non-
financial firms as not being subject to a cash flow constraint. In other words, we assume
that (3.30) is not binding, and accordingly solve the model dropping that equation as well
as the Lagrange multiplier λ3,t .
    Because of the linear solution to the model, we do not need to take a stand on what kind
of shock contributed to the Great Recession. A natural candidate, however, as emphasized
in Sims and Wu (2020b), is a sequence of adverse credit shocks, captured by the exogenous



                                                               18
variable θt . Due to concerns surrounding subprime mortgages, creditors became less willing
to fund financial intermediaries, resulting in a tightening of balance sheet constraints. In
the model, this would lead to a widening of credit spreads and a contraction in aggregate
demand, roughly in-line with observed patterns in the data.
   Figure 1 plots impulse responses of selected variables to a Wall Street QE shock during
the Great Recession in the model (when the cash flow constraint does not bind). The QE
shock is a shock to purchases of privately issued debt from intermediaries; responses of a
shock to government bond-holdings would be similar but smaller in magnitude. For the
responses shown, we do not impose a ZLB constraint on the short-term interest rate. Doing
so would amplify the effects of the QE shock. Responses of inflation and the policy rate are
expressed in annualized percentage points. Responses of central bank bond holdings, as well
as the multiplier on the balance sheet constraint, are expressed in absolute deviations from
steady state. All other responses are expressed in percentage deviations from steady state.
   The Wall Street QE shock results in hump-shaped expansions in output, investment,
labor input, and inflation. Output reaches a peak response after about a year. The path of
investment is similar, albeit about three times larger. Consumption initially declines before
eventually rising. Focusing on the lower right-hand part of the figure, one sees the key
mechanisms through which Wall Street QE transmits to the economy. When the central
bank purchases bonds from intermediaries, it swaps these bonds for reserves. Reserves do
not factor into the leverage constraint facing intermediaries. As a consequence, the leverage
constraint becomes looser, as evidenced by the decline in the Lagrange multiplier facing
intermediaries, denoted in the model by λt . Less constrained, intermediaries purchase more
bonds. This pushes the price of these bonds up. The higher bond price, in turn, eases the
investment constraint facing the wholesale firm. This allows them to do more investment
and stimulates aggregate demand.
   In an environment in which the cash flow constraint is not binding, such as the Great
Recession, Main Street and Wall Street QE are equivalent to one another. As discussed in

Notes: The shock is a 0.01 shock to central bank private bonding holdings, fcb,t , when the
cash-flow constraint on the wholesale firm is not binding. Units of variables: CB bond
holding and the multiplier on the leverage constraint are in absolute deviations. Inflation
and the policy rate are changes in annualized percentage points. All other variables are in
percentage deviation from the steady state.

Subsection 3.5, it does not matter whether a central bank issues credit directly to firms or
indirectly through easing balance sheet constraints on intermediaries.


4.3    COVID-19

We next use our model to discuss different kinds of QE during the COVID-19 pandemic,
a situation in which the cash flow constraint on non-financial firms is binding. We do
not formally model why this constraint is binding, but nevertheless think this captures in a
convenient way the situation facing firms in the present crisis. A combination of government-
mandated lockdowns, unwillingness of households to go to work, and changes in consumption

patterns have resulted in a near evaporation of cash flows for many firms. One could think
of this is as a massive reduction in Yt − wt Ld,t in response to some combination of shocks.
Alternatively, given serious concerns about the profitability of these firms, one could also
think of this constraint as being binding due to a reduction in ϕ – i.e. an unwillingness of
banks to extend credit.
   Figure 2 shows impulse responses to a Wall Street QE shock when both the balance sheet
constraint on intermediaries and the cash flow constraint on firms are binding. One observes
that Wall Street QE is approximately neutral for the real economy. The Fed purchasing

                                                                                  21
bonds from intermediaries pushes bond prices up, but with no cash flows the lower cost of
borrowing is of no use to firms, who nevertheless can still not issue debt to support their
ongoing activities. The very small effects of Wall Street QE (note the units on the vertical
axes in the impulse response graph) emerge due to small general equilibrium effects.
       Next, consider the impulse responses to a Main Street QE shock in a situation in which
firms are cash flow constrained. These responses are depicted in Figure 3. We consider a
shock to Main Street QE of exactly the same magnitude as the Wall Street QE shock in
Figure 2. Here one observes that Main Street QE is even more stimulative than in Figure 1.
The immediate impact of the shock is a large reduction in the multiplier on the cash flow
constraint. This allows firms to sell more bonds to finance investment, which results in a
decline (rather than an increase) in bond prices and a large increase in aggregate demand,
with output, consumption, labor input, and inflation all rising.
       The large increase in investment unleashed because of the immediate relaxing of the cash
flow constraint allows firms to quickly accumulate more capital. On its own, this serves as a
propagation mechanism for output, but there is an additional channel at play. Higher future
capital stocks further loosen the cash flow constraint facing firms far off into the future,
which works to reinforce the beneficial effects of Main Street QE.
       In comparing the impulse responses in Figure 3 to Figure 1, one notices that in the
COVID-19 scenario output and investment respond maximally on impact and then revert
rather quickly.3 This is because Main Street QE works through a flow channel: in the cash
flow constraint (3.30), the new bond issuances are constrained by the firm’s cash flows. To
relax this constraint, the central bank needs to absorb new debt. In contrast, Wall Street
QE works through a stock channel, because the leverage constraint facing intermediaries
applies to their stock of assets and not to the flow. In this paper, we have assumed the
same exogenous processes for both types of QE to facilitate comparison. In practice, QE is
implemented more in the flow sense. Hence, if one were to modify our exercises to apply to
   3
    While the responses revert quickly, they nevertheless remain well above their pre-shock values for some
time due to propagation from increases in the capital stock and subsequent easing of the cash flow constraint.

the flow and not the stock of central bank bond purchases, one would expect to see a more
prolonged effect on variables like output and investment from Main Street QE.
   The take-home message from these exercises is that, to simulate economic activity, it
is not simply important for the Fed to purchase assets and lend freely, it is important that
they allocate funds to where constraints are most binding. In a “balance-sheet” recession like
the one induced by the Financial Crisis in 2007-2009, purchasing assets from banks makes
sense. But if the key constraint is facing firms, no amount of easing bank balance sheets will
stimulate the economy. In a situation like this, which we think is a reasonable description

                                                                          23
of the current state of affairs, direct lending to firms can be a powerful stimulative tool.



5     Conclusion

This paper represents a first attempt at formally modeling direct lending by the Federal
Reserve to non-financial firms as an emergency measure to combat the COVID-19 crisis.
Direct lending, both through the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility and the various
facilities associated with the Main Street Lending Program, amounts to more than $1 trillion
of credit that the Fed has or is planning to funnel into the economy. Lending to non-financial
firms represents an important departure from past Fed policies, all of which only targeted
banks and other financial firms. We refer to direct lending to non-financial firms as “Main
Street QE,” while we call lending and asset purchases involving financial firms as “Wall
Street QE.”
    We construct a macro model with two key frictions relevant for central bank balance
sheet policies. The first is an endogenous leverage constraint on intermediaries. The second
is a cash flow constraint on how much debt non-financial firms can issue. When only the first
constraint on financial intermediaries binds, Wall Street and Main Street QE are isomorphic
to one another. We think of a situation in which intermediaries are constrained but firms
are not as roughly characterizing the US economy at the time of the Great Recession. In
contrast, when the cash flow constraint on intermediaries is also binding (which we think
of as a defining characteristic of the COVID-19 crisis), Wall Street QE becomes ineffective.
Main Street QE, however, becomes even more effective. By directly lending to firms, the Fed
can loosen the constraint facing them and trigger an increase in investment and aggregate
demand.
    Overall, we conclude that Wall Street QE is an appropriate policy response to a “balance
sheet” recession such as the Great Recession. COVID-19 is much more of a “cash flow”
recession that is directly impacting non-financial firms, rather than financial intermediaries.



                                              24
It is not sufficient for the Fed to simply lend freely to counteract the crisis. Rather, the
central bank ought to lend freely, but more importantly its lending should be targeted at
segments of the economy where constraints are most binding. For the particular circum-
stances surrounding the COVID-19 crisis, lending directly to non-financial firms can be a
highly effective way to raise aggregate demand.
   In closing, we wish to highlight that we do not aim to address a variety of issues related
to independence and accountability that arise from the Fed directly interacting with non-
financial firms. Many commentators (e.g. Cecchetti and Schoenholtz 2020) have argued that
the assumption of credit risk and “picking winners and losers” through direct extension of
credit to non-financial firms poses a significant threat to hard-won central bank independence.
The resultant blurring of lines between monetary and fiscal intervention will likely need to
be addressed once the current crisis has passed.

A      Full Model and Derivations
This appendix lays out the more standard parts of the model presented in Section 3.


A.1     Household
The household consumes, supplies labor at nominal wage WtH to labor unions, and saves via one
period deposits, Dt , with financial intermediaries. These deposits offer gross nominal return Rtd .
In nominal terms, the household’s flow budget constraint is:

                      Pt Ct + Dt ≤ WtH + Rt−1
                                          d
                                              Dt−1 + P ROFt − Pt X − Pt Tt .                    (A.1)
    P ROFt is nominal profit distributed lump sum to the household each period. It is inclusive
of profit from both non-financial firms as well as exiting financial interemdiaries. As discussed in
the text, X is a fixed real equity transfer to newly-born financial intermediaries. Tt is a lump sum
transfer/tax from the government. Pt is the price level.
    The household has standard preferences. Its problem, with the budget constraint written in
real terms, is:

A.2     Labor Market
There are two layers to the labor market. There are a unit measure of labor unions, indexed by
h ∈ [0, 1], that purchase labor from the household at nominal wage WtH . These unions simply
repackage this labor, call it Ld,t (h), and sell it to a competitive labor packer at nominal wage
Wt (h). The labor packer transforms union labor into labor available for lease to the wholesale firm
at nominal wage Wt . This transformation takes place via a CES aggregator:

    Nominal dividends for union h are: DIVL,t (h) = Wt (h) − WtH Ld,t . Were they freely able to
                                                                      

adjust wages, the optimality condition would be to set Wt (h) as a fixed markup over WtH , with
the markup given by ww−1 . But only a fraction of unions, 1 − φw , are able to adjust nominal wages
in a given period. This makes the problem of a union given the ability to adjust dynamic. Future
dividends are discounted by the household’s stochastic discount factor with extra discounting to
account for the probability that a wage chosen in the present will remain in effect into the future.
The optimal wage-setting condition is common across all updating unions. Let Wt# denote the
optimal reset wage, or wt# = Wt# /Pt in real terms. Optimal wage-setting is characterized by:

A.3      Production
In addition the wholesale firm discussed in the text, there are three other kinds of production firms
– a continuum of retail firms, a final goods firm, and a new capital goods producer.
    There are a continuum of retailers indexed by f ∈ [0, 1]. These firms purchase wholesale output
at Ptw , repackage it, and sell it a competitive final goods firm at Pt (f ). The competitive final goods
firm transforms retail output into final output via a CES aggregator:

     Retailers simply repackage wholesale output, earning dividend DIVY,t (f ) = (Pt (f ) − Ptw ) Yt (f ).
If they could freely adjust price, then given (A.13), the optimal price-setting rule would be to set
                             p
Pt (f ) as a fixed markup, p −1 , over the price of wholesale output. But each period, only a fraction,

1 − φp , of retailers can adjust their price. This makes the price-setting problem dynamic. Future
dividends are discounted by the household’s stochastic discount factor, adjusted for the probability
that a price chosen today will remain in effect into the future. All updating retailers adjust to the
same price, Pt# . To stationarize this, define the relative reset price as Π#    #

    There is a third firm in the model that produces new physical capital from final output. It used

    Bond market-clearing requires that the total stock of bonds issued by the wholesale firm by
held either by financial intermediaries or the central bank:

                                                  fw,t = ft + fcb,t                                   (A.28)
   Similar, debt issued by the government must be held by either intermediaries or the central
bank:

                                                   b̄G = bt + b̄cb                                    (A.29)
    Aggregating the balance sheet conditions across intermediaries, and imposing that total reserves
issued by intermediaries are held in the banking system, yields:

                                         Qt ft + QB,t bt + ret = dt + nt                              (A.30)
    Each period, the fraction 1 − σ of intermediaries exists and returns their accumulated net worth
to the household. They are replaced by an equal number of intermediaries, who in aggregate are
given real startup net worth of X. Accordingly, aggregate real net worth of intermediaries evolves
according to:


  nt = σΠ−1       RtF − Rt−1
                         d
                               Qt−1 ft−1 + RtB − Rt−1
                                                  d                    re     d              d

         t                                              QB,t−1 bt−1 + Rt−1 − Rt−1   ret−1 + Rt−1 nt−1 + X

    Combining the household’s budget constraint, along with the aggregate balance sheet of
intermediaries and the consolidated government balance sheet, yields a standard aggregate
resource constraint:

                                                 Yt = Ct + It + G                                    (A.32)
