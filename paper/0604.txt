                  Inflation, Taxation and Corporate Investment:
                              A Q Theory Approach



                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper examines the role of taxation and inflation in determining

the market valuation of corporate capital and the level of investment.      It

extends previous work on the q theory of investment by incorporating the

effects of taxes levied at the individual level and by focusing on the

impact of inflation.    The q theoretic approach makes it possible to study

the effect of policy announcements and of temporary policies.       The

resulting model of the investment process is immune from the "Lucas

critique".   The estimated relationships are technological and independent

of the choice of policy rule.

     The empirical results indicate that tax policy and inflation have

potent effects on both the stock market and investment.    These effects

depend critically on whether or not policy is announced in advance.

Simulations based on q investment equations indicate that an increase in

the rate of inflation from 0 to 8 percent would cause an immediate 23

percent decline in the stock market, and a 35 percent increase in the

capital stock.    Changes in tax policy also have a large effect.     The

estimated speed of adjustment of the capital stock is surprisingly slow,

with less than half the adjustment occurring within 10 years following

typical shocks.

I.   INTRODUCTION



        The last decade has witnessed a striking decline

in the market valuation of corporate capital.      In 1967,

the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 1600 expressed

in today's dollars compared to 800 as this is written.        As

theory would predict, the reduction in the valuation of

existing corporate assets .has retarded investment.      Indeed,

the rate of growth of the non-financial corporate capital

stock has fallen considerably from 4.8 percent during the

19.60."5 to 3.9. pe+:cent during the 1970's.   This paper ex-

amines the extent to which the interaction of inflation

and taxation can account for these phenomena.       It also

provides an alternative to the traditional econometric

framework for estimating the effects on investment and

the stock. market of changes in corporate and individual

tax rules.

        The dependence of aggregate investment on the level

of the stock market has been widely recognized.      As Tobin

argued, increases in the return to capital will raise the

market value of existing capital signaling the profitability

of additional investment.    Additional investment will drive

down the marginal product of capital, reducing the asset
                            -2-



price of capital goods until equilibrium is restored.      While
models linking the stock market to investment have been
estimated, they have not been used to examine the impact
of economic policies on investment.     This paper develops
a method of using investment equations based on stock market
valuation to evaluate the effects of changes in capital
income taxes.   The model relies on the assumption that the
stock market valuation of corporate capital represents the
present value of its future profit stream.     By calculating
the effects of tax changes on future profits their impact
on the stock market is estimated.     This is used as a basis
for estimates of their effect on corporate capital accumula-
tion.
        This approach has several advantages when compared
to previous empirical approaches to modelling investment.
Almost all previous evaluations of tax policy's impact on
investment have relied on single equation models linking
investment to its proximate determinants, usually output and
the cost of capital.   For the most part, individual taxes
have been ignored and the process of adjustment has been
handled in an ad hoc fashion.     Most critically, existing
approaches to modelling investment decisions are subject
to the "Lucas criticism".     The estimated parameters are not
likely to be invariant to the choice of policy    rules~   The
equations thus do not provide a busis for estimating the
                           -3-




true effects of changes in policy rules.   This failing is

seen by considering the effect on investment of a tax change

announced in year 1, which will take effect in year 2.

Standard "backward looking" investment equations imply that

such announcements have no immediate impact on investment.

The general theoretical approach developed here makes use

of the fact that stock market valuation reflects expectation

of future policies as well as the effects of taxes levied

at the individual level.   It can be used to assess a richer

variety of tax changes than are normally considered.

        The results suggesi that changes in inflation and

tax rules have very important effects on capital accumulation

and asset prices.   However, because adjustment costs appear

to be substantial, the effects of tax policy on investment

are slow to manifest themselves.   For example, the results

suggest that the elimination of capital gains taxes would

raise the ultimate capital stock by 29 percent, but raise the

capital stock by only 4 percent within five years.     It appears,

however, that the interaction of inflation and taxation can account

for a significant fraction of the decline in the stock market

and capital formation which has occurred during the 1970's.

        The second section of the paper    outlines a "q" model

of investment and uses it to examine the dynamics of market
                            -4-




valuation and capital accumulation.   The effects of intro-

ducing a simple tax system are considered.

         The third section of the paper considers explicitly

the optimization problem of a value maximizing firm in the

presence of taxation and adjustment costs.     It is shown that

the optimal investment decision at any point in time can be

written as a simple function of the firm's market value,

its capital stock and the tax parameters.     The results of

estimating this "tax adjusted q" investment equation are

reported in section four.    This section also discusses the

estimation of the other parameters of the model.     The fifth

section of the paper uses the estimates developed in the

previous section to examine the effect of increases in infla-

tion on capital accumulation and taxation.     It is shown that

the non-indexed character of the tax system can account for

a large part of the decline in the stock market and investment

which has taken place over the last decade.      The likely effects

of continued inflation on capital accumulation are also

examined, along with the effects of indexing the tax system.

Estimates of the effects of tax reforms on the stock market

and investment are presented in the sixth section of the

paper.   Reforms considered include changes in      the

investment tax credit, corporat.e tax integration, corporate tax rate
                            -5-




reduction, and the abolition of capital gains taxation.

The dynamics of the response to announced changes in future

tax rates are also examined.      The seventh and final section

of the paper discusses some implications of the results and

suggests directions ,for future research.




II.   THE STOCK MARKET AND CAPITAL ACCUMULATION



        This section examines the dynamics of investment

and market valuation in a simplified model where all invest-

ment is financed through retained earnings and the only tax

is a proportional levy on corporate income.        In this setting

it is reasonable to assume that investment depends on the

ratio of the market value of existing capital to its re-

placement cost.   Unless the market value of the firm will be

increased by more than one dollar      by   a one dollar invest-

ment, there is no reason for it to be undertaken.       Given

costs of adjustments and   lags    in recognition and implementa-

tion, there is no reason to expect that all investments which

will raise market value by more than their cost will be made

immediately.   As Tobin (1969) has argued, these considerations

lead to an investment equation of the form:
                                 -6-




                             I   =                                                 ( 1)


                         I(l)    =a                      I' >   a


where I represents gross investment and V/K is the "q"

ratio of market value to replacement cost.                          The assumption _

that i t is IlK which depen:1s         on q insures that the growth

rate of the capital stock does not depend upon the scale
of the economy.

            It is assumed that equity owners require a fixed

real rate of return p to induce them to hold the existing

stock of equity.         This return comes in the form of dividends,

equal to after tax profits less retentions for new invest-

ment, and capital gains.             Hence we have the condition:



                                                                                  (2 )



which implies:



                v = pV   -   (l-T)    F' (K) K   +   I   (~) K +       oK         (3 )
                                       ,
where   t   is the corporate tax rate, and F(K)                     is the production

function for net output.

(.ll   A rigorous foundation for an investment equation of this
       type is provided in the next section. The analysis in
       this section is only intended to be illustrative since
       adjustment costs are neglected. An important implicit
       assumption of this .approach is the homogeneity of capital.
       If capital is heterogeneous, shocks may reduce the market
       value of existing capital but raise the return on new in-
       vestment. The recent energy shock illustrates this phe-
       nomenon.
                              -7-




It will be most convenient to examine the dynamics in

terms of K and q    = R.    Equations (I) and (3) imply that

the system's equations of motion are:



                           K = I{q)K   - 15K                              (4)



         q = [p -    I{q) + oJq + I{q) -        (l-T)F' (K)     -   0     (5)

where 0 is the rate of depreciation.

The steady state properties of the model are easily found

by imposing the conditions       K=    0 and    q=   O.   These imply:



                                                                          (6)


                    (l-L)F'     (K)    =   pq                             ( 7)




The former equation indicates that the steady state value

of q must be greater than 1 by an amount just large enough

to induce sufficient investment to cover depreciation.                  The

latter equation holds that firms equate their net marginal

product of capital to the cost of capital.                Inspection of

(6) and (7) makes it clear that a change in the corporate

tax rate affects the steady state capital stock but has no

effect on steady state q.        This is a consequence of the

assumption that it is investment relative to the capital

stock which varies with q.
                               -8-




          The phase diagram of the system (4) and (5) is

displayed in Figure 1.         It is readily verified that the

pair of equations is saddle point stable (2) .       The arrows

indicate the directions of motion and the heavy line

represents the saddle point path along which the system

will converge.     A change in the corporate tax rate is

depicted in Figure 2 ( 3 ) •    If the expectations about pre-

tax profits were static, the value of q would Jump from E

to A    when   the tax chan:Je took place. This expectations assumption

has been used in previous work on the effects of taxation on the

stock market,     (Feldstein (1979), Hendershott (1979).        It

neglects the effect of the induced changes in investment

on the present value of future profits.         With perfect fore-

sight, as assumed here, the value of q will jump only to B.

The magnitude of the jump will depend upon the speed of

adjustment of the capital stock to the shock.

         The system of equations (4) and (5) can be solved

numerically to estimate the impact of any type of shock

on the path of q and the capital stock.         The effect of

       This is a common feature of models with asset prices.
       Abel (1979) was the first to use an approach of this
       type to analyze investment incentives.

tax changes on the level of the stock market can then

be easily calculated.         This is the approach taken below

to estimating the effects of tax changes.         In the next

section the firm's optimization problem is considered

explicitly, and the tax structure is enriched.         The dynamics

parallel those described above.




III.    THE FIRM'S OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM



       In what follows the behavior of a representative,

competitive firm seeking to maximize the market value of

its equity is considered.         We begin by examining how

individuals value corporate stock, and then turn to the

firm's decision problem.         Throughout, it is assumed that

firms neither issue new equity, nor repurchase existing

shares (4) .   Hence share prices are proportional to the

outstanding value of a firm's equity.         We continue to

assume that equity holders require a fixed real after tax

return P in order to induce them to hold the outstanding

equity.    The value of   p    is not affected by either changes




(4 )
       Under the conditions described below firms would
       never want to issue new equity.     Legal restrictions
       severely limit firms' ability to repurchase their
       own shares. A discussion of these restrictions and
       the limitations of other mechanisms which might seem
       to be functionally equivalent to repurchasing shares
        is contained in Auerbach (1979 a ).
                                 -11-



 in the tax rules     or the quantity of equity.                  While this
 assumption may seem extreme, Summers (1980a) shows that in
 plausible general equilibrium models, tax changes are
 unlikely to have a large impact on the real after tax
 return required by equity holders.                     The required return
 p   is the sum of capital gains and dividends net of tax.
 It follows that:


                                                                               (8)



 where c  represents the effective. accrual rate of taxation on capital
 gains(S), and eD the tax rate on dividends, and ~ is
 the rate of inflation.      Differences in the tax rates faced
 by different investors are ignored.                    To solve this
 differential equation it is necessary to impose a trans-
 versality condition.      We do this by requiring that                 at time t;

                             _
                                 Jl(tS   (   P+Tr)du
                 lim V . e                             = 0                     (9)
                 S-+CO
                       s



This condition precludes the possibility of an explosive
solution to (1).
       With the transversality condition satisfied and the
assumption of perfect foresight, the solution to (1)
becomes:



(S) This corresponds to the statutory rate adjusted for
    deferral, and the lack of constructive realization at
    death.

                          Div    e    t l-c    ds                     (10)




In the steady state where taxes, the price level and

dividends are held constant, this expression reduces to:



                                                                      (11)



In this case capital gains taxes do not matter because

there are no capital gains.     More generally, as in (10)

capital gains taxes raise the discount rate on future

dividends, as well as affecting the valuation of current

dividends.   Note that equation (10) implies that because

of dividend taxes an extra dollar of promised dividends
                                   D
raises share valuation by only (l-e ).

      The firm seeks to choose an investment and financial

policy to maximize (10) subject to the constraints it faces.

It is constrained by its initial capital stock and by a

sources equal uses of funds requirement.            It will also be

necessary to assume that credit market constraints do not

permit the firm to finance more than a fraction(6) of its



(6)
      This is a crude way of modelling the effects of bankruptcy
      costs on the firm's choice of a debt equity ratio. As
      noted below, the ~ssumption of a constant debt-capital
      ratio is a fairly good representation of the recent
      American experience. McDonald (1980) treats the choice
      of financial pOlicy in more detail.
                                  -13-




investment through debt finance.             In the model presented

below, this constraint will always be binding, so we

assume that a share b of all new investment comes from

debt issues and the remainder is financed through retained

earnings.       Finally, the firm cannot change its capital

stock costlessly.        The cost of installing extra capital

is assumed to rise with rate of capital accumulation.                 For con-
venience, it is assumed that the cost function is convex and homo-

geneous in investment and capital.             Under these conditions dividends

       The assumption here is that all marginal equity finance
       comes from retained earnings. This'follows from the
       assumption of a constant number of shares made earlier.
       It accounts for some of the apparently parad0xical results
       described below. The last term reflects the net receipts
       from new debt issues (wi thdravla19) necessary to maintain the
       debt-capital ratio as the capital stock depreciates and the
       price level rises.

~    is the adjustment cost function which is assumed to be con-

vex, I represents investment, oR is the real rate of depreciation,

and D represents the value of currently allowable depreciation

allowances.         It has been assumed that adjustment costs are ex-

pensed and ineligible for the investment tax credit. (8)

          The tax law is assumed to allow for exponential depreciation

at rate oT that may differ from oR, but to be based on historical

cost.      This implies that:

Combining equations (2) and (5), making use of (6) and

rearranging yields an expression for the value of a firm's

equity at time t:

          Assuming that adjustment expenses were treated as investment
          under the tax law would not importantly alter the results.
          If these costs are taken to represent managerial effort, or
          as interference with concurrent production, the assumption
          in the text is appropriate.

These rather formidable expressions have simple interpreta-

tions.   B represents the present value of depreciation
          t
allowances on existing capital, Zs is the present value,

evaluated at times of the depreciation on a dollar of new

investment.   In maximizing (14) the firm can ignore Bt

since it is independent of any future decisions.                                            The

constraint faced by the firm in maximizing (14) is then:



                                                                                                   (16)


holding that capital accumulation equals net investment.

The first order conditions for optimality are(9):

      Similar conditions differing because of assumptions
      about taxation have been derived by Hayashi (1979) and
      Abel (1979).

Equation (17b) characterizes the investment function.               It
implicitly defines a function linking investment to the
real shadow price of capital A/p and the tax parameters.
The condition for zero investment is that:

                            O
                 1 =   (1- e )   [1 -   ITC -   Z - b]                   (18)
                 P     (I-c)


This result can be characterized in intuitive terms.               It
implies that the shadow price of additional capital goods
is equated to their marginal cost in after tax dollars.
Equation (18) implies that there will be investment even
if the shadow price of new capital goods is less than 1.
This is because taxes and debt finance reduce the effective
price of new capital goods.
                                     -17-




        Equation (17b) is of no operational significance

as a theory of investment unless an observable counterpart

to the shadow price Alp can be developed.                         Hayashi (1979)

has shown in a similar model with a less elaborate tax

system how the shadow price is linked to the market valuation

of existing capital.             The derivation below follows his

very closely.            Equation (14) implies that:

The real shadow price of additional capital may thus be

expressed as a function of the firm's market value.                             The term

B is subtracted from market value since the depreciation
 t
allowances the firm will receive on existing capital provide no

inducement to further investment.                    Substituting equation (21)

in equation (17b) yields an investment function expressable

entirely in terms of observables.

the capital stock, and so is the rigorous generalization
of equation (1).

          The equation of motion for q, the ratio of stock
market value to the value of the capital stock can be
written as:


                  • =        p+1T         (I-eO) Oiv   (           ~K·)            (23)

                                                        h
where Oiv is given by equation (12) , and K is defined by
equation (22).         We begin by examining the steady state
properties of the system (22) and (23).                     Solving for
the steady state values of q and K yields the conditions.

where g is the growth rate of effective labor.                            In the

special case where adjustment is costless, these expressions
take on a more familiar form.                 In this case if we also assume
oR   =   oT, the steady state conditions become:
                                   -20-




                  q*   =   (I-aD) [1 - b - ITCJ                                        (26 )

           (I-or) F'(K) + (ITC)       (g+o)   =   (p+c 'IT) (1-b) + b ( ( I-or) i   -'IT )

                                                                                       (27 )




           These expressions are equivalent to those derived

by Auerbach (1979a, 1979b).           Assuming all equity finance and

ignoring the investment tax credit, equation (26) yields his

formula for steady state q.           The value of steady state q

is less than one because of the difference between dividend

and capital gains tax rates.              Firms find it optimal to invest

past the point where a dollar's expenditure raises market value

by a dollar, since the alternative is to payout heavily taxed

dividends.     The latter expression holds that the cost of

capital is a weighted average of the costs of debt and equity

capital.     Note that cost of equity capital                depends only on the

capital gains tax rate and not on the dividend rate.                        That is

to say permanent dividend taxation has no distortionary effects.

Permanent increases in the dividend tax rate are the cause of an

immediate fall in the stock market, exactly offsetting the

reduced opportunity cost to shareowners of investment funds.
gb - The symbolb here refers to the debtb   capital ratio.  In
     Auerbach's work it refers to the debt-market value ratio.
     The results here would not be importantly altered but the
     calculations would become much more complex if a constant
     debt-market value ratio were assumed.
                            -21-




        For given tax parameters, the phase diagram for the

system (22) and (23) looks just like that one depicted in

Figure 1.     It also exhibits saddle point stability.     There

is again a unique path, indicated by the heavy arrows, along which

the system can converge to equilibrium.     On this perfect

foresight path, investment is just sufficient to actualize

the market's expectations about future dividends.        This phase

diagram can be used to study the relationship between tax

changes, market valuation and investment.

        Consider for example an increase in the investment

tax credit as shown in Figure 3.     The steady state capital

stock unambiguously increases.     In the long run the value

of q falls since the credit reduces the "effective" replace-

ment cost of capital goods.     The short run impact on stock

market valuation is ambiguous, depending on the rapidity of

adjustment.     It is possible for q to jump to any point

between A, corresponding to no capital stock adjustment,

and B, corresponding to an instantaneous adjustment of the

capital stock.    It is thus possible that the stock market

may decline even though investment has been encouraged.

Exactly parallel results hold for a decline in the capital

gains tax rate, or acceleration of tax depreciation.        An

increase in the corporate tax rate, as shown in Figure 4,

has an ambiguous effect on long run capital accumulation.

      .
The q = 0 schedule is likely to shift backwards, reflecting

the effect of increased taxes in reducing dividends.        However,

the   K=   0 locus will shift downwards because of the expending

of adjustment costs and the increased value of untaxed

depreciation allowances.        Hence the value of the market will

unambiguously decline in the short run, but the short run

impact on investment and the long run impact on the capital

stock are indeterminate.

           A substantial virtue of the approach to modelling

investment decisions developed here is that it can easily

be used to analyze the effects of announced but not yet

implemented tax changes, and temporary tax measures.        This

can be illustrated by considering the effects of an announce-

ment that at some point in the future, the dividend tax rate

will be increased.        This situation is shown in Figure 5.

There is no immediate effect on either schedule.        At time t,

when the tax increase takes effect, both schedules shift down-

wards as shown by the dashed lines.        As already noted, a

dividend tax change has no impact on long run capital intensity.

But the change does alter the timing of investment decisions.

Firms have an incentive to pay           extra dividends before the

dividend tax increase takes effect, and to pay lower subse-

quent dividends.     Following the announcement,       stock market

declines to point    A~    as firms raise dividends and reduce

investment, the system moves towards B.        At time t when the

dividend tax is increased to economy moves along the stable

arm from B to the new equilibrium C.    Note that the announce-

ment of the tax reduces investment but that investment rises

sharply at the moment when it takes effect.

         All these examples illustrate cases where tax changes

can have opposite effects on the stock market and investment.

This demonstrates the importance of taking tax factors into

account in estimating relations between market valuation and

investment.    This is done in the next section which describes

the estimation of the model outlined above.




 IV.   ESTIMATING THE MODEL



        This section describes the empirical estimation of

 the model outlined in the preceeding section.     There are

 two behavioral     functions describing adjustment costs and

 production which have to be estimated along with p) the

 required real return on equity.


        A.    The Investment Function

        For simplicity we postulate that the adjustment    cos~


  are piecewise linear with adjustment costless up to     ZOP1C   '1ormal
   level of investment, and then rising linearly' with investment

  above a threshold.     That is:
                                                      -26-



A.   The Investment Function.
                                 .2
     A   = e (I          -       y)    K               (I _() ~ 0                  (28)
          2K                                            K
         =0                                            (I -y) <:0
                                                        1\
It follows that the function                            ¢ (      ) is given by:
                                       2
     ¢   (~J =   e (! -           y)
          K      "!     K                                                          (29)

which is homgoeneous in                           ~   as required.




This implies that the investment function                                  (22) can be

written as:



                                       I
                                       K

                                                                      eQ                   (30)

 By estimating equation (30) the parameters of the adjust-

 ment cost function                    </>(   )   can be inferred.         This" is the approach

 taken below.
                            -27-



       Several authors including Von Furstenberg (1977),

Ciccolo (1975, 1977) and Engle and Foley (1975) have estim-

ated variants on equation (30).     With the exception of

Ciccolo    (1977), no account was taken of tax effects.     Cicco-

lo's tax adjustments differ from. those used here because he

takes no account of individual taxes, and implicitly makes

different assumptions about the tax treatment of adjustment

costs. Theee studies have all related components of business

fixed investment to q, which may not be appropriate for non-

corporate investment.      They have all been confined to the post-

Korean War period during which tax changes have been relatively

minor.

       In order to focus on tax effects, the work reported here

examined the determinants of non-financial corporate invest-

ment over the entire 1932-1978 period. The extension of the

sample period allows the substantial variation in tax par-

ameters.    The dividend tax rate has varied between .15       and

.58   during the period while the corporate rate has varied

between     .18 and .70.   Extending the equation back this far

necessitates some crudeness in the calcualtion of Q, and forces

the use of annual data.      Since the focus here is on long

run issues, this is probably not too serious a problem.

      The calculation of the various components of Q is des-

cribed below.     A full listing of all the series is included

in the paper's data appendix.
                          -28-



     v ---   The stock market value of non-financial cor-

porations is estimated by capitalizing non-financial cor-

porate dividends using the Standard and Poor's dividend

yield.

     K       The capital stock K is taken to be the sum of

equipment, structures and inventories all valued at current
replacement cost. (10)

     B --- The present value of depreciation allowances is
estimated in several stages.     First, the value of the de-

preciable capital stock, KDEP is calculated using the per-

petual inventory method, and annual data an investment and

tax depreciation.    Second, the tax depreciation rate is es-

timated as the ratio of tax depreciation to KDEP.              Third, B

is calculated from equation (lSb) assuming static expecta-

tions about the corporate tax rate, a constant value of p=

     b --- The fraction of investment which is debt financed

is assumed to equal the ratio of the market value of out-

standing debt to the capital stock.        The market value of

debt is estimated by capitalizing net interest payments at
the BAA interest rate. (12)



(10) The data on capital stocks, stock market values, and
     market value of debt are taken from Holland and Myers
     (1979) .

     C --- It is difficult to measure the effective capital

gains tax rate because of the problems inherent in estimating

the effects of deferral and the absence of constructive rea1-

ization at death.   Following Bailey (1969) we assume that each

of these factors halves the effective rate.      From 1932-1969,

the statutory rate on capital gains was half the rate on div-

idends.   Hence for this period the capital gains rate' was

estimated at 12.5% of the average marginal dividend tax rate.:{.13}

For the 1969-1978 period, the effect of the 1969 capital gains

reforms is proxied by assuming that the capital gains rate

is 50% higher or 18.75% of the dividend rate. (14)



     find expected inflation in year t,an ARMA (1, 1) process
     is fitted to the previous 20 years'data. Expected
     inflation is then a 10 year disoounted average of the forecasts
     of the future inflation rates. The discount rate is .08.
     The calculation is performed using the consumer price
     index.

(12) This procedure would only be strictly appropriate if all
     bonds were conso1s. Comparing the resu1ts~ with those
     of Von Furstenberg's (1977) more careful adjustment
     suggests that the error is not likely to be large.

(13) The construction of this series is discussed below.

(14) These reforms included the minimum tax, maximum tax,
     and special provisions relating to preference income.
     The estimate that these reforms raised effective rates
     by about 50 percent is derived from the NBER TAXSIM
     model.

      o
     e ---    The marginal tax rate on dividends is estimated

as a weighted average of individual marginal rates with

weights equal to the share of dividends going to taxpayers
                                  1S
in each marginal rate c1ass.           Because of data limitations,

no account is taken of equity owned outside the household

sector.

     ITC --- The effective rate of the investment tax credit

is the statutory rate, as adjusted by ORI to reflect the

effects of eligibility rules, times the share of investment

devoted to equipment.

     Z --- The present value of future depreciation allowances

on a dollar's investment is calculated on the basis of tax

lifetime and depreciation methods reported by ORI.         Static

expectations about future corporate tax rates are assumed.

     ~    --- The corporate tax rate is the maximum statutory

marginal tax rate on corporate income.

     The estimated values of Q are shown in Table 1 along

with estimated values of q as normally calculated.         The most

striking feature of the table is the pronounced drop in q

over the fifty year period.       The value of q actually peaked

in 1937.     Tax factors can account for a large part of this

decline.     Rising dividend and corporate tax rates have

reduced equilibrium market values.         Indeed, such factors

would lead one to predict a drop of about 30 percent in q



(lS) The series are taken with adjustments from Wright (1969)
     and Brinner and Brooks (1979).

between 1932 and 1978.                Taxes also account for another

apparent anomaly in the data.                   Despite the fact that many

assets of firms, such as intangibles, are excluded from

the denominator of the q ratio, it appears that q averages

sUbstantially less than 1, and positive investment takes

place.     In contrast, the tax adjusted variable Q is greater

than the investment threshold of zero in every year except

1932. (16)     Indeed, viewed in terms of Q it appears that on

average, the market if anything overvalues corporate assets.

           Table 2 presents estimates of simple investment

functions using Q and q as explanatory variables.                      The

dependent variable is defined as the change in the net capital

stock plus depreciation divided by the value of the beginning

of year capital stock.                Before examining the results, it is

necessary to make several comments on the estimation.

First, the estimates here are not intended to provide

the best possible fit of actual investment behavior during

the sample period.             They undoubtedly could be improved by

adding additional variables reflecting business cycle

is unclear in this context.            As Engle and Foley emphasize,

theory suggests that most of the power in the relation be-

tween investment and Q is at low frequencies.               Shiller (1979)
has shown       that   there is substantial noise in share price

movements.      Transforming the data to correct for autocorrela-

tion places greater weight on the high frequencies and there-

justified by the theory, lagged Q's are included in the in-

vestment equations to take account of delivery lags and the

inevitable arbitrariness in the time when investment projects

show up in the national income accounts.

     The results provide mild evidence that tax adjustments

enhance the power of movements in market valuation in ex-

plaining investment.       Using ordinary least squares, q has the

wrong sign, while Q is marginally significant               with the right
sign. (19)

     These equations exhibit extreme serial correlation.

When an autocorrelation correction is made as in the third

and fourth equations, there is little to choose between the

two specifications.       The Q equation provides a marginally

better fit and exhibits somewhat less autocorrelation.



(18) This point is amplified in Sims (1972) . It is a variant
     in the frequently made observation that autocorrelation
     corrections exacerbate the errors in variables problems.

(19) Since OLS gives inconsistent estimates of the standard
     errors, not too much can be made of this observation.
                               -36-



Including lagged values raised the explanatory power of both
equations but does not alter their relative perfonnance.                  When
both concepts are entered together, the Q variable completely
dominates the unadjusted variable which becomes statistically
significant with the wrong sign.                    Alternative specifications
not shown here suggest that these results are not signif-
icantly affected by the inclusion of additional lags, time
trends, or the exclusion of the War years from the sample.
Estimates for the 1954-1978 period yield quite similar
results, though for this shorter period there is no basis

at all for choosing between the q and Q specifications.
     The parameter estimates are comparable to those suggested
by previous work.      The fifth equation suggests that

Since equation (27) implies that

                       K
the implied estimate is that a                10 percent increase in the value

of the stock market raises I                by about .008.      This result
                                        K
parallels closely to the implications of earlier studies.
These equations can be used to solve for the parameters

This is the equation used in the simulations reported

below.


     B. The Production Function

     It is assumed that production in the non-financial

corporate sector is Cobb-Douglas.          This assumption is borne

out by the approximate constancy of factor shares, and appears

to be consistent with the available empirical evidence. (21)

The share of capital in the output of the non-financial

corporate sector averaged .16 during the period 1970-1978.

This is taken to be the share of capital in the production

functions.


     C. Other Parameters

     The required after tax real return on equity is taken

to be .06.   This corresponds closely to the average pre-tax

real return of 8.4 percent    reported by Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1976)

for the period 1926-1976.       The real interest rate is taken

to be .02 which corresponds closely to the real BAA. yield over the same

period.   Following Feldstein and Summers (1978) it is

assumed that inflation raises interest rates point for point. (22)

The value of 6 is   estima~ed       at .067 from the data used in

estimating the investment equation.             The growth rate


(20 ) Cross sectional production function estimates generally
      suggest an elasticity of substitution of close to 1, while
      time series studies usually yield lower estimates. The
      relative merits of these approaches are assessed in Lucas
       (1969) •

(21) This assumption appears to fit the rent data, but need not
     be even approximately accurate in the presence of non-indexed
     taxes.
                               -38-



of effective labor,       y   is taken to be .03.
     The remaining parameters to be discussed characterize

the tax system.       Tax parameters are calculated as described

above and are       in the base case set equal to their 1978 values.

These are:    ~   = .48; ITC = .056;   eo =                  T
                                              .44; c = .083; 0    = .10.

In the simulations, one additional complication is introduced.

Inflation raises the effective tax rate on corporate capital

by taxing nominal inventory profits of firms using FIFO

accounting.       In 1978 when the rate of inflation was 7.4,

these profits      !represented 24.3 billion or.33 percent of

non-financial corporate output per point of inflation.             It

is assumed in the simulations that each point of inflation

raises the corporate tax base by this fraction of corporate

output.

     At this point, the effects of tax and inflation changes

can be studied.       The system of equations (22) and (23) can be

solved numerica1ly(23) to find the path of investment and

the stock market.       This is done in the next section.        Table

3 characterizes then no inflation steady state of the model

under the assumptions made here.         This steady state appears

to afford a reasonable benchmark for studying tax changes.

The pre-tax marginal product of capital is .147.         Netof



(22) The model is
                  solved using the mUltiple shooting algorithm
     described in Lipton, et al. (1980).
                         -39-


steady state aadjustment costs the pre-tax rate of profit

is .134.   While this number is somewhat higher than standard

estimates of the rate of profit, this reflects the fact that

land is omitted from consideration here.    Adjustment costs

are estimated to comprise 9 percent of gross profit. It

is difficult to evaluate this assumption since adjustment

costs are not directly observable. (24)    If adjustment costs

are neglected, estimates of the effects of tax changes are

altered only slightly.   The effective tax rate on corporate

source income is fairly close to the value that was observed

prior to the period of rapid inflation.    Finally, the earnings

price ratio and dividend yield appear to be reasonable.     In

any event experimentation suggested that the estimated im-

pacts of tax changes were not very sensitive to the initial

choice of parameters.



(24) The· level of investment does enter with a significant
     negative sign in standard cyclical profit equations
     of the type estimated by Feldstein and Summers (1977).

v.      INFLATION EFFECTS



              In this section, the model of investment and

market valuation described in the preceeding section is

used to evaluate the impact of inflation on the non-financial

corporate sector.      Four separate non-neutralities of the
                                                    25
tax system lead to real effects of inflation.            First,

historical cost depreciation causes inflation to raise the

effective corporate tax rate.         It is important to note

that the understatement of depreciation for tax purposes

depends on the entire history of the inflation rate not just

on its current level.       In 1977, historic cost depreciation

raised corporate tax liabilities by $19.1 billion or 32.4

percent of actual tax liabilities.         Second, firms which use

FIFO inventory accounting incur extra tax liabilities an their
                               26
nominal inventory profits.           The size of this effect varies

with the inflation rate.       In 1977, tax liabilities were




( 25)
         These non-neutralities are discussed in more detail in
         Summers (1980b). Evidence of their aggregate importance
         can be found in Feldstein und Summers (1979).
(26)
         Although the extra taxes due to FIFO accounting are in a
         sense voluntary, managements presumably pay these taxes
         because they believe that there would be greater costs of
         some other kind if they used LIFO and reported lower
         profits. As long as firms pay higher taxes based on FIFO
         accountin~ these taxes do affect investment decisions.
                           -42-




increased by $7 billion or 12.1 percent of actual tax liabili-

ties.     By 1979, this had risen to    $19 billion   or 27   percent

of tax liabilities.     Third, firms are permitted to deduct

nominal rather than real interest payments for tax purposes.

Equivalently stated, they are not taxed on the capital gain which

they realize as inflation erodes the value of their outstand-

ing debt.    This offsets the effects of historic cost deprecia-

tion and nominal inventory accounting and reduces. the tax

burden on corporate capital by 26.4 percent in 1977!27) Fourth,

the taxation of nominalJ:T.ather than           real capital gains

leads to an increase in the pre-tax real return on equity

demanded by investors.     This effect is potentially very large.

Nominal capital gains     on      corporate capital stock totalled

$112 billion in 1977, implying an extra tax liability of about
$10 billion. (28)

            On balance, these effects imply that inflation

substantially increases the effective tax rate on corporate

equity.     Feldstein (1979a) has suggested that this could




(27)
        This discussion and calcualtion ignore the one-time capital
        gains firms realize on the revaluation of their long term
        debt when the inflation rate rises. Summers (1980b) shows
        that this effect can be very substantial for some firms.
(28)
        This effect is masked by the downwards recapitalization
        of the market caused by unexpected increases in the rate
        of inflation.
                           -43-




provide an explanation for the observed decline in the stock

market.    This conclusion has been challenged by Hendershott

(1979), Fama (1979) and Modigliani and Cohn (1974).      None of

these analyses have taken account of the endogneity of capital

accumulation and its impact on market valuation.      Nor have

they recognized that taxes complicate the determination of the

long run relationship between market valuation and the replace-

ment cost of the capital stock.      Only Feldstein considers the

implications of his     analysis for the long run growth of the

corporate sector.     He does not however consider the nature of

the adjustment path after an inflation shock.

            Before turning to the results one qualification must

be stressed.     The assumption is maintained throughout that

inflation has no impact on the rate of return required by

equity owners.    This assumption is open to question. (29)      Many

observers have argued that inflation reduces real after tax

interest rates and so should also be assumed to reduce requirec

after tax returns on equity.      .This argument presumes that




( 29)
        The arguments of Hendershott (1979), Gordon and Malkie1
        (1979), and Modig1ian and Cohn (1979) that inflation
        should not discourage investment are based on the assump-
        tion that it reduces the real return on other assets
        particularly bonds.
                          -44-




inflation has no effect on the equity risk premium and that

bonds are the relevant alternative asset.    If the alternatives

to holding equity, include tax sheltered fonns   of saving such

as owner     occupied housing, this assumption is inappropriate.

Further, there is theoretical reason to believe that in the

very long run inflation should raise real interest rates. (30)

            The effect of inflation on market valuation and

investment is gauged by simulating the effects of an unexpected

permanent increase from 0 to 8 percent in the rate of inflation.

The paths of the variables of interest are shown in Table 4.

All variables are measured as percentage changes from the

benchmark    steady state values displayed in Table 3.   The

results indicate that inflation can have very large effects on

capital accumulation in the corporate sector.    The immediate

effect of the 8 percent inflation shock is to reduce the value

of the stock market by 22.7 percent.    This is associated with

a 16.8 percent reduction in the rate of investment.

            As the capital output ratio declines, raising the

pre-tax marginal product of capital, the stock market tends to

rise relative to the replacement cost of the capital stock.




(30)   Summers (1980) suggests that this will take place in
       almost any plausible model with non-indexed taxes on
       capit;al income.

In the long run the 8 percent rate of inflation reduces the

capital stock by 34.4 percent and the value of the stock

market by 36 percent.   The transition is quite slow.as only

three quarters of the ultimate adjustment of the capital

stock takes place within 20 years.     The impact of inflation

on the rate of investment actually increases over time

reflecting the reduced need for replacement investment as

the capital stock contracts.

        These results suggests that inflation can account for

a large part of the decline in the stock market and investment

which has occurred during the last decade.     After 10 years of

8 percent inflation, the stock market is almost 30 percent
lower in real terms than it would have been in the absence

of inflation.   The 22 percent decline in gross investment

indicated by the simulation is somewhat larger than the decline

which has actually occurred.     This probably reflects the

increases in the investment tax credit, and the acceleration

of tax depreciation which have   ~     place during the 1970's!3l)

As shown in the next section, these measures are a significant

spur   to investment, but are not likely to significantly increase

stock market values.




(31)
       The investment tax credit was suspended at the beginning
       of the decade and applied at a 9 percent rate in 1979.
       The ADR system introduced in 1971 has shortened deprecia-
       tion lifetimes by about 20 percent.
                           -47-




          The results in Table 4 suggest that 8 percent infla-

tion slows the rate of growth of the capital stock by about

1.1 percent a year for the first decade.     The production

function used here implied that this leads to a decline of

about.2 percent a year in the rate of growth of productivity.

The long run impact of inflation according to these calculations

is to reduce corporate sector output and wages by about 6

percent below the level that would have been reached in the

absence of inflation.     This is a quite substantial effect.    It

implies that if inflation continues at current ratio until the

year 2000, per-capita output of the corporate sector in that year will

be reduced by $420 a year below its no inflation level.

          These results suggest that inflation has substantial

effects on market valuation and investments.      It is frequently

proposed that these non-neutralities be remedied through

indexation of the tax system.      The effects of inflation on

the stock market and investment under various partial indexing

schemes     is shown in Table S.   As well as illustrating the

effects of indexing, the Table make it possible to examine the

relative importance of the various distortions associated

with inflation.     Full indexing leaves the tax system completely

neutral, so it is not shown in the Table.

          Indexing depreciation allowances and inventory accounting

while doing nothing about the profits firms realize on their
                           -48-




outstanding debt would lead to a situation where inflation

significantly encouraged investment.         Under such indexing

rules, an 8percent increase in the expected rate of inflation

would raise the stock market by 10 percent.         This is because
the non-neutrality     associated with the deduction of nominal

interest payments is greater than the distortion due to the

taxation of capital gains.        These results imply that indexing

depreciation allowances would reduce the equilibrium ratio of

the stock market values to the replacement cost of the capital

stock.   This is because indexation raises the value of

reducing the effective price of new capital goods.

         The effects of full indexing at the corporate level are

shown in column (2).     The remaining distortion, the taxation

of nominal capital gains, leads a reduction in the stock market

and capital formation.            The   capital gains distortion alone is

sufficient to cause 8 percent inflation to reduce the steady

state capital, stock by over 11 percent.        Thus the taxation of

nominal capital gains is responsible for about one-third of

the total reduction in capital accumulation caused by inflation.

         Indexation at the individual level but not at the corporate

level is considered in the third column of the Table.          The

results show that corporate tax non-neutralities are responsible

for a large fraction of inflation's impact on capital formation.

They show clearly that contrary to assertions made by some
                          -49-




authors, the effect of inflation on inventory profits and

depreciation allowances more than offsets the deductibility

of nominal interest payments.    This is because the analysis

here takes explicit account of the growth in the understatement

of depreciation allowances which accompanies prolonged inflation.

       Space does not permit a detailed discussion of the robust-

ness of these results to changes in the assumptions about the

underlying parameters.    The qualitative results and long run

estimates are almost completely unaffected by plausible changes

in the parameters.    Reductions in the assumed elasticity of

substittltion reduce the sensitivity of tre steady state capital

stock to inflation.   Plausible changes in the adjustment cost

function alter the size of the initial jump in the stock

market and the speed of adjustment, but the effects are not

very large.

VI. ALTERNATIVE TAX REFORMS



     This section begins by considering the impact of the

investment tax credit, since this issue has been a focus of

previous work.   Standard single equation approaches to the

investment function have yielded divergent results.    In perhaps

the most widely cited study, Hall and Jorgenson (1971) conclude

that the investment tax credit has a potent impact, which

reaches its peak after about 3 years.    They estimated that the

7 percent creditonequiptment enacted in 1962 raised the 1970

capital stock by about 4 percent above the level it would have

reached in the absence of the credit.    Other estimates

typically suggest much smaller estimates of the effect of the

credit.   None of the estimates takes explicit account of the

possibly temporary nature of changes in the level of the credit.

     In Table 6 the effects of     alternative tax credit

policies are considered.   The first column considers the effects

of a correctly perceived permanent removal of the credit.     The

results indicate that the credit has potent effects on invest-

ment, even though it has only a small impact on market valuation

in the short run. (32)   Its immediate effect is to reduce

investment by about 6 percent, and it decreases the capital stock

by 8.9 percent in the long run.   The estimated response is



(32) This illustrates the point made in Section III, that changes
     in unadjusted q may be a poor guide to investment incentives.

much more gradual than that predicted by standard investment

equations.    The effect on invesment declines between the

first and second years and then rises steadily as the reduced

capital stock requires less replacement investment.

Since the change considered here is the removal of 9 percent

investment credit, these results indicate a slightly larger

effect than those of Hall and Jorgenson, and a much larger

effect than that found in most other studies.

      The right-hand half of the table considers the impact

of a temporary removal of the ITC.     Such a measure leads to

a sharp decrease in investment during the suspension period.

This leads to an increase in net investment after the suspension

is removed.     Gross investment does not increase because the

lower capital stock requires less replacement investment.

Note that the catch up following the restoration of the credit

is very slow.    Two thirds of the gap caused by the suspension

in the capital stock remains 15 years later.     These results

show the importance of adjustment costs.     In the absence of

any adjustment costs, one would expect to see substantial

disinvestment    during the period of the suspension.   Because

the   adjustment costs of returning to the steady state capital

stock would be high, this does not take place.     These sim-

ulations suggest that a countercyclical investment credit

might not be destabilizing.    Adjustment costs are sufficiently

large to negate substantial anticipatory effects.
                            -54-




       The effects of reductions in the corporate tax rate

are examined in Table 7.     An immediate rate reduction from

.48 to .40 is contrasted with an announcement that in year 4,

such a tax cut will take place.     Both measures are equivalent

in the long run, and raise the steady state capital stock by

15.7 percent.     They increase the long run value of the stock

market significantly more because the reduced corporate tax

raises the effective price of new capital goods by diminishing

the value of accelerated depreciation and the expanding

of adjustment costs.

       The simulations show that the announcement policy has

a significantly greater short run impact on investment than

the immediate implementation policy.     The former raises the

capital stock by 3 percent after 3 years compared with 2 percent

for the latter.     This occurs even though the immediate implemen-

tation policy has a greater immediate impact on the capital

stock.    The reason again is the effects of accelerated deprecia-

tion     and the expanding of adjustment costs.   Firms find it

optimal to accelerate their investment plans to take account

of the lower effective price of capital goods which prevails

before the tax reduction actually takes place.     This implies

that if the goal of the corporate rate reduction is to increase

capital formation, the measure should be announced     well in

advance of its enactment.     Similar considerations suggest

that a temporary increase in the corporate tax rate would

actually spur investment.

     The effects of reforms in the individual tax system are

considered in Table 8.     Eliminating capital gains taxes would

raise the stock market by 7.3 percent in the short run.

Because it would increase the advantages to the firm of

retaining earnings, the impact on investment is substantially

greater.     Its long run effect would be to raise the capital

stock by 29.5 percent.     The transition is however very

gradual with only half the adjustment occurring within the

first decade.     Comparison of Table 8 with Table 5 suggests

that a significant part of the effect of capital gains taxes

takes place because of inflation.

     The second reform considered is an announcem"ent that

in year 4, the dividend tax will be eliminated.     This corres-

ponds to an extreme form of partial integration of the corporate

income tax.     As explained in Section III, changes in the dividend

tax rate have no effect on steady state capital intensity.

The announcement that a dividend tax reduction will occur

however gives firms a very large incentive to defer paying of

dividends.    This is done by accelerating investment.      The

simulations suggest that the announcement effect raises invest-

ment by 40.5 percent.

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS



     This paper has developed and applied a market

valuation approach to evaluating investment incentives.        The

results demonstrate that tax and monetary policies have

large effects on the stock market and investment.     The non-

indexed character of our tax system causes inflation to have

strong impact on market valuation and investment.     Indeed, it

appears that inflation can account for a large fraction of the

decline in the stock market and investment which occurred

during the 1970's.     Reducing the rate of inflation would do

more to increase capital formation than even quite substantial

changes in the tax law.     However the results do strongly

suggest that tax policies have quite significant effects on

capital formation.     The market valuation approach implies

that the lagged response of investment to tax changes is quite

pronounced.   Only half of the response to shocks takes place

within a decade.     This may explain why the estimates   reported

here imply much larger long run effects of tax policies than

previous studies which have focused on a shorter horizon.

     There are several directions in which the analysis in

this paper could be usefully extended.     Probably the most
                                -59-




    important would be placing the model of investment developed

    here in a general equilibrium context.         Since the corporate

    sector represents a substantial fraction of the economy,

    measures which affect it will impact on investors' required

    rate of return.     Feldstein and Summers (1977) estimate that

    tax changes which raise the interest rate firms can afford

    to pay on given investment projects 1 percent, increase the

    actual interest rate by ,25 percent.   Summers (1980c) examines

    the steady state properties of a general equilibrium model

    with three assests, corporate      capita~   owner occupied housing

    and land.     The findings suggest that taking account of general

    equilibrium effects would reduce somewhat the partial equili-

    brium estimates of tax effects reported here.         Appropriate

    government monetary polic ies could be directed at keeping

    the required real return constant if it were considered desir-

    able to achieve the full partial equilibrium effect of tax changes.

              A second important direction for future research is

    the implications of uncertainty.       A more satisfactory treat-

    ment of uncertainty would make it possible to model the deter-

    minants of corporate financial policy and the required risk

    premium      on equity.   By introducing a diversification motive,
.   an explicit treatment of uncertainty would make it possible

    to meaningfully model the heterogeneo.us tax rates faced by different

    investors.     It is difficult to predict how the introduction

    of uncertainty would alter the conclusions reached here.            The
                              -60-




principal new feature would be a risk sharing effect of

taxation which might tend to encourage investment.

          The empirical approach described here is potentially

applicable to a wide variety of problems.             Poterba (1980)

has used a similar model to evaluate the impact of inflation

on the market for    ~eroccupied     housing.       The approach could

also be applied to modelling the effects of shocks on invest-

ment in different industries for a different regions. (33)

With some adaptation the market valuation approach could be

used to evaluate a wide variety of shocks, including regulatory

on observable market valuations and consistancy with rational

        by von Furstenberg, Malkiel, and Watson (1980) could
        be utilized for this purpose. Summers (1980b) shows
        that inflation shocks are likely to have divergent effects
        on industry "q"s.

        This apprach is being used by Poterba and Summers (1980)
        to evaluate the effects of local property tax changes.
