                      Annuity Prices and Saving Behavior
                             in the United States


                                     ABSTRACT



            The observed reluctance of most individuals in the United States

to buy individual life annuities, and the Concomitant approximately flat

average age—wealth profile, stand in sharp contradiction to the standard

life cycle      model of consumption-saving behavior. The analysis in this

paper      lends support to an   explanation for this phenomenon based on the

interaction      of an intentional bequest motive and              annuity   prices that are
not actuarially        fair.
           Premiums charged for individual          life    annuities in the United States
include a load factor of 32-48 per            dollar,       or l8—33 per dollar after
allowing for adverse selection, in comparison to actuarially fair annuity
values.       Load factors of this   size     are   not   out of line with those on other
familiar (and almost       universally   purchased) insurance products. Simulations
of an extended model of life cycle saving and                 portfolio     behavior, allowing
explicitly for        uncertain lifetimes and Social Security, show that the load

factor charged        would have to be far larger than this to account for the

observed     behavior in the   absence   of   a bequest motive. By contrast, the

combination      of a load factor in this range and a positive bequest motive can
do so for some plausible values of the assumed underlying parameters. Moreover,

if this combination of factors is leading elderly individuals to avoid

purchasing life annuities, it implies a typical bequest that is fairly large

in comparison to their consumption.

         ANNUI   PRICES AND SAVING BEHAVIOR IN THE UNITED STATES


                Benjamin M. Friedman and Mark Warshawsky*



       One of the most puzzling contrasts between observed behavior and

the implications of standard economic theory is the fact that, at least in

the United States, few elderly individuals purchase life annuities. The

conventional life—cycle model, based on the appealing concept that people

save so as to smooth their consumption over their lifetimes, suggests that

elderly retired individuals would seek to dissave out of their available

resources as their remaining life expectancy shortens. Instead, observed

age-wealth profiles among the elderly are more nearly flat.1 Given the

uncertainty associated with any individual's life expectancy, this

reluctance to dissave would be a natural consequence of risk aversion if

individuals could not avoid that risk by buying annuities. Since a

well-developed individual life annuity market does exist in the United

States, however, the challenge is to explain why so few people actually

avail themselves of it.2

       In an earlier paper, the authors offered an explanation for this

phenomenon based on a combination of the cost of annuities and a bequest

motive.3 Annuities are costly, in the first instance, because the insurer

must price them to defray ordinary costs of doing business and then earn a

competitive profit. In addition, the typical individual in the population

finds annuities even more costly because of adverse selection — in other

words, the tendency of longer—lived people to buy more annuities than

people facing shorter life expectancies. Both kinds of costs understandably

discourage the purchase of individual life annuities, within the context
                                       —2—




of the familiar life—cycle model. By contrast, if individuals choose not

to buy annuities because they have accumulated wealth to leave to their

heirs, rather than to finance their own consumption after retirement, then

the life-cycle model — and with it, a variety of well known implications

for economic behavior and economic policy — fails to withstand scrutiny.

The principal finding of the authors' earlier research was that during

the early years of retirement the observed cost of annuities can

independently account for the absence of purchases of individual life

annuities, while at older ages the combination of the observed costs of

annuities and a bequest motive of plausible magnitude can do so.

        The   object of this paper is to experiment with an alternative form
of   the authors' earlier   analysis by representing the cost of annuities as
the   (positive) differential between the premium on an annuity and its

implicit expected value, rather than as the (negative) differential between
the implicit expected yield on an annnity and the available yield on
alternative forms of wealth holding. Given the inverse relationship between
price and yield for any fixed-income invesnent vehicle, in principle
these two forms of analysis are simply the duals of one another. The difference

here stems from the need    to compromise with reality in order to investigate

the implications of life annuities within the context of a readily

tractable model of the consumption—saving and portfolio—allocation decisions.

In effect, the analysis both here and in the authors' earlier paper

represents these annuities as if they were one—year contracts. Here,

however, the analysis represents the cost of annuities as a one—time

proportional charge to enter a market in which actuarially fair annuities are

available, while in the earlier paper this cost consists of a continual

unfairness in the pricing of the (one—year) annuity contracts. One
                                          —3—




 advantage of the approach taken here is that, because large short—sales of

 annuities are no longer optimal, the nonnegativity constraint that

 was necessary in the earlier paper is no longer required. Because these

 formulations of the problem imply alternative opportunity sets, the

 results given by the two    approaches   differ.

         Section I presents raw data on the prices of individual life annuities

 sold in the United States during 1968-83, together with transformations

 of these data that correspond to familiar concepts in economic discussions

of consumption-saving behavior. Section II reviews the model of consumption—

saving   and portfolio—allocation behavior,     for an individual with uncertain

lifetimes,   developed in the authors' earlier paper. Section III uses
simulations of   this   model, based on the observed pricing of   annuities to
drawinferences about the respective roles of annuity costs and a bequest
motive in accounting for the typical elderly retired individual 's preference
for maintaining a flat age-wealth profile instead of buying annuities. Section
IV briefly summarizes the paper's principal findings, and re—emphasizes some
limitations that apply to the analysis here as      well as to the authors earlier
work.

I. Prices of Individual Life annuities
       Table 1   presents   data for 1968—83, coni1ed from successive annual
issues of the A.M. Best Flitcraft Coutpend, on the per—dollar prices of
guaranteed single-premium immediate annuities offered in the United
States for 65—year—old males. In each case the value shown is the price
(premium) charged to purchase a stream of payments equalling $1 per nDnth,
to begin in the nth iediately following the purchase and continue for the
life of the annuitant.
       The first column of Table 1 indicates the nan premium charged on
this basic annuity contract by the ten largest insurance coanies in the
United States. These data are probably the mrst relevant for analyzing
economy-wide individual behavior. The largest insurers usually do business
in all regions of the country, so that the typical 65 -year-old U.S. male
has access to annuities at this mean price with little or no search costs.
is would be expected, the average annuity premium has fallen over tim,
as the effect of rising interest rates has predeminated over the effect of
increasing life expectancy.
       The remaining columns of Table 1 indicate the potential returns to
market search by showing the dispersion of premiums charged for this same
basic contract by different insurers .       The   second and third columns show
data for the highest and lowest premiums charged for this contract by any
of the ten largest insurers. Presumably most 65—year—old males have access
to the 1est premium in this groi at only ndest search cost. The final

column of the table shows the lowest premium charged for this contract by any
of the fifty—odd insurers in BestLs saxL1e. Because the smaller couanies
in the sanle do not necessarily maintain sales forces in all parts of the
country, however, there is no presuntion that the typical 65—year-old male

has ready access to this complete—saile lowest premium.
          Table 2 presents calculations of the present expected value of an
immediate $1 monthly annuity for the life of a 65-year-old male. The two
key ingredients in such calculations, of course, are the assumed interest
rate and the assumed structure of mortality probabilities.5 The table
reports annual calculations of present expected value based on two different
interest rates, the 20—year U.S. Government bond yield and the average
yield on corporate debt directly placed with major life insurance conanies.
In the calculations underlying the first two columns of the table, the
assumed mortality probabilities are the general population mortality
probabilities for 65-year-old males reported in the 1970 and 1980 U.S.
Life Tables, adjusted by a factor of • 985 to reflect the 1.5% annual
irovement in U.S. male mortality probabilities that has occurred over
the last two decades, and by a further factor of .9925 to reflect the
asstion of a future 0.75% annual irovement in male mortality probabilities
for   all ages. 6
         Which of the two interest rates used in Table 2 is most relevant
depends on the perspective taken in the analysis. From the standpoint of
the actuarial "fair" value to an insurer who has access to (and
typically owns), direct placement securities, the associated hier yield is
the correct one to choose. Alternatively, from the standpoint of an
individual's opportunity cost of funds, the lower yield on U.S. Government
bonds is relevant if   the individual has no better investment vehicle.
Because direct placements bear higher yields than do Government bonds, the

present   expected values calculated using this yield are smaller than the
corresponding values calculated using the Government bond yield. Nevertheless,
the present expected values calculated on either basis, including the

Government bond yield, are always smaller than even the lowest preiniuni
charged in the same year by any insurer in Best"s sample.
          If all individuals had identical mortality probabilities, a
comparison between the calculated present expected values shown              in   the
first two columns of Table 2 and the actual premiums shown in Table 1
would indicate the "load factor" by which the pricing of these annuities
differs from their fair actuarial value. In fact, many individuals have
information that leads them to expect either a shorter or a longer life
than the population-wide average. Insurers, however, typically charge a
uniform premium to all individuals of the same age and sex, presumably
because                               mortality probabilities is either
           information about individual

impossible or too costly to obtain and use. Individuals expecting longer
 (shorter) than average lifespans will therefore perceive life annuities

as more (less) attractively priced, and          hence will   be more (less)      likely to
buy them.7      This adverse    selection — adverse    from   the viewpoint of the
insurer, that is — will        lead   to underwriting losses if the insurer continues
to   charge a premium that      is actuariafly   fair to the population as a whole.
          The   final two   columns of Table 2   therefore present the results of

further annual calculation       of   the present expected value of the same basic
annuity contract for a 65—year-old male, based on the same            two   interest rates
as   before, but now based on alternative mortality probabilities compiled from
the actual company experience on individual life annuity contracts issued
in the United States during 1971-75, again adjusted as indicated above to
reflect the improvement in mortality probabilities.8 Figure 1 indicates

the extent to which the sub—population who choose to buy annuities in fact

have a greater survival probability than the general population. Because

of this greater life expectancy, the present expected values shown in the

last   two columns   are   greater than the corresponding values shown in the

table's first and second columns, respectively, based on the same two

interest   rates but on general population mortality probabilities. Even

the greater values resulting from the actual company experience mortality

probabilities, however, are still uniformly smaller than even the lowest

corresponding   premiums shown in Table 1. Even within the sub—population who
voluntarily buy annuities, therefore, the price is not actuarially fair.
         Table 3 summarizes the differences between the actual premiums
charged on this basic annuity contract and the corresponding actuarially
fair values by showing the 1968-8 3 average of the ratio of premium charged
to present expected value, for each of the four premiums reported in Table 1
and each of the four present expected value calculations reported in Table 2.
The resulting average load factors range from a low of 1.06 for the smallest
premium charged by any cottany in Best' s sa1e, compared to the present
expected value based on Government bond yields and actual coIany experience
mortality probabilities, to a high of 1.55 for the largest premium charged
by any of the ten largest insurers, compared to the present expected value
based on direct placement yields and general population mortality tables.
        The comparisons in Table 3 that are probably most relevant for studying
economy—wide individual behavior are those shown in the first row for the mean
premium charged by the ten largest insurers versus the present expected value
based on either Government bond yields or direct placement yields, and on
either general population or company experience mortality probabilities.
The load factor of 1.32 for the first case considered means that a 65—year—old
U.S. male, randomly selected from that population, and for whom the Government
bond yield represents the opportunity cost of capital, typically pays
$1.32 for each $1.00 of expected present value when he purchases a life annuity.

2½xnong   the (on average longer-lived) sub-population of 65-year-old U.S.

males who actually choose to buy life annuities, the load factor based on

the same    opportunity cost is only 1.18.    In other words, of the   32c per

dollar    load factor to the general population, 14 represents the effect
of adverse selection and the remaining l8 the combination of transactions
costs, taxes and profit to the insurer. If the annuity purchaser's
opportunity cost of capital is instead the direct placement yield — for
example, because of ability to buy shares in packages of intermediated
private securities — then the load faôtor per dollar of expected present
value is 48, of which 15' represents the effect of adverse selection
and the remaining 33 the insurer' s co st.s, taxes and profit . As the
Appendix Table shows, these results for 65 year-old males are similar to
those for females, or for males of different ages.
          The question for cons tion—saving behavior, then, is whether an
average load factor of 1.18 (or even 1.48) is sufficient to account for
the smell participation in the individual life annuity market in the
United States. In short, do most elderly retired      people choose not to

consume out of their wealth, arid therefore leave unintentional bequests,
merely because they are reluctant to pay $1.18 (or $1.48) for every $1.O.O.
of present expected value of annuities?
       It is difficult to answer this question on the basis of casual evidence
only. At first thought, a load factor of this magnitude seems a large price
to pay for pooling risk. Nevertheless,, it is not out of line with
loads charged elsewhere in the insurance business, in product lines that
alxst everyone buys. For exa1e, data from Best's Key Rating Guide:
Property—Casualty indicate that the recent average load factor in premiums
charged for property and casualty insurance written by large coiranies has
been 1.37 —essentially the same as that on individual life annuities.
                                        —9—




         Moreover, despite the apparently large load factor, individual

life annuities are not a "dominated asset" in the sense that the cost

per unit of pay-off, unadjusted for mortality probabilities, is

greater than the analogous cost of alternative investment vehicles.

Table 4 shows the present value of a 35-year certain $1 monthly annuity,

calculated using the two interest rates used in Tables 1 and 2, respectively,

for each year during l968_83.10 As comparison to the first column of Table

1 shows, the value of the certain annuity based on the government bond

yield exceeded the mean premium on the life annuity charged by the ten

largest insurers in all years of the sample except 1980-82, while the value

based  on the direct placement yield exceeded the mean premium in all years
until 1979.
         Hence some more formal approach to this issue is necessary. Section
II   develops   a framework for such an analysis, and Section III   applies   that
framework in the context of the premium and load factor data reported here.

II. A Model of Saving and Annuity Demand11

         The model used in Friedman and Warshawsky (1985) to analyze

the demand for individual life annuities in the context of life-cycle

saving and a bequest motive is an annuity analog of Fischer's (1973)

model of the demand for life insurance, generalized to incorporate fixed

mandatory holdings of socially provided annuities.'2 The individual's

decision problem in this expanded life—cycle context is to maximize

expected   lifetime utility
         w-x-1
E(U)             [PtUt(ct) +                                                            (1)

where   w is the     assumed maximum length of life, x is the individual's age
as   of time   t=0   Pt iS      the   probability that     an   individual of age x at t=0

will be alive at any           time t>O,          is the (conditional) probability that

such an individual who was             alive at   time   t will die at time t+l.13
Ut(c) is utility received from consumption C at time t, and vt÷i(G+,)

is utility received from (anticipation of) a bequest G at time t+l.

Following Fischer, it is convenient to specify the two utility functions

in   the iso—elastic form

           cl_s
U(Ct) =              a                                                                  (2)




V(Gt) =              bt
where    is the Pratt—Arrow coefficient of relative risk aversion, a is the

time preference parameter, and b (in comparison to at) indicates the

relative utility attached to bequests left in period t.

        The usual life—cycle specification of behavior with no bequest motive

is therefore just        the   speical case of this model with bt=0 for all t>O.
                                               i. i—




In general, however, people may        value    bequests, and they may value them

differently at different times. The application of the model in Section III

below follows Yaari's suggestion that bt follows a hump-shaped pattern

with higher values during the years when family dependency is important,

so that bt is declining     during retirement years when children have
typically become     independent.

         The individual's problem is to maximize (1) subject to a given

initial wealth position and to a nonnegativity constraint on wealth in

each subsequent time period, given the menu of available investment

opportunities (including any mandatory holding of socially provided

annuities)      and their respective   yields 14 In          each period the individual

must   decide    not only how much of current wealth to consume but also how

to allocate the remainder among the available investment vehicles. The

specific asset menu considered here includes a riskless one—period bond

bearing gross rate of return Rt a one—period social annuity bearing gross

rate of return         to survivors, and a      one—period market annuity bearing
gross rate of return Q to survivors.15 Both annuities                    are actuarially

fair — that is, there is no load factor on either —                 if
                                                                                      (4)
             =
                  (l_1)Q = Rt.
With little relevant loss of generality, it is convenient to set Rt constant

at R for all t>O.

         The dynamic programming solution              to this problem proceeds from the
final   period t=w-x-l, in which the certainty of death at the end of the
                                                                     survived to
period           =1) simplifies the problem of an individual who has

that date to merely choosing C1 to maximize the sum of utility from

current consumption Ui(C_1) and utility from bequests V(G)
subject to then-remaining wealth W1 and the constraint

The consumption decision (5)          represents the entire solution for t=w—x—l,

since in that period the availability of annuities is irrelevant to the

analysis.

         The dynamic programming solution next proceeds to the individual's

optimal consumption and portfolio decisions for the immediately prior period,

given wealth remaining at that time. An individual alive at t=w-x-2 will

die at the end of that period with probability q1. Hence the relevant

maximand governing the decisions to be taken as of t=w-x-2 is U    (C

         The remainder of the dynamic programming solution proceeds backward

to the initial period t=O in an analogous way. The expressions for each

period's optimal consumption and             purchases   of market annuities, and for

each   period's value of the indirect utility function, are of the same
form   (but with subscripts adjusted accordingly) as (12),             (13) and (14),
respectively.

III.      Simulation          Results

           The model developed in Section II generates lifetime streams of

consuntion         and annuity purchase values that are optimal for given values of
parameters describing preferences (,                 ci.   and b), the market environment
     A     S
(R, Q and Q ), and mortality                        q). The principal
                                           probabilities (p and

focus of interest in this paper is on one aspect of preferences and one
aspect of the market environment — the bequest tive and the availability
of market annuities, respectively.
           The strategy adopted here for representing the bequest tive
(confronting a 65-year-old male) follows Fischer (1973) by assuming that
bt in (3) varies according to


bt =      (1.04   —
                          .Olt) '   0,   t=0,.. .,35                                               (17)



where 0 is a non-age—specific parameter indicating the individual's life-
long preference for bequests relative to current consumption, given the
other parameters of the model, including in particular the interest rate
(R), the curvature of the utility function (s),                    and   — because 0 implicitly

gives     the relative weight of a stock             (the   bequest) versus a flow

(consumption)
                          — the assumed   time   unit of analysis. For any given value
of   0,   however,         b declines    linearly with t.17 Given 0 and            the bequest

amount is larger as P is higher, and smaller as                       is higher. For example,

from (5)      —
                  (7) and (17), 0        takes the   value (Gwx/Cw_i)           (.69)/P, where


  w—X/Cw—x—1
(G                    )    is just the ratio of the final-period bequest to the prior-

period      consumption. The normally limiting case for altruistic bequests,
in which an individual provides for his heirs' consumption at the same

level as his own, indicates (l/R-1) 1.69)/P                      as   the logical upper bound on

l8         In the         simulations reported below, the strength of the bequest

motive is indicated initially by 0, and subsequently by the corresponding

bequest/saving ratio (G/Ci) given the other assumed parameters.

          The strategy used here to represent the market for private annuities

follows Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981) by assuming that private annuities are

either available at the actuarially fair price               =   R/(l—q),   or, alternatively,

not available at all (A=O).         The object of the analysis, therefore, is

to determine    what load    factor an individual would be willing to pay in order

to have   access    to market   annuities under the   assunEd     values of   all of

the   model's   other paranters. By coraring this critical load factor

with the typical load factors summarized in Table 3, in light of the
observation that in fact only few individuals actually purchase life
annuities, it is then possible to assess the reasonableness of the assumed
values of the model's other parameters — including, in particular, the
strength of the bequest motive.
          This treatment of the cost of annuities captures the chief implications
of the fact that, although the model in principle refers to one—period
annuities, in fact the annuities available for purchase are life annuities.
Even when an individual makes monthly annuity purchases over time,
as in many defined contribution retirement plans, what he is buying each
month is an additional life annuity. It is therefore plausible to treat
the   load factors or annuity premiums shown in Table 3 in a lump-sum
fashion, not as a load to be repeated in every period.
          The simplest place to begin is the special case of the model
developed in Section II corresponding to the standard life cycle model
with neither bequest motive nor Social Security (which is equivalent to the
model in   Kotlikoff and Spivak).      Table 5    sunixnarizes   the results of two
simulations of the model, lxth based on the assumptions              that   bt=O and
       for all t.    As   in Kotlikoff and Spivak's work, the assumed time

preference parameter is c=.99,      and   the assumed market interest rate is

constant at R=l.01. The assumed       coefficient     of relative risk aversion is

=4l9 The assumed mortality probabilities             are   those   for a 65-year--old male

reported in the 1980 U.S. Life      Tables,   adjusted as described in Section I.

Fbr   each   simulation, Table 5 shows the relevant solution values for the initial

year   (age 65) and every fifth year thereafter        until   the assumed maximum
life span (age 110).
         The first simulation considered within this traditional life cycle
context represents the case in which market annuities (like social annuities
here) are unavailable. The individual' s only choice is therefore how much
to cons in each period, since the unconsumed portion of initial wealth
is autotically invested in one-year bonds. The first column of Table S
shows the opt iir1   age—cons   ution profile,      while the second column shows

the corresponding i1ied profile of remaining wealth (consisting entirely
of bonds), with both sets of values stated as percentages of initial
wealth. These simulated values ilNnediately indicate the important
contrast between reality and the      model' s    assumptions, in that they show the
optility of a declining age—consuixtion profile and a sharply declining
age—wealth profile — phenomena not observed in available dáta.
        The second simulation within this traditional life cycle context,
sinnmrized in the remaining columns of Table 5, shows that simply relaxing
the assumption that market annuities are unavailable avoids this strikingly
counterfactual result only at the expense of leading to another. This
simulation differs from the first one in assuming that individual life
annuities are available in the private market at an actuarially fair price
(QA=p/(1_q)) and the table reports values for optimal consumption as well
as optimal wealth holdings in bonds and annuities,respectively.2° In this
case, the individual's optimal course of action is to hold no bonds at all
                                               —18—



 but   to stabilize the age-consumption profile almost completely by investing

 all wealth in annuities. The implied flat age—consumption profile is

 roughly consistent with the available evidence, but the implied large demand

 for   market annuities is sharply counterfactual.
       Following Kotlikoff and Spivak, it is possible to infer the lunp—sum
value to the individual, under the conditions assumed in the simulations
reported       in Table 5,   of   having access to a market for actuarially fair
life annuities. From (14), the initial value of the indirect utility
function in each simulation is

for    given initial wealth W0. The        proportional increment in   the individual' s
initial wealth required to render the individual as wefl off, in the sense
of an equal initial value of the indirect utility function, in the absence
of an annuity market as with such a market is therefore just

where
           0QA=(_q)       is the value    of     in (18) in the simulation with a
market for fair annuities and 601A=0 is the analogous value in the simulation
with no annuity market.
           For the pair of simulations reported in Table 5, the calculation in
(18) yields M=1.13. Under the conditions assumed in           these simulations,

therefore, it      would still be preferable      to put all of initial wealth into

annuities than to buy none at all, as long as the load factor did not exceed

L*=2.l3.23 Because L*=2.l3 far exceeds the load factors in actual annuity

prices calculated on any of the bases reported in Table 3,          and yet   in fact
                                        —19—




 there is little individual demand for life annuities, some other assumption
 common to the two simulations shown in Table 5 must be importantly counterfactiial.
          One possibility,   of course, is that =4 overstates the coefficient

 of relative risk aversion. Alternative simulations with a smaller risk

 aversion parameter show that this is not the source of the problem, however.

 Table 6 summarizes a pair of simulations that are identical to those

reported in Table 5   except    for the new assumption =2.22 Although the

specific   age-consumption and age-wealth profiles shown in Table 6 differ
somewhat from those in Table 5, the same counterfactual implications are again
readily apparent. Indeed, because of the lower risk aversion the optimal
age—consumption and age—wealth profiles when annuities are unavailable
decl me even more sharply. When actuarially fair annuities are available,
it is again optimal to invest all of initial wealth in them.      Most

importantly,   even with lower risk aversion the proportional increment in
initial wealth required to render the individual as well off in the absence
of an annuity market as with such a market is still M= .88. Even with
lower risk aversion, therefore, it would still be preferable to put all of
initial wealth into annuities than to buy none at all, as long as the
load factor did not exceed L*=l.88     —a critical value again well in excess

of   any of the observed load factors reported in Table 3.
      A further possible explanation for the counterfactual results in
}xth Tables 5 and 6 is that Social Security not only exists but is a large
part of wealth for most individuals. Table 7 presents a pair of simulations
of the more general model developed in Section II — first without, and then
with,   a market for actuarially fair   annuities — based   on the assumption that

actuarially   fair Social Security constitutes half of total wealth (S=.5) •23

simulations      are   analogous to those reported in Table 5.
          The   results shown in Table 7 again exhibit largely the sa
coimterfactual patterns       as in   Table 5, and therefore suggest that merely
allowing for Social Security cannot account for the observed behavior either.
In the absence of an annuities market, the optial age-consumption and
especially age-wealth profiles        decline fairly sharply, although not so much

so as in Table 5.         If actuarially fair annuities are   available,   it is

optimal to invest all of total wealth other than Social Security in
purchasing them. Most importantly, even with a sizeable role for Social

Security the proportional initial wealth increment required to render the
individual as well off without as with a private annuity market is M= .33.
Hence it would still be preferable to put all of total wealth other than
Social Security (that is, one-half of total wealth) into private annuities
rather than buy none at all, as long as the annuity load factor did not
exceed L*=l .66 (=1 + .33/ .5) — again far greater than the load factors
actually observed. n analogous simulation based on the lower risk
aversion value of =2 (not shown in the table) produces alnst identical
results, with M=.3l and a critical load factor L*=l.62.
      The potential elanation for the observed behavior that is of
greatest interest in the context of this paper is that, in general, people
may value not just their own consumption but also bequests. Table 8 presents
three further pairs of simulations of the fully general model developed in
Section   II, in each case based on the same      assumptions as in Table 7
(including      the prominent role for Social Security) and, in addition, a

positive bequest motive. The first of these three pairs of simulations assumes

the bequest motive 0=2, which is quite modest given the stock-flow dimension

of 0, and the model's use       of   an annual time unit, and =4. The second pair

of simulations assumes 0=8. The third pair assumes 0=24.

         The simulation results reported in Tablo        S   show that even a very
modest bequest motive is sufficient to eliminate one of the importantly
counterfactual aspects of the earlier simulations. In particular, because
of   the bequest motive it is no longer optimal to invest all of total

wealth   other than Social Security in private annuities. The           fraction

of   wealth invested   in   bonds varies positively with the strength
of the bequest motive, but even 0=2 is sufficient to make optimal bond
holdings neither zero nor trivially small. Ibreover, optimal bond holdings
do not decrease (until the final year they actually increase slightly) with

age. Hence the    general     model,   with even   a modest positive bequest motive,

is consistent with     observed behavior in ilying an          approximately flat

age-wealth profile for the part of wealth held in non-annuity form.
       By contrast, the results for all three pairs of simulations shown

in Table 8 continue to be counterfactual in ilying that, when private
annuities are available, it is optimal to use a large fraction of total
wealth other than Social Security to purchase them. Further analysis,
however, indicates that here the load factor in annuity pricing is
potentially very iiortant.
      For the weak bequest motive 0=2, the proportional initial wealth
increment required to render the individual as well off without as with a
private annuity market       is   M=.22. The critical load factor necessary to
make buying no annuities at all preferable to investing 41% of initial
wealth in annuities is therefore L*=1.53 (=1 +           .22/.41),   again above the

observed load factors reported in Table 3 for the mean premiums charged by

the ten largest insurers, regardless of the mortality probabilities and the

interest rate used in the calculations.

         For 0=8, the initial wealth increment required to render the individual
                                          —22—




as well off without as with a private annuity market is only M=.l8, so

that the critical load factor that would make buying no annuities at all

preferable to investing 38% of initial wealth in annuities is L*=l.47. As

Table 3 shows, this load factor is approximately equal to that charged on

average by the largest ten insurers if the underlying present expected value

calculation relies on general population mortality probabilities and the

interest rate on corporate direct placements. Nevertheless, it still

exceeds the implied load factor confronting an individual who knows that

bis    mortality   probabilities are characteristic of other annuity purchasers,

or whose opportunity cost of funds is the government bond yield (or who

searches    for the lowest available premilmi)
         Filially,   for 0=24, the initial wealth increint required to render
the individual as well off without as with a private annuity market is M=l .14.
nce the critical load factor that would make buying no annuities at
all preferable to investing 35% of initial wealth in annuities is L*=l.40,
about in the middle     between   the actual load factor based on general
population mortality probabilities and the direct placement yield and the
actual load factor based on alternative assuntions.
         Under    sets of plausible assumptions, therefore, importantly
                 sons

including a positive bequest motive, the actual load factor included in
the premiums on individual life annuities sold in the United States is
sufficient to make people prefer buying no annuities at all over buying
the amount that would be optimal if annuity prices were actuarially fair.
Although this finding is     hardly   without interest, since   it indicates   a joint
role   for the bequest motive and for annuity load factors in explaining the

observed behavior, it still does not fully explain the fact that almost no

one buys any individual life annuities. Nothing forces people to choose
                                           —23—




between buying either the amount of annuities that would be optimal at

actuarially fair prices or buying none at all. Hence showing under

what conditions people would prefer no annuities at all to the amount

they would purchase at actuarially fair prices still does not establish

the conditions under which they would not buy some amount that is

significant albeit less than the actuarially fair optimum. For the

assumed values of 0, R,     and S underlying the simulations reported in

Table 8, for example, and for an assumed annuity load factor of L=l.40

(the   critical value for 0=24) ,   the   strength of the bequest motive required

to make the individual indifferent between purchasing private annuities

equal to 1% of initial wealth (including Social Security) and purchasing

none at all is 0=343 —    far   above 0=24, yet still below the logical upper

bound for 0 given the assumed parameter values. Table 9 summarizes the

results of analogous simulations based on various values of 5, R and ,

reporting   in each case the value of 0 that renders the individual just

indifferent between investing 1% of initial wealth (including Social Security)
in private annuities and purchasing none at all when the load factor is

L1.40.24
        Both because the quantitative importance of bequests in overall
saving is a question with major implications for both positive and normative
issues,25 and also because there is little other way to evaluate the
plausibility   of values of 0 within the logically admissible range, it is

interesting to see just how large these results suggest that the typical

bequest should be. Table 10 shows, for each of the combinations of

parameter values considered in Table 9, and in each case for the value of the

bequest motive parameter 0 (as shown in Table 9) needed to render the

individual indifferent between investing 1% of initial wealth in private

                                                            For the most part
these estimates are closely bunched, despite the wide variation in the
underlying parameter values, typically     indicating a bequest equal to

two to four times the final year's consumption. Especially for the lower

end of the range, these estimates appear to be empirically plausible.26

         Given the respective roles of S, R and     in affecting the demand

for annuities in the model developed in Section II, their corresponding

roles here in determining the strength of bequest motive necessary to

eliminate that demand (for a given load factor) is straightforward. The

demand   for individual life annuities is smaller as Social Security is
more   important, smaller as the rate of return is higher, and greater as
people   are   more risk averse. Hence the bequest motive implied by the

fact that few people buy individual life annuities is weaker as Social

Security is more important, weaker as the rate of return is higher, and

stronger as people are more risk averse.

         In   sum, the results shown in Tables 9 and 10 indicate that for
plausible sets of assumed parameter values the combination of an annuity load
factor in the observed range (see again Table 3) and an empirically
plausible     positive bequest motive in the theoretically admissible range for
altruistic bequests is sufficient     to explain the absence of purchases of

individual     life annuities. This finding lends strength to the view that
desired bequests are an important element in consumption—saving behavior.
Moreover, when Social     Security is less important and people are more

risk averse, the bequest motive assumes an especially large role in

explaining why so few people buy annuities. Under these circumstances the

indicated bequest is at least four times final consumption.

iv. Conclusion and Further Thoughts
        The   observed reluctance of most individuals in     the   United States
to buy individual life annuities, and the concominitant approximately flat
average age—wealth profile, stand in sharp contradiction to the standard
life cycle model of consumption-saving behavior. The analysis in this
paper lends support to an explanation for this phenomenon based on the
interaction of an intentional bequest motive and annuity prices that are
not actuarially fair.
         Premiums charged for individual life annuities in the United States
do include a load factor of 32—48 per dollar, or l8—33 per dollar after
allowing for adverse selection, in conarison to actuarially fair annuity

values. Load     factors of this size are   not   out of line   with   those on other

familiar (and almost universally purchased) insurance        products.      Simulations

of an   extended model of life cycle saving and     portfoio     behavior, allowing

explicitly    for uncertain lifetiits and Social Security, show that the load
factor charged would have to be far larger than this to account for the
observed behavior in the absence of a bequest motive. By contrast, the
combination of a load factor in this range and a positive bequest motive, can
do so for some plausible values of the assumed underlying parameters. Moreover,
if this combination of factors is leading elderly individuals to avoid
purchasing life annuities, it implies a typical bequest that is fairly large.
in comparison to their consumption.
        As the authors' earlier work has already emphasized, caution is
appropriate    in relying on these conclusions without further research.

Although the model used here does generalize the standard life—cycle model

in several potentially important ways, it still excludes a priori a variety

of further possible explanations for the observed behavior:27 First, many
                                        —26—




people at least say that they choose stable age-wealth profiles, rather
than either buying annuities or simply consuming out of wealth, not because
of mortality considerations but from fear of the consequences of

catastrophic illness. Second, while the analysis here follows the recent

literature by impilcity working in real terms, the individual life

annuities available in U.S. markets quarantee specified nominal payments.

Third, the analysis here does not allow for several more complex kinds

of possible interactions within families, including, for example, either

non-altruistic ("manipulativet') bequests or intra-family risk sharing.28

Finally, in contrast to the reliance here (and in just about all of the

available literature on the subject) on the standard theory of expected

utility   maximization, there is evidence that, especially when the prospect
of rare events is involved, individuals systematically overweight the
probability of rare events. 29
       These further possible explanations for the fact that few people
purchase   individual life annuities   remain as objects for future research.

     population own individual annuities of any sort; see, for example,

 3. See Friedman and Warshawsky     (1985).

 4. This dispersion probably reflects search costs; see, for example,
     Pratt et al. (1979). Alternatively, it could reflect different
     marketing choices by different insurers.

                                                  x

      the date of issue (here 65 years), r is the relevant interest rate, and
      p is the probability that an individual of age x at time t=l will
      surviveto any year    t>l. These annual   calculations   are   then converted
      to a monthly basis.
 6. The calculations rely on the 1970 tables for years 1968—70, on the 1980
     tables for years 1980—83, and on both tables (weighted) for years 1971-79.
     See Faber (1982) for a complete description of the U.S. Life Tables,
     and Wetterstrand (1983) for a discussion of improvements in mortality
     probabilities. In the calculations for females suxmnarized in Appendix
     Table 1 below, the corresponding adjustsient factors are .98 and .99.
 7.   See Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) for an analysis of the principles
      underlying this kind of adverse selection.

 8. See Society of Actuaries (1983) for the actual company experience tables.

 9. This latter comparison is the relevent one from the perspective of the
     insurer. Informal discussions with insurers suggested that, of this 33
     per dollar, roughly 1l reflected transactions costs (narrowly defined),
     8 taxes, and l4 return to capital at risk. This break—down is at best
     only suggestive, however.

10. The small probability that a 65-year—old male will survive past age 100
     is simply ignored for purposes of this comparison.
Ii. This section draws heavily on Friedman and Warshawsky (1985); see
     that paper for additional details and references to relevant
      literature.

12. In fact, Fischer's model is really an annuity model, despite his
     application of it to the demand for life insurance.

13. probabilities Pt and            are, of course, conditional on initial
      age x. Writing them as p(x) and q(x)1 would be appropriate but
      would clutter an already cumbersome notation. Conditionality on
      x is to be understood, here and below.

14. In a more general context it would also be necessary to take account
     of labor income. The focus of this paper, however, is on the elderly
     retired population.

15. As in Fischer (1973), the assumption of one—period annuities makes
     the analysis tractable. The annuities actually available for purchase
      in the United States are instead life annuities.
16. The model as written here imposes no nonriegativity constraint on choice
     parameter A — that is, it does not explicitly preclude short sales of
     annuities. For most reasonable values of the given parameters, however,
     large short sales are not optimal anyway. If they were, imposing a
     nonnegativity constraint in solving the model would be straightforward.
17. The time profile in (17) is from Fischer's Appendix Table A2,
     extended to age 110. Reasoning analogous to that underlying abel's
     (1984) model of life insurance markets suggests that the results could be
     very sensitive to whether the value of bequests is rising or falling
      with t. In particular, a sufficiently negatively sloped bequest
      motive can, under some circumstances, give rise to a negative demand
      for annuities. The after—age—65 portion of Fischer's time profile,
      used here, makes bt decline approximately in step with        for   c.99   as
      assumed below.

18. Friedman and Warshawsky (1985) indicate other circumstances under which
     0 would not be bounded.

19.   Grossman and Shiller (1981) found evidence consistent with a relative
      risk aversion coefficient roughly equal to 4. Bodie et al. (1985)
      also    used this value.

20. Wealth held in annuity       form is valued at the presented expected value.
21. In   other words, any approximately flat consumption stream exceeding
      3.38% of initial wealth each year (7.20% as in the third column of
      Table 5, divided by 2.13) would be preferable to the declining
      stream shown in the first column.
22. Friend and Blume (1975) found evidence indicating a relative risk
     aversion coefficient roughly equal to 2.

23. One-half is about the fraction of total wealth constituted by
     Social Security and private pensions for the average retired
     elderly individual in the United States; see the evidence
     provided by Kotlikoff and Smith (1983), Table 3.7.19 (p. 127)..

24. The results shown in Table 9 follow from searching over 0, given
     the assumed values of the other parameters. For purposes of
     comparison to the analysis by Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981), the
     o values corresponding to =l.25 are (in order, from top to bottom
     in the table) 3, 2, 1, 2, 1.5 and 1.

25. See, for example, Kotlikoff and Summers (1981).

26. For males Menchik and David (1982 p. 193, Table 1), reported a median
     bequest equal to 2.1 times annual median labor income (defined as
     one—fortieth of average annual labor earnings), and a mean bequest
     equal to 4.2 times mean annual labor income.

27. See Friedman and Warshawsky (1985) for a brief discussion of several
     of these other possible explanations.

28. See, for example, Berriheim     et
                                   al. (1984) on non—altruistic bequests
     and Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981) on intra-fam.ily risk sharing.

29.   See, for example, Kahnexnan   and   Tversky (1979)
