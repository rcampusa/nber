This paper employs Swedish data on households' stock holdings to investigate how consumption responds
to changes in stock market returns. We instrument the actual capital gains and dividend payments
with past portfolio weights. Unrealized capital gains lead to a marginal propensity to consume (MPC)
of 23% for the bottom 50% of the wealth distribution and about 3% for the top 30% of the wealth
distribution. Households’ consumption is significantly more responsive to dividend payouts across
all parts of the wealth distribution. Our findings are consistent with households treating capital gains
and dividends as separate sources of income.

I.      Introduction

In the U.S., stockholdings represent the largest share of financial assets on households’ balance
sheets, reaching more than $32 trillion (with about $15 trillion in non-retirement accounts),
which makes them comparable in importance to the stock of housing wealth. Given their
prominence, movements in stock prices and dividend payments might significantly affect
households’ consumption and savings decisions. With soaring stock prices, households'
savings rate is at a 12-year low, sparking the question of whether stock market trends indeed
drive households' spending habits. 2 This shift away from saving, however, could leave some
consumers exposed to changes in market conditions. Furthermore, concerns about the
consumption-wealth effects of stock market returns have been the main driver of US monetary
policy sensitivity to stock price movements (Cieslak and Vissing-Jørgensen, 2020). Thus, a
natural question is: how much of a decline in aggregate consumption should we expect if stock
prices take a sudden turn for the worse as they did during past recessions?

        Despite the central importance of these issues, there is no comprehensive study on the
causal impact of changes in stock market wealth on households’ consumption. This is due to
several challenges. First, aggregate movements in stock prices are endogenous with respect to
other macroeconomic shocks, such as expectations of future income growth and consumer
confidence (Beaudry and Portier, 2006). Second, due to the presence of home bias, exploiting
regional cross sectional variation that would control for macroeconomic fluctuations is also not
ideal. One could potentially address these challenges by exploiting household level data, such
as the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), however, the advantages of using such data are
counterbalanced by the lack of accuracy in the reported measures of capital gains (Dynan and
Maki, 2001). 3 Furthermore, households bias their investment towards their own companies and
local industries, resulting in correlation between capital gains and other factors affecting their
income directly, which may even introduce a new source of endogeneity that is absent in the
aggregate data (Benartzi, 2001; Coval and Moskowitz, 2001; Mitchell and Utkus, 2003;
Meulbroek, 2005). Finally, given the skewness of the stockholdings, it is important to estimate



2
  The Commerce Department has reported that the savings rate was 2.4% of disposable household income in
December 2017, the lowest rate since September 2005. The savings rate had risen to 6.6% when the recession
ended in June 2009.
3
  There is no direct measure of capital gain in the CEX, and capital gains are imputed based on changes in total
security holdings and the amount of sales and purchases during that year. Any such imputation requires strong
assumptions on the timing and portfolio rebalancing of households. Moreover, many households report zero
capital gains in the years the stock market performs remarkably well.
                                                       2
the consumption behavior of the households at the top of the wealth distribution, which are
usually underrepresented in surveys. 4

        In this paper, we overcome these challenges by using very granular household level
data from Sweden. Due to the presence of a wealth tax, we are able to have a full picture of the
households’ balance sheets at the end of each year from 1999 to 2007 (when the tax was
repealed). We have data on the universe of households’ portfolio holdings at the security level,
as well as information about their debt obligations and real estate transactions. To measure
consumption, we follow the residual approach proposed by Koijen, Van Nieuwerburgh and
Vestman (2015) that imputes consumption as a residual of households’ disposable income net
of other transactions and also validate this measure against survey information. Koijen, Van
Nieuwerburgh and Vestman (2015), Eika, Mogstad and Vestad (2020), and Kolsrud, Landais,
and Spinnewijn (2019) discuss the quality of this imputed measure of consumption based on
administrative data and its comparison with survey data. These papers show that the quality of
the consumption measure based on the residual method depends on the availability of data on
detailed household level asset allocation as well as data on housing transactions.

        Even with this data, households’ portfolio choices are endogenous and might be driven
by omitted factors that also drive households’ consumption behavior. We address this issue in
several ways. First, we exploit the panel nature of our data and estimate all of our regressions
using first differences. This allows us to capture any time-invariant difference across
households that might be correlated with the level of their capital gains or dividend income.
Second, we limit the heterogeneity across households’ portfolios by estimating the MPC
separately for different parts of the wealth distribution. Third, we also exclude stockholdings
in the households' own industry of activity from their portfolios before computing the capital
gains and dividends. This ensures that our results are driven by households’ holdings in
industries other than their own, whose fluctuations are less likely to be correlated with changes
in households’ income.

        One might still be concerned that changes in capital gains and dividend income could
be driven by dynamic changes in households’ portfolios. In fact, changes in households’
portfolios can be driven by factors such as the liquidation of stock holdings due to an
expenditure shock or a large durable purchase, the very same factors that are likely responsible

Consumer Finances.

for household consumption. Therefore, we implement a simulated IV strategy where we
instrument the variations in capital gains and dividend income with the capital gains and
dividend income that would have accrued, had the household kept its portfolio the same as the
one observed in previous years. Intuitively, the portfolio weights in previous years should not
be determined by future shocks that drive both stock returns and consumption choices. In other
words, our identification comes from the stickiness in the households’ portfolios, for which we
find strong evidence in our data.

         The first main result is that the MPC out of (unrealized) capital gains for households in
the top 30% of the financial wealth distribution is about 3% and does not exhibit significant
variation between, for instance, households in the 70th to 90th percentile and households in the
top 5% of the wealth distribution. In contrast, the MPC for households in the bottom half of
the distribution is significantly higher at about 23%. However, it is worth noting that these
households own less than 7% of overall stockholdings. Our estimates are robust to directly
controlling for realized capital gains, which we observe for a subsample. Intuitively,
households can freely respond to changes in unrealized capital gains by adjusting their savings
decisions. 5 In further tests, we also condition on households sharing the same employer, which
ensures that they share a similar income stream, and provide several tests to show that our
estimates are not driven by measurement error. Overall, these results show that households’
consumption is responsive to paper wins.

         Moreover, consistent with buffer-stock models of consumption, such as Zeldes (1989),
Carroll (1997), Gourinchas and Parker (2002), and their extension to life-cycle portfolio choice
model like Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout (2005), we show that what determines the
heterogeneity in MPC out of capital gains is not financial wealth per se, but the ratio of financial
wealth and average income. The MPC out of capital gains of buffer-stock households, defined
as households with financial wealth less than six months of their disposable income, is almost
40%, but, conditional on not being a buffer-stock household, their MPC is almost invariant
with respect to wealth, and is about 3%.

         Second, consistent with the evidence in Baker, Nagel and Wurgler (2007), we find that
households are significantly more responsive to changes in dividends. In fact, the MPC out of
dividends, for all of our wealth groups, is around 40-60%, that is, more than ten times the MPC



5
  Note that this is also why transaction costs, related to the liquidation of the stock holdings, are unlikely to drive
the difference between the MPC for capital gains and dividends.
                                                          4
out of capital gains for the top 50th percentile of wealth distribution. It is worth mentioning that
this result is not driven by a potentially endogenous sorting of households with higher levels
of consumption (relative to their income) into stocks that pay more dividends. This is because
all of our estimates are based on within household variation of consumption that is caused by
changes in the same firms’ dividend payments. Though it is hard to reconcile this result with a
fully rational model without transaction costs, our result on MPC out of dividends and capital
gains is consistent with near rational behavior in which households separately optimize their
consumption with respect to capital gains and dividend income as if they were independent
from each other. 6 This interpretation is consistent with the free dividend fallacy identified by
Hartzmark and Solomon (2019): investors view capital gains and dividend income as separate
attributes of a stock.

        Finally, in exploring the mechanisms driving the results, we find evidence consistent
with life cycle models such as Gourinchas and Parker (2002), where older and unconstrained
households have higher MPC to transitory income (or wealth) shocks, since they consume
those capital gains over a shorter period of time and face significantly less uncertainty about
their lifetime income and wealth.

        Our findings are most closely related to Baker, Nagel and Wurgler (2007) and
Hartzmark and Solomon (2019). Baker, Nagel and Wurgler (2007) exploit cross sectional
variation in households’ consumption, capital gains and dividend income in CEX, in addition
to using data from a large discount brokerage. The authors document that households’
consumption and their withdrawal behavior is significantly more responsive to dividend
income than to capital gains. 7 Our results confirm the main finding of Baker, Nagel and
Wurgler (2007) and suggest that the significant difference between MPC out of capital gains
and dividend income is not driven by measurement error in capital gains, endogeneity of
households’ portfolio choice or lack of data on the household balance sheet outside a brokerage
account. Moreover, our results are helpful in discerning between the different underlying
theories. In fact, our estimate of a significantly positive MPC out of capital gains allows us to
conclude that near rational behavior, in which households treat capital gains and dividends as
separate sources of income, might be a better description of households’ behavior than a mental


6
  See Baker, Nagel and Wurgler (2007) for a comprehensive discussion on the inconsistency of this result with a
fully rational model.
7
  When using data from the brokerage accounts, Baker, Nagel and Wurgler (2007) proxy for consumption
expenditures with net withdrawals from the accounts. In contrast to a zero MPC for capital gains when they use
CEX, they estimate a 2% MPC when they analyze the brokerage account data.
                                                      5
accounting model, where households consume out of dividend but not capital gains, which is
the leading explanation for the differential MPCs out of dividend and capital gains in Baker,
Nagel and Wurgler (2007).

         Hartzmark and Solomon (2013) and Harris, Hartzmark and Solomon (2015) investigate
the impact on stock prices of investors’ demand for dividend income. Hartzmark and Solomon
(2019) show that, in contrast to Miller and Modigliani (1961), investors do not fully appreciate
that dividends come at the expense of price decreases. Our results show that this fallacy
translates in differential consumption responses, which suggests that it might have aggregate
effects on the real economy.

         Our results also contribute to the extensive literature that attempts to measure
households’ MPC. For example, Johnson, Parker and Souleles (2006), Johnson et al. (2013),
Agarwal and Qian (2014) and Jappelli and Pistaferri (2014) discuss estimates of MPC out of
one time transfers like tax rebates. Baker (2018) and Kueng (2018) on the other hand estimate
MPC out of more regular income shocks. Most of this literature finds MPCs for non-durables
of about 20% and for total consumption between 60-80%. Our estimates of MPC out of
dividend income are in line with these estimates, especially once one takes into account that
the majority of stockowners are not financially constrained.

         Closely related is also the literature linking housing wealth and stock wealth with
consumption expenditures, see Davis and Palumbo (2001), Case, Quigley and Shiller (2005,
2013), Carroll, Otsuka, and Slacalek (2011), Carroll and Zhou (2012), Dynan and Maki (2001),
Guiso, Paiella, and Visco (2006) and Paiella and Pistaferri (2017). More recently, Chodorow-
Reichet al. (2020) exploit regional heterogeneity in stock market wealth to identify the causal
effect of stock price changes on labor market outcomes. The estimated MPCs out of capital
gains in both categories of these papers range from as low as 0% to as high as 10%. 8 Poterba
(2000) and Paiella (2009), as well as Table AII in the Appendix, provide a more detailed review
of the literature on stock market wealth and consumption. Our paper contributes to this
literature by ensuring that the measurement error on the stockholdings of individuals is
minimal, and households in the top parts of the wealth distribution are not underrepresented. 9

  See Mian and Sufi (2011), Aladangady (2017), Campbell and Cocco (2007), Cloyne et al. (2019) and Agarwal
and Qian (2017) for estimates of MPC out of housing wealth that are based on micro data.
9
  Dynan and Maki (2001) argue that the imputation of household level capital gains based on the CEX responses
might be problematic. For instance, they mention that in the 1995-1998 period – a period of very strong market
growth – 30% of households with positive security holdings reported no change in their security holdings.
Therefore, instead of using capital gains based on CEX, they impute the level of stock holding of each household
in the beginning of each year and assume all households experience the aggregate market return on their portfolio.
                                                        6
Moreover, the data on households' holdings of each individual security helps us distinguish
between exogenous changes in the capital gains of households due to market movements and
the endogenous variation due to changes in household portfolio.

         The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the data and provides
summary statistics. Section III lays out our empirical strategy. Section IV presents the main
results, while Section V presents several tests showing that measurement error is not the main
driver of our results. Section VI explores the potential mechanisms for our findings by
investigating heterogeneous responses to capital gains, and Section VII presents more
robustness checks. Section VIII discusses the implications of these findings and concludes.


II.      Data

         To construct our sample of analysis, we begin with administrative data containing
information on all Swedish residents, including information on income, municipality of
residence, basic demographic information, and detailed wealth data.

         For information on households’ wealth, we mainly use the Swedish Wealth Register
(Förmögenhetsregistret), collected by Statistics Sweden for tax purposes between 1999 and
2007, when the wealth tax was abolished. The data include all financial assets held outside of
retirement accounts at the end of a tax year, December 31st, reported by different sources.
Financial institutions provided information to the Swedish Tax Agency on their customers’
security investments and dividends, interest paid, and deposits. Importantly, this information
was reported even for individuals below the wealth tax threshold. 10

         Since this data was collected for tax purposes, we observe an end-of-the-year snapshot
of each listed bond, stock, or mutual fund held by individuals, reported by their International
Securities Identification Number (ISIN). 11 Using each security’s ISIN, we collect data on the
prices, dividends, and returns for each stock, coupons for each bond, and net asset values per

10
   During this time period, the wealth tax was paid on all the assets of the household, including real estate and
financial securities, with the exception of private businesses and shares in small public businesses (Calvet,
Campbell, and Sodini, 2007). In 2000, the wealth tax was levied at a rate of 1.5% on net household wealth
exceeding SEK 900,000. This threshold corresponds to $95,400 at the end of 2000. In 2001, the tax threshold was
raised to SEK 1,500,000 for married couples and non-married cohabitating couples with common children and
1,000,000 for single taxpayers. In 2002, the threshold rose again to SEK 2,000,000 for married couples and non-
married cohabitating couples and 1,500,000 for single taxpayers. In 2005, the threshold for married couples and
cohabitating couples rose to SEK 3,000,000 (Black et al. 2017).
11
   Two exceptions to this are the holdings of financial assets within private pension accounts, for which we only
observe total yearly contributions, and “capital insurance accounts”, for which we observe the account balance
but not the asset composition. The reason is that tax rates on those two types of accounts depend merely on the
account balances and not on actual capital gains.
                                                       7
share for each mutual fund in the database from a number of sources, including Datastream,
Bloomberg, SIX Financial Information, Swedish House of Finance, and the Swedish
Investment Fund Association (FondBolagens Förening). 12 This additional information allows
us to compute the total returns on each asset, as well as capital gains and dividends paid to each
individual.

        From this data, we also observe the aggregate value of bank accounts, mutual funds,
stocks, options, bonds, debt, debt payment, and capital endowment insurance as well as total
financial assets and total assets. We use data from the Income Register to measure disposable
income for our sample. As a result, we are able to obtain a close-to-complete picture of each
household’s wealth portfolio.

        It should be noted that during the 1999 to 2005 period, banks were not required to report
small bank accounts to the Swedish Tax Agency unless the account earned more than 100 SEK
in interest during the year. From 2006 onwards, all bank accounts above 10,000 SEK were
reported. In surveys, 99% of Swedes aged 15 and above have a bank account, indicating that
in reality the people who are measured as having zero financial wealth probably in fact have
some bank account balance. We follow Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2007), Calvet and Sodini
(2014), and Black et al. (2017) and impute bank account balances for households without a
bank account using the subsample of individuals for whom we observe their bank account
balance even though the earned interest is less than 100 SEK. As a robustness check, we redo
our analysis for the subsample of households for whom the imputed balance accounts for less
than 10% of the total reported bank accounts and confirm that our results are not sensitive to
this.

        Since we are interested in the effect of capital gains on consumption, we limit our
sample of analysis to households with a portfolio in the previous period. Furthermore, we
restrict attention to households in which the head is younger than 65 years of age.

        Additionally, in order to mitigate potential measurement errors in households’ asset
changes and consumption, we follow the restrictions Koijen, Van Nieuwerburgh and Vestman
(2015) impose on the data. 13 In particular, we limit the sample to households with a fixed
number of household members between two consecutive periods, those who remain in the same


12
   For more in-depth description of this component of the data, see Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2007, 2009)
who use the Swedish Wealth Register for the period 1999 to 2002.
13
   See Table 13 of Koijen, Van Nieuwerburgh and Vestman (2015) for the impact of each of these steps on their
sample size. These restrictions’ effects on our sample size are detailed in Table AIII in the Appendix.
                                                     8
municipality, and those where none of the household members are self-employed or own non-
listed stocks, due to valuation problems. Using the real estate transaction register, we drop
households who have cash flow from real estate transactions. 14 We also drop observations
where a household member owns any derivative product (e.g. options), since it is difficult to
value those assets correctly, and households for which the calculated financial asset return on
the portfolio of stocks and mutual funds is in the bottom 1% or the top 1% of the return
distribution in each year.

         Finally, to mitigate measurement error, we remove households with extreme changes
in financial cash flow between two consecutive periods. This could happen for reasons such as
bequests or inter-vivos transfers from family members, which we do not observe. We drop
households for which the changes in financial cash flow are in the top or bottom 2.5% in the
corresponding year-specific distribution. 15

         As mentioned before, when measuring capital gains and dividends, we distinguish
between assets that belong to firms that are active in the same industries in which household
members work versus firms in other industries and exclude those assets that belong to
households' industry of activity from their portfolio. To do this, we categorize each security
held by an individual in our sample into a 4-digit NACE industry code and do the same for the
firm in which a person works. This ensures that our results are driven by households’ holdings
in industries other than their own, whose fluctuations are less likely to be correlated with
changes in household income, and reduces the concern that the relation between capital gains
and household consumption is driven by the household’s expectation about its future income.

         Table I presents detailed summary statistics of the main variables of interest for our
base sample. The main takeaway is that there is significant heterogeneity across households in
all dimensions. For instance, average consumption ranges from 235,000 SEK in the bottom
50% of the financial wealth distribution to 592,000 SEK for the top 5%. 16 While the average
value of stock wealth is around 27,000 SEK among the stockholders in the bottom 50% of the
wealth distribution, it is worth around 715,000 SEK in the top 5%. Also, for the sample of

14
   As explained in Koijen, Van Nieuwerburgh and Vestman (2015), this is because any error in the recorded
transaction price of houses can introduce a new source of measurement error. Using the same specification as in
Table 3, but including households involved in a real estate transaction, we find that there is no statistical
relationship between capital gains and being involved in a real estate transaction. In particular, the coefficient
estimate of the impact of capital gains on having a real estate transaction is -0.001 and for dividend payments is
0.002 with standard errors (0.004) and (0.007), respectively.
15
   As we will show later in the paper, our results are not sensitive to this threshold.
16
   Ranking in the distribution of financial wealth is based on financial wealth in year t-2 and is conducted before
all other aforementioned restrictions are imposed.

people participating in the stock market, about 45% of the total financial wealth is stock wealth
(including both direct holding of stocks and indirect holding of stocks through mutual funds)
for the bottom 50% versus 55% for the top decile. Furthermore, there is also some
heterogeneity within each financial wealth bin as the standard deviations of our main variables
are still noticeable. Our research design aims to explain part of this heterogeneity as a function
of the returns on the households’ portfolios.


III.   Research Design

       This section describes our empirical strategy. First, we follow the approach proposed
by Koijen, Van Nieuwerburgh and Vestman (2015) to impute consumption expenses.
Specifically, we impute consumption expenditure from the household budget constraint by
combining information from the Swedish registry data on income, detailed asset holdings, and
asset returns that we collect from third party sources. For each household i, we employ the
following identity to compute consumption:

       Intuitively, consumption is the difference between the households’ after tax labor and
financial asset income (plus transfers plus rental income from renting out owned houses), 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 ,
and the payment on existing debt, financial and housing savings (which do not include capital
gains) as well as pension contributions. We also take into account changes in the indebtedness
level. The granularity of the Swedish tax records allows us to measure the right hand side of
equation (1).

       This approach has the advantage of allowing us to build a panel of the consumption
measure for each household. However, there are some limitations. For instance, stock holdings
are observed at an annual frequency; this means that we have to ignore stock price changes and
active portfolio rebalancing within a year, as well as gifts and transfers. Eika, Mogstad and
Vestad (2017) shows that conditional on having information on real estate transactions, taking




                                                              10
into account stock transactions within each year does not add much to reducing measurement
error. 17

            Having imputed consumption expenditures, we are interested in estimating the
following specification relating consumption to capital gains and dividends:

                         𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (2)

where 𝛽𝛽1 and 𝛽𝛽2 are the main coefficients of interest, 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 is the household fixed effect and 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 is
the time fixed effect. More formally we want to estimate:

                               𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽1 (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (3)

where 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of stockholding shares of household i in the beginning of year t (that we
approximate with holdings that we observe on the last day of year t-1); 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 measures the return
during period t on portfolios held in the beginning of the period, and 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
measures the observed dividend income of household i in period t.

            By exploiting the panel nature of our dataset and estimating a first difference, we
control for time invariant household characteristics that might affect both the consumption
choices and capital gains. More specifically, we estimate:

     Δ𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 − 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡−1 ) + 𝛽𝛽2 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐼𝐼𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 )

                      +𝛽𝛽3 𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 + 𝛽𝛽5 𝑁𝑁𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡 +𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                   (4)

where we also control for change in disposable income (net of dividend payment) between time
t-1 and t, change in lagged financial wealth, time fixed effect, and a dummy for whether the
household has received any dividend payments in either of the two periods.

            However, even after excluding stockholding of households in their own industry (as
explained before), both the change in capital gain and the change in dividend income in
equation (4) contain not only an exogenous component that arises from the movements in
market returns to each stock (𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 ) or changes in the dividend payments per share, but also an
endogenous component that comes from changes in household portfolio allocation 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . In
particular, the change in capital gains (or equivalently for dividends) can be rewritten as
𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 . (𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 − 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡−1 ) + (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−1 ). 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 . While the variation in the first term is driven by the


17
  Following Koijen, Van Nieuwerburgh and Vestman (2015), in our main analysis we exclude a few households
with negative imputed consumption, our results are qualitatively and quantitatively the same without excluding
those data points.

                                                                    11
variations in the stock market returns, the variations in the second term are completely driven
by the changes in the portfolio endogenously made by the household.

         For instance, consider a household who receives a positive income shock and increases
its consumption as a result. However, at the same time, the positive income shock can result in
the expansion of the portfolio and therefore a positive change in capital gains - since
(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−1 ) will be positive. Alternatively, we can think of a household who received an
expenditure shock in period t-1 and liquidated part of its portfolio to finance that expenditure
shock. Since this was a one-time expenditure shock, everything else being fixed, Δ𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 will be
negative. However, because this household liquidated part of its portfolio in t-1, (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 )
will be negative, and therefore, the change in capital gains will be negative. These are just two
examples of reasons why one could observe a positive correlation (assuming market return in
that year was positive) between changes in consumption and capital gains without that
correlation being driven by the causal impact of capital gains on household consumption.

         Our main proposed solution to deal with the aforementioned endogeneity issue is to
employ passive changes in returns (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 . �𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 − 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡−1 �) and passive changes in dividends
(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 . �𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡 − 𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡−1 �), where 𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡 and 𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡−1 measure the dividend payments per share at time t
and t-1, to instrument for actual changes in total portfolio returns ([(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 ) − (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡−1 )])
and total dividends (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 ) in the first difference
regression. 18 By doing so, we capture the effect of changes in actual returns from what would
have been household i's capital gains and dividend income, assuming no changes in its
portfolio. 19 Intuitively, in this setting, any variation in portfolio allocations cannot drive our
results, limiting the endogeneity concerns. In theory, the weights can significantly change from
year to year, but we show that households’ portfolio choice is relatively stable, and our
instruments strongly predict the actual capital gains and dividends.

         Our baseline specification is an IV estimation of equation (4) for different wealth
groups. Specifically, we separately identify a coefficient for households between the 5th and
the 50th percentile, 50th and 70th, 70th and 90th, 90th and 95th, and 95th to 100th percentiles of the
financial wealth distribution. Coefficients 𝛽𝛽1 and 𝛽𝛽2 capture the marginal propensity to
consume for every dollar of capital gains and dividends.


18
   In order to compute passive changes in dividends, we use Datastream to get data on dividend payments per
share.
19
   Calvet, Campbell and Sodini (2009) use a similar strategy to calculate the share of risky assets in household
portfolio in the absence of any rebalancing.

       We devote Section V to discuss and investigate whether measurement error in capital
gains and consumption could bias our estimates.


IV.    Main Results

       This section presents the main results. We start our analysis by reporting the OLS
results for specification (4), where the returns are driven by employing the actual portfolio
weights. The results here are due to the changes in capital gains and dividend income that are
generated from both the passive return due to market movements and also endogenous
rebalancing of the portfolios by households between the two periods. Comparing these results
with the IV estimates (presented in Table III) sheds light on the importance of the endogeneity
concern.

       Table II presents the results. We find that households in the bottom 50% of the wealth
distribution consume about 53 cents for every dollar of capital gains. This MPC monotonically
declines with households’ wealth to about 4 cents for the top 5% of the distribution. We find a
larger reaction of consumption to dividend payments. Except for the households in the top 5th
percentile of the wealth distribution, households consume about 30-40 cents for every dollar
of change in dividend income. For households in the top 5% of the wealth distribution this
reduces to 17 cents per dollar. Although these estimates correct for the endogeneity concern
arising from households’ portfolio exposure to their own industry, they do not address the
concern about the endogeneity in capital gain or dividend income changes due to the changes
in households’ portfolio. Therefore, we now turn to our main empirical strategy.

       We next focus on the IV estimates of specification (4), where households' capital gain
and their dividend income are instrumented by their passive capital gain and passive dividend
income. First stage results for this exercise have been presented in Panel A of appendix Table
AIV.1 and AIV.2. Table AIV.1 shows that passive capital gain strongly predicts the actual
capital gain, which is consistent with the evidence on the persistence of households’ portfolio
allocations. Interestingly, the explanatory power of passive capital gains for total capital gains
increases with household wealth; this can be seen from an increase in the R-squared values of
the regressions in the first stage. While for the bottom 50th percentile of the wealth distribution
changes in passive capital gains explain 36% of variation in total capital gains, the same
number is around 80% for the top 5% of the wealth distribution. This also suggests that the
endogeneity concern is a more important problem for households in the lower part of the wealth

                                                13
distribution. Table AIV.2 shows similar observations for dividend payments and confirms that
passive dividend income is a strong predictor of total dividend income. It is worth noting that
the data we use to estimate passive dividend income (from Datastream) has lower coverage
than our data on stock returns (coming from 6 different sources, including Datastream), and
therefore, our estimated coefficients for the impact of passive dividend income on actual
dividend income are smaller than the analogous coefficient for the capital gain regression. This
is also reflected in the lower R-squared values of the regressions reported in Table AIV.2.

       Moreover, disposable income and lagged financial wealth are only very weakly related
to capital gains and dividend income, and the first stage regression coefficients remain the same
in the absence of these control variables. We also report the first stage estimates for capital
gains and dividend income without including the controls in Panel B of appendix Table AIV.1
and AIV.2. These results confirm that our instruments are not correlated with observable
controls and also that adding controls does not change the explanatory power of our instruments
for the actual capital gains and dividend income.

       As with Table II, each column in Table III presents the average MPC out of capital
gains and dividends for a specific wealth group. All specifications include disposable income
(net of dividend payments) and a lagged measure of financial wealth as controls, as well as
year fixed effects and a dummy for whether the household has received any dividend payments
in the two periods. Moreover, our specification in first differences captures time-invariant
household characteristics that might be correlated with the consumption decision.

       We find that the highest MPC belongs to the bottom 50th percentile of the wealth
distribution and is about 23 cents for every dollar increase in capital gains. From there, it
decreases significantly to about 3 cents for households in the top 30th percentile of the wealth
distribution. The second row of Table III shows that the MPC out of changes in dividends is
significantly larger than the estimated MPC for capital gains in all wealth groups and is about
40-60 cents for all wealth groups.

       These results are consistent with models of buffer-stock households, such as those
proposed by Zeldes (1989), Carroll (1997), Gourinchas and Parker (2002) and, more recently,
Kaplan and Violante (2014) that predict households with low liquid wealth exhibit higher MPC
from temporary income or wealth shocks.

       Table IAI in the internet appendix reports the results of the same regressions without
any controls. This is to ensure that our results are not contaminated by the fact that we do not
                                               14
use exogenous variations in households’ income. Tables IAII.1, IAII.2 and IAII.3, instead,
show that our results are robust to alternative restrictions in the sample construction. To be
specific, Table IAII.1 reports the results when we do not exclude observations with negative
imputed consumption. In Table IAII.2 we restrict our sample to households for whom the total
balance of bank accounts (either imputed or not) is less than or equal to 10% of the reported
bank accounts. 20 Table IAII.3 drops households for which the change in financial cash flow is
in the top or bottom 1% of the distribution in each year (as opposed to 2.5% in the base sample).

         Finally, in Table IAIII we allow for a lagged impact of capital gains and dividend
income on households’ consumption and find similar results to the baseline specifications.

         What can explain the difference in the MPC out of capital gains and MPC out of
dividends? Baker, Nagel and Wurgler (2007) discuss in detail why this is inconsistent with
fully rational behavior, but is in line with mental accounting by households (Shefrin and Thaler,
1988). At the root of the inconsistency with a fully rational model is the fact that, to the extent
that stock prices reflect the value of all future dividends, any change in dividend payouts should
not have any additional impact on household consumption. While it is difficult to reconcile our
findings with a fully rational model, our result on MPC out of dividends and capital gains can
be consistent with a near rational behavior in which households optimize their consumption
with respect to capital gains and dividend income as if they were independent from each other.
In particular, in our data, dividend income changes are significantly more persistent than
changes in capital gains (as shown in Figure 1) and, as long as households consider capital
gains and dividend income as separate sources of income, this can rationalize an MPC out of
dividend income that is significantly larger than MPC out of capital gains. 21

A. Capital Gains, Dividend Income, and Components of Household Saving

         The depth of our data and the fact that we observe all components of the household
balance sheet allow us to take a step further and not only study the response of household
consumption to stock market returns, but also analyze the relation between capital gains and

20
   As reported in Table AVI.2, imputed bank accounts, on average, account for less than 1% of the total bank
accounts for this sample.
21
   In the extreme case that any change in dividend payments is permanent, the “optimal” response of households
in this near-rational framework is to increase their consumption by one dollar for each dollar of increase in their
dividend income. Alternatively, if the price of a security follows a random walk, a one-dollar increase in a stock
price today does not have any predictive power about future movements in the stock price. In that case, the optimal
response of household consumption to this one time wealth shock is the same as the consumption response of the
household to a one-time temporary income shock –since households can always transfer a dollar of transitory
income shock to a dollar of wealth and vice versa- and is equal to the annuity income of one dollar –which is
significantly less than one.
                                                        15
dividend income and each component of household financial saving. This analysis also sheds
light on how shocks to capital gains or dividend income can propagate to other markets through
households’ balance sheets.

        The results are shown in Table IV. Panel A reports the impact of capital gains on
household active financial saving and its components. 22 Each cell is related to a separate
regression. For example, the first row reports the impact of capital gains on total cash flow of
households when estimated separately for each wealth group. These coefficients, by
construction, are equal to the MPC estimates of capital gains times minus one. The first row in
Panel B reports the impact of dividend income on households’ active financial saving. Again,
these coefficients by construction are equal to one minus the estimated MPC out of dividend
income (reported in Table III). The estimated coefficients for dividend income show that on
average, households save 40-60% of their dividend income.

        Next, we investigate the response of different components of households’ balance
sheets to capital gains and dividend income. Row (a) in Panel A of Table IV shows that
households in the top 50th percentile of the wealth distribution reduce their savings in stocks
by about 10 cents with respect to a dollar increase in their portfolio value (i.e. 90 cents net
increase in the value of their portfolio in response to a dollar of capital gain). This comes both
from selling some of their existing stocks and, more importantly, by adjusting their savings and
purchase of new stocks which will not incur any transaction cost. Rows (b) and (c) of Panel A
show that households use part of this additional cash flow (either from liquidating stocks or
reducing their savings in stocks) to pay down their debt and increase their holdings in their
bank accounts. Row (a) of Panel B shows that indeed households in the top 50th percentile of
wealth distribution reinvest about 30-50 cents from each dollar of income from dividends in
stocks. Rows (b) and (c) show that they also some of the dividend income in their bank account
and use another 10 cents to pay down their debt.

B. Realized vs. Unrealized Capital Gains

        So far, we have focused on the effects of capital gains on households’ consumption,
regardless of whether the gain is realized or not. This is partly driven by data limitations; since
we are unable to observe stock transactions, for most of the sample period, we cannot cleanly



22
  Note that our imputed consumption is equal to household disposable income minus household active financial
saving.
                                                    16
identify the price at which households bought the stocks, which makes it impossible to compute
realized capital gains.

        However, between 2005 and 2007, households' realized capital gains for different asset
categories were reported in the Capital Income Registry. Table IAIV reports detailed summary
statistics for realized and total capital gains during this period. We exploit this additional piece
of information to try to shed light on whether the realized capital gains are the only driver of
the changes in households’ consumption. The hypothesis is that, if all the estimated coefficients
are driven by the realized capital gains, we should observe the coefficient on our measure of
capital gain decrease when we add the realized gains as an additional control. Since we have
this additional information only for three years, we first estimate our baseline IV regression of
equation (4) for that subsample and report the result in Internet Appendix Table IAV. The table
shows that the coefficients on both capital gains and dividends are very similar to the ones
found for the entire sample (Table III).

        Table V shows the results. We find that, although, expectedly, an increase in the
realized capital gains is positively correlated with an increase in consumption, the coefficient
on our measure of total capital gain (including both the realized and unrealized capital gain) is
almost unaffected.

        It should be noted that, while our estimated coefficient for total capital gain relies on
the passive variations in capital gain that are not affected by household choices, realized capital
gain is affected by the endogenous decision of households to rebalance their portfolio (e.g. a
household receives an expenditure shock and liquidates part of its stock holding in order to
smooth that shock), and therefore, the estimated coefficient can be biased upward. 23

        The fact that households’ consumption is responsive to unrealized capital gains
suggests that in response to a positive capital gain, households do not necessarily need to
liquidate their stocks in order to increase their consumption. Rather, they can reduce (or
increase) their savings rate, which in turn affects their expenditures. Adjustment through the
change in the saving rate is also tax advantageous, because it allows households to avoid paying
capital gain tax. In sum, it seems that adjustment in saving rate is an important channel through
which households’ consumption responds to capital gain.




23
  Meyer and Pagel (2019) use liquidation of mutual funds as an exogenous source of variation of realized capital
gains and show an asymmetric response of households to realized capital gains.
                                                      17
V.     Measurement Error

       One potential concern about our analysis is the possibility that the lack of transaction
level data introduces measurement error in both capital gains and imputed consumption, which
might result in a biased MPC estimate (Baker et al. 2018). In this section, we investigate both
theoretically and empirically the extent to which this is a concern in our setting.

A. Measurement error in dividends

       It should be emphasized that our data does include a measure of total dividends earned
by the household during each year. As a result, we use actual dividend income, and not imputed
dividends, in both the construction of our measure of imputed consumption and as our right
hand side variable in the estimation of the MPC out of dividend income. Specifically,
households’ portfolios in previous years are only used to construct the measure of passive
changes in dividend income, which is used only as an instrument for the actual changes in
dividend income. Therefore, a change in the household portfolio during the year does not cause
any error in the measure of total dividend income. Consequently, measurement error in
dividend income does not seem to be a source of bias in our estimates of MPC out of dividend
income.

B. Measurement error in capital gains

       Unlike dividend income, unrealized capital gains are not taxed and therefore our
measure of capital gains is a noisy measure of actual capital gains. We now discuss whether
the measurement error in our imputed capital gains could bias the MPC estimates. We first
discuss the requirements for the estimate of MPC in levels to be unbiased and then extend the
framework to the first difference estimates used in the paper. It should be noted here that in all
of our main analysis based on Swedish data we control for time fixed effects. This means that
we are only exploiting the cross sectional variation in stock returns. Therefore, throughout this
section we assume that the expected return of the assets is equal to zero.

B.1. Measurement error in capital gains and level regressions

       Let’s assume the true relation between consumption 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and capital gain 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is:
                                     𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .   (5)
However, not having transaction level data results in measuring 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 with error. Let us define
𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 as the measurement error in estimating the capital gain of household i in period t:
                                      𝑅𝑅�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖     (6)
                                                     18
where 𝑅𝑅�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the imputed capital gain.

            This error in the measurement of the capital gains affects our measure of imputed
consumption as well and implies that the relation between actual consumption and the imputed
consumption (𝑐𝑐̃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) is:
                                             𝑐𝑐̃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .           (7)


            Consequently, the relation between imputed consumption and imputed capital gains is:
                               𝑐𝑐̃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽𝑅𝑅�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + ( 1 − 𝛽𝛽 )𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .                (8)

Therefore, the necessary condition to estimate an unbiased MPC out of capital gains in our
setting is for the measured capital gains (𝑅𝑅�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) to be uncorrelated with the measurement error in
the capital gains (𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ).

            In order to shed more light on the assumptions required for our MPC estimates to be
unbiased, let’s assume that each year is divided into two sub-periods, but we only observe the
household portfolio in the first sub-period of the year. In this case, we can write:
                                           𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡1 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡2        (9)
             𝑗𝑗
where 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the vector that contains the holdings of household i in the sub-period j in year t
       𝑗𝑗
and 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 is the vector of market returns in sub-period j of year t. 24 Assuming that all trades
between year t and year t+1 happen at the end of year t, the measured capital gain is:
                                    𝑅𝑅�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 ∙ (𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡1 + 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡2 ) = 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡         (10)
where 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 is the vector of total market return for each stock in year t. Therefore, measurement
error in capital gain is:
                                   𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 − 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2 ) ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡2 = 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡2         (11)

where 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is defined as within the year changes in household portfolio. The requirement for the
MPC estimates in levels to be unbiased is that the measured capital gains 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 needs to be
uncorrelated with 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . This requires changes in the household’s portfolio (𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) to be
uncorrelated with the portfolio of the household at the beginning of the year (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 ), with the
market returns in that sub-period (𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡2 ) and the market return in the previous sub-period (𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡1 ).
The independence of household initial portfolio from the subsequent changes in household
portfolio does not seem unreasonable. The independence of the changes in households’


24
  Note that 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 is the same as 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 used in Section III, that is, the vector of stockholding of household i on the first
day of year t (or the last day of the year t-1).
                                                                    19
portfolio and the return of the portfolio in that sub-period also results directly from the lack of
households’ ability to time the market.

            However, changes in the number of shares held by the household (and not the value of
the stock holdings of the household per se) and market return in the first sub-period (𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡1 ) can
be correlated, for example, due to a positive feedback trading behaviors. If households tend to
invest a higher fraction of their income in stock market whenever the market return is higher,
there will be a negative correlation between our measurement error in capital gains (𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) and
the imputed capital gains and therefore our estimates of the MPC out of capital gain will be
biased downward. Alternatively, to the extent that in response to positive capital gains
households rebalance their portfolio and liquidate part of their portfolio (either to consume or
to keep the fraction of their investment between stocks and nominal assets constant), there will
be a positive correlation between 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and market return in the first sub-period. However, here,
the size of the bias is also a function of the correlation between the household portfolio returns
in the first sub-period and the household portfolio return in the second sub-period
(i.e. 𝐸𝐸[(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡1 )(𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡2 )] .

            This discussion suggests that, whether the measurement error in capital gains and the
imputed capital gains are correlated is an empirical question. However, using the annual
snapshots of household portfolios in Sweden, we cannot test directly whether the lack of
transaction level data results in any error in our estimates. Therefore, we use external data to
provide evidence that this is generally not a concern. Specifically, we use the transaction level
data from a large brokerage in the US supplemented with monthly dividend distributions from
the Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP). 25 Following the data preparation steps in
Baker, Nagel and Wurgler (2007) gives us a dataset that contains monthly household
information on total portfolio value, net withdrawals, capital gains, and dividend income as
shares of the previous month’s assets. Similar to Baker, Nagel and Wurgler (2007), we use
withdrawals as a proxy for consumption expenditures. Lastly, we account for outliers using the
same methods as in Baker, Nagel and Wurgler (2007) by, first, excluding household-month
observations where CRSP stocks and mutual funds do not account for at least 75% of the
portfolio value in month t-1, excluding households whose portfolio value falls below $10,000
or whose dividend information is missing in months t to t-11, and, second, excluding

household-month observations where the absolute value of net withdrawals surpasses 50%.
This leaves us with 98,951 household-month observations.

        We then construct a measure of annual net withdrawals and annual capital gains and
dividend income for households that we observe in our data for at least three years. We also
use the annual snapshots of the data (households’ portfolio holdings as of the end of December
each year) to construct our measures of net withdrawals as well as capital gains and dividend
income that we would have estimated if we only had annual data. The net withdrawals measure
based on annual data incorporates a proxy for stocks and funds bought and sold between year
t and year t+1 using midyear (June) prices.

        Column (1) of Table VI investigates the correlation between measurement errors in
capital gains due to lack of monthly data and passive annual capital gains in levels. Column (2)
replicates the same analysis, but when the independent and dependent variables are normalized
by the value of the households’ previous year’s assets, following the footsteps of Baker, Nagel
and Wurgler (2007). Indeed, in both columns we find that errors in the passive capital gains
and measurement error in the imputed capital gains are uncorrelated which makes the
estimation of MPCs based on the annual data unbiased. In order to show this point more
directly, Column (3) replicates the results in Table 6 Regression 3 in Baker, Nagel and Wurgler
(2007) and estimates net brokerage withdrawals on total dividends and total returns using
monthly data. 26 Since the main object of interest in our analysis is the relation between
consumption and capital gains and dividend income at the annual frequency, as opposed to
monthly frequency, we next use the same data, but construct measures of household annual
withdrawal and annual capital gains and dividend income. Column (4) shows the results for
the same regression specification in Column (3) using annual household data constructed by
aggregating the monthly withdrawals, capital gains, and dividends and reporting their annual
values as shares of the households’ previous year’s assets. One can think of this as the relation
between annual consumption (net withdrawals) and annual capital gains and dividend income
in the absence of measurement error due to lack of transaction level data. 27 Column (5) uses
only annual snapshots of the data to construct the measures of annual consumption and annual


26
   The small difference between our result and the one in Baker, Nagel and Wurgler (2007) most likely is due to
having slightly different data on dividend payments of mutual funds. This is because of the missing CUSIPs for
mutual funds in CRSP data (see Pastor, Stambaugh and Taylor (2015) for the issue of missing CUSIPs on mutual
funds and various ways of addressing that).
27
   Our further investigation shows that some households reinvest part of their dividend income with some delay
and therefore the annual “MPC” out of dividend income is slightly smaller than the monthly “MPC” out of
dividends.
                                                      21
capital gains and dividend income and therefore is the closest in spirit to our setting. Given the
fact that in this data the measurement error in capital gains is not correlated with the passive
capital gains, it is not surprising that our estimated MPCs based on annual data and monthly
data are almost the same. The estimated “MPCs” out of capital gains and dividend income
using the brokerage data in the US resemble the result that we find for the Swedish households,
further validating our main estimates.

        This exercise provides evidence that the measurement error originated from not
observing intra-year transactions is, most probably, orthogonal to the measured "passive"
return. This could be because of the unpredictable nature of changes in holdings within the year
and the fact that changes in holdings do not predict returns. In other words, actual "active"
returns are measured returns plus noise uncorrelated with the passive return. 28


B.2. Measurement error in capital gains and first difference regressions
        We now turn to the discussion of bias due to capital gain measurement error while
estimating the MPC out of capital gains in first differences. Extending equations (9), (10), and
(11) to this new setting, for the OLS regression in the first differences to be unbiased, the
correlation below needs to be equal to zero.

                                                                                        2 ]

                                   + 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐[(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 − 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1

                                                                ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 , 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡2 − 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡−1
                                                                                                        2 ]
                                                                                                              (12)


        While the requirements for the first term of the covariance to be equal to zero or
negligible is similar to the requirements that we discussed for the level regressions, the
covariance in the second term can be different from zero. This is because any trend in the
portfolio of the household, for example, due to life cycle patterns in portfolio choice such as
accumulation or liquidation of assets depending on the income growth path, will result in a
negative correlation between the change in the portfolio of households from one year to the
next (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 − 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1
                   1 )
                         and the change within a year (i.e. 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 ). Assuming the


28
  We have also tested whether the fact that the capital gains have been imputed using price data from the end of
the year could be a concern. Specifically, we performed a similar analysis, but imputed households’ consumption
by changing our assumption about the price at which they traded their shares to June prices. These estimates are
very similar to the baseline ones.
                                                                  22
independence of stock returns across different years, 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐[(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 − 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1
                                                                           1 )
                                                                                 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 , 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 ∙
   2 ]
𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡−1 will be equal to zero. This assumption can be justified by the fact that we do control for
time fixed effect in all of our regressions. However, given the positive correlation of 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 and
𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡2 , the term 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐[(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 − 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1
                                      1 )
                                            ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 , 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∙ 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡2 ] can still be negative which biases the OLS
estimates of MPC in the first difference setting.

        However, our IV methodology ignores any variation in the capital gains that is
originated from the changes in households' portfolios across two years and only relies on the
changes in the capital gain that would have happened in the absence of any such changes (i.e.
   1
𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 ∙ (𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 − 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡−1 )). Therefore, the requirements for the impact of capital gain measurement
error on our first difference IV estimate to be negligible is similar to the requirements for
running the level regressions.


B.3. Household portfolio turnover and capital gain measurement error

        While we cannot test directly the size of the bias in our first difference IV estimates,
we now compare the estimated MPCs for households with high vs. low average annual turnover
to provide suggestive evidence on the size of the measurement error bias induced by lack of
data on capital gains. This comparison is not perfect, because the selection into high versus low
turnover is endogenous and can be correlated with behavioral characteristics of households that
may directly affect their consumption behavior. Moreover, our measure of household portfolio
turnover is based on the annual turnover of household portfolios and not portfolio turnovers
within the year. However, it is difficult to imagine that annual turnover and turnover within the
year are not highly correlated with each other.

        To be specific, we define a measure of similarity of household portfolios across years
based on the share of each stock or mutual fund for each household portfolio in a given year
and divide our sample in each wealth group into a high versus low turnover group. Table VII
shows similar estimates for the estimated MPC out of capital gains for low and high turnover
households across different wealth groups. Again, this result is suggestive of the limited
importance of the measurement error in capital gains in our first difference IV estimates of
MPC. However, as mentioned before, low turnover households are different from high turnover
households and are more likely to have more passive investment strategies and for example
they can be more likely to opt in automatic reinvestment of their dividends, which will result
in lower MPC out of dividends for this group.

                                                      23
VI.        Heterogeneity

           To provide further evidence on the mechanisms behind the results, we examine whether
households with different access to liquid wealth and those in different parts of their life cycle
exhibit heterogeneous consumption responses to changes in their portfolio returns.

           To investigate the effect of access to liquid wealth, we define "buffer-stock" households
as those whose level of liquid wealth (cash, stocks, funds, bonds, and endowment insurance)
is less than 6 months of disposable income and ask whether the response to capital gain differs
with being liquidity constrained. 29 For each wealth group, we interact capital gain and dividend
income with a dummy indicating whether a household is a "buffer-stock" household and
employ the corresponding instrumental variables. Note that hardly any households in the top
10% of the distribution qualify as "buffer-stock", and as a result, we do not have any reliable
interaction estimates for households in those two groups.

           Table VIII reports the results. We find that the interaction coefficients for capital gain
are statistically and economically significant. The results indicate that when households have
access to "high enough" liquidity, response to capital gain shocks varies much less across
different wealth groups. The result on the interaction term with capital gain also shows that the
buffer-stock households have significantly higher MPC out of capital gain. While this result is
consistent with the prediction of life cycle consumption models with financial frictions, such
as Carroll (1997) and Gourinchas and Parker (2002), it can also be consistent with a model in
which both lower financial wealth and higher MPCs are caused by the households being less
patient.

           The interaction terms with dividends are positive, but not statistically significant. This
can be partly rationalized by the fact that, even in models with financial frictions and
precautionary saving motivation, households’ consumption response to permanent changes is
not a function of how financially constrained the household is and is close to one. To the extent
that changes in dividend payments are perceived by households as relatively stable, we should
expect less heterogeneity in MPC out of dividend income between buffer-stock households and
other households. The second reason for the insignificant coefficient is that shocks to dividend
income (especially for households in the bottom 90th percentile of wealth distribution) account

29
  The 6-months of income threshold used here is somewhat arbitrary, but the results are also robust to using 3 or
9 months of income as the threshold.
                                                       24
for less than 1% of households’ annual income. This can make the standard errors in our
estimates of the MPC out of dividend income larger, which makes it even more difficult to find
a significant difference between MPC out of dividends for buffer-stock households compared
to other households.

       We also examine whether households in different parts of their life cycle exhibit
heterogeneous consumption responses to changes in their portfolio returns. To do so, we report
the estimates separately for three age groups: less than 40, between 40 and 55, and between 55
and 65 in Table IX. What seems to be clear here, especially in the case of heterogeneous
response to portfolio return, is that households consume more out of capital gains as they get
older. This is consistent with the predictions of life cycle models with less than complete
bequest motive, in which older unconstrained households have higher MPC out of transitory
income or wealth shocks, since they consume those gains over a shorter period of time and face
significantly less uncertainty about their lifetime income and wealth.


VII.   Robustness Analysis

       So far, we have abstracted from the potential role of other types of wealth in our
regressions. One could imagine that passive capital gains could be correlated with changes in
housing wealth or financial wealth net of portfolio. To investigate this, we add these controls
and instrument changes in housing wealth with the average changes at the municipality level.
The results are presented in Table X. The coefficient estimates for capital gains and dividend
income are not significantly affected. This suggests that our coefficients of interest are not
driven by changes in the value of other types of wealth.

       Additionally, although in our analysis all the variation in capital gains comes from
passive movements in individual stock prices, one may be concerned about the potential
determinants of the static portfolio choice of households, such as the riskiness of household
income or the co-movement of household income with the aggregate economy, and how those
affect household consumption. In order to alleviate these concerns, we go further by directly
matching households based on several characteristics, such as their financial wealth, age,
income, portfolio’s dividend yield, portfolio’s value, and share of directly held holdings (i.e.
not held through mutual funds).

       Specifically, we define bins based on: 10 wealth deciles, 9 age groups between 18 and
65, 10 income deciles within each wealth group, and 5 groups based on the share of directly

                                              25
held stocks within each wealth group. This results in 4,500 finely defined groups. We then re-
estimate our baseline regression in Table III, but let observations in each of these 4,500 bins to
have a different time trend. In other words, we only exploit the variation in capital gains and
consumption within these very narrowly defined groups in order to estimate the MPC out of
capital gain and dividend income. The results are presented in Table XI and overall confirm
our previous findings.

         In order to ensure that we are not capturing an spurious correlation between the
stockholding of individuals and their consumption, in Table IAVI we run placebo regressions
in which we match non-stockholders with a stockholder that looks closest to them based on
observable factors like wealth, age and income and investigate whether the imputed
consumption of the non-stockholders is correlated with the capital gains and dividend income
of their matched stock holders. Indeed we find that the estimated placebo MPCs are not
significantly different from zero.

         Finally, in our most restrictive specification, we use the variation for households who
share the same employer (for the head of the household) and also have similar wealth, income,
age and share of stocks in their portfolios. The same employer requirement ensures that our
results are not driven by any differential exposure of households’ income to the business cycle.
In particular, we define new bins based on each employer (firm) in our data, five wealth groups,
four income quartiles within each wealth group, three age groups (less than 35, 35-50, and
older than 50) and two groups based on the share of stocks within each wealth group. Then we
allow for workers within each bin to have a different time trend. The results are reported in
Table XII and confirm our baseline estimates. 30

         Another potential concern might be about the role of differential exposures to aggregate
risk factors in creating bias. Households with different portfolio weights might also have
different consumption growth paths. To shed light on whether the observed return differences
in the cross section are capturing ex-ante differences in loading on different risk factors or ex-
post idiosyncratic differences, we decompose our measure of total capital gains into a part that
can be explained by the loading on the four factor model and a residual (idiosyncratic returns),
and then replicate our MPC regressions. The idea is that even if households endogenously

30
   Note that the number of observations within each wealth category that we use to present results is reduced to
less than half of the number of observations in Table III. This is because for this specification we require at least
two workers with the same employer and the same bin based on wealth, income, age and stocks share. Also, the
reason that we have fewer wealth/income/age/share of directly held stock groups than the previous exercise is to
have enough number of final bins containing at least two households.
                                                         26
choose the loading of their portfolio on different factors, it will be difficult for them to predict
the idiosyncratic component of their returns. To be clear, we do not argue that the factor related
returns are expected, although they may be correlated with consumption growth. We only need
to assume that households do not have any predictive ability about the idiosyncratic component
of their returns and therefore, do not endogenously sort their portfolio based on that.
       In order to perform this exercise, we use a two-year rolling window to estimate the
loading of each individual stock or mutual fund on the Swedish stock market index and the
four factor model for Sweden and decompose each individual stock's return into factor related
and idiosyncratic returns.
       The results presented in Table XIII show that, once we control for individual
characteristics, such as financial wealth, income and demographics as well as time fixed
effects, which are all likely to drive the loading on the different factors, our estimated MPCs
are driven by the idiosyncratic component of the returns. Since most people are exposed to the
stock market through index funds, our controls are likely to capture most of the variation
generated by the factor related returns as this will be common across individuals. This is likely
to explain why the factor related returns do not seem to be driving households’ consumption
decision in a significant way.


VIII. Conclusion

       This paper takes advantage of a unique administrative dataset containing household
level information on stock holdings and imputed consumption for the entire Swedish
population to analyze whether stock market trends drive households’ spending habits and
whether this link depends on households’ overall wealth.

       Two main advantages of our approach set this paper apart from the existing literature.
First, we are able to address the endogeneity issues arising from the fact that a change in
portfolio value could be the result of passive changes in asset prices as well as active
(endogenous) rebalancing of portfolio and that factors, such as income shocks or bonus
payments, might increase both household consumption and household stockholdings by fixing
the portfolio weights of the households when computing the capital gains and the dividends to
the ones observed in previous years. Second, the scope of our data allows us to investigate the
heterogeneity in households’ response depending on the level of household wealth.



                                                27
       We uncover three main findings. First, we show that the MPC out of capital gains for
the households in the top 50% of the financial wealth distribution varies between 3-7% and it
generally goes down with wealth. On the other hand, it is significantly higher for the bottom
50% of the distribution. Importantly, we show that in the absence of limited access to liquid
wealth, there is not much heterogeneity in MPC out of stock wealth among households in
different parts of the wealth distribution. This is consistent with models of buffer-stock
consumption in which households with high enough liquid wealth behave according to the
predictions of permanent income hypothesis.

       We also find that the MPC out of dividends, for all of our wealth groups, is much larger
than the MPC out of capital gains. Higher MPC out of dividend payments is consistent with a
near rational behavior in which households optimize their consumption with respect to capital
gains and dividends income as if they were separate sources of income.

       To provide further evidence on the mechanisms driving the results, and in addition to
investigating the role of having access to enough liquid wealth compared to monthly disposable
income, we also examine whether within each wealth group, households in different parts of
their life cycle exhibit heterogeneous responses to changes in capital gains and dividend
income. We find that among households with enough financial wealth, MPC out of capital gain
is significantly larger for older households. This finding is consistent with life cycle models
such as Gourinchas and Parker (2002) and Cocco, Gomes and Maenhout (2005) where older
unconstrained households have higher MPC to transitory income (or wealth) shocks, since they
consume those gains over a shorter period of time and they face significantly less uncertainty
about their lifetime income and wealth.

Notes: This table reports summary statistics of financial characteristics as well as imputed consumption of
households in different wealth groups. Each observation refers to a household-year. Monetary values have been
reported in 1,000 SEK. The sample includes observations for years 2001-2007 and is restricted to households (1)
who participate in the stock market in two consecutive periods, (2) in which the head is younger than 65 years of
age, (3) with a fixed number of members in two consecutive periods, (4) who remain in the same municipality,
(5) where none of the members are self-employed, owns non-listed stocks, or any derivative products, and (6)
who have neither moved nor received any cash flow from the sale of real estate. We also drop households for
which we observe non-identified dividend payments. Finally, we drop households for which the calculated
financial asset return on their portfolio of stocks and mutual funds is in the bottom 1% or the top 1% of the return
distribution in each year, the change in financial cash flow is in the bottom or top 2.5% respective of corresponding
year-specific distribution, dividend income over 3-year average income is in the top 0.5% of the distribution,
capital gain over 3-year average income is in the bottom or top 0.5% of the distribution, or consumption over 3-
year average income is in the bottom or to 0.5% of the distribution. Ranking in the distribution of financial wealth
is based on financial wealth in year t-2 and is conducted before all other restrictions are imposed. Financial wealth
includes bank accounts, bond holdings, as well as stock holdings. Stock wealth includes both direct holding of
stocks as well as holding of mutual funds. Income includes both labor income and financial income minus
dividend income plus transfers. Portfolio gain is the passive return on the portfolio of the household as of the year
before. Dividend income is based on the dividends of identified assets. Consumption is imputed according to
equation (1).

Notes: The table reports the IV regression of change in households' consumption as a function of change in capital gain and dividend
income, controlling for the realized capital gains. Change in capital gain and dividend income is instrumented by their passive capital
gain and passive dividend income: Xit−1 . �rt − rt−1 � and Xit−1 . �Dt − Dt−1 � where Xit is a vector of stockholding shares of household
i in the beginning of year t; while rt and Dt are vectors of stock returns and dividends, as defined in Section III of the paper. The
sample is restricted to years 2005-2007 (i.e. 2006 and 2007 in the difference regressions). Other controls include income (net of dividend
payment), one year lagged financial wealth of the household as well as, NDit,t−1 , a dummy equal to one if the household did not receive
any dividend in both periods t and t − 1. Year fixed effects are included and standard errors are clustered at the household level. See
notes of Table I for description of variables and the restrictions on the sample. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%,
*=10%).

Notes: The table reports regression results of the consumption measure (net withdrawals) as a function of capital gains and dividend
income. The data used for the regressions comes from transaction level data from a large brokerage in the US (see Barber and Odean
2000 for more details) supplemented with monthly dividend distributions from CRSP. The data preparation follows the same steps in
Baker, Nagel and Wurgler. (2007) which results in a dataset containing monthly household information on total portfolio value, net
withdrawals (the consumption measure), capital gains, and dividend income. Column (1) shows the relationship between the
measurement error in imputed capital gains due to lack of transaction level data and passive annual capital gains based on annual
snapshot of the data. In Columns (2)-(5), similar to Baker, Nagel and Wurgler (2007), the dependent variables and all RHS variables
are scaled by the previous-year’s assets, such as in Column (2) is scaled by assets in year t-1 and Column (3) is scaled by assets in month
t-12. Column (2) repeats the analysis in Column (1) except for the normalized variables. Column (3) replicates the Table VI Regression
3 result in Baker, Nagel and Wurgler (2007). Column (4) investigates the relationship between net annual withdrawals and capital gains
and dividend income based on monthly data. Column (5) only uses annual snapshots of the data to estimate the relationship between
annual consumption and annual capital gains and annual dividend income. The net withdrawals and capital gains measures incorporate
a proxy for stocks and funds bought and sold during the year using midyear (June) prices. Constant not reported in the table. Robust
standard errors are reported. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).

Notes: Low vs. High Turnover has been defined based on the average turnover of a household in all periods within each wealth category.
The table reports the IV regression of change in households' consumption as a function of change in capital gain and dividend income
when change in capital gain and dividend income is instrumented by their passive capital gain and passive dividend income:
𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 . �𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 − 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡−1 � and 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 . �𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡 − 𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡−1 � where 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of stockholding shares of household i in the beginning of year t; while
𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 and 𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡 are vectors of stock returns and dividends, as defined in Section III of the paper. Controls include income (net of dividend
payment), one year lagged financial wealth of the household as well as, 𝑁𝑁𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 , a dummy equal to one if the household did not receive
any dividend in both periods 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑡𝑡 − 1. Year fixed effects are included and standard errors are clustered at the household level. See
notes of Table I for the restrictions on the sample. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).

Notes: The table reports the IV regression of change in households' consumption as a function of factor related and idiosyncratic change
in capital gain as well as dividend income. In order to perform this exercise, we use a two-year rolling window to estimate the loading
of each individual stock or mutual fund on the Swedish stock market index and the four factor model for Sweden and decompose each
individual stock's return to the part predicted by the four factor model and the residual part (idiosyncratic returns). Change in capital
gain and dividend income is instrumented by their passive capital gain and passive dividend income. The sample is restricted to the
2002-2007 period (2003-2007 difference). Wealth is represented in 1,000 SEK. Controls include income (net of dividend payment), one
year lagged financial wealth of the household as well as, 𝑁𝑁𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 , a dummy equal to one if the household did not receive any dividend
in both periods 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑡𝑡 − 1. Year fixed effects are included and standard errors are clustered at the household level. See notes of Table
I for description of variables and the restrictions on the sample. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).

Note: This table reports summary statistics of household stock wealth and its components in thousands of USD, as reported by the
Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). Note that this sample includes both stockholders and non-stockholders. Each observation refers
to a household-year. The sample includes observations for the year 2016. Because the SCF is not an equal-probability design (some
types of households are overrepresented, particularly those with higher financial wealth), the Federal Reserve assigns analysis weights
to each household in the sample. These weights were used in calculating the summary statistics reported above, and each panel reports
the number of actual observations used as well as the equivalent number of observations in the weighted sample. Stock wealth is the
sum of directly held stocks, quasi-liquid retirement accounts, stock mutual funds, and combination (/other) mutual funds. Share is the
share of stock wealth for each group that is outside the retirement accounts.
