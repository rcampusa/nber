                                             ABSTRACT

I show that accounting for cross-industry variation in trade elasticities greatly magnifies the estimated
gains from trade. The main idea is as simple as it is general: While imports in the average industry
do not matter too much, imports in some industries are critical to the functioning of the economy, so
that a complete shutdown of international trade is very costly overall.

1         Introduction

Either the gains from trade are small for most countries or the workhorse models of trade

fail to adequately capture those gains. This uncomfortable conclusion seems inevitable given

recent results in quantitative trade theory. As shown by Arkolakis et al (2012), the gains

from trade can be calculated in the most commonly used quantitative trade models from the

observed share of a country’s trade with itself,              ,   and the elasticity of aggregate trade ‡ows
                                                                                  1
with respect to trade costs, , using the formula  = (  )¬  .1 Using standard methods

to obtain estimates of           and , I show below that this implies that a move from complete

autarky to 2007 levels of trade would increase real income by only 16.5 percent on average

among the 50 largest economies in the world.

         In this paper, I argue that the workhorse models of trade actually predict much larger

gains once the industry dimension of trade ‡ows is taken into account. The main idea is

as simple as it is general: While imports in the average industry do not matter too much,

imports in some industries are critical to the functioning of the economy, so that a complete

shutdown of international trade is very costly overall. In particular, I show that the above
                                             ¬ ~1
formula can be written as  = (  )                in a multi-industry environment, where the aggregate
1                                                                  1
~
   is now a weighted average of the industry-level                .   The point is that if  is close to zero
                        1                                                                                   1
in some industries,        is close to in…nity in these industries which is su¢ cient to push             ~
                                                                                                               up

a lot. Loosely speaking,  is a weighted average of  so that the exponent of the aggregate

formula is the inverse of the average of the trade elasticities whereas the exponent of the

industry-level formula is the average of the inverse of the trade elasticities.

         I make this point in the context of a simple Armington (1969) model in which consumers

have CES preferences within industries and goods are di¤erentiated by country of origin. As

is well-known, the trade elasticities then depend on the elasticities of substitution through

the simple relationship  =            ¬ 1. Estimating these elasticities at the 3-digit level using the

standard method developed by Feenstra (1994) and re…ned by Broda and Weinstein (2006), I

show that the industry-level formula predicts that a move from autarky to 2007 levels of trade
     1
    This includes the Armington (1969) model, the Krugman (1980) model, the Eaton and Kortum (2002)
model, and the Melitz (2003) model. The aggregate trade elasticity  corresponds to di¤erent structural
parameters in di¤erent models.

increases real income by 48.6 percent on average which is around three times the number the

aggregate formula predicts. It increases even further once I allow for non-traded goods and

intermediate goods which have opposing e¤ects on the gains from trade. All things considered,

I …nd that the gains from trade average 55.9 percent among the 50 largest economies in the

year 2007.2

       While my point may seem obvious once stated, I believe it has not been made explicitly

before. Arkolakis et al (2012) brie‡y discuss a multi-industry formula in an extension but

never contrast it to their aggregate formula or use it to actually calculate the gains from trade.

Caliendo and Parro (2015), Hsieh and Ossa (2012), Ossa (2014), and others work with multi-

industry versions of standard trade models but also do not point out that cross-industry

heterogeneity in the trade elasticities has the potential to greatly magnify the gains from

trade. Closest in spirit is perhaps the contribution by Edmond et al (2012) which measures

the gains from trade originating from pro-competitive e¤ects in an oligopolistic trade model.

A key …nding is that such pro-competitive e¤ects are large if there is a lot of cross-industry

variation in markups which is the case if there is a lot of cross-industry variation in the

elasticities of substitution.3

       Having said this, Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014) perform closely related calculations

in recently published contemporaneous work. In particular, they also work out the gains from

trade using the aggregate and industry-level formulas considering cases with and without

intermediate goods. While my analysis features more industries (252 instead of 31), more

countries (50 instead of 34), and uses di¤erent data (GTAP instead of WIOD), the main

distinction lies in the elasticity estimates. Instead of relying on elasticity estimates from the

literature, I estimate them using the Feenstra (1994)-Broda and Weinstein (2006) approach.

This allows me to estimate con…dence intervals for the elasticities and, in turn, also con…dence
   2
     While my general point also extends to imperfectly competitive gravity models such as Krugman (1980)
and Melitz (2003), the particular gains from trade predicted by my multi-sector Armington (1969) model are
only exactly the same in other perfectly competitive gravity models such as Eaton and Kortum (2002). This is
because the exact isomorphism between "old" and "new" trade models does not apply in the case of multiple
industries as shown by Arkolakis et al (2012). However, recent calculations by Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare
(2014) suggest that even with multiple industries the gains from trade are quite similar in "old" and "new"
trade models.
   3
     Related points have, of course, also been made in other areas of macroeconomics. For example, Nakamura
and Steinsson (2010) show how cross-industry heterogeneity in menu costs substantially increases the degree of
monetary non-neutrality. Also, Jones (2011) argues that cross-industry complementarities through intermediate
goods matter a great deal for understanding cross-country di¤erences in incomes.

intervals for the gains from trade. Overall, the gains from trade appear to be quite precisely

estimated with the average 95-percent con…dence interval ranging from 49.3 percent until 62.5

percent.

    The remainder of this paper is divided into four sections. In Section 2, I develop a multi-

industry Armington (1969) model of trade in …nal and intermediate goods and show what

it implies for the measurement of the gains from trade. In Section 3, I describe the data

and discuss all applied aggregation, interpolation, and matching procedures. In Section 4, I

discuss the elasticity estimation and give an overview of the obtained results. In Section 5, I

report the gains from trade for 50 countries in the world and document that a small share of

industries typically accounts for a large share of the gains from trade.



2    Model

There are  countries indexed by  or  and  industries indexed by  or . In each country,

consumers demand an aggregate …nal good  and industry  producers demand an aggregate

intermediate good  . These aggregate goods are Cobb-Douglas combinations of industry-

speci…c traded varieties  di¤erentiated by the location of their production. To be clear,

 denotes the quantity of the industry  traded variety from country  available in country

 and it is at that level of disaggregation that trade physically takes place. In sum,

    Notice that I allow the Cobb-Douglas shares of the aggregate intermediate good to vary

by country , upstream industry , and downstream industry , which allows me to match

input-output tables from around the world. The aggregate …nal good translates one-for-one

          There is perfect competition and the shipment of an industry  traded variety from country

solved by invoking the standard requirements that consumers maximize utility, …rms maximize

pro…ts, …rms make zero pro…ts, and all markets clear. Since the model’s solution should be

intuitive to most readers, I con…ne myself to sketching some core aspects here.

          The value of industry  trade ‡owing from country  to country ,  , follows the

country  in country ,  is the ideal price index of all industry  varieties available in

country , and  is total expenditure on all industry  varieties in country  originating

to the functioning of the economy.8

        Notice that this point is overlooked if the aggregate formula is used. In the special case

elasticity. If the multi-industry model is correct, the aggregate trade elasticity                           ¬ 1 is some

weighted average of the industry-level trade elasticities                              ¬ 1 because the latter ultimately

govern how trade ‡ows respond to trade costs. Loosely speaking, the exponent of the aggregate

formula is therefore the inverse of the average of the trade elasticities whereas the exponent

of the industry-level formula is the average of the inverse of the trade elasticities which is

di¤erent as long as the elasticities vary across industries.9

        In the empirical application, I report results using the industry-level and aggregate for-

mulas discussed above. In addition, I also consider the simpler formulas which arise in the

special case without non-traded and intermediate goods. While non-traded goods tend to

dampen the gains from trade, intermediate goods tend to amplify them so that abstracting

from both turns out to be a reasonable …rst pass. I remove non-traded goods by simply nar-

rowing down the set of included industries, as I discuss below. I remove intermediate goods

by considering the special case with                 = 1 for all  and  which yields the modi…ed formulas

      In the context of their discussion of aggregation biases in elasticity estimations, Imbs and Mejean (forth-
coming) seem to conjecture that the gains from trade estimated using the aggregate formula would be the same
as the gains from trade estimated using the industry-level formula if the aggregate trade elasticity is estimated
using a method which does not su¤er from aggregation bias. A simple thought experiment reveals that this
cannot be the case. In particular, suppose that  ! 1 in one industry so that 
                                                                                        

main text. While this situation would imply that industry ’s trade elasticity is zero, it would certainly not
imply that any reasonably measured aggregate trade elasticity is zero, which would be required, however, for
the aggregate formula to correctly predict in…nite gains from trade.
    9
      Notice that this can also be understood in terms of the familiar Jensen’s inequality. To be able to use the
aggregate formula, one essentially has to compute the aggregate trade elasticity as  =  ¬ 1  [ ( )], where
 ( ) = 1 is a convex and decreasing function of  . As a result,         [ ] by Jensen’s inequality, where
 [ ] represents the weighted arithmetic average that is implicitly estimated when estimating aggregate trade

eighth version of the Global Trade Analysis Project database (GTAP 8) which I supplement

with the widely used NBER-UN trade data from the time periods 1994-2008 when I need time

variation or a …ner disaggregation of industries. The GTAP 8 database is a carefully cleaned,

fully documented, publicly available, and globally consistent database covering 129 countries

and 57 industries which span all sectors of the economy.11

       It is not obvious at what level of aggregation my analysis should be performed. On the

one hand, the main point of the paper is that excessive aggregation is likely to introduce

biases which suggests that a low level of aggregation should be preferred. On the other

hand, my Cobb-Douglas assumptions in consumption (                           is constant) and production (          
                                                                                                                  

is constant) seem less reasonable the narrower the industry classi…cation which suggests that

disaggregating too …nely is problematic as well. Since departing from the Cobb-Douglas

assumption seems challenging particularly on the production side where it is the natural

interpretation of national input-output accounts, I choose the SITC-Rev3 3-digit level as a

compromise but also report results at a higher level of aggregation as a sensitivity check. After

constructing a cross-walk between the GTAP 8 data and the NBER-UN data, I am left with

251 industries from agriculture, mining, and manufacturing and a residual one aggregating

all other industries available in the GTAP database.

       The NBER-UN data is originally at the SITC-Rev2 4-digit level and I convert it to the

SITC-Rev3 3-digit level using a concordance from the Center for International Data at UC

Davis. I then match the SITC-Rev3 3-digit industries to the GTAP industries using a con-

cordance which I manually constructed with the help of various concordances available from

the GTAP website. By design, the SITC classi…cation focuses on traded goods only so that

the residual industry aggregates over the remaining industries of the economy which have

relatively little trade (the residual industry has an average                   of 0.94 compared to an average

     of 0.63 elsewhere and includes sectors such as construction and services). I will therefore

refer to the residual industry as the non-traded industry in the following even though I will

actually treat it as a traded industry with little trade.

   To construct             and   ,   I disaggregate the GTAP 8 data using bilateral trade shares

from the NBER-UN data. In particular, I calculate what share of each bilateral GTAP indus-

try trade ‡ow should be attributed to each bilateral SITC-Rev3 3-digit trade ‡ow from the

NBER-UN data and then superimpose these shares onto the GTAP 8 data so that everything

aggregates back to the GTAP 8 data in the end. Since internal trade ‡ows are not reported

in the NBER-UN data, this strategy only works for international trade ‡ows and I simply

apportion internal trade ‡ows to SITC-Rev3 3-digit sectors uniformly.

   The GTAP 8 data includes input-output accounts for all included countries which I use to

calculate       and
                      .   One problem with input-output accounts for my purposes is that they

separate …rms’purchases into intermediate consumption (which is reported in the main body

of the input-output tables for each upstream-downstream industry pair) and …xed investment

(which is reported in a separate column of the input-output tables for each upstream industry

only) depending on how …rms treat these purchases in their balance sheets. Since I do not

explicitly allow for investment in my model, I scale all entries referring to …rms’intermediate

consumption by the total investment to intermediate consumption ratio of the corresponding

upstream industry to obtain a more accurate picture of what …rms actually buy.

   For example, for each piece of "other machinery and equipment" classi…ed as intermediate

consumption in the US, there are 0.8 additional pieces classi…ed as …xed investment on average,

and I scale all intermediate consumption values in the input-output matrix by 1.8 to account

for this. Using this scaled data, I then simply read o¤ the share of intermediate consumption

spending of downstream industry  on upstream industry ,                  ,   as well as the associated share

4    Estimation

Using the abovementioned NBER-UN bilateral trade data for the years 1994-2008, I estimate

the elasticities of substitution      using the method developed by Feenstra (1994) and re…ned

by Broda and Weinstein (2006) for all 251 matched SITC-Rev3 3-digit traded industries (I

simply use the average        for the residual non-traded industry). This method identi…es the

elasticities from variation in the variances and covariances of demand and supply shocks across

countries and over time. I base my estimation on the instructions in Feenstra (2010) in which

the method is particularly clearly explained. My estimating equation is equation (2.21) in

Feenstra (2010) which I estimate using weighted least squares following the code provided

in Appendix 2.2 of Feenstra (2010). However, I do not focus on a single importer, but pool

across the 49 importers considered in my analysis (I keep all exporters available in the data).

This is not only consistent with my theoretical assumption that                    does not vary by country

but also gives me a much larger dataset with over 5 million price-quantity pairs.

    Table 1 lists the resulting elasticity estimates in increasing order together with the SITC-

Rev3 code and an abbreviated description of the corresponding industry. As can be seen,

they range from 1.54 to 25.05 and have a mean of 3.63 which is within the range of other

estimates in the literature. Table 1 also reports the associated 95-percent con…dence intervals

which I obtained by bootstrapping with 1,000 repetitions per industry. When resampling, I

always clustered by exporter and importer to ensure that it is conducted separately for each

exporter-importer pair. As can be seen, the con…dence intervals vary widely by industry and

are quite large on average. In particular, the average lower bound is 2.32 and the average

upper bound is 8.16 suggesting that it might be important to account for estimation error in

    when assessing the reliability of estimates of the gains from trade.12



5         Results

Table 2 summarizes the changes in real income resulting from a move from autarky to year

2007 levels of trade. Columns 1-3 ("Unadjusted") focus on the special case without non-traded

and intermediate goods while columns 4-6 ("Adjusted") adjust for these e¤ects. Recall that

the special case without non-traded and intermediate goods involves dropping the residual

non-traded industry as well as setting             = 1 for all  and . The results under "Naive Gain"

are computed using the aggregate formulas, the entries under "True Gain" are computed

using the industry-level formulas, and the entries under "Ratio" are simply the ratio of the

two. When using the aggregate formulas, I work with                 = 394 which is the trade-weighted

cross-industry average of all          .   When allowing for non-traded and intermediate goods, I

further construct aggregate           by calculating the economy-wide share of value added in gross

production.

         As can be seen, allowing for cross-industry heterogeneity in the trade elasticities substan-

tially increases the estimated gains from trade for all countries in the sample. While the

unadjusted median "naive" gains are only 16.5 percent, the unadjusted median "true" gains

are actually 48.6 percent so that accounting for cross-industry heterogeneity multiplies the me-

dian gains from trade by a factor of 3.1. Similarly, the adjusted median "naive" gains are only

16.9 percent while the adjusted median "true" gains are actually 55.9 percent, representing

an increase by a factor of 3.3. While the magni…cation e¤ect from having multiple industries

is similar to the one estimated by Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014), my estimates of the

absolute gains from trade are quite a bit larger than theirs.13

         Table 3 decomposes the "true" gains from trade into the own trade share and the exponent

from formula (7). This decomposition helps understand why allowing for non-traded and

intermediate goods does not change the gains from trade estimates that much. On the one
    12
     Recall that the Feenstra (1994)-Broda and Weinstein (2006) method assumes that all varieties are substi-
tutes which is why all elasticity estimates and con…dence intervals in Table 1 imply   1.
  13
     Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014) use the elasticity estimates of Caliendo and Parro (2015) which have
a higher variance, a higher mean, and a higher minimum value than the ones I use. The higher variance
explains why they …nd a similar magni…cation e¤ect despite using a higher level of aggregation. The higher
mean and higher minimum value explain why they estimate lower gains from trade.

hand, including non-traded industries raises the median own trade share from 63.8 percent

to 82.2 percent which tends to dampen the gains from trade. On the other hand, including

intermediate goods increases the median exponent from -0.9 to -2.3 which tends to magnify the

gains from trade. On average, these two forces are roughly o¤setting so that the unadjusted

special case provides a reasonable …rst pass. Columns 2 and 3 further reveal that most of the

variation in the unadjusted gains from trade is due to variation in    ,   while columns 5 and

6 point out that variation in the exponent is more pronounced in the presence of non-traded

and intermediate goods.

   This point is further explored in Figures 1-3. Figure 1 relates the unadjusted gains from

trade to the corresponding own trade shares and shows that the correlation is very tight.

Figure 2 does the same for the adjusted trade shares and it is clear that variation in the

exponent now plays a larger role. Figure 3 plots the unadjusted log gains from trade against

the adjusted log gains from trade and also includes a 45-degree line for ease of comparison.

As can be seen, allowing for non-traded and intermediate goods tends to lower the gains from

trade for richer countries but increase the gains from trade for poorer ones. The reason is that

richer countries tend to have higher expenditure shares on non-traded industries and are also

typically less dependent on imports for inputs that feature prominently in their input-output

accounts.

   Table 4 reports the 95-percent con…dence intervals for the "true" gains reported in Table

2. These con…dence intervals are constructed by re-calculating the gains from trade for each

of the 1,000 sets of bootstrapped elasticity estimates. Despite the considerable noise in the

elasticity estimates, the con…dence intervals around the "true" gains from trade are actually

tighter than one might have thought. In particular, the median lower bound of the con…dence

intervals of the unadjusted "true" gains from trade is 41.4 percent while the median upper

bound of these gains is 52.8 percent. Similarly, the median lower bound of the con…dence

intervals of the adjusted "true" gains from trade is 49.3 percent while the median upper

bound of these gains is 62.5 percent. This happens because most of the variation in the

bootstrapped elasticity estimates is in the right tail which is exactly where the gains from

trade do not respond to elasticity changes that much.

   Figure 4 illustrates that a large share of the adjusted "true" gains from trade can be


                                              12
attributed to a small share of critical industries. I construct this …gure based on the relation-
                 P     P
ship ln c
                              1        
         = ¬    =1     =1  ¬1   ln (  ) which follows immediately from the above

formulas for the gains from trade. First, I rank all industries  by their contribution to the
                              P
overall log gains from trade ¬ =1 1¬1   ln (  ) for each country. Then, I compute the

shares of the log gains from trade due to shares of most important industries by cumulating
       P
over ¬ =1 1¬1   ln (  ) for each country. Finally, I take the simple average of these

shares across countries. As can be seen, the 10 percent most important industries account for

roughly 90 percent of the log gains from trade on average.

    Table 5 explores the sensitivity of the gains from trade estimates from Table 2 to the level

of industry aggregation. In particular, it replicates Table 2 after …rst aggregating all data

back to the GTAP level using trade-weighted averages of the elasticity estimates from Table

1. At this level of aggregation, there are only 28 traded industries instead of the 251 traded

industries used before.14 By construction, the "naive" gains from trade are the same in Tables

2 and 5. However, the "true" gains from trade are lower in Table 5 than in Table 2, as one

would expect given the higher level of aggregation. For example, the adjusted median "true"

gains fall from 55.9 percent to 35.2 percent when the analysis is conducted at the GTAP level

instead of the 3-digit level.



6     Conclusion

In this paper, I argued that accounting for cross-industry variation in trade elasticities greatly

magni…es the estimated gains from trade. The main idea was that a complete shutdown of

international trade is very costly even though imports in the average industry do not matter

too much since imports in some industries are critical to the functioning of the economy.

While I have made this point in the context of a simple Armington (1969) model, it should

be clear that it extends to other commonly used quantitative trade models. In an Eaton and
  14
     The original GTAP data actually features 42 traded industries. I aggregate them into 28 traded industries
by combining "paddy rice", "wheat", "cereal grains nec", "vegetables, fruits, nuts", "oil seeds", "plant-based
…bres", "crops nec", and "processed rice" into "products of agriculture, etc", "bovine cattle, sheep and goats,
horses", "animal products nec", and "wool, silk-worm cocoons" into "live animals, etc", "raw milk" and "dairy
products" into "milk and dairy products", "bovine meat products", "meat products nec", and "vegetable oils
and fats" into "meat, oil, etc", and "sugar cane, sugar beet", "sugar", and "food products nec" into "food
products nec". This is necessary to ensure that each SITC-Rev3 3-digit sector uniquely maps into one GTAP
sector.

Kortum (2002) model, for example, the interpretation would be that international productiv-

ity di¤erences are so large in some industries that replacing e¢ ciently-produced imports with

ine¢ ciently-produced domestic substitutes in these industries would imply extreme costs.

Note: This table summarizes the changes in real income resulting from a move from autarky to year 2007 levels of trade. The results under "True Gain"
are computed using the industry‐level formulas, the results under "Naïve Gain" are computed using the aggregate formulas, and the results under
"Ratio" simply compute the ratio of the two. Columns 1‐3 do not adjust for non‐traded or intermediate goods while columns 4‐6 do. I include Hong Kong
in my definition of China.

Note: This table provides more detail on the calculation of the gains from trade in Table 2. In particular, it again lists the gains from trade computed
using the industry‐level formulas and explicitly shows the λ and the exponent from formula (7). Notice that the gains and the λ are expressed as
percentages so that "True Gain (%)"=100*(("Lambda (%)"/100)^"Exponent"‐1). Columns 1‐3 do not adjust for non‐traded or intermediate goods while
columns 4‐6 do.

Note: This table summarizes the changes in real income resulting from a move from autarky to year 2007 levels of trade using a 2‐digit instead of a 3‐
digit industry aggregation. The results under "True Gain" are computed using the industry‐level formulas, the results under "Naïve Gain" are computed
using the aggregate formulas, and the results under "Ratio" simply compute the ratio of the two. Columns 1‐3 do not adjust for non‐traded or
intermediate goods while columns 4‐6 do. I include Hong Kong in my definition of China. The GTAP aggregation features 28 traded and one non‐traded
industry while the earlier 3‐digit aggregation features 251 traded and one non‐traded industry.
