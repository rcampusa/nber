                                            ABSTRACT

For those who think of Cleveland as a decaying rustbelt city, it may seem difficult to believe that this

northern Ohio port was once a hotbed of high-tech startups, much like Silicon Valley today. During

the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Cleveland played a leading role in the development

of a number of second-industrial-revolution industries, including electric light and power, steel,

petroleum, chemicals, and automobiles. In an era when production and inventive activity were both

increasingly capital-intensive, technologically creative individuals and firms required greater and

greater amounts of funds to succeed. This paper explores how the city's leading inventors and

technologically innovative firms obtained financing, and finds that formal institutions, such as banks

and securities markets, played only a very limited role. Instead, most funding came from local

investors who took long-term stakes in start-ups formed to exploit promising technological

discoveries, often assuming managerial positions in these enterprises as well. Business people who

were interested in investing in cutting-edge ventures needed help in deciding which inventors and

ideas were most likely to yield economic returns, and we show how enterprises such as the Brush

Electric Company served multiple functions for the inventors who flocked to work there. Not only

did they provide forums for the exchange of ideas, but by assessing each other's discoveries, the

members of these technological communities conveyed information to local businessmen about

which inventions were most worthy of support.

                Financing Invention during the Second Industrial Revolution:

                                      Cleveland, 1870-1920



       Since the early nineteenth century, the United States economy has benefited from a legal,

economic, and cultural environment that strongly encouraged technological innovation.

Nonetheless, there has been substantial change over time in the way new technological ideas

have been generated and exploited. In the early years, the dominant practice was for inventors to

commercialize their ideas themselves. During the middle two quarters of the nineteenth century,

however, there was a growing division of labor between those who invented and those who

exploited inventions commercially. Most new developments during this period involved

mechanical technologies, and consequently the amount of capital and formal education that an

inventor needed to set up shop was relatively low. Firms were eager to secure patent rights to

cutting-edge technologies, and many creative individuals learned to support themselves as

independent inventors by selling their intellectual property in the market. By the end of the

century, however, the more science-based technologies associated with the second industrial

revolution had significantly raised the capital requirements (both human and physical) for

effective invention, and inventors found it increasingly difficult to maintain their independence

(Lamoreaux and Sokoloff 1999, 2002, 2003, and 2004).

       This turn-of-the-century period is conventionally associated with the rise of R&D

laboratories inside large firms, but as we show in this article, it was also a time when large

numbers of new enterprises were being formed in the “high-tech” sectors of the economy.

Although some productive inventors gave up their independence and took employment positions

in the research departments of large-scale enterprises, others became principals in start-ups or
                                                                                                     2


spin-offs formed to exploit their inventions. In some cases, these new firms effectively

replicated the mid-nineteenth century division of labor. That is, they were essentially

development facilities, organized to provide resources for the inventor’s ongoing work and to

market the resulting technologies to other enterprises. In most cases, however, the firms were

organized with the aim of commercializing a particular line of technology with the inventor’s

assistance. Even in these cases, however, inventors often obtained space and resources to

continue their inventive activity—facilities that often subsequently evolved into R&D labs.

       New firms, we argue, provided much of the technological leadership in second-industrial-

revolution industries. This leadership was especially pronounced in the East North Central

region of the country. Indeed, the formation of new firms seems to have thrived in an area that

was located, much like Silicon Valley in the late twentieth century, at a significant distance from

the nation’s main capital markets and established financial institutions. It is thus of particular

interest to understand the locational dynamics of this phenomenon—how inventors in such a

region were able to attract the attention and resources of those with capital, why investors there

were particularly willing to risk funds in such ventures, and what the role of formal financial

institutions was in supporting the formation of new firms.

       Because such questions can really only be answered in the context of a local case study,

we focus our analysis on Cleveland, Ohio, a city that played a leading role in the development of

a remarkable number of second-industrial-revolution industries, including electric light and

power, steel, petroleum, chemicals, and automobiles. In the next two sections, we provide an

overview of Cleveland’s industrial and financial development and place our study in context by

comparing data on Cleveland inventors to similar information for a nationwide sample of

inventors. We then show how Cleveland’s initial locational advantages were magnified, perhaps
                                                                                                    3


serendipitously, by a small number of successful enterprises that both exemplified the wealth-

creation possibilities of these new technologies and served as hubs of overlapping networks of

inventors and financiers. Focusing on one of the most important of these hubs—the Brush

Electric Company—we show how such enterprises served multiple functions for the inventors

who gathered around them. On the one hand, they were places that fostered technological cross-

fertilization and the exchange of ideas about how to solve particularly difficult problems. On the

other hand, they were places where the technological community could pass on—validate—

promising ideas and thus perform a useful vetting function for local capitalists. This validation

not only opened up sources of venture capital to startup firms connected to the “hub” or nodal

firm, but also plugged these enterprises into the network of formal financial institutions that local

capitalists were simultaneously building, giving them access to commercial credit and ultimately

to the possibility of raising additional capital on a formal local exchange.



The Rise of Cleveland

       Located on Lake Erie at the terminus of the Ohio Canal, Cleveland had long been the

commercial center of northeastern Ohio, but it became a manufacturing powerhouse during the

last third of the nineteenth century. Cleveland’s first heavy industrial enterprise, a firm that

produced steam furnaces, was founded in the 1830s, and its first iron rolling mills were built in

the 1850s, but the city’s rise as a manufacturing center was largely a post-Civil War phenomenon

(Miller and Wheeler 1990, 50-51, 70-71). As late as 1870, Cuyahoga County, where Cleveland

is located, ranked number twenty-two in manufacturing output among counties nationwide; by

1920, it had risen to fourth place (over the same period Cleveland’s ranking in terms of

population rose from 20 to 7) (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1860-1920). Intriguingly, although the
                                                                                                                      4


average size of firms in the county rose over the same period, the local economy continued to be

characterized relatively small enterprises (see Table 1). In 1870, the county ranked number

sixty-six among the hundred largest manufacturing counties in terms of the average number of

workers employed per establishment. In 1920 its rank on this scale was still only fifty-two.

Although some Cleveland enterprises grew very large, high rates of formation of new firms kept

the average size of firms low.1

         Many of the new firms founded in Cleveland during the late nineteenth and early

twentieth centuries were in industries associated with the second industrial revolution.

Cleveland’s location gave it convenient access to Lake Superior iron ore, so it is not surprising

that iron and steel was the city’s leading industry (in terms of value of output) throughout the

nineteenth century, falling to second place in 1910 and to third in 1920 (see Table 2). Machine

tools was also persistently among the city’s top three industries throughout the period 1870 to

1920. By 1910, however, automobiles had become the third largest industry, and it would climb

to number one by 1920. During that same decade electrical machinery rose to fourth place, so

that the city’s top industries by 1920 were automobiles, machine tools, iron and steel, and

electrical machinery. Chemical products, such as paints and varnishes, also had a major

presence in the city and its surrounding areas.2

         Cleveland’s financial sector also grew rapidly over the half-century between 1870 and

1920. In 1870, the city was home to five national banks, most of which were originally founded

in the 1840s, and one very substantial savings institution, the Society for Savings founded in


         1
            From 1880 to 1900 the number of firms in Cuyahoga County tripled with little or no change in their
average size. During the first decade of the twentieth century, however, the number of firms in the city fell by a
third, despite continued growth in employment and output. As a consequence, average firm size nearly doubled.
Between 1910 and 1920, however, the number of firms rebounded and the average size of firms did not change.
          2
            Cleveland was also, of course, the home of Standard Oil, and petroleum refining was the city’s third
largest manufacturing industry in 1890. As the locus of crude-oil production shifted to other regions, however, the
city’s refining capacity declined.
                                                                                                              5


1849, with total deposits under $0.5 million. By 1920, the city was home to thirty-eight banks,

savings institutions, and trust companies with total deposits amounting to more than $800

million. More than a dozen national banks were founded during this period, though because of

mergers, the net gain in number over the entire period was only two. After the Ohio legislature

passed enabling legislation, a dozen trust companies were organized, eleven of which remained

active through this period. Similarly, an 1868 law permitting the formation of building-and-loan

and savings-and-loan associations stimulated a rash of entry, but many of these institutions were

short-lived.3

        From the 1816 founding of Cleveland’s first bank, the Commercial Bank of Lake Erie,

the city’s leading businessmen were active in founding its most important financial institutions,

so it is not surprising that industrialists played significant roles in organizing and running many

of the banks and trust companies formed after 1870.4 For example, Robert Hanna helped to

organize the Ohio National Bank in 1876, eight years after founding the Cleveland Malleable

Iron Company. His nephew and partner, Marcus Hanna, organized the Union National Bank in

1884, served as its president for at least a decade, and also subsequently served on the board of

the Commercial National Bank, the Guardian Trust Company, and the People’s Savings and

Loan Association.5 Similarly, C. A. Grasselli, a leading chemical manufacturer, was founder and

president of the city’s first trust company, Broadway Savings and Trust (1884), and also its

second trust company, Woodland Avenue Savings and Trust (1886).6 Prominent among the

founders of the Cleveland Trust Company (1895) were Fayette Brown, president of the Brown

Hoisting Machine Company, and Jacob D. Cox, owner of the Cleveland Twist Drill Company.7

Brown’s son, Harvey H. Brown, who replaced him as president of the Hoisting Company, served

on the board of the Bank of Commerce.8 Many savings institutions also had industrialists among

their organizers. For example, the founding board of directors of the Detroit Street Savings and

Loan included Theodor Kundtz, an inventor and manufacturer of sewing-machine cabinets and

auto bodies, and E. R. Edson, an inventor and manufacturer of machinery for extracting oil and

other products from fish.9

        Cleveland’s equity markets also developed during this period. Daily quotations of

government bond prices first appeared in the Cleveland Plain Dealer in 1880, and by 1886 the

daily lists included prices for the stocks of local banks, street railroad companies, iron mines, and

“miscellaneous” securities, including industrials. Moreover, advertisements in the Plain Dealer

offered shares for sale in companies such as the Cleveland Stock Yard Company, the Brush

Electric Company, and Brush Electric Light and Power. The continued growth both of local

brokerage houses and of trading in local securities resulted in 1900 in the formal organization of

the Cleveland Stock Exchange. Although local brokers led the formation of the exchange, its

founding members also included prominent Cleveland industrialists such as Harvey Brown,

Jeptha Wade, and Daniel R. Hanna.10 As was the case for most other exchanges at that time,

railroads initially dominated the listings. But the Cleveland market from the beginning handled

the securities of a broader diversity of firms, including relatively more industrials. For example,

52 percent of the firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1900 were railroads, and in

1910 the figure was still 48 percent. In 1903, railroads accounted for only 40 percent of the

listings on the Cleveland exchange, and by 1910 the share had fallen to 15 percent. Over the

same period, the share of industrials on the Cleveland exchange rose from 10 to 15 percent, and

in 1910 the exchange also listed ten local telephone companies.11



Cleveland Inventors in National Context

        By the late nineteenth century, Cleveland was not only a center of production in second

industrial revolution industries, it was also a hotbed of patenting. In 1900 it ranked eighth out of all

U.S. cities in the total number of patents granted to residents. Moreover, if the calculation is limited

to patents deemed by official examiners to have made significant contributions to the industrial art

of the period, Cleveland was the fifth most technologically important city in the country (Fogarty,

Garofalo, and Hammack n.d., 43-46). The purpose of this section is to set Cleveland’s patenting

record in the context of changes that were occurring in the organization of inventive activity across

the United States. We show that, at a time when many productive inventors appear to have been

taking employment positions in large-scale enterprises, inventors residing in Midwestern cities such

as Cleveland were disproportionately likely to become principals in firms formed to exploit their

inventions.

        As we have already suggested, the increase in patenting activity that occurred in the mid-

nineteenth century U.S. was associated with a rise in the proportion of inventions attributable to

highly productive inventors. Many talented individuals took advantage of the period’s vibrant

market for technology to specialize in the generation of inventions, financing their creative work

        11
            Cleveland Stock Exchange Handbook, 1903 and 1910. Even after ten years in operation, most trading in
local securities probably did not occur under the auspices of Exchange. Of the 105 firms it listed in 1910, the
Exchange reported trades for only twenty-six firms, amounting to total sales of approximately 40,000 common
shares and 20,000 preferred shares.
                                                                                                                   8


by selling off the rights to their patents. By the early twentieth century, however, this “golden

era of the independent inventor” was coming to an end, to a large extent, we argue, because the

rising amount of capital (both human and physical) required for effective invention was making

it increasingly difficult for inventors to survive on their own (Lamoreaux and Sokoloff 1999,

2002, 2003, and 2004; Hughes 1989, 15).

        This change is visible in the assignment behavior of a nationwide sample of more than

five hundred patentees whose surnames began with the letter “B.”12 The sample was generated,

first, by drawing three random cross-sectional samples from the lists of patents reported in the

Annual Reports of the Commissioner of Patents for the years 1870-71, 1890-91, and 1910-11,

and then, for those patentees whose last names began with “B,” collecting data on all patents

received during the twenty-five years before and after they appeared in our samples, including

whether and to whom the patents were assigned at issue. Table 3 divides the inventors into three

different cohorts (according to the cross-sectional sample from which they were originally

drawn) and also by the number of patents they obtained over their careers. It then categorizes

each of their patents according to whether or not it was assigned at issue, and if it was, whether

the assignment was in whole or part to an individual or to a company. Assignments to

companies were classified in the following way. We first checked to see whether the assignee

was a company with the same name as the patentee (indicating that the inventor was likely a

principal in the firm). If not, we classified as “large integrated companies” all assignees for

which financial information was reported in the Commercial and Financial Chronicle or in

Poor’s or Moody’s Manual of Industrial Securities (indicating that the company was important

enough to tap the national capital markets) or, alternatively, that were listed in an early-1920s


        12

2003, and 2004).

National Research Council directory of companies with research laboratories. The remaining

companies were divided into two groups: “other local companies,” if the firm was located in the

same city as the patentee; and “other companies” for all the rest.

        Perhaps the most striking feature of the estimates presented in Table 3 is the widening

contrast between the assignment behavior of the most specialized or productive patentees (those

with 10 or more patents over their careers) and inventors who seem to have been much less

specialized in this activity. By the 1910-11 cohort, the specialized inventors were assigning

nearly two-thirds of their patents at issue, while inventors with 5 or fewer career patents were

assigning only about a fifth. The identities of the assignees to which these two groups of

inventors transferred their patents also diverged increasingly over time. Whereas inventors with

five or less patents continued to assign mainly to individuals, often maintaining shares of the

patents themselves, inventors with ten or more patents were overwhelmingly assigning their

patents to companies. Moreover, by the third cohort, 22.5 percent and 37.7 percent of the patent

assignments made by this group of productive inventors went respectively to large integrated

companies and to firms that bore the name of the patentee. Indeed, virtually all of the patents

assigned to large integrated companies came from inventors with ten or more career patents, and

the share of this productive group in patents assigned to companies that bore the same name as

the inventor was almost has high.

        As Table 4 shows, these patterns had a pronounced regional character. Inventors,

especially highly productive ones, in the Midwest (East North Central states) were

disproportionately likely to assign their patents at issue to companies that bore their names:13

56.7 percent of their assignments went to such firms and only 7.4 percent to large integrated

        13
            Because the estimates in Table 4 were computed over all of the patents received by our sample of “B”’
inventors, it is the behavior of the more productive inventors that is most clearly reflected in our results. They
received the most patents and thus get more weight in these averages.
                                                                                                                    10


enterprises. The pattern in the Middle Atlantic was just the opposite, with 36.2 percent of

assignments going to large firms and only 4.4 to companies with the inventor’s name. New

England was an intermediate case, with 35.4 percent of assignments going to large enterprises

and an equivalent number to firms that shared the name of the inventor. Although regional

differences in industrial composition might in principle account for these disparities, the same

qualitative pattern holds when we control for the sectoral classification of the patents.14

         That the increase in assignments to large firms did indeed represent a decline in the

independence of inventors is suggested by the drop that occurred contemporaneously in what we

call “contractual mobility”—that is, the number of different assignees to whom the inventor

transferred his patents over the course of his career. As Table 5 indicates, after rising between

the cohorts of 1870-71 and 1890-91, the proportion of patentees who assigned their patents at

issue to four or more distinct assignees over their careers decreased between the 1890-91 and

1910-11 cohorts. The fall was greatest in the Middle Atlantic where the proportion of

assignments going to large enterprises was highest. Intriguingly, contractual mobility actually

increased in the Midwest, where inventors were most likely to assign their patents to firms that

bore their name. It seems that patentees who were able to attract investment in enterprises

formed to exploit their inventions were also able to maintain a significant degree of

independence.15



         14
             As our theory would predict, inventors whose patents were classified as being in sectors that would
normally be considered as having more technical or capital-intensive technologies, such as
electricity/telecommunications or heavy industry, were much more likely to assign their patents at issue and to make
assignments to large firms or firms that shared their name, than those whose patents were in sectors such as light
manufacturing or agriculture/food processing. The different patterns across sectors do not account for the regional
differences, however. For example, inventors who received patents classified as electricity/telecommunications or
as heavy industry were much more likely to assign them to large companies (as opposed to firms with the same
name) if they resided in the Middle Atlantic than if they resided in the East North Central states.
          15
             As we shall see from the data on Cleveland, the relatively high proportion of patents not assigned in this
region might also be taken as an indication of independence.
                                                                                                      11


        As might be expected, inventors found it easier to obtain this kind of financial backing if

they could demonstrate early in their careers that they had the “right stuff”—that is, that they had

the ability to generate economically valuable ideas. In Table 6, we look at how the assignment

behavior of inventors with ten or more patents evolved over their careers, using the earliest

patent as the beginning of each inventor’s career.16 For all three cohorts, there is evidence that

patentees were better able to transfer their property rights later in their careers than at the

beginning. The proportion of their patents that were not assigned at issue fell with the passage of

years, as did the proportion of those assigned in which the patentee maintained an interest. There

is also evidence that those who managed to find a market for their early inventions were better

able to pursue successful careers at invention. Indeed, what is most striking about the evidence

in the table is the disproportionate extent to which assignments to companies bearing the

inventors’ name occurred in the later phases of patentees’ careers. For the last (1910-11) cohort,

only 1.3 percent of the patents obtained by inventors in the first five years of their careers went

to companies that bore the patentee’s name. During the next ten years of their careers the figure

increased to 17.1 percent and, after 15 years had elapsed, to 32.6 percent. There was a similar,

though less pronounced, pattern in assignments to large integrated companies. While inventors

often had to establish track records before they could secure good R&D positions with large

firms, it appears that it was especially important for them to prove their inventive skill, either as

independent inventors or as employees, in order to obtain backing for start-up or spinoff

ventures.

        The purpose of our case study of Cleveland was to obtain, through detailed analysis of

local sources, a more concrete sense of how such talented inventors were able to attract the

attention and funds of the businessmen who would commercialize their technological

discoveries. The first step was to contextualize our study by exploring the extent to which

patterns of inventive activity in Cleveland were similar to those in the Midwest as a whole. To

this end, we collected samples of patent data for two groups of inventors resident in Cleveland at

the beginning of the twentieth century. For each group, we sought to identify patentees who

were likely to be among the most productive or specialized inventors of their cohort. The first

group (36 in number, accounting for 22.4 percent of the patents awarded to Cleveland patentees

in 1900) included inventors who met the following criteria: they received at least one patent in

1900, were also awarded a patent in either 1898 or 1902, and received a total of at least three

patents in those three years. We then collected information on all of the patents awarded to these

individuals in selected years from 1892 to 1912. We also added to this group several additional

Cleveland inventors who were sufficiently prominent to be profiled in the Dictionary of

American Biography and who secured patents during these years. For our second group, we

followed a somewhat different procedure. We compiled a list of all Cleveland inventors who

were awarded patents in 1912, examined their patenting records in 1910 and 1911, and then

selected the subset who received three or more patents in 1910, 1911, and 1912. This group

included 107 inventors who collectively received 43.9 percent of the patents awarded to

Cleveland inventors in 1912.

       Our next step was to collect as much information about these productive inventors as we

could. By consulting city directories for Cleveland, we were in most cases able to determine

whether the inventors were principals or employees of the firms to which they assigned their

patents or whether they had no such long-term attachments with their assignees. For many

inventors, moreover, we were able to obtain additional information that provided insight into

their patenting careers and the ways in which they obtained financing for their activities. This
                                                                                                      13


information came from mainly from manuscript collections, histories of individual firms,

biographies and autobiographies, specialized encyclopedias, and contemporary newspaper

reports. The results for the first sample are reported in the Appendix.

       As Table 7 shows, both groups of Cleveland inventors displayed roughly the same pattern

of assignments that we observed in our national sample for the East North Central states. The

proportions of patents assigned at issue, and the proportions assigned to companies are similar to

the figures for the 1890-91 and 1910-11 cohorts reported in Table 4. For example, the 1910-11

cohort of East North Central inventors assigned at issue 55.4 percent of their patents overall and

5.2 percent to individuals, as compared to 55.2 percent and 4.5 percent for the 1910-12

Cleveland inventors. But there were also some discrepancies. For example, assignments to large

integrated companies appear to have been relatively more common, and assignments to related

companies (as indicated by the company’s name or by the position of the inventor) somewhat

less so, among Cleveland inventors than those in the East North Central as a whole, but the

difference may be attributable to Cleveland’s status as one of the largest industrial cities in the

region. This notion receives some support from the figures reported in Table 8, which breaks

down the inventors in the first sample by the number of patents each obtained during this period.

We see that assignments to large integrated companies were disproportionately the work of

productive inventors who were employees of firms (or at least were not principals). For

example, Clinton A. Tower, a foreman and pattern maker for the National Malleable Castings

Company, assigned the bulk of the 17 patents he obtained in our sampled years to his employer

(see Appendix). Because Cleveland was home to a significant number of large companies, it

was also home to the inventors who worked for them.
                                                                                                                     14


         More importantly, however, the evidence shows that many productive inventors in

Cleveland, like their counterparts in the East North Central states as a whole, assigned their

patents to firms in which they had a direct interest. Indeed, from the information we were able to

collect from local sources, we can see that they typically served as officers of such enterprises.

Despite their close attachments to such firms, however, productive patentees in Cleveland seem

to have been able to maintain a considerable degree of independence. In this way too, they

resembled their counterparts throughout the region. Although our data do not allow us to

calculate measures of contractual mobility, in Table 8 we can see that the assignment patterns of

highly productive inventors who were principals in firms were very different from those of

highly productive inventors who were not. Although the former group made nearly 75 percent of

their assignments to the companies in which they were principals, they had strikingly lower rates

of assignment at issue (39.0 percent on average) than the other highly productive patentees in the

sample (74.7 percent). That they were able to retain ownership of such a high fraction of their

patents suggests that they maintained a remarkable degree of autonomy vis à vis the other

owners of their firms.17 Because these other owners included the main suppliers of capital to

their enterprises, the question naturally arises how inventors were able to secure financial

backing under such circumstances.



The Brush Electric Company

         At the simplest level, before they would be willing to invest in new technological

ventures, wealthy individuals had to be convinced of two things: first and most obviously, that it


         17
            It is worth noting that our examination of the more comprehensive listings of patent assignments
currently stored at the National Archives for several of these highly productive inventors (including Sidney Short
and Elmer Sperry) suggests that a number of their patents were assigned after issue.
                                                                                                        15


was indeed possible to earn high rates of return by putting their money in this kind of enterprise;

and second, that the particular technologies in which they were being asked to invest promised

significant returns. All that was really needed to satisfy the first condition was some enticing

examples of ventures that had made their backers rich. The second was more difficult, however,

because evaluating the merits of alternative projects required considerable technological

expertise. Our research on the financing of new enterprises in Cleveland suggests that a few

highly successful enterprises could help satisfy the second condition as well as the first. As the

following analysis of the Brush Electric Company illustrates, such firms could provide powerful

demonstrations of the high profits that investing in cutting-edge technology could generate. At

the same time, by serving as the hub of overlapping networks of inventors and investors, they

could both stimulate ongoing inventive activity and provide the expertise needed to assess the

economic merits of the resulting discoveries.

       Charles F. Brush, the inventor at the heart of the Brush Electric hub, had been interested

in electricity from an early age and had built his first arc light while still a student at Cleveland

High School. During the late 1860s, Brush attended college at the University of Michigan,

majoring in mining engineering because the school did not yet have a program in electricity. He

then returned to Cleveland and attempted to earn a living as an analytical chemist, joining an

iron-dealing partnership with Charles Bingham, a childhood friend, when he found he could not

make ends meet. All the while, he continued to experiment in his spare time with electric lighting

(Kennedy 1885; Brush 1905; Gorman 1961; Eisenman 1967, 11-26).

       Another long-time friend, George Stockly, provided Brush with the opportunity to pursue

his electrical interests more seriously. Stockly was vice president and general manager of the

Telegraph Supply Company, and he hired Brush to do some consulting work for the firm. The
                                                                                                                16


two men got talking about the future of electricity, and Stockly, impressed by Brush’s ideas,

offered him the use of the company’s shop to develop his arc-lighting system.18 When Brush

successfully demonstrated a new dynamo, Stockly negotiated a contract that gave Telegraph

Supply exclusive rights to market the device in exchange for royalties. Brush’s reputation as an

inventor got a boost in 1878, when his dynamo won a competition at the Franklin Institute in

Philadelphia, but it was the backing of Stockly and other officers of the Telegraph Supply

Company that translated Brush’s technical triumph into a commercial success. These officers

included Mortimer D. Leggett, a patent solicitor who had served as the U.S. Commissioner of

Patents, and banker James J. Tracy, who belonged to the “Ark,” a club whose members were

interested in natural science, and who was helping to found the Case School of Applied Science

at around the same time. These men had both the technological expertise and the connections

needed to raise the capital for the new venture.19

        Looking for a dramatic way to publicize Brush’s invention, Stockly and his associates

negotiated a contract with the city of Cleveland to light Monumental Park (now Public Square).

Advance publicity brought out a large crowd the evening of April 29, 1879, when Cleveland

officials threw a switch, and twelve strategically placed arc lamps flooded the park with light.


        18
             Intriguingly, other boyhood friendships did not have similar benefits. For example, Brush lived during
his high school years at the same boarding house as John D. Rockefeller, who despite his great wealth was not a
supporter of technological innovation. (In 1898 Elmer Sperry took Rockefeller for a ride in the electric automobile
he had recently invented. Rockefeller refused to take over the controls and advised Sperry afterwards to move on to
other things.) Later, however, Brush would join Frank Rockefeller in a real estate venture (Eisenman 1967, 18, 162-
3; Hughes 1971, 87).

News of the event spread quickly throughout the country, generating a rush of interest in this

new type of street lighting, followed by orders for installations. The successful demonstration

also helped the officers of Telegraph Supply line up investors, and the next year the firm was

reorganized as the Brush Electric Company with an authorized capital of $3 million, an

enormous amount for the time (Brush 1905, Gorman 1961, Cox 1951, 90-91).20

         Brush Electric installed about eighty percent of the nation’s arc-lighting systems during

the early 1880s and made the business people who initially bought its stock rich. As Jacob D.

Cox, founder of the Cleveland Twist Drill Company, later regretfully noted: “The original

holders made immense sums of money but, as I had no funds to invest, I missed this rare

opportunity” (Cox 1951, 90-91). Brush himself became a wealthy man, earning royalties on his

patents in excess of $200,000 a year during 1882 and 1883. Indeed, his royalty account

accumulated so quickly that the company fell behind on its payments, and to settle the debt,

Brush agreed in 1886 to take $500,000 in stock.21 By the second half of the decade, however,

the company was losing ground to new competitors, and Brush, Stockly, and the other major

shareholders sold out to the Thomson Houston Electric Company at what appears to have been a

handsome price (Eisenman 1967, 112-14, 118-20, 162-3; Rose 1950, 477). According to a report

in the New York Times on January 21, 1890, the controlling shareholders (Stockly, Tracy,

          20
             Subsequent negotiations between Brush and the company suggest that only half of the authorized capital
was ever paid in. Brush himself did not take stock in the company until a number of years later. Instead, he agreed
to assign all of his existing and future lighting-system patents to the enterprise in exchange for royalties. See
“Memorandum of Supplementary Agreement between Brush and the Brush Electric Co. (formerly Telegraph
Supply),” 1 Sept. 1880, and “Agreement between Brush and the Brush Electric Company,” 27 July 1886, Box 21,
Folder 12, Charles F. Brush Collection.
          21
             As part of the deal, Brush Electric’s capital stock was reduced from $3 million to $1.5 million fully paid-
in shares. The company then issued an additional $0.5 million in stock for Brush. In addition, the company
promised that, before making any dividends, it would pay Brush “an amount not less than one fourth part of the
whole sum proposed to be divided, . . . such payments to continue until [the company’s] indebtedness shall be fully
paid.” “Agreement between Brush and the Brush Electric Company,” 27 July 1886, Box 21, Folder 12, Charles F.
Brush Collection. The royalty statements are in Box 15. Brush also sold his British and other foreign patents to the
Brush Electric Light Corporation, Limited in England for a “very large price.” According to a report published in
Scientific American (2 April 1881, p. 211), “The sums paid for these foreign patents are . . . greater than have ever
been paid for any other foreign patents obtained by an American.”
                                                                                                                      18


Leggett, Brush, and Stockly’s sister) owned 30,000 of the company’s 40,000 outstanding shares

and sold them for $75 each. The par value of the stock was $50, and its market price was

estimated at that time to be $35.

         Whether the profits that these stockholders earned from their shares in Brush Electric had

a demonstration effect that encouraged other local capitalists to invest in cutting-edge

technologies is impossible to measure.22 There is no doubt, however, that the men most visibly

associated with the Brush enterprise had a comparatively easy time raising capital for their

subsequent ventures. A good example is Washington Lawrence, a major investor in the Brush

Company and, for a time, its general manager. In 1882, Lawrence cashed out and invested the

proceeds in real estate, but he returned to the industry in 1886 to buy a controlling interest in the

Boulton Carbon Company, a spin-off venture that supplied carbons for arc lights to Brush

Electric and other firms. Lawrence reorganized Boulton as the National Carbon Company,

bringing in wealthy investors such as Myron T. Herrick, a local lawyer who had founded a

hardware company and who built the Society for Savings into a major financial institution, and

Webb C. Hayes, son of the ex-president. He then used this firm as a vehicle to acquire

competing enterprises and expand into batteries and other components of electrical systems, in

the process creating one of the country’s earliest industrial research laboratories.23




         22
             There is evidence, however, that interest in investing in electrical startups was sufficiently elevated that
con artists were able to organize “wild cat” companies, “whose only purpose seemed to be to foist a lot of worthless
stock upon a gullible public.” Henry I. Hoyt, president of the Gramme Electrical Company, a trust that temporarily
included all the major electrical lighting companies in the country, claimed that one important purpose of the
monopoly was to stamp out such practices. These wild cat companies, he claimed, owned no patents and displayed
other companies’ machines to gullible investors as if they were their own. “‘Why, Sir,’ exclaimed Mr. Hoyt,
indignantly, ‘I have even had men come to me and ask to borrow dynamo-electric generators to exhibit in the offices
of the so-called ‘electric light companies.’” According to Hoyt, between forty and fifty such “speculative
enterprises” were out raising capital (New York Times, 27 April 1881, p. 12).

        Another good example of the ease with which men associated with Brush Electric could

raise capital for innovative projects is Brush’s own promotion of the Linde Air Products

Company. Brush became aware during the 1890s of the work of Carl von Linde, a German

scientist who had developed a process for liquefying air. Linde wanted to market his invention

in the U.S. but was prevented by a conflicting patent. Believing that Linde’s invention had

priority, Brush bought a one-third share in the patent and financed the necessary litigation. The

case dragged on for several years, but Brush ultimately won and, after a brief period during

which he and Linde disagreed about terms, set about organizing the Linde Air Products

Company. In early 1907, he held a meeting in his office to present a prospectus for the company

to a small group of prominent Cleveland businessmen. Virtually all of those present immediately

agreed to invest, and the company was launched with a capital of $250,000 and with Brush as

president, chemical entrepreneur C. A. Grasselli as vice president, and J. L. Severance of

Standard Oil as Secretary-Treasurer.24 After some initial technical problems, which Brush

himself resolved, the enterprise grew rapidly. By 1910, R. G. Dun & Company gave it a credit

rating of “excellent,” despite having no information to measure its pecuniary strength, and by

1917 its authorized capital had increased to $15 million. In the latter year, the firm merged with

National Carbon, Union Carbide, and other firms to form Union Carbide and Carbon Company,

with Brush and the other investors exchanging their Linde stock for twice the number of shares

in the new combine.25

Brush as the Hub of a Network of Inventors

        The phenomenal profits that Brush and his associates earned in arc lighting gave them the

clout they needed to command the attention and the funds of the city’s capitalists, but such

effects do not begin to capture the impact of Brush Electric on the technological development of

Cleveland. Indeed, the company was from early on a magnet for ambitious young men who

came to work in its shops, network with other technologically creative people, and catch the eye

of investors eager to finance the next Charles Brush. Some of these young men were employees.

For example, W. H. Bolton, founder of the Boulton Carbon Company (later National Carbon),

was a foreman at Brush before organizing his spin-off enterprise in 1881 with capital supplied by

Willis Masters, son of Irvine U. Masters, owner of a prominent Cleveland shipbuilding firm.26

Others, however, were independent inventors whose experiments Brush encouraged at least in

part to increase the demand for his electrical equipment. Thus Walter H. Knight, an engineer,

and Edward M. Bentley, a patent attorney, used the company’s facilities in the early 1880s to

develop and patent an underground power cable (connected to a Brush generator) to operate an

electric streetcar.27 Their position at Brush gave them sufficient visibility that they were able in

1884 to attract New York venture capital, organize their own firm, the Bentley-Knight Railway

Company, and convince the East Cleveland Railway Company to lay a trial line. Although the

initial experiment was successful and generated orders from companies in other cities, it soon

became apparent that the technology did not work well in inclement weather. The company ran

        27
           We have not been able to find precise information about the terms on which Knight and Bentley and
other companies used the Brush facilities. While Brush may early on have provided space and access to his machine
shop to inventors in much the same way as Telegraph Supply had encouraged him, it is likely that, as time went on,
inventors who ran their businesses out of the Brush complex paid rent.
                                                                                                                   21


into financial difficulties, and Thomson-Houston bought out its shareholders in order to gain

control of the Bentley-Knight patents.28

         Similarly, another streetcar pioneer, Sidney H. Short, moved to Cleveland so that he

could work in the Brush shops. Growing up in Columbus, Ohio, Short (like Brush) had early

developed an interest in electricity, and he had amused himself as a child by equipping his

parents’ home with burglar alarms and other electrical devices. Later, while attending Ohio State

during the late 1870s, he patented and sold a transmitter for telephones. Graduating in 1880, he

accepted a professorial position at the University of Denver, where he taught physics and

chemistry and pursued his research in electrical applications. Within several years he had

demonstrated his “Joseph Henry,” a trolley car driven by an electric motor around an elliptical

track. In his own words, “so impressed were the capitalists then interested in my experiments

that the Denver Tramway Company was at once organized” to build an electric streetcar in that

city. Obtaining a contract for a system in St. Louis, he secured financial backing from an Ohio

investor who arranged to have the necessary dynamos custom-made at the Brush Electric

Company. Short then moved to Cleveland to supervise the work and experiment in the

company’s shops. Brush not only encouraged Short’s efforts but helped to finance the resulting

Short Electric Railway Company, which operated out of a Brush building. By that time, it seems

that Short’s reputation as an inventor was sufficiently well established that he was able to attract

considerable outside investment.29




         28
            This is another example of an ultimately unsuccessful venture that made a lot of money for its investors.
The firm, which was organized in New York, was initially capitalized at $1 million, with much of this amount being
issued in exchange for patents. According to a report in the New York Times, “Interested parties, it is said, advanced
the money for the development of the business” (1 Sept, 1889). See also New York Times, 9 Sept. 1884, p. 8; 6 Sept.

        The career of John C. Lincoln, founder of the Lincoln Electric Company, provides further

insight into the connections and opportunities that Brush’s shop had to offer young would-be

inventors. The son of an impoverished minister, Lincoln developed an interest in electricity

during his high-school years and pursued it at Ohio State by taking all of the relevant courses the

university offered. He also worked during his spare time for the company that installed

Columbus’s first electric streetcar line. With the help of a relative, he secured a position at

Brush Electric in 1888, enrolling in the training course that Brush had created for his employees.

About a year later, Brush introduced Lincoln to Short, who promptly hired him to assist in

demonstrating and installing his electric streetcar system. While traveling in Short’s employ,

Lincoln obtained his first patent, an electric brake for streetcars, which he sold for $500 to the

great inventor Elmer Sperry (who was then also working on streetcars at the Brush facility). In

1892, Lincoln returned to Cleveland (and to Brush) as Short’s superintendent of construction.

When shortly thereafter General Electric bought the company, Lincoln joined forces with

Samuel K. Elliott and his brothers, W. H. and Emmett, in an enterprise to sell electric motors.30

This venture too originated in a Brush connection, for Samuel was a fellow student in the

training course. Lincoln designed a motor that quickly gained a respected place in the market,

and in 1895 the four men organized the Elliott-Lincoln Electric Company with financial backing

from members of a local family named Crawford. Times were hard, and Lincoln fought with his

associates over the future direction of the business. Forced out of the company, in 1896 he

started his own venture to produce electric motors, the Lincoln Electric Company. The firm’s




        30
            Virginia Dawson claims that Short fired Lincoln “for the failure of a motor manufactured by the Brush
Electric Company,” but she does not mention the sale of the firm to General Electric and does not provide a source
for her account (Dawson 1999, 16). If this story is true, however, it might explain why Lincoln relied on his own
savings to found Lincoln Electric.

initial capital came from his own meager savings,31 but Lincoln was able to build up the business

rapidly by custom designing motors for local firms. By the end of the next decade, Lincoln had

spun off the production of motors to the Lincoln Motor Works (later Reliance Electric) with

capital supplied by Cleveland industrialist Peter M. Hitchcock (a relative who was an early

supporter of Brush and who had originally gotten Lincoln the job there), and was increasingly

devoting his energies to the development of the arc-welding equipment for which the firm would

become famous. In the meantime, he wrote a popular handbook on electricity that sold 40,000

copies, invented an automobile powered by a variable-speed electric motor that he considered his

greatest invention, and designed generators for electric vehicles that allowed owners to recharge

their car’s batteries in their own garages.32

         The Brush firm was also the incubator for the Cowles Electric Smelting and Aluminum

Company, the brainchild of Eugene and Alfred H. Cowles, whose father was a prominent

Cleveland newspaper publisher. Eugene began to study electricity and its possible uses for

smelting after covering an early exhibit of Brush lighting for his father’s paper. In 1880 he left

the news business to organize and manage the Brush Electric Light and Power Company, the

Brush affiliated utility in Cleveland. His brother Alfred was at that time studying physics and

chemistry at Cornell, but the two brothers soon joined forces in New Mexico, where Eugene, a

tuberculosis sufferer, had gone for health reasons and to inspect mining properties. The

proximity of the mines to good sources of water power stimulated the brothers to pursue

Eugene’s ideas about electric smelting. Lacking the equipment they needed to experiment, they

returned to Cleveland and to the Brush works, successfully built their first furnace, applied for a

         31
           Indeed, it is claimed that Lincoln started the firm with $200 or $250 (the accounts vary) that he earned
from designing a motor for Herbert Dow. When he incorporated the firm in 1906, however, it was capitalized at
$10,000 (Moley 1962, 42, 64; Dawson 1999, 17, 20).

patent, and in 1885 organized their company.33 Located initially at the Brush works, the firm

operated four furnaces, each powered by a Brush dynamo. With capital supplied by their father,

they built a larger plant in Lockport, New York, where they could obtain cheap power from

Niagara Falls (the local Brush Electric Light and Power Company had generated the first hydro

electricity there just a few years earlier).34 The company did well until 1893 when it was shut

down by court order in a patent dispute. Although Cowles emerged from the litigation victorious

with a hefty financial settlement in 1903, ten years of enforced idleness had done its aluminum

business irreparable harm, and it licensed its patents to the defeated party, the Pittsburgh

Reduction Company, later ALCOA. Meanwhile, a group of investors had organized the Electro

Gas Company to use the Cowles technology for the production of calcium carbide, the main

component of acetylene gas. The application was discovered and patented by Thomas L.

Willson, who had worked for a short-time at Brush and presumably had there become familiar

with the Cowles’s smelting methods. The Cowles Company received 12.5 percent of the capital

stock of the new firm in exchange for a license to use its furnace patents. In 1898 Electro Gas

was reorganized as Union Carbide, which, as we have seen, later merged with two other Brush-

related concerns, National Carbon and the Linde Air Products Company, to form the Union

Carbide and Carbon Corporation.35

         Inventors continued to gravitate to the Brush Electric shop even after Brush and his

associates sold out to Thomson-Houston. It was there, for example, that Walter C. Baker


         33
            It is interesting to note that Brush himself was initially skeptical that the process would prove practicable
(Cowles 1958, 34). By 1886, however, Brush was using Cowles aluminum to make hubs for armatures (Scientific
American, 15 May 1886, p. 303).
         34
            The Cowles brothers may also have gotten financial help from Eugene’s father-in-law, the wealthy
private banker E. B. Hale, before the marriage ended in a spectacularly messy divorce that made national news in
1890. See New York Times, 10 June 1890, p. 1, 31 Aug. 1890, p. 1, 24 Dec. 1890, p. 6.

invented his electric automobile, organizing the Baker Motor Vehicle Company in 1898 with the

assistance of his father-in-law, Rollin C. White, one of the founders of the White Sewing

Machine and Cleveland Machine Screw Companies.36 Around the same time, Elmer Sperry

developed his own electric vehicle in the same facility. Sperry had originally been enticed to

Cleveland (and to Brush) by Washington Lawrence and other major investors associated with

National Carbon. Collectively known as the Sperry Syndicate, this group contracted with Sperry

in 1890 to develop a prototype for an electric streetcar, promising that, if the prototype proved

workable, the syndicate would either form their own company to build the cars or sell or license

the patents to another company that would. This arrangement was really early stage financing.

Although Sperry already had some patents in the area, he had not yet developed a working

model. Sperry developed his streetcar over the next couple of years and, in 1892, the syndicate

arranged to exploit the invention in a joint venture with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company

(which a few months later became General Electric). The resulting Sperry Electric Railway

Company contracted to pay Sperry a lucrative salary as consultant in addition to a share in the

company’s profits.37

        When Sperry got interested in the idea of an electric automobile a few years later, he

again turned to the syndicate for financial help. Their backing provided the support he needed to

develop his vehicle (at Brush), which was then licensed to the Cleveland Machine Screw

Company (Sperry received stock in the company and the position of electrical engineer). In

1900, the American Bicycle Company bought this business, along with Sperry’s patents, and the

next year assigned Sperry’s electric storage battery inventions to the National Battery Company.

Sperry helped to get this enterprise up and running and served for a short time as its general

manager (Hughes 1971, 80-88; Hritsko 1988, 12-13; Wager 1986, 221-23).

       The spate of mergers and buyouts that followed the formation of General Electric in 1892

also spurred a number of Brush-connected inventors to form independent enterprises. For

example, employees of what had been Brush’s lamp affiliate, the Swan Lamp Manufacturing

Company, formed the Adams-Bagnall Electric Company in 1895 (Covington 1999). Similarly,

as we have already seen, after Short sold his streetcar company to General Electric in 1893,

Lincoln formed his first independent enterprise. Short himself reentered the business almost

immediately by joining forces with the Walker Manufacturing Company, a cable and machinery

builder, to develop an electric traction system. By this time, his abilities as an inventor in this

promising new field of technology were so well appreciated that he was able to mobilize

financial support on what seem to be remarkably favorable terms. For example, in a contract

dated July 1, 1896, he agreed in return for generous compensation and the title of vice president

to work for the company and to assign it the rights to all of his patents that he then owned and

controlled, as well as to inventions he would patent in the future, in the areas of “Dynamo

electric machinery, Street Railway motors and car equipment, Arclighting machinery, and

Alternating machinery.” Although we do not know what salary he received, his contract

specified that he would be paid an additional royalty of “20 cents per horse power upon all of the

electrical apparatus sold and delivered to customers,” and that the assignments of his patents

would be revoked if the royalties due were not paid within three months of the delivery of the

apparatus, or if the company failed to sell and deliver electrical equipment totaling at least

$300,000 in any calendar year. Most telling, however, is the contract’s “reversionary clause,”

which specified that, if Short were to leave the employment of the Walker Company, the rights
                                                                                                                27


to all of his patents would revert back to him. The implication is that Short’s participation in the

company was so desirable that he was able to find individuals willing to invest in developing his

technology, despite the fact that he had the right to withdraw at any time with all of the assets he

had brought to the firm.38 Indeed, the next year a group of New York capitalists who were

“largely interested in street railway and electric lighting systems in many of the principal cities”

(they included ex-Governor Roswell P. Flower, Anthony N. Bradey, James W. Hinkley, and

Perry Belmont, brother of August Belmont) bought a controlling interest in Walker and

negotiated with Short and the company’s other officers for the sale of the firm and its assets to

Westinghouse in 1898.39 Short then left for England to help set up a company that would exploit

his traction patents in Europe. When he died suddenly of appendicitis in London in 1902, he left

an estate valued at about two and a half million dollars (Smith 1955).



The Limited Role of Formal Financial Institutions

        One of the most striking features of the foregoing company histories is the limited role

played by formal financial institutions, not only in the formation of the original Brush Electric

Company, but also in the many startups and spinoffs that came out of this hub. The entrepreneurs

who organized and promoted these new ventures secured investment capital largely by relying

on personal connections. These could be familial, as when the father of Eugene and Alfred

Cowles provided most of the initial capital for the Cowles Electric Smelting and Aluminum

Company; they could result from friendships, as when George Stockly agreed to support Brush’s

initial work in electrical lighting; or they could be based on the recommendations of men who

        38
           Unfortunately, we have been unable to locate the employment contract between Short and the Walker
Company. The assignment contract is dated July 1, 1896, but was not recorded at the Patent Office until January 5,
1898. See Liber V-56, p. 322, Records of the Patent and Trademark Office, Record Group 241, National Archives.

had established their expertise in the community, as when Brush secured backing for the Linde

Air Products Company simply by assuring local businessmen of the merits of the technology. In

addition, association with a hub enterprise such as Brush could in and of itself be a means of

attracting both attention and funds. Thus Knight and Bentley’s very visible association with

Brush Electric enabled them to raise venture capital as far away as New York.

       The wealthy Clevelanders who bought shares in these new high-tech enterprises seem to

have been motivated by the returns they expected to earn from owning and holding them rather

than by the profits they could reap by selling them off after an initial run-up in price. Although a

few investors cashed out their investments relatively early (as Lawrence did when he sold off his

Brush stock), this practice seems to have been quite uncommon. A search of Cleveland

newspapers indicates, for example, that from the time of the formation of the Brush Electric

Company until the late 1880s, when the idea of selling or merging the firm was beginning to be

discussed, the only mention of Brush shares available on the market occurred around the time

Lawrence was selling out.40 Before the formation of the Cleveland Stock Exchange in 1900, the

only firms associated with the Brush hub for which share prices were quoted in the Cleveland

papers were Brush Electric itself and the Walker Manufacturing Company. Even after the

formation of the exchange, we do not see much trading in the equities of concerns associated

with this hub. The one major exception, National Carbon, was listed on the exchange from the

very beginning, but it was by that time a consolidation of a large number of previously

competing firms.

       This is not to say that formal financial institutions played no role in the financing of these

firms. Once enterprises associated with the hub got off to a good start, they were undoubtedly

able to tap into other sources of finance, particularly trade credit from suppliers but also short-

term commercial loans from banks and other financial intermediaries. Here the overlapping

network of financiers was likely to have played an important role. Some of the men who

invested their savings in the new firms were also officers and directors of banks. For example,

James J. Tracy, one of the original incorporators of Brush Electric, became vice president of the

Society for Savings after a long career in various other Cleveland financial institutions.41

Similarly, Myron T. Herrick, a member of the Sperry Syndicate and one of the initial investors in

National Carbon, was secretary-treasurer and then president of the Society for Savings, a founder

of the Euclid Avenue National Bank, a director of the American Exchange National Bank, and a

director of the Garfield Savings Bank.42 Some of the inventors and other businessmen involved

in these startups and spinoffs also helped to organize financial institutions during this period—

Brush himself was a founder and vice president of the Euclid Avenue National Bank (Eisenman

1967, 162)—and it is likely that they did so because they thought their companies would benefit.

         In addition to providing short-term commercial credit, financial intermediaries could help

these firms raise additional capital by underwriting and marketing their bond issues. Thus the

Cleveland Trust Company underwrote securities for many local firms, ranging from small

electrical manufacturing companies to local telephone companies to larger electrical utilities.43

Moreover, in the absence of an active securities market, banks and other financial intermediaries

could make investments in equities more liquid by accepting the shares as collateral for loans.

The portfolio of the Fairmount Savings Bank, for example, included a number of loans based on

such securities. Of the nearly 150 loans approved by the bank from July, 1903, to November,

by manufacturing enterprises, including the Adams Bagnall Electric Company.44



Beyond Brush

        In Cleveland, the Brush Electric Company was one of the earliest and most important

examples of an enterprise around which extensive overlapping networks of inventors and

financiers formed. But it was not the only such hub. The city’s hardware dealers served a

similar function, for example. Because their stores were gathering places for people who made

and bought the vast variety of products that they stocked, these merchants were particularly well

placed to obtain information about new products and production processes, as well as to attract

investors for new ventures. One reason why Jacob Cox, founder of the Cleveland Twist Drill

Company, decided to move his business to the city was that he was already “well acquainted

with the principal hardware dealers in Cleveland, George Worthington & Company, and Wm.

Bingham & Company, and also with some of the bankers” (Cox 1951, 87). Although it is not

certain that Cox himself obtained any advantage from these connections, Worthington and

Bingham were in fact major investors in Cleveland industry. Worthington had founded the

Cleveland Iron Company in 1849, and he and Bingham together organized the Cleveland Iron

and Nail Works in 1863. Bingham’s son, Charles W., who was trained in geology, mining, and

chemistry, later organized one of Cox’s major competitors, the Standard Tool Company, as well

as the Parrish & Bingham Company, a producer of bicycle parts.45 Similarly, two of the

founders of the Cleveland Cap Screw Company, the acorn from which TRW ultimately grew,

came out of the hardware business. David J. Kurtz and Samuel M. Mathews had in the course of

their business learned about a new electric welding technology invented by Elihu Thomson of

Lynn, Massachusetts. They envisioned that it would enable them to reduce dramatically the cost

of manufacturing cap screws in standard sizes, organized a company to license and exploit the

technology, and, through their local connections, were able to raise about $80,000 in capital by

selling equity in the proposed venture. They were not able to make the enterprise a success,

however, until Cleveland automaker Alexander Winton, an early investor, bought control of the

company and used the technology to produce engine valves for his cars (Dyer 1998, 17-27).

        As this last example suggests, downstream (or upstream) businesses could also be

important sources of finance for new ventures. Their assistance to entrepreneurs was likely to

be especially critical in technologically advanced industries because they had the expertise as

well as the motive to search out promising new prospects. For example, Alexander E. Brown

and other entrepreneurs associated with the Brown Hoisting Machine Company provided most of

the capital for the Elwell-Parker Electric Company of America in 1893. Brown had been looking

for an electric motor capable of driving his ore-handling machinery, discovered the Elwell-

Parker Company in Britain, and arranged for the formation of a company to produce the motor in

Cleveland. The new firm was hit badly by the Panic of 1893 and the ensuing depression, but

orders from Brown kept the company going (Brown even provided it with production space). In

the meantime, Elwell-Parker was able to develop the new product lines (for example, motors for

electric automobiles and trucks) that allowed it to expand its customer base and move into a new

factory of its own (Rose 1950, 546, 595-6).46


        46
           Brown himself was originally connected with the Brush hub. Born in 1852, he attended Brooklyn
Polytechnical Institute in the early 1870s and then took a job from 1873-74 as chief engineer with the Massillon
(Ohio) Bridge Company. While in the company’s employ, he invented a method of using scrap iron and steel to
build bridge columns. Returning to Cleveland, he attempted to pursue a career as an inventor, in part by working
                                                                                                                32


        A more important example, the White Sewing Machine Company, not only assisted

upstream producers but became a source of spin-off enterprises rivaling those of Brush. Founder

Thomas H. White had moved his small sewing-machine company to Cleveland in the late 1860s,

and, in combination with Howard W. White (his half-brother) and Rollin C. White (no relation),

formed what later became known as the White Sewing Machine Company.47 Once the firm was

well established, White began to encourage vertically related ventures. For example, White

played a major role in convincing the fledging precision machine-tool firm of Warner and

Swasey to move from Chicago to Cleveland. White helped the two partners find a suitable

location for their shop, fed them information about potential customers, and assured them that “If

anyone undertakes to squeeze you, let me know, and I will see that they don’t.” He also stepped

forward when they needed a respected businessman to guarantee a contract.48 White played an

even more important role in the success of Theodor Kundtz’s furniture company, providing

financing backing as well as buying the major part of his output. At that time, sewing-machine

furniture consisted of little more than tables on which the machines were bolted. With White’s




with in the shop of arc-lighting pioneer Charles F. Brush. Alexander’s father, Fayette Brown, was a prominent
Cleveland merchant banker, iron dealer, manufacturer, and inventor. When Alexander patented his first hoisting
machine, Fayette recognized the value of the invention and financed the formation of a company to exploit it in
1880. “Brown, Alexander Ephraim” and “Brown, Fayette,” Encyclopedia of Cleveland History; “Brown, Fayette,”

support, Kundtz innovated by designing and patenting convertible tables which, when not in use

for sewing, closed up to become attractive pieces of furniture.49

        Like many other enterprises using machine-tool technology, the White Sewing Machine

Company made a number of products over the years besides sewing machines. These included

kerosene street lamps, roller skates, phonographs, bicycles, and precision tools. In 1890, the

Whites spun off their machine-tool business as a separate concern, the Cleveland Machine Screw

Company, headed by Rollin C. White. This firm also diversified its output (Rose 1950, 336).

Thomas White’s son, Rollin H. White, was a gifted inventor who had double majored in both

mechanical and electrical engineering at Cornell. Rollin and his brother Windsor (who also had

engineering training) developed a type of “safety bicycle” while working in the Screw

Company’s employ. The company had acquired a local bicycle stamping concern, the A. L.

Moore Company, and it produced the bicycles until it sold off this part of its business to the

American Bicycle consolidation in 1898.50 As already discussed, Elmer Sperry arranged for the

Cleveland Machine Screw Company to produce the electric car he had designed at Brush,

assigning the company his patents in exchange for shares of its stock and agreeing to assume the

position of electrical engineer. This business, along with Sperry’s patents, was sold to American

Bicycle in 1900 (Hughes 1971, 88; Hritsko 1988, 12-13; Wager 1986, 221-23).

        Around the same time, Walter C. Baker founded his own company to produce the electric

vehicles he had designed in a Brush shop. Financial backing for the company came from his

father-in-law, Rollin C. White, the president of Cleveland Machine Screw Company. Baker’s

father, George W. Baker, had been an inventor and long-time employee of the White Sewing

Machine Company. Walter attended the Case School of Applied Science and after a brief stint

as a civil engineer, returned to work at the Screw Company. There he invented a revolutionary

anti-friction ball bearing that could be used for bicycles, carriages, and automobiles, and with the

assistance of his father-in-law and several other men, organized the American Ball Bearing

Company in 1895, the same year he received his patent.51

         When Thomas White’s son, Rollin H., developed a new kind of flash boiler for steam

vehicles in 1899, the White Sewing Machine Company also added the production of automobiles

to its already diversified product line. The vehicles proved so successful that the Whites spun off

production into a separate automobile concern, the White Company, in 1906.52 Bowing to trends

in popular demand, in 1909 the company began producing gasoline vehicles, the main

components of which were designed by other companies, and began to phase out the production

of steam cars in 1911. Forced to spend more of his time simply managing production, Rollin had

comparatively little outlet for his creativity and was stimulated by a visit to a Hawaiian

plantation owned by another brother, Clarence, to turn his energies toward designing agricultural

equipment. He invented the first crawler-type tractor and, with Clarence’s help, founded the

Cleveland Motor Plow Company in 1916 (later renamed the Cleveland Tractor Company and

shortened to Cletrac). Once Cletrac’s success was assured, he founded another car company, the

            According to Hritsko (1988, 13-19), Thomas H. White bought a steam car from Locomobile in 1899 and
gave Rollin H. responsibility for maintaining it. Frustrated by the unreliability of the car’s engine, Rollin developed
an improved boiler and offered to sell his invention to Locomobile. When the Locomobile refused to buy it, the
Whites decided to develop their own car. See also White Motor Company, “Important Milestones in White Motor

Rollin Motor Company, in 1923. That venture lasted only a few years, though it the cars it

produced embodied notable technological advances.53

        By the time these latter enterprises were organized, the formal financial institutions that

Cleveland’s industrialists had helped to create were more accessible to new high-tech startups

and spinoffs. The Whites’ automobile venture, for example, was listed on the Cleveland Stock

Exchange in 1912—just six years after its formation. Nonetheless, the role played by such

institutions in the creation and promotion of new firms was still relatively minor. As in the case

of the firms associated with the Brush hub, early investment still came primarily through local

informal channels. Family and friends played a prominent role, as did upstream or downstream

enterprises who had special reasons to encourage the development of complementary businesses.

Other significant amounts came from business people in the local community who were eager to

follow the example of those who had gotten rich from investing in cutting-edge technologies.

        Such local business people were only willing to invest, however, if they had good reason

to believe that the new ventures seeking their funds were likely to be profitable. Well known

inventors such as Sperry could readily attract capital because they had established reputations for

generating economically significant technologies. Inventors who were just starting their careers

needed some other way to signal that their ideas were promising. Here Cleveland’s industrial

hubs played a critical role. Because they were collecting points for technological expertise, they

served an important vetting function. Inventors seeking validation for their ideas gravitated to

these hubs. So did business people in search of profitable investments. In this way, the networks

that formed around innovative firms like Brush Electric and White Sewing Machine became

engines of local economic development. They encouraged the geographic concentration both of

technological creativity and of venture capital. They also matched inventors who had promising

ideas with business people who possessed the managerial skills needed to transform these ideas

into productive enterprises.

Appendix: Cleveland Inventors, 1900 Sample

Anderson, Valerius D. 13 patents in sampled years, no assignments at issue. Nearly all of the
patents were for “presses” designed to extract oil from seeds. Was a principal in a firm that bore
his name but did not assign to it at issue.

       1897-8 Cleveland Directory: president and treasurer of the V. D. Anderson Co.
       1906-7 Directory: not listed.

       Anderson was born around 1830. His work history begins in 1855 in a tin shop in
       Milton, Wisconsin, that made hoops for skirts and repaired tin roofs. He moved to
       Kewanee, Illinois, invented and patented a steam boiler, and formed a company to
       commercialize his invention. He next moved to Springfield, Ohio where he managed the
       Mast-Foos Company, a boiler manufacturer, that was later acquired by International
       Harvester. Anderson left Mast-Foos in 1876. In 1880 he moved to Cleveland, where he
       invented a rendering tank for use by butchers. “Sales of these tanks dropped when
       packinghouses started to replace butcher shops, causing Mr. Anderson to develop and
       turn to the manufacture of fertilizer dryers.” He ran the business out of his home, where
       he was assisted by two of his sons and two younger brothers. In 1888 he founded the V.
       D. Anderson Company, and in 1893 the company moved into a small factory on the west
       side of Cleveland. Among his most important inventions was a steam trap in 1893
       (which “not only made his fertilizer dryer the most efficient, but also expanded his
       market into steam specialties around the world”) and a press for extracting oil from seeds
       (or degreasing the cooked byproducts of butchers) that the company commercialized
       itself (Anderson International Corp. n.d.; Rose 1950, 440-41).

Avery, Henry C. 10 patents in sampled years. Assignee at issue: Avery Stamping Company (1
patent in 1899, 2 in 1902, 3 in 1905—retained share of the 3 in 1905). Most of his patents dealt
with railway ties, but he also patented designs for “non-refillable receptacles” and for a
“pneumatic tire.” Was a principal in a firm that bore his name and assigned most of his patent
to it at issue.

       1897-8 Cleveland Directory: secretary and manager of the Avery Stamping Company.
       1906-7 Directory: not listed.

Baker, Walter C. 8 patents in sampled years. Assignees at issue: American Ball Bearing
Machine (one patent in 1898). His patents covered designs for antifriction bearings, grinding
machines, motor vehicles, a voltmeter, a transmission for automobiles, and a cloth-cleansing
device. Was a principal in a firm that bore his name and also in another company formed to
exploit his inventions, but did not assign most of his patents to these firms at issue.

       1897-8 Cleveland Directory:
       1906-7 Directory:

       Baker was born in Hinsdale, New Hampshire, in 1868 and moved to Cleveland with his
       parents at the age of three. His father, George W. Baker, was an inventor and long-time
                                                                                                 43


       associate of the White Sewing Machine and Cleveland Machine Screw Companies.
       Walter attended Case School of Applied Science, graduating in 1891. That same year he
       married Fannie Elizabeth White, daughter of Rollin C. White, one of the founders of the
       White Sewing Machine Company and president of Cleveland Machine Screw, where
       Baker went to work after a stint as a civil engineer. In 1893 Baker helped establish his
       reputation by exhibiting his “Electrobat,” a light electric vehicle equipped with bicycle-
       type wheels, at the Chicago Exposition. Around the same time, Baker invented a
       revolutionary anti-friction ball bearing that could be used for bicycles, carriages, and
       automobiles, and with the assistance of his father-in-law and several other men,
       organized the American Ball Bearing Company in 1895, the same year he received his
       patent. Baker became president of the new company, which produced axles for horse-
       drawn vehicles and then for automobiles, and served in that capacity until 1918, when the
       firm merged with thirteen other concerns to form the Standard Parts Company (Baker
       stayed on as consulting engineer). In 1897 Baker built an electric automobile with F.
       Philip Dorn, secretary of the Ball Bearing Company. The two men worked on the car in
       a building at the Brush Electric Company shop, where their friend Elmer Sperry was also
       developing an electric car. While Cleveland Machine Screw geared up to produce
       Sperry’s vehicle, Rollin C. White and his son, Fred R. White, left to help Baker and Dorn
       organize the Baker Motor Vehicle Company in 1898. Baker held the post of vice
       president and mechanical engineer of that company until 1906, when he gave up his
       formal position in order to concentrate his energies more fully on the Ball Bearing
       Company. Baker was also a director of the Peerless Motor Car Company and helped
       engineer that company’s cars. He was an extraordinarily talented inventor who counted
       Thomas Edison among his friends (Edison bought his first electric car). Later Baker
       worked with Lee DeForest on the development of amplifiers for radio. (Orth 1910, Vol.
       2, 332-32; “The Baker Motor Vehicle Company,” Men of Ohio 1914; Wager 1986, 205-

Ball, Herman F. 6 patents in sampled years. Assignee at issue: Chicago Railway Equipment
Company (one patent in 1898). His patents included designs for a “brakebeam,” a car buffer,
and a key for a journal box. Was an employee but did not assign his inventions at issue.

Brown, Alexander E. 17 patents in sampled years. Assignees at issue: Brown Hoisting
Machinery Company (assigned to this company all patents except 2 in 1899 and 1 in 1900).
Virtually all of his patents related to hoisting. Was a principal in a firm that bore his name and
assigned most of his patents at issue to the firm.

       Alexander E. Brown was born in Cleveland in 1852. He father, Fayette Brown, was a
       private banker and iron dealer. A graduate of Central High School, Alexander studied
       civil engineering at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1872. He worked as chief engineer
       at the Massillon, Ohio Bridge Company in 1873-4, where he developed a method of
       using scrap iron and steel to build bridge columns. He then returned to Cleveland and
       pursued a career as an inventor (in part by working on lamps along with Charles F.
       Brush). He invented a hoist that partially automated the unloading of cargo at Great
       Lakes ports. With his father, he organized the Brown Hoisting & Conveying Machinery
       Company in 1880 with a capital of $100,000. They incorporated the firm in 1893. Also

       1906-7 Directory: same

       Fayette Brown was born in North. Bloomfield, Ohio, in 1823, the youngest of nine
       children. His father, Ephraim, had joined with a friend to purchase that township, moved
       there from New Hampshire, and became a leader in this “transplanted New England
       Community.” At 18, after finishing his education in local public schools, he worked in
       Pittsburgh for his brother’s wholesale dry-goods firm, becoming a partner in 1845. He
       moved to Cleveland in 1851 and formed a banking partnership with George Mygatt
       (Mygatt & Brown), taking over the business when Mygatt retired in 1857. He closed the
       business and became a U.S. Army paymaster in 1861. He resigned his commission in
       1862 and returned to Cleveland as general manager and agent of the Jackson Iron
       Company. He remained in that position for the next 25 years. During that period he
       secured four patents dealing with blast furnaces (issued in 1884 and 1885). He also
       became interested in Great Lakes shipping and invested in a fleet of lake steamers for
       transporting iron ore. In 1880, he organized Brown Hoisting Machinery Company in
       1880 to exploit the inventions of his son, Alexander E. Brown (see above). Fayette
       served as president of that company until his deat in 1910. He also served as president of
       the Union Steel Screw Co., the National Chemical Company, and the G. C. Kuhlman Car
       Company; as general manager of the Stewart Iron Co. of Sharon, Pennsylvania; and as
       receiver of the Brown, Bonnell Co. of Youngstown, Ohio (Dictionary of American

       Kundtz was born in Metzenseifen, Austria-Hungary, in 1852 and migrated to the U.S.
       and to Cleveland in 1872 at the age of 20. His first job was with a small woodworking
       firm (the Whitworth Co.) that made sewing machine cabinets. The owner went bankrupt
       after a damaging fire. Kundtz and three other employees (George Gebbard, Charles
       Simon, and Edward Genee) bought the remaining assets and started the Cleveland
       Cabinet Co. One by one Kundtz bought out his partners until he was the sole proprietor
       of the Theodor Kundtz Cabinet Work by 1878. He supplied all the cabinets for the White
       Sewing Machine Co. As the business grew, Kundtz expanded into new products from
       school desks to church pews to bicycle wheels, many of which were based on his own
       inventions. Later he also built automobile bodies for the Whites. By 1910, Kundtz
       headed a vertically integrated enterprise that employed 2500 workers in five plants and
       was the largest consumer of hardwood in the state of Ohio. He died in 1937 (Eiben 1994,

       1897-8 Cleveland Directory: not listed
       1906-7 Directory: not listed

       Rogers was born in 1856 in Roseville, Ill. After attending Berea College in Kentucky and
       then Oberlin (A.B. 1875), he taught in the Michigan public schools and then at Berea
       College. From 1877-1881 he was superintendent of schools in Lorain, Ohio. He then did
       engineering work for the railroads for two years in Iowa and Michigan, returning to
       Lorain to teach until 1888. He got interested in mechanical type setting, obtained a
       patent in 1888 for a machine for “making stereotype matrices,” and moved to Cleveland,
       Ohio, where he organized the Rogers Typograph Co. Rogers introduced a typesetting
       machine in 1890 whose production was enjoined the next year for infringing on Ottmar
       Mergenthaler’s linotype invention. Several years later another of Rogers’s inventions
       involved him in an interference suit with Merganthaler and with another inventor named
       Jacob W. Schuckers. Rogers bought Schuckers’ patent, which was subsequently
       validated. The Mergenthaler then bought Rogers’s firm in 1895, and Rogers went to work
                                                                                                    49

       Seaver was born in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1856 and then moved with his parents to
       Buffalo, New York. At the age of 13, he took a job in the machine shop of the Shepard
       Iron Works, attending school in the evenings. Five years later he moved to the Howard
       Iron Works, which designed and built marine engines. He was promoted to Assistant
       Superintendent at the age of 20. After a stint in the partnership of Seaver & Kellogg,
       where he built the first steel railroad cars in the U.S., be took a position with the Kellogg
       Bridge Works and then, in 1880, became chief engineer of the Iron City Bridge Works in
       Pittsburgh. In 1884 he assumed the same title at the Riter-Conley Co. and earned a
       reputation designing blast furnaces, steel works, oil refineries, and other industrial
       structures. In 1896 he joined Samuel T. and Charles H. Wellman to found Wellman-
       Seaver Engineering (later Wellman-Seaver-Morgan), assuming the position of vice
       president. The firm operated extensive plants in Cleveland and Akron, manufacturing ore
       and coal handling machinery, car dumpers, hoisting engines, water power, steel plant and
       railroad equipment, and other heavy machinery. He remained a director of that firm until
       his death in 1911, but in 1906 joined a consulting practice with James E. A. Moore

       1906-7 Directory: deceased

       Short was born in Galena, Ohio, in 1858 and grew up in Columbus, where his father was
       a manufacturer. He developed an early interest in electricity, which he pursued by
       studying physics at Ohio State. Graduating in 1880, he accepted a professorial position at
       the University of Denver, where he taught physics and chemistry and pursued research in
       electrical applications. After demonstrating his invention of electric trolley car, local
       capitalists organized the Denver Tramway Company to build an electric streetcar in that
       city. Obtaining a contract for a trolley system in St. Louis, he secured financial backing
       from an Ohio investor who arranged to have the necessary dynamos custom-made at the
       Brush Electric Company. Short then moved to Cleveland to supervise the work and
       experiment in the company’s shops. Brush not only encouraged Short’s efforts but
       helped to finance the resulting Short Electric Railway Company, which operated out of a
       Brush building. Short sold the company to General Electric in 1892 and then reentered
       the business almost immediately by joining forces with the Walker Manufacturing
       Company, a cable and machinery builder, to develop an electric traction system. Short
       served as vice president of that company until Westinghouse bought control in 1898.
       That same year, Short left for England to help Dick, Kerr & Company, Ltd., prepare to
       manufacture his railway equipment, assuming the position of technical director of the
       English Electric Manufacturing Company. He died in England in 1902, leaving an estate
       worth about 2.5 million dollars (Short 1899; Smith 1955; Dictionary of American
       Biography; Moley 1962, 33-34).

Goodman Manufacturing Company, Chicago (1 in 1907). His patents pertained to motor vehicle
storage batteries, gearing, electric railways, preserving perishable goods, a heating apparatus, and
refining tin. He maintained his status as an independent inventor, forming only temporary
attachments with the firms to which he assigned patents.

       1897-8 Cleveland Directory: manager of the Sperry Engineering Co. (motor carriages)
       1906-7 Directory: not listed

       Sperry was born in 1860 in Cortland, New York. He attended Cortland Normal, finishing
       in 1880, and also sat in on lectures at Cornell, where he discussed technical problems
       with Professor William A. Anthony. With backing from Cortland Wagon Co, he
       developed an arc lighting system and then incorporated the Sperry Electric Light, Motor,
       and Car Brake Company of Chicago in 1883. The company was not very successful and
       went through several changes in ownership. From 1888-92, he ran the Elmer A. Sperry
       Co. of Chicago, a research and development enterprise. Inventions he made during that
       time led to the formation of the Sperry Electric Mining Machine Company in 1889 and
       the Sperry Electric Railway Company in 1892. He moved his family to Cleveland in
       1893, where he was developing his streetcar inventions with the aid of local financiers.
       Cleveland backers also financed his work on electric automobiles. In 1898 he convinced
                                                                                                51


       the Cleveland Machine Screw to tool up to produce his cars in quantity. He assigned his
       patents on electric vehicles to the company, receiving stock in return and for a time
       worked as the company’s chief electrical engineer. In 1900, the American Bicycle
       Company took over this business (and Sperry’s patents). The same deal led to the
       formation of the National Battery Company to manufacture a storage battery invented by
       Sperry. He then got interested in electrochemistry, moving to Brooklyn, New York, in
       1905 to work on a detinning process for the American Can Company. He remained in
       New York for the rest of his life (he died in 1930), turning out inventions ranging from
       gyro stabilizers and compasses for ships to devices to control and direct machine gun
       batteries to automatic pilots for aircraft to detectors to spot flaws in railroad tracks.
       Sperry either assigned the resulting patents to existing companies or helped financiers
       organize companies (usually bearing his name) to exploit them commercially (Hughes
       1971; Hunsaker 1955).

       Stearns was born in 1878 in Berea, Ohio. He graduated from University School in
       Cleveland in 1894 and then went to the Case School of Applied Science, leaving after
       one year to pursue his longstanding passion for automobiles. With capital provided
       initially by his father, who owned a stone quarry and speculated in real estate, he
       organized the F. B. Stearns Co. in 1898, serving in the office of president. The
       company’s automobiles embodied many of Stearns’s inventions. In 1912, however,
       Stearns recognized the superiority of a new engine design by Charles Y. Knight and
       joined forces with that inventor to offer the famous Stearns-Knight authomobile. In 1918
       a dispute over engineering policies spurred him to retire, but he continued to serve the
       firm as a consultant. During the 1920s he worked on diesel engines and obtained sixteen
       patents. He died in 1955 (Dictionary of American Biography; Los Angeles Times, 9 Feb.

       Wellman was born in 1847 in Wareham, Massachusetts. His father was an iron worker
       who rose to the position of superintendent of the Nashua Iron Company. Wellman
       attended local public schools and then studied engineering at Norwich University in
       Vermont until he enlisted in the Union Army in 1863. After the Civil War he worked as
       a draftsman and engineer at the Nashua works, earning recognition by successfully
       constructing a Siemens regenerative gas furnace under license from the German firm.
                                                                                               53


       Wellman was immediately hired by Siemens’s U.S. representative, J. T. Potts, to help
       build furnaces at other works. After he left Siemens’s employ, he built an open-hearth
       furnace (the first commercially successful one in the United States) for the Bay State Iron
       Company using a plan designed by French engineers. In 1870 he returned to Nashua to
       take charge of charge of building and running a new steel department. Then in 1873 he
       moved to Cleveland to do the same for the Otis Iron & Steel Company. He received an
       ownership interest and the title of chief engineer and superintendent and stayed with the
       firm for sixteen years. During this time he obtained a number of patents for inventions
       that included a hydraulic crane and an open-hearth charging machine. In 1886 Wellman
       built an experimental furnace at Otis and produced the first basic open-hearth steel in the
       U.S. Because the process was slower than the more conventional acid process, the firm
       discontinued the experiment. In 1889, Wellman left the company and worked briefly as a
       consultant for the Illinois Steel Company. In 1890 he and his half brother, Charles,
       founded the Wellman Steel Company, which operated a rolling mill in Chester,
       Pennsylvania, until it failed in 1895. The next year the Wellmans joined forces with John
       W. Seaver to organize the Wellman-Seaver Engineering Company, a consulting firm that
       built iron and steel works on contract. Thomas R. Morgan joined the firm in 1901, and it
       was reorganized in 1903 as the Wellman-Seaver-Morgan Company, an Ohio corporation,
       in order to acquire the assets of the Webster, Camp & Lane Company of Akron.
       Wellman served as president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1900-
       01 and also served at various times as director of East End Bank & Trust, Dime Savings
       & Banking, Cleveland Trust, Iroquois Portland Cement, and Dow Chemical. He died in
       1919 (Wellman 1902; Samuel T. Wellman Collection, Kelvin Smith Library, Case
       Western Reserve University; Sicilia 1989; Dictionary of American Biography; “Dravo

White, Rollin H. 25 patents in sampled years. Assignees at issue: A.L. Moore Company (1 in
1898); White Sewing Machine Company (1 in 1900, 4 in 1902, 8 in 1903, 3 in 1905, 1 in 1906,
and 1 in 1907). Patents include ‘steering mechanisms for autos’, ‘airpumps for autos’,
‘golfclub’, gasoline burner’, and ‘transmission’. The businesses to which he assigned many of
his patents were associated with his family. He later became a principle in firm formed to
exploit his inventions.

       Machine Co.

       White was born in Cleveland in 1872. His father, Thomas H. White, was a founder of the
       White Sewing Machine Company, the Cleveland Machine Screw Company, and other
       concerns. Graduating from Cornell in 1894, Rollin went to work at his father’s various
       companies. While he was working at the A. L. Moore Company, which his father had
       acquired, he and his brother Windsor developed a bicycle which the Sewing Machine
       Company then manufactured and distributed. In 1899 Rollin invented a flash boiler for
       steam automobiles and introduced the first White steamer in 1900 (he raced his cars,
       setting a world record for steam cars in 1901). Rollin’s cars (and later trucks) were
       produced by the White Sewing Machine Company until the family incorporated the
                                                                                            54


       White Company in 1906. Rollin became its vice president but mainly supervised
       technological development and production, while two of his brothers took charge of the
       business aspects of the firm. Rollin always felt underappreciated by his family and left
       the company in 1914 to pursue inventions in agricultural equipment. He incorporated the
       Cleveland Motor Plow Company (later Cletrac) in 1916. Maintaining the presidency of
       Cletrac, he returned in 1923 to automobiles with the incorporation of the Rollin Motors
       Company. He died in 1962 (“White, Rollin Henry,” “White, Thomas H.,” “The White
       Motor Corp.,” and “Cletrac, Inc.” Encyclopedia of Cleveland History; Hritsko 1988;

Notes and Sources: The table is based on a longitudinal data set constructed by selecting all of
the inventors whose family names began with the letter “B” from three random cross-sectional
samples drawn from the Annual Reports of the Commissioner of Patents for the years 1870-71,
1890-91, and 1910-11. We then collected from the Annual Reports all of the patents received by
these inventors during the twenty-five years before and after they appeared in the samples,
including information on whether and to whom the patents were assigned. Companies to whom
the patentees assigned their inventions were classified as follows: We first checked to see
whether the assignee was a company with the same name as the patentee. If not, we classified as
“large integrated companies” all assignees for which financial information was reported in the
Commercial and Financial Chronicle or in Poor’s or Moody’s Manual of Industrial Securities
(indicating that the company was important enough to tap the national capital markets) or,
alternatively, that were listed in an early-1920s National Research Council directory of
companies with research laboratories. The remaining companies were divided into two groups:
“other local companies,” if the assignee was located in the same city as the patentee; and “other
companies” for all the rest.
