                 THE LONG-RUN IMPACT ON FEDERAL TAX REVENUES AND
          CAPITAL ALLOCATION OF A CUT IN THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX RATE


                                    ABSTRACT

      Model simulations are run to obtain a range of realistic estimates of
the long-run revenue impact of a capital-gains tax-rate cut to a maximum of

15 percent. The basic vehicle for the simulations is a slightly modified

version of the Galper-Lucice-Toder (GLT) general equilibrium model. The key

behavioral assumptions affecting the estimates are:      (1) the portfolio and

tangible capital reallocations implicit itt the structure of the GLT model,

(2) corporate payouts responses based on recent empirical estimates, and

(3) illustrative noncorporate recharacterizations of regular income as

capital gains.

      The essential message of this paper is that the strong emphasis in

the literation on the realization response to a capital gains tax rate cut

has been appropriate. The payout/recharacterization and portfolio

redistribution/reallocation effects do not appear to be large. Moreover,

the portfolio responses, within the context of the GLT model, act to raise

tax revenues (substitution of taxable business capital for taxfree

household and state and local capital), not lower them as has been

conjectured. Thus these responses offset the payoutjrecharacterization

effects, leaving the realization response as basically the total response.

Future research could, of course, modify this finding.

                The Long-Run Impact on Federal Tax Revenues and
           Capital Allocation of a Cut in the Capital Gains Tax Rate*

          How a capital gains tax rate cut affects federal tax revenues has

dominated recent discussion of capital gains taxation. No matter how

appropriate a cut might be in terms of increasing economic efficiency if a

cut decreases tax revenues, it is unlikely to be implemented. Conversely

no matter how inappropriate a cut might be from an equity perspective, if a

cut increases tax revenues, it is likely to be adopted. The issue is

whether behavioral responses are sufficient to offset the direct reduction

in revenues caused by the rate cut. The existing literature provides no

clear answer (see Auerbach, 1988, Cook and O'Hare, 1987, and Toder and

Ozanne, 1988, for reviews).

          The empirical literature concentrates on the realizations response

(Lindsey, 1987ab and the above references), which is certainly the most

important if one is concerned with the impact of capital gains tax rate

changes on capital gains tax revenues only. However, other responses must

be considered if one is concerned with the wider impact on total federal

capital income tax revenues. While capital gains will be realized more

quickly if the gains rate is cut, less corporate income will be paid as

"dividends" and more as capital gains (Poterba, 1987). Moreover, owners of

noncorporate enterprises may characterize less of capital income (or of

their personal labor income) as current income and more as capital gains.

These responses further increase capital gains revenues but decrease total

tax revenues from capital income. In addition, a lower gains rate will lead

households to realign their asset portfolios and will induce a reallocation

of the underlying tangibLe capital stock. While these indirect responses

have usually been viewed as lowering total capital income tax revenues (Cook

and O'Hare, 1987, and Toder and Ozanne, 1988). the responses can just as

well raise revenues and, in fact, do so in our simulations.

        In the short run, a capital gains tax cut will almost certainly

raise tax revenues. The two revenue-losing or potentially losing responses,

the redirection of income from dividends to capital gains and the

reallocations of portfolios and tangible capital stocks, will occur

gradually. Thus the dominant response will be an increase in realizations.

More important, the initial increase in realizations will vastly exceed the

long-run increase, owing to the one-time unlocking of existing capital

gains, if the previous higher rate had been in place for a lengthy period.

Our concern, however, is solely with the long-run impact on federal capital

income tax revenues. The specific capital gains tax cut analyzed is the

reduction to a maximum rate of 15 percent.

        Unfortunately, we know little about any of the relevant behavioral

responses. While many studies have measured realization responses to

capital gains tax rate changes, the variation in these estimates is wide and

the interpretation of them is uncertain. Some studies have examined

corporate payout behavior, but these studies do not have a strong

theoretical base, and no one, not surprisingly, has measured noncorporate

recharacterization responses. Some work exists on portfolio shifts, but it

is insufficiently comprehensive or precise to be useful in this context.

        We employ a portfolio choice model to compute tax revenue effects.

This model incorporates assumptions regarding household portfolio and firm

investment decisions based on utility maximizing behavior. Thus, portfolio

shifts and existing capital stock reallocations are a fundamental part of

the model. Optimizing realization and payout responses are not, however,

part of the model. Instead, we simulate revenue effects under alternative

assumptions regarding these responses, based on existing empirical

estimates. The important features of the portfolio model are described itt

Section   I, and the method of incorporating the capital gains tax rate cut is

discussed in Section IX. Section III presents the results, and Section IV

summarizes them.


                            I. The Simulation Model

          The basic vehicle for the analysis is a slightly modified version of

the GENDAT model of Galper, Lucke and Toder (1988). GENDAT stands for

General Equilibrium Model of Differential Asset Taxation. As its name

implies, GEHDAT is designed to capture the interaction between differential

tax treatment of assets and marginal tax rates of taxpayers and the impact

of this interaction on the long-run allocation of tangible capital in the

economy. The model is thus well suited to analyze the long-run impact of

capital-gains tax changes. We begin with a general overview of the sectors

in the model, and then we provide some additional detail on households.

The Sectors

          GEMDAT describes a model with three fundamental sectors (those

endogenously investing in tangible capital): state and local governments,

corporations, and households. The first two sectors have limited behavior..

The corporate sector demands capital (KCOR) and finances it by issuing debt

and equity (EQU). The optimal debt-equity ratio, f, is chosen; as much tax-

exempt debt is issued as is legally possible (EXCOR â€”
                                                        gK};    and taxable

debt (TAX) is issued residually. The state and local sector demands capital

(KSTL) and finances it with tax-exempt debt (EX). The federal government

sector is totally exogenous. For both government sectors, tangible capital

is assumed to equal debt. The balance sheets for these three sectors are

shown at the top of Table 1.

          The household sector is far more complex. First, noncorporate

businesses are folded in with "households." That is, it is as though each
                                                                             4


household directly holds its share of noncorporate capital, all of which

earns the same pretax rate of return. Because the same pretax return is

earned, only one demand for capital exists, although numerous households

account for different shares of it. Second, direct household capital

(owner-occupied housing and consumer durables) is also folded in, but this

capital pays different pre-tax returns (imputed rent plus expected

appreciation) to different households. Thus, each household is a separate

production unit, supplying varying amounts of owner housing and consumer

durable services.

        In addition to these classes of tangible capital, households hold

corporate equity, taxable and tax-exempt bonds, and retirement accounts


(private pensions, PEN, and federal pensions, PENFED, and IRAs). The

pension accounts are treated as exogenously determined, and taxable bonds

can be held in positive or negative (debt) amounts. The balance sheet for

this sector is pictured on the lower left in Table 1, where the capital

stock demands are denoted by K's and the capital types by subscripts (OH for

owner-occupied housing, CD for consumer durables, and MC for noncorporate

business capital). The balance sheets for individual households have the

same form as the aggregate balance sheet.

        In general, households are assumed to see through financial

intermediaries (to act as though they hold the financial assets, rather

than the liabilities, of the intermediaries). More specifically, households


view themselves as holding the underlying corporate equity (ePEN) and


taxable debt ((l-e)PEN + PENFED + IRA] of retirement entities. (Pensions

determine e endogenously, but the pension asset holdings are treated as

exogenous to households.) However, all households may not be able entirely

to offset aogenous retirement holdings by their personal portfolio choices.
                                                                              5



If a household held more corporate equities in retirement accounts than it

wished to hold in its total portfolio, the household portfolio would be "out

of balance" on the assumption that equities cannot be sold short.. Because

taxable borrowing is allowed, no such problem arises with IRA and pension

taxable bond holdings. The holdings matter in the overall model, however,

owing to the different taxation of retirement and regular accounts.

        All other financial intermediaries and the rest of the world are

treated as exogenous. On net, this exogenous sector holds tax exempts

(largely commercial banks and property insurers) and taxables, matched by

outstanding equities. The full division of financial institutions into

pensions and exogenous, shown at the lower right in Table 1, differs from

the Calper, Lucke and Toder (GLT) treatment. Because Gilt combined the

sectors, netted the exogenous sector's net equity outstanding from equities

held by pensions and did not distinguish between federal government and

private pensions (the former hold no equities), CLT greatly understated the

equity share of pensions (set it at 0.14 instead of 0.33).

Household Demands

        There are 400 representative households (taxpayers) in the model,

differentiated by labor income capital income, tax-filer status (married

versus single), and itemization status under prel986 tax law and weighted to

represent the entire population. Under any given tax regime, each unit

simultaneously determines whether to itemize or not and how much of each

of six assets to hold: owner housing, consumer durables, taxable bonds,

corporate equity, noncorporate capital, and tax-exempt bonds. The first

three assets are presumed risicless, the first two are not taxed and the

third is fully taxed, and the second three have varying degrees of risk and

taxation. Table 2 lists these assets, the sectors supplying them, the

nominal pretax returns on them (the ik's) and the effective tax rates


applied to the returns: t is the statutory marginal tax rate of household
                                                                                              6



j, and a_K is the effective proportion of the return included in the tax

base.

        All demands for tangible capital are unit elastic functions of the

net (of depreciation) cost of capital. For consumer durables and owner

housing demanded by households j


        4â€” 4/[(lbti)i - INFLJ.

where the 4 are constants and INFL is inflation (actual and expected). For
owner housing, b equals unity if either the household itemizes or doesn't

itemize but doesn't have debt, and, if not unity, b equals zero. For

consumer durables, b equals unity if the household's owner housing b is

unity and the household doesn't have any disallowed interest deductions,

and, if not unity, b equals zero.

        Household j's utility-maximizing shares of wealth in the three risky

assets (4) can be expressed as



         j â€”   ExP(ik)(l.akti)   -   i   t   (l-bt1)   -
                                                           TRAN4,               (l.3)-(l.S)


               &mvar(ik)(latJ)2wi
where m is household j's utility per dollar of expected income, 4 is the

degree of household j's risk aversion on risky asset k,                     is the share of


variance included in the tax base, and TRANS reflects the impact of the

variance in government tax revenues owing to the variance in revenues from

asset k on household i's demand for asset k.

        Holdings of the risk-free taxable bond are derived residually from

the household balance sheet identity:


        TAX1 + IRA1 + PENFED1 + (l-e)PEN1 + Â£QU1              +   ePEN1   + Fit1 + NC   +
                              O}1 +          â€” Wi.                               (1.6)
(An equation like (1.3) determines the share of pension wealth in corporate

equities (e), where ak and a are zero, and an equation like (1.6) gives

pension holdings of taxables.)

        Four market-clearing equations for fully taxable bonds (TAX), tax-

exempts, corporate equity and noncorporate equity close the model (and can

be thought of as determining the pretax returns on these assets):

                  II. Modeling the Impact of the Tax Cut

        Capital gains taxation works through the inclusion factors, the ak

and a in the portfolio share demand equations. For an asset whose entire

return is received as current income and is fully taxed, such as risk-free

taxable bonds, a â€” 1.    For other assets, the greater the proportion of the

return that takes the capital gains form, the longer the gains are deferred,
                                                                                   8


and the lower is the capital gains tax rate, the lower are ak and a. In

the CLT model, taxable returns with favorable capital gains tax treatment

are those on equity investments in corporate and noncorporate business. The

taxable variances with favorable capital gains treatment are those on equity

investments and tax-exempt bonds.

          The inclusion factors can be related to the fraction of true income

that accrues directly to households (p), the proportion of variance in

income that is attributable to this accrual (v), the effective realization

rate (the concurrent equivalent realization of. currently nonaccruing income
--
     capital   gains, rr), and the fraction of realized gains that are excluded

from taxes (x). With these definitions,


          a.( â€”    p +   (l-p)(l-x)rr                                 (2.1)



               â€”   v +   (l-v)(l-x)rr.                                (2.2)


For corporations, p is simply the payout ratio. For noncorporate business,

all recorded earnings are paid out by definition. However, not all earnings

are recorded concurrently, but rather get deferred owing to the generally

favorable taxation of business activity (investment tax credit, favorable

accounting treatment, accelerated tax depreciation --    but   at historic cost,

        as well as illegal tax avoidance, before someday showing up as

capital gains (for corporations, these business tax advantages are

incorporated in the model at the corporate level). Thus p and v for

noncorporate business reflect these phenomena. For state and local bonds,
GLT set a.K â€” 0 and v â€”       0.

         Examination of how Galper, Lucke and Toder (GLT) altered the ak's


and at's in response to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 is instructive both in

setting parameter values and in determining how to alter them in response to
                                                                                                  9


a capital gains tax cut. Because the variance of returns on tax-exempt

bonds was presumed to be in the capital gains component only, the inclusion

rate on this variance was specified as the fraction of annual capital gains

included in the tax base. Under pre-1986 law, this fraction was 0.2,

reflecting a 60 percent exclusion (x â€”         0.6)   and an assumed 50 percent.

                                                        *
effective     realization rate (rr â€”   0.5).   Thus,        â€”   (1   -
                                                                         0.6)0.5   â€”   0.2.   with

the removal of the exclusion in the 1986 law, the inclusion rate rose to the

full 0.5 effective realization rate. For corporate equity, the variance

inclusion rate was slightly higher, 0.25 under old law and 0.55 under the

1986 Act, because some of the variance in the total return was attributed to

variance in dividends as well as in capital gains. These parameters are

consistent with v â€” 0.0625 under pre1986 law and 0.1 under the 1986 Tax Act.

            GLT set the inclusion rate on the expected return from corporate

equity far higher because dividends are an important component of the

return. With dividends equal to three-eighths of total return (p â€” 0.375)

and capital gains equal to five-eighths, the corporate income inclusion rate

was 0.5 [â€” 0.375 +      0.2(0.625)].   With removal of the exclusion in the 1986

Tax Act, the rate rose to 0.7, assuming a slight increase to 0.4 in the

dividend payout ratio [0.7â€”0.4 +         0.5(0.6)].     The v fraction was one-sixth

the p fraction under pre1986 law but one-quarter under the 1986 Tax Act.

           The GLT treatment of the noncorporate income and variance inclusion

rates                                                                                         *
         ts less helpful; they set v and p equal to zero. That is, thetr ak â€”


ak
     â€”   (l-x)rr   rise from 0.2 to 0.5 because x declines from 0.6 to 0.0. Zero

values for v and p seem inconsistent with their overall analysis (clearly

the 1986 Tax Act increased these parameters, i.e., reduced the deferral of

noncorporate income). In no case did CLT explicitly change the realization

rate for either corporate or noncorporace capital gains.
                                                                               10


        Table 3 contains four sets of parameter values for the corporate and

noncorporate equity inclusion rates. The first two are those of CLT for

prel9SS and 1986 tax laws. The second two are our adjustments to their

calculations. For corporate equity, our numbers are identical to theirs for

prel986 law and only slightly lower for 1986 law. By maintaining v and p at

their pre1986 law values, 4    rises   to 0.5313, not 0.55, and a rises to

0.6875, not 0.7. The changes for noncorporate equity are greater. While

the ak and 4 values are maintained, the parameters leading to these values

are altered. The realization rate is lowered to 0.3, three-fifths that for

corporate equity, and p and v are raised to 0.0909 under pre1986 law and

0.2857 under 1986 law, values which, from equations 2.1 and 2.2, are

consistent with the GLT ak and 4.

        Setting   the inclusion rates for the returns and variances under the

proposed capital gains tax cut is straightforward. Because the new 15

percent rate constitutes a gains exclusion that varies with the regular

income tax rate of the household, the inclusion rates are also household

specific. More precisely, the rates are those described by the a.K and a


expressions with x replaced by l-O.lS/&. Our      base   simulation, then, is one

in which the parameter values are those in the lower right corner of Table 3

but with x shifted from 0.0 to l-0.lS/t.

        The impact of inclusion-rate changes on portfolio demands for

corporate and noncorporate equities is complicated by the fact that the

changes increase both the numerator (the return inclusion rate) and

denominator (the variance inclusion rate) in the share demand equations.

Only if the percentage increase in the numerator, generated by the increased

after-tax return, is greater than the percentage increase in the

denominator, induced by the increased after-tax variance, will the share
                                                                             11


demand tend to increase. This is not the case for some households in the

simulations reported below, However, because the after-tax variance on tax-

exempt bonds, but not the return, is increased, households in the 28 and 33

percent tax brackets will tend to shift out of tax exempts. Another

complication is that m ,   the utility per dollar of expected income, is
endogenous, depending on the prices of goods in the model. As a result,

intuitive explanations of portfolio changes are often not easily provided.


                                 III. Results

Portfolios After Full Adiustment to the 1986 Tax Act

        The first step in the analysis is to replicate the CLT's simulation

of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Our results differ in only minor respects

from theirs. These results are taken as the base from which the capital-

gains tax-rate reduction is presumed to shift the economy under the

assumption of constant realization and payout rates. These results are also

the basis upon which the 400 sample households are combined into classes to

present the portfolio responses in a meaningful fashion.

        Households have been divided into seven classes based on their tax

bracket. Under the 1986 Tax Act, the tax schedule rises as taxable income

increases to 0.15, 0.28, 0.33, and then falls to 0.28. Taxpayers with

marginal tax rates of zero, 0.33 and the highest 0.28 form three classes,

while the 0.15 and lower 0.28 cLasses are divided roughly in half to form

the other four classes: 0.1SL, 0.lSH, 0.28L and O.28H. The 0.15L bracket

includes taxpayers with a marginal tax rate of 0.15 and income under $16,000

(singles) or $32,000 (joint); the 0.28L bracket includes taxpayers with a

tax rate of 0.28 and income under $35,000 (single) or $70,000 (joint).

Income is the CLT concept: approximately before-tax cash income, including

that of corporations owned by the households.

        Table 4 lists the hypothetical percentage distribution of total U.S.

wealth among these seven household classes in the new equilibrium following

passage of the 1986 Tax Act (assuming no realization, payout or

recharacterization responses) and the percentage distribution of each

class's wealth among three risky assets and total riskless assets (taxable

bonds and household capital --   housing and durables). The zero-tax class
holds only 3 percent of total wealth, the next five income classes hold

about 15 percent each, and the highest income class holds 20 percent of the

economy's wealth. Ignoring the zero tax bracket class for the moment, the

next three classes hold about 30 percent of their wealth in equities

(corporate and noncorporate) and this percentage rises monotonically to 40.

48 and 59 for the remaining classes. The highest five income classes all

have 4 to 7 percent of their wealth in tax exempts, while the lowest two

have none. The portfolio share in taxable bonds and housing capital

declines (almost) monotonically as income rises from 73 percent to 34

percent, largely reflecting a smaller proportion of income being spent on

housing and durables as income rises. Surprisingly, the fourth income

class, households just above the 15 percent tax bracket, hold portfolios

quite similar to those of households in the 15 percent bracket rather than

those of higher income households in in the 28 percent bracket.

        The lowest income class is a substantial outlier with respect to

holdings of noncorporate equity and household capital, having at least a 20

percentage point greater share of their wealth in noncorporate equity than

one might expect and an equal lesser share in household capital. We suspect

these data are dominated by small family-farm households, who would have

large noncorporate equity by definition and might have some discretion in

classifying household capital as business capital.

Gains Tax Cut. No Realization, Payout or Recharacterjzatjon Resnonses

        Federal taxes paid on household j's capital income are computed as


                         Taxi â€”
                                  QaktJExp(iL)sWJ.                 (3.1)


Total federal taxes are the sum of Taxi over all j. The tax revenues lost

from a tax rate cut must be made up in some manner for the model to be

internally consistent. In order to avoid altering marginal tax rates and

thus introducing other tax effects into the simulation, we assume a

proportional tax on consumption of sufficient magnitude to leave the federal

budget unchanged.

        Table S contains the results of the base case simulation with no

realization or payout changes, i.e., these results follow solely from the

structure of the model. The top left indicates the percentage changes in

tax liabilities for each income class and the total economy, both without

portfolio or capital allocation effects and with them. The top right

reports percentage changes in the portfolio holdings of each income class.

The lower left indicates the capital stock reallocations, including those

financed by debt and equity, and the lower right shows the changes in pretax

interest rates. These figures have been computed on 1985 asset stocks
and income flows.

        In the static case, tax cuts occur only for those in the 28 and 33

percent tax brackets and the percentage reduction rises with income because

higher income househ9lds hold proportionately greater quantities of the

assets that receive the more favorable tax treatment. In the dynamic case,

tax changes depend on changes in pretax interest rates and in portfolio and

capital stock redistributions     As can be seen, business capital increases,

largely at the expense of household capital. The former is induced by 10
                                                                                14


and 6 basis point declines, respectively, in the pretax yields on corporate

and noncorporate equity and is accompanied by a reduction in the corporate

debt-capital ratio; the latter is largely attributable to a decrease in

marginal tax rates, which raises the after-tax debt rate. The reduction in

zero-taxed assets by the 28 and 33 percent tax rate households reflects this

reduction in marginal tax rate and thus in household capital demands (the

marginal tax rate of the highest income household class rises slightly

because some of these households shift down into the 33 percent bracket).

tn all cases, the capital stock changes are a half to one percent of the

base level,

Alter-native Realization. Payout, and Recharacterization Assumotions

           We now consider the impact of alternative realization, payout, and

recharacterization assumptions. Table 6 lists the alternatives for both the

1986 Tax Act and the cut in the capital gains tax rate. The former are

needed because the simulated impact of the 1986 Tax Act itself varies when

changes in realizations et cetera are incorporated, and it is from these new

equilibria that the capital gains tax rate is presumed to shift the economy.

For small increases in realizations, an elasticity of -0.5 with respect to a

change in the statutory capital gains tax rate is posited for corporate

equity, i.e., a rough halving of the gains rate (from 0.28 or 0.33 to 0.15)

is assumed to raise realizations by 50 percent, and -0.3 is posited for

noncorporate equity. For moderate increases in realizations, elasticities

of -1.0 and -0.6 are assumed; for large increases, -1.5 and -0.9 are

assumed.

           The assumed corporate payoUt response is based on Poterba's recent

study. In his framework, dividends depend on both earnings and a tax

preference parameter, 8, which is a weighted average across shareholders of

the ratio of the current-equivalent after-tax income from a dollar of
                                                                               15


dividend payout to that from the capital gains he assumes would result from

a dollar of retained earnings:

                 il-ri
                        cg
where rdiv is the marginal tax rate on dividends,   Tcg is the concurrent-

equivalent capital gains tax rate, and i varies over a number of household

income classes and financial institutions each with a weight   w. Poterba
finds that 9 â€”   0.78 prior to the 1986 Tax Act and would equal 0.88 in the
new equilibrium after tax reform, owing largely to a cut in the weighted

average marginal tax rate on household dividend income from 33.4 percent to

25.3 percent. As a result of this l2 percent increase, Poterba projects a

20 percent increase in dividends. We simulate a 20 percent increase in

corporate p (raise it to 0.45) in response to the 1986 Tax Act.

        The proposed reduction in the capital gains tax rate should have a

far smaller impact on the payout ratid. Consider investors as being in two

classes only, households and others. Concentrating on households, we write


                   1- th
        8 â€”                   + others

                 l-%(l-x)rr


where wh is the proportion of equities held by households (0.634 in 1986),

t.1 is the household marginal tax rate (0.253 posttax reform), rr is the

realization rate (which Poterba assumes equals 0.25 for all years) and

"others" is the contribution of other investors. To determine the value of

others, we set all parameters equal to their post-reform values (9 â€”   0.88,   x
â€” 0 and th â€” 0.253) and solve for other â€” 0.374.    Raising x from 0 to 0.5

lowers e to 0.863, a two percent decline that, from Poterba's estimate,

translates into a 3.2 percent fall in dividends. We lower p to 0.435.

        The last response considered is the potential recharacterization of

noncorporate income in response to changes in the relative taxation of

capital gains. Precisely how individuals achieve this and how much occurs

is unclear, but the possibility would seem to exist. To incorporate

recharacterizations in response to the 1986 Tax Act (sharp decrease in

regular income tax rates and increase in gains tax rates), we multiply all

    and a by 1.1. For the capital gains tax cut, this multiplication

factor is reduced to 1.08 but only for those households with marginal

regular income tax rates above 0.15. This 20 percent offset to the impact

of the 1986 Tax Act (reduction in multiplicative factor from 1.1 to 1.08,

after starting at 1.0) is comparable to the 17 percent offset in Poterba's 8

(0.88 to 0.863, after starting from 0.78). The recharacterization is

simulated in combination with moderate realization and payout responses

(case 5 is case 4 with recharacterizations).

        The ak's based upon the new realization and payout rates are clearly

the correct ak's to use in equation (3.1) to calculate taxes paid. However,

they cannot be correct for using in equations (l.3)-(l.5) to compute

portfolio share demands. To illustrate, assume that the elasticity of

realizations with respect to the tax rate change is -1.0 so that a cut in

the capital gains tax rate does not alter taxes paid or ak. With

unchanged, there would be no shift in portfolio shares - a cut in the tax

rate on capital gain income would not make the asset more attractive to

households.

        Presumably households have a desired realization rate in the absence

of taxes (and other transactions costs) on capital gains. Decreases in

realizations from this rate, in order to lower effective taxation, generate
                                                                               17


disutility. A cut in the gains rate on an asset lowers this disutility and

thus will lead households to demand more of the asset. To ensure that

demand will rise, we alter the rr's and p's underlying the a,'s and 4's in

equations (1.3)-(l.5) by only half the differences between the values listed

in the lower left corner of Table 3 and those shown in Table 6,

           Table 7 contains the static and dynamic revenue losses for all cases

considered. We discuss the static results first. The tax cut with no

changes in realizations, payouts or recharacterizations would lose $14.5

billion dollars annually. This loss is cut by 40 percent to $8.6 billion

with a small increase in realizations and reduced by another 40 percent to

only $3.0 billion with a moderate realization response. With a large

realization response, revenues actually rise by $2.8 billion. Decreases in

payouts and recharacterizations act to offset the impact of increased

realizations, but the offsets are small. Comparing cases 4 and S with case

2, decreased payouts increase losses by half a billion dollars and decreases

in both payouts and recharacterizations increase revenue losses by only $1.3

billion.

           The dynamic responses tend to dampen the decline in tax revenues by

$1.5 billion when realization responses are low, but by less than $0.5

billion when realizations are high. The dampening occurs largely because

capital tends to be reallocated toward taxed assets (corporate and

noncorporate capital) and away from non-taxed assets (household and state

and local capital). These capital stock shifts and changes in pretax

interest rates and corporate structure are shown for all the different cases

in Table 8.

           The business capital stock increases are caused by the gains rate

cut, although the increases are cushioned to the extent that realizations

increase and soften the impact of the rate cut (reduce the shift toward the

partially taxed equities)      The increased demand for equities and decreased
                                                                              1.8




demand for tax-exempt securities cause the pretax returns on the former to

fall by 2 to 10 basis points and on the latter to rise by 2 to 3 basis

points. The quantity of state and local capital falls in response to this

rate increase; the demand for household capital falls, in spite of a general

minor decline in the fully taxable rate, because of a reduction in the

average marginal tax rate of some households and a decrease in the fraction

of households that itemize, both of which increase the net-of-tax debt rate.

        Table 9 illustrates portfolio shifts in what we view as the most

likely case (moderate increase in realizations and decrease in payouts and

recharacterizations). The highest income class shifts slightly from

partially and zero taxed assets into fully-taxed bonds; the lowest three

income classes switch from fully to partially taxed assets; and the middle

income class switches from zero taxed assets (largely household capital) to

partially taxed equities. The portfolio shifts are not large though. For

example, the largest absolute change, the 1.1 percentage point increase in

the middle income (.28L) class's holdings of partially taxed other assets,

is only a 3 percent portfolio shift (increase from 30 to 31 percent) -

        Our final experiment is one in which the capital gains tax rate cut

is applied to corporate equities only. Limiting the tax cut to corporate

equity obviously would substantially lessen the potential revenue loss.

Table 10 gives the revenue, capital stock, and pretax interest rate changes

for two cases. In the unlikely event of no realization or other responses,

the dynamic revenue loss, $5.3 billion, is 35 percent of that when the gains

rate is cut on all capital gains, With moderate behavioral responses, a

slight $0.3 billion revenue gain is computed. The capital stock

reallocations differ from those with the general gains rate cut because

noncorporate capital, like household and state and local capital, now

decreases.
                                                                             L9


                              IV. Conclusions

        Our model simulations were designed to obtain a range of realistic

estimates of the long-run impact of a capital-gains tax-rate cut on total

federal capital income tax revenues. In doing this, a number of assumptions

were made regarding behavioral responses. First, the portfolio and tangible

capital reallocations follow from the structure of the CLT model. Second,

the realization and payout responses grafted onto the model cover the gammut

of recent econometric estimates. Third, the noncorporate

recharacterizations are illustrative only; we have no evidence on the exten

to which such recharacterizations occur. The realism of the revenue

estimates is. of course, dependent on these assumptions. The gains cut

analyzed is a cut to a maximum capital gains rate of 15 percent.

        Four key questions are addressed in our analysis. What is the

expected long-run annual revenue loss from a gains rate cut? Do portfolio

redistributions and real capital reallocation responses act to raise or

lower federal capital income tax revenues? How large is the likely effect

of decreased corporate payouts and recharacterizations of noncorporate

income as capital gains relative to that of increased realizations? Is

there any chance that a gains tax cut would raise capital income (as opposed

to capital gains) tax revenues?

       Our major conclusions are:

o      a cut in the capital gains tax rate on all assets to 15 percent is

       likely to cause a steady-state annual revenue loss of $2 to $6

       billion based on 1985 capital stock and wealth levels.

o      while portfolio and tangible capital reallocations could either

       increase or decrease tax losses in theory, in our simulations the

       reallocations reduce tax losses by about a billion dollars, largely

       through an increase in partially-taxed business capital at the

       expense of zero-taxed housing and state and local capital.
                                                                                       20


o        while changes in corporate payouts and recharacterizations of

         noncorporate income act to increase tax losses, neither response is

             likely as large as the reallocation effect.

o        restricting the gains rate cut to corporate equities would likely

         reduce the annual loss to under $2 billion and could increase

         revenue; a rationale for such a restriction is the current double

             taxation of corporate income (Cravelle and Lindsey, 1988).

         The essential message of this paper is that the strong emphasis in

the literation on the realization response to a capital gains tax         rate   cut

has   been   appropriate. The payout/recharacterization and portfolio

redistribution/reallocationÃ¬ effects do not appear to be large. Moreover,

the portfolio responses, within the context of the CLT model, act to raise

tax revenues (substitution of taxable business capital for taxfree household

and state and local capital), not lower them as has been conjectured. Thus

these responses offset the payout/recharacterization effects, leaving the

realization response as basically the total response. Future research

could, of course, modify this finding.

         As to future research, extension of three financial assets in the

model to include a pure capital gains asset (equity in farming and oil and

gas production?) would be appropriate in order to better measure portfolio

effects. Also, realization and payout responses should be built directly

into the model. Utility losses from deviations of realization rates and

payout rates from those that would exist if gains weren't taxed could be

specified and optimal realization and payout rates could be computed as

those that balanced these losses against gains in after-tax income.

Further, the tax parameter affecting corporate payouts could be computed

internally in the model. A related endeavor would be to recompute historic

values of the tax parameter using estimates of the optimal realization rate

and to relate historic payout rates to the recomputed tax parameter.

        Model simulations are run to obtain a range of realistic estimates of

the long-run revenue impact of a capital-gains tax-rate cut to a maximum of

15 percent. The basic vehicle for the simulations is a slightly modified

version of the Calper-Lucke-Toder (CLT) general equilibrium model. The key

behavioral assumptions affecting the estimates are:      (1) the portfolio and

tangible capital reallocations implicit in the structure of the CLT model,

(2) corporate payouts responses based on recent empirical estimates, and

(3) illustrative noncorporate recharacterizations of regular income as

capital gains.

        The essential message of this paper is that the strong emphasis in

the literation on the realization response to a capital gains tax rate cut

has been appropriate. The payout/recharacterization and portfolio

redistribution/reallocation effects do not appear to be large. Moreover,

the portfolio responses, within the context of the GLT model, act to raise
tax   revenues   (substitution of taxable business capital for taxfree

household and state and local capital), not lower them as has been

conjectured. Thus these responses offset the payout/recharacterization

effects, leaving the realization response as basically the total response.

Future research could, of course, modify this finding.
