                                            ABSTRACT


        In this paper we focus on a mystery we uncovered while undertaking a detailed audit of the

US Bunau of Labor Sttistics   producer price index (PPI).   We summarize our puzzle as follows.

From January 1984 through December 1989. the BLS price index for SIC 28341 (pnscriplion

pharmaceutical preparations) grew at an annual rate of 9.09%. For purposes of comparison, we have

ob0incd monthly price and quanlity sales data on all prcscriptlon pha~acculical   preparation products

sold by four major US phannaccutlcal manufacturers, accounting for about 24% of lotal lnduslry

domestic sales in 1989. Using Laspcyrcs price Index construction procedures on these data that mimic

BLS methods, we fud that over the same lime period, the four-company price Index increasedLI only

6.68% per year. Finally, when we employ a Divislr price index proccdun with smoothedweights ti

incorporatesnew goodsimmediately,the aggregateprice index for thesefour firms grows a~a CPIC
                                                                                           of

only 6.03% per year.

        Why is it that the official BLS price index grows approximately 50% more rapidly (9.09% vs.

6.03%) than the Divisia price index? That mystery Is lhc focal point of our paper.

          In this         paper ve focus on a mystery                        ve uncovered vhila                    undertsklng              a ’

Our puzzle          is summarized in Figure                       1 below.             From January         1984 through                December

1989, the         BLS price          index for         SIC 28341 (prescription                          pharmaceutical

prepartions)             grev at an annual rate                    of 9.09%.             For     purposes of comparison,                         ve

have     obtained         monthly price             and quantity            sales data on all                    2,090 prescription

pharmaceutical             preparation          products           sold by four             major pharmaceutical                      oanufac-

data     4th      spliced         fixed     vefghtse2            we find        that     over     the     same     time        period,           the

four-company             price     index      increased           at only        6.68% per year.                  Finally,          vhen we

employ a Divisia                 price      index procedure              that     incorporates             new goods immediately,

the aggregate             four-firm         price      index grovs at a rate                      of only 6.03% per year.                              Uhy

Is it      that     the BLS price             index grows approximately                          50% more rapidly                 (9.09% VS.

6.03X)         than the Divisia             price      index?           This mystery             is the focal             point        of   our

paper. 3

          A number of factors                  could account               for    the difference.                  First,         our four

firms      could be unrepresentative                        of    the    industry          as a whole.             Second, the

products          and firms        sampled by the BLS could be unrepresentative                                           of     industry

transactions.              This sampling discrepancy                        could reflect                the fact         that

participation              by firma         in providing        Its      price       date     ia voluntary.               ~lro,       sampling

procedurea          used by the BIS might                   not capture           l dequetaly           the price         trends       of new

producta,         particularly              in industries            cheracteriaed            by rapid       technological

change.          Third,          the prices      reported       by the firma                to the BLS might              differ       from

the firma’          actual         average      transactions           pricea.4             Fourth,      use of fixed              veight

rater     from      those baaed on chained procedures                             such as the Diviaie                  index,          Note

thet    one would not expect                    unmeaaured quality                changes to account                 for      the

difference,           since none of the three                    indexes         reported        above connects generics                          to

their     patented              antecedenta.       nor doer any compare wimprovedw drugs to their

predecessors              and adjust          the price        index accordingly                using,      for example, hedonic

ae thoda .

          Our interest               in the reliability               of official            producer      price       indexes stems

from a aore general                   research      interest           in the oeaaurement of output                         and

productivity              growth.       Given the          esaential        identity           betveen value           of sales and a

price       index     timer a quantity              index.       any errors           in the PPI have important

implications              for     the accuracy          of measured rates               of inflation,              real     output

changes, real              inveatment,          and grovth           in productivity.

            To begin eaaeaaing the reliability                             of the PPI, ve decided to audit                                 one

industry         in detail.            Our choice           of the pharmaceutical                     preparations           industry           vas

affected         by the fact           that     this     industry         is one in vhich               technological               change is

significant,              its     pricing      of products           has been the focus of considerable                                public

attention,           it    her other          attributes        of     interest        to us (for          example,          it     is heavily

engaged in research                   and development),                and, on a practical                 basin,         arrangements

could be made to have proprietary                              micro data made available                      for analysis.                  It        is

worth noting              that      our analysis         is confined             to the PPI for            this     industry,              and ve

levels      would be required.               However,          some of the                 important       issues      involving            the

treatment       of generics         and new goods may be similar                               for      the PPI and CPI.

           We start     our paper in Section                   II     with         a brief       overview         of the PPI;         a aore

detailed      discussion          is found in Appendix                      A to this          paper.’        In Section          111 we

provide      a summary of the four                     anonymous pharmaceutical                        manufacturers,            comment on

another      source of data (MS America)                            that,         for     one significant            sub-class         of

pharmaceutical          preparations              (systemic          anti-infectives),                   encompasses          almost the

entire      universe      of products            sold domestically,                       and prerent       some preliminary

empirical       findings         involving         data comparisons.                       The principal            results      of our

empirical       analysis         are presented             in Section              IV,     and there       we report          on our

various      attempts       to unravel            this     mystery.               In Section           V we address the “youthful

goods” problem in further                    detail,          Finally,             in Section           VI we summarize our

findings        and describe         our agenda for                 further             research.

           The PPI is one of the oldest                       continuous                 statistical       data      systems published

by the BIS, although               until         1978 it      was known as the Wholesale Price                                Index      (UPI).

The first        WPI, published            for     the base period                      1890-1899,       was an unweighted

 average of price           relatives            for     about 2S0 commodities.                         Since that       tioe,      aany

 changes have been made, including                           alterations                 in the sample of comaodities,                        the

base period,          and the method of calculating                               the index.            According       to the U.S.

 Department of labor               [1988, p, 1251, the 1978 name change from UP1 to PPI “...Vas

 intended       to reemphasize that                    the industrial               price      program      continues         to be based

 on prices       received        by producers              from whoever makes the first                           purchase,        rather

 than on prices          paid to wholesalers                   by retailers                 or others       further      removed in the

 distribution          chain.”       Currently             the PPI program at BLS encompasses the

 construction          of aggregate          price         indexes          for     almost SODmining and                 manufacturing

 industries,          including      approximately              8,000 indexes                  for     specific       product

           The PPI for                  the     various            pharamaceutfal                    products             ara based               on prices            for        a

fixed      basket           of products,                dravn from monthly                           voluntary                reporting            to    the      BLS        by

selected           manufacturing                     establishments.                   Several                  points        are worth noting.

           First,           the fixed                basket of products                       is chosen through                        a sampling procedure

implemented at irregular                               intervals              across industries,                          vhose frequency                       depends in

part    on the perceived                        stability             of      the industry.                          Detailed         surveys           of

pharmaceutical                   firms vere conducted                           in 1980 and in 1987, and                                   the     fixed         baskets

were changed in 1981 and in January                                             1988;         the         BLS        refers     to     the        1980 survey                as

“Cycle       I”.       and       that         from 1987 as “Cycle                      II”.

            Second,          in principle,                   the      sample is drawn from the                                  universe               of all

products           from domestic establishments                                     vhoae           main production                    is in SIC 2834.7                           A

BLS field             representative                   visits         selected              establishments                     (in the pharmaceutical

industry,             the    BLS        visits         wherever              the appropriate                         records are kept,                   usually              ’

“disaggregation”                        to settle           on vhich            detailed             products             are to be sampled.                           Once

this       initial          visit         is completed,                    subsequent “repricing’                              for     the selected                commod-

ities       occurs          on      a    monthly basis,                    typically           by         the        respondent            company filling’out

and returning                 forms sent it                  by mail by the BLS; these forma are                                                  pro-printed                with

the     detailed            description                of the chosen products.                                   the reported                prices          over the

previous           three or four months, and a request                                               for         a    price     quote fron                the     Tuesday

of the        week      containing                   the 13th of the month.                                 Currently,               approximately                50

responding             companies in SIC 28341 provide                                          about 400 individual                              price       quotations.

            Third,          once monthly                    data are in hand,                       the         BLS    calculates                thr     PPI according

to a modified                 Laspeyres               formula,             details          of which are                  given in Appendix                       A.

            Fourth,           during           the     disaggregation                   process,                 products            are defined                in very

specific           detail.               As the        U.     S.    Department of Labor (1986a, 1989) manuals

emphasize, any price-determining                                           characteristic                       distinguishes                one product                from

another.        The U. S. Department                 of     Labor [1988,            p. 1261 rummarinoa price-

dotormining           characteristics          as follows:

           ‘If a company charges more for a red widget than a white one,
             color is one of the price-determining variables;    if all widgets
             sell for the #ame price regard1088 of color,   color is not a
             price-determining variable.'

In the pharmaceutical              context,          if     prices      of bottles            differ,       a bottle       of 100

pills      each having        SO milligrams               of a drug is not the same as a bottle                               of SO

pills      of 100 milligrams,            even though both bottles                       contain           5,000 milligrams             of

the     #ame drug.         Noreover,      transaction-specific                      factors       such as volume discounta

or freight          costs (if      absorbed by the manufacturer)                          affect          price,      so these

factors       are included         in the definition                 of the     product.

           Sixth,      precisely       hov the BLS determines                   the      total      number of price

quotations          assigned to each establishment                       is not completely                   clear,     but

apparently          thin   decision      involves           substantial         judgment.               According        to the US

Department of Labor [1986b.                    pp.        42-461,     the number of quotes taken from an

establishment           depends on industry                 concentration,             price       variations          vithln        and

across establishments,                 establishment            size,     and the number of products                          produced

at each       establishment.            Moreover,           discussions         with      BLS personnel               suggest that

for     any   sampled establishment                  in any industry,                there      is a minimum of tvo quotes

and a maximum of sixteen.                  In recent            years,        the     number of companies sampled has

declined       vithtn       the pharmaceutical               industry,         there has been an effort                         to

increase       quotes to large           sample units               and to distribute                   quotes across product

lines      to create       more    efficient          index estimates.                 Hence,           in practice       the        choice

of products           sampled departs          significantly              from strict            probability            sampling

procedures.

           Finally,        although     the BL!I manuals emphasize                       that      transactions           rather        than

list     prices       are desired,       and Form 473P states                       clearly       that      “net      transactions

estimated total industry                             revenues           by product              class.    Since the IHS data    include

IV.         SOME CLUES AND AN IMPORTANT m

            Our analysis            to this         point     suggests that              the products               sampled by the BLS

in this        industry          appear to have price                   trends        that      differ          from representative

transactions             for      the four companies in our sample, and in the systemic                                                        anti-

infective         sub-class,            from essentially                the     industry           as a whole.                What        is    it     about

the BLS sampling                 procedures          that     on average appear to miss the smaller                                            price

increases         of     representative              transactions?

            Since the potential                    existence        of a ‘new goods” problem has been known for

quite       some time, 2o ve began our search for                                   an explanation               by simply looking                      at

the      mean age of products                    sampled by the BLS relative                          to the average age of all

dated products                 in the     four      companies.21               This coarse analysis                     turned out to be

uninformative,                 since differences              vere small.

            Another        line     we pursued,             followlng          a conjecture              presented             in Berndt,

Criliches         and     Rosett         (19901,       involved         examining            the     extent        to which           items

 sampled by the BLS in Cycle                          I were re-sampled by them                          in     Cycle        II.      For the 25

 items in the            four      companies sampled by the BLS in Cycle I,                                        seven were re-sampled

 in Cycle        II.      Whether such a 28~ re-sampling                               rate        is consistent               with probability

 sampling procedures                    is not clear,           but it         appears unlikely                   to us that              this       amount

 of re-sampling                could be responsible                  for      the    BLS sample failing                      to pick up

 adequately            the smaller          price      increases           of representative                    transactions.

             Uo then examined                       the role         of new products                       in     a different                  manner,

 conjecturing               that          while       the     distribution               of       products              by age may p11 sveragg be

 might      be      skewed in different                        ways.           To follov            this          up,        we first            defined            six      age

          For our purposes,                it     is important       to note that      the tvo clearly

Further,             when a BLS sampled item dummy variable                                          was added              to thts         equation          (see

Column 4 of Tsblt                          5),      the estimated             coefficient            on the             BIS dummy variable                   is

‘explained”                 by the           right-hand           aide of equation                  (4);         hence about 43X (2.70/6.28)

of     the         discrepancy               can       be explained           by differences                     in share weights              and

differentials                     in      rates        of price     change           by age        group.           For     Cycle      I,    this

proportion                 is 36X (1.89/5.27),                     while       for     Cycle II             it     is     38% (3.26/8.54).

            Cur focus in this                        paper has been on why the official                                  BLS price                index

grovs approximately                        50X more rapidly                   (9.09X vs.          6.03%)         than     a Divisia                 index,

where       the     latter            is computed             using         data on 2,090 products                      sold by four                 of the

ten largest              firms         in the US pharmaceutical                          industry.          These four                 firms

comprised approximately                              24% of total             domestic          industry         sales in 1989.

            The evidence                we have presented                     suggests that,             in terms of sampled items,

the difference                   cannot be attributed                        to the      four     firms being unrepresentative                                    of

the     industry           as     a    vhole,         for growth rates                 of prices         for      items sampled by the

BLS at       the        four      firms        are     very      close        to that        of the      official              PPI (8.94X             VS.

9.09X).           Moreover,             when         IIIS data        are     employed for            a sub-class               of products

(systemic           anti-infectives)                       encompassing almost the entire                               universe             of products,

the difference                   in AAGR becomes even                        larger      -- 6.26X for             the     official                PPI vs.

sampling process better,                                   ve now follow                    the BLS procedure                        and discuss            its       two

distinct            stages,            in vhich                the overall                 aim is to           make        the probability                  of

ensure         coverage of important                items. 28            We now      summarize these two stages.

          ~11 PPI’s are routinely                        subject        to monthly         revision           every        month for              four

months after            original      publication                (usually      on the          second      or third           Friday           of the

month following             the     reference        month),            to reflect         late        reportr        and corrections

by compsny respondents.                    After          four     months,       indexes         are     considered             final.

          The sampling frame               for      estsbllshments               is drawn from the Unemployment

Insurance         data files         (as upd.sted and refined                     by BLS personnel),                       and in almost

all    cases reported              employment determines                     the probability              of inclusion.              29

Although        use of VOS to choose the establishment                                   sampling frsme would be

preferable,            the BLS Justifies             using employment as a proxy                              for VOS in            the        first

stage since employment figures                            are more widely             available            for       estebllshments

than     sre    data     on VOS; 3o moreover,                    BLS asserts         that UI ‘...ls                  used as a proxy                   in

sampling since             the number of employees tends to be correlated                                             with      the revenue

several        establishments          are set at one location                          (called         a Profit           Haxlnlrlng

Center),         then the estsbllshments                        (referred      to as a cluster)                  are considered                   to

be one establishment,                 and the reported                   employment figures                   are appropriately

summed.

          Once an establishment                    has     been selected,               in the second stage                     l   BLS field

representative            visits      it   and conducts                 an interview            designed to select                   the items

to be priced            and to collect             base prices              and value      weights.                 In theory,            the

probability            with which a product                     is selected,         given choice              of the establishment

and the number of quotes asslgned to it,                                     is proportional               to its          VOS over            the

twelve     months        prior      to the interview.                    In this      dlsaggregatlon                  process,            ln

subset      of products.              This        economy of required                detail      reduces         the reporting

burden      on cooperating              companies,           and results           in an initiation                   interview               that        is

          Within       the disaggregation                   process,       several         additional       steps occur.

First,      all     products         are categorized               into broad         product       classes.              A running

total      of the percent             of VOS for            each category            is formed,          and the          number of

price      quotes to be taken from within                             each category            is determined              by randomly

choosing a first              percentile            level     and equally           spacing the remaining                           quotes to

be chosen.

           For example, suppose there                        are three          product        categories         and that                  five

quotes are to be chosen for                         the     establishment           as a whole.            Let the             first

category          account     for     SOX of the            VOS,      the second for            30X. and the third                          for      20X;

hence the running               total        is    SOX,     BOX and       100X.       Since five          quotes are                  to be

chosen,       a random percentile                   level     from      1 to 20 is selected                (note             that       100X/S -

20X).       Suppose this             random percentile                 level      is 1S.33        Then     the         additional                  four

quotes are equally               spaced at intervals                    of 20; in this            case, at 3S, 55, 75 and

9s.       because the         15th and 35th               percentiles           both fall        within     the first                   segment

of the      running      total        (OX - SOX), tvo quotes will                         be chosen from the                        first

category.           Similarly,          55 and 7S fall                within     the second segment, so two quotes

~111 be chosen           from        the     second       category.            Finally,        one quote will                 come from the

third      category.          This      process       of     disaggregation               is repeated       within             each

category          from the first             stage until           an individual              product     involved             in a

particular          transaction            is identified.               The resulting            unique transaction                           is     then

recorded          in detail      so that           future     price      quotes can be accurately                            identified               by

the reporting           establishment.

          As was noted earlier,                     in some cases selected                     product     categories                   are

-certainty          sampled’ or “certainty                    selected”.            This can occur               if     it     is felt               by

the BLS that           some item is of particular                         importance,           or may be so in the future.

    In the 1987 sample                      for         specified       companies,           both      diabetes           and cancer         therapies
1   are certainty                 selected.                In this      type      of certainty               selection,           one item         from

    within          the chosen           category             is selected          using normal disaggregation                             procedures
!   (e.g.,          vithin        SIC 2834 119 for                   cancer therapies,                 or vithin           SIC 2834 127 for

    diabetes           therapies),                the     VOS for       the entire           category           is subtracted              from the VOS

    of the establishment,                            the number of remaining                    selections              is reduced by one, and

    the      disaggregation                 process is begun again from the beginning                                           (without       the

    certainty              selected         category).               This procedure                 is repeated           for     any additional

    certainty              selected         items.           A second type of certainty                            sampling occurs whenever

    the percentage                   of VOS for             a product          class       exceeds the sampling interval                            at that

    level          of disaggregotion.

                   For the        pharmaceutical                   and paper mill            industries,               the Cycle II

    disaggregation                   procedure            differed       from that           for most other                industries          in tvo

    respects.               First,       rather           than alloving             the     establishment               to determine           the

    classes          of products               for       the first       step of the disaggregation                             process,       the BU

    provided           a table          of product              categories.               In most industrias                no more than eight

    categories              are defined              at each         level      of disaggregation.                   but in SIC 28341 there

    are      48 products              vithin         the prescription                   pharmaceuticals                section.          The other

    difference               from normal disaggregation                           procedures           is in        the handling            of the

    second typo of certainty                              selection,           mentioned at            the     end      of the previous

taking      place         through     the mail.           From        this    the BLS obtains                     a    time series             of

monthly price              quotes for each item sampled, defined                                   in such             a     way so as to make

the item transacted                  and the transaction                    constant     over time.

establishment.               Note that         an item with             a    small VOS is given                        the same vithin-

cell     vtight      as an item with                 a larger     VOS, but that                   this      is consistent                  with

probability          sampling proportional                    to VOS, for           the small item essentially

represents          many other         small items which.                    when combined, have the same

probability          of selection             as     a single,         larger      item with               the        same VOS.            As ve

understand          it,     the within         cell      index is a fixed-base                      Lasptyres                 index     adjusted

Aggregated          between-cell             indexes are then created                    by weighting                        withln-cell

    prices reported by the companies, and 17 were entrants or exits where
    movements of initial     or final sales  by producers   through   the distribution

data was   4.12X, while     that for the matched four-company              products was 3.27X.
Since the     four-company    Divisia     for all products       in SIC 2834111 grows at but
1.20X per     year, we interpret       the higher    growth    rates   of these common items.as
reflecting      the fact that the matched products            omit new goods and therefore
represent     more mature,    established     products.       Recall   from the previous
footnote    that typically     nev goods are poorly         tracked    by IMS as they initially
enter   the distribution      chain.

141t might be noted,   however,  that contemporaneous correlations   of monthly log
price changes between    IHS and company data are typically   very low -- often
less than 0.02.    However, for annualized prices,   the revenue-weighted
correlations  exceed 0.5.

15Paralle1 MCR’s over the same lo/84 - 12/89 time period for the four-company
products in SIC 2834111 are 1.96X for the Laspeyres and 1.15X for the Divisia.
Ue had expected the Ikf.9 prices to grow at a slower rate   than those in the
four-company data, in part because the ItlS data include generic drugs.     Why
this inequality  occurs is a topic worthy of further   consideration.

16tlonthly    total   revenue data by therapeutic       class were purchased from Ills.

17This smoothing procedure was employed to mitigate   the problem of “drift
that occurs with chained indexes such as the Divisia.    For further discussion,
see Berndt, Griliches  and Rosett (19901, as well as Barzel 119631, Frisch
119361 and Stulc (19831.

1’This Laspeyres calculation    uses company quantities   as weights, and links
them in January 1988 to reflect    the BLS splice between Cycles I and II.      For
Cycle I, the MGR of reported prices was 7.741. while for transactions        prices
it was 8.97X; for Cycle II, the respective     growth rates are 11.49X and 10.69X.

“For  Cycle I, reported and average transactions  prices               of SIC 2834111 sampled
items grew at an MGR of 7.64X and 7.63X, respectively,                 while for Cycle 11 the
growth rates  are 10.43X and 10.64X.

2oSee, for     example, W. Ervin     Dievert   (19881 and the references        cited   therein.
21Alternative    presentations  of the same product introduced at different     dates
are treated as such, i.e.,     we do not treat alternative    treatments as all being
introduced    at the time the initial   presentation  was brought to market.

22Revenue shares are computed as the arithmetic              mean of the shares in the tvo
years.

23Uhen a similar    analysis is done separately  for Cycles I and, we find that of
the 1.16X difference     in MCR in Cycle I, the right-hand    side of equation (4)
explains 1.57X (or more than the entire difference),      while in Cycle II the.
relationship   explains 1.15X of the 4.60X difference    in AACR’o.

241t would have been desirable to undertake a similar analysis using the IhS
data, but at this point in time we have not been able to obtain data on
product introduction  dates for the items in that data set.

*‘Note   that the summation counter is not specified      in (1), and generally
requirer    an additional   subscript.    Also, the BIS Handbook (BIS, Bulletin  2265
[1988], p. 130) states that       ‘The expression (QaPD) represents the weight in
value form, and the P and Q elements (both of which originally         relate to
period   ‘a” but are adjusted     for price change to period “0”) are not derived

companies, both cancer therapy and diabetes preparation  drugs are being

2gDiscussions with BLS personnel indicate   that in some cases where value of
shipment data is intact and complete for establishments,   VOS rather than UI
data are used to compute probabilities   of inclusion.

3oAs Hill [1987, p. 5831 notes,      “By law, every employor in the U.S. is
required to report the number of people employed and to purchase               insurance
vhich vi11 cover the employer’s unemployment benefit         liability.       As a result
the UI file data are fairly     complete.    The continued existence of the UI file
is also assured, thereby ensuring continued availability            of a consistent       frame
for sampling.   The UI file contains such information        as the establishment’s
name, the SIC in which it is classified,       the county and state in which it 18
located, and its number of employees.        This file   is explicitly     stratified
according to industry  classification      and thus provides    individual       industry
frames vhich form the basis for the PPI frames.”

34Houever,  there     is some ambiguity here.      Although the wording in the BLS
discussion of special        disaggregation  procedurea (U. S. Department of Labor
[1986a]) explicitly       states that the entire cell is discarded once the
certainty  selection      occurs,   our sample from one company contains multiple
selections  from    individual     cells.
35 An adjustment  is made for inter-    and intra-industry   transfers   to remove non-
final product values from the veights,      thereby obtaining    net output values of
shipments as weights.    Currently   the adjustment factor is based on the 1977
Input-Output  tables from the Bureau of Economic Analysis,        U. S. Department of
Commerce.
