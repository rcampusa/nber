Valuing Consumer Products by the Time Spent Using Them: An Application to the Internet
Austan Goolsbee and Peter J. Klenow
NBER Working Paper No. 11995

JEL No. D6, L0

                                           ABSTRACT

For some goods, the main cost of buying the product is not the price but rather the time it takes to
use them. Only about 0.2% of consumer spending in the U.S., for example, went for Internet access
in 2004 yet time use data indicates that people spend around 10% of their entire leisure time going
online. For such goods, estimating price elasticities with expenditure data can be difficult, and,
therefore, estimated welfare gains highly uncertain. We show that for time-intensive goods like the
Internet, a simple model in which both expenditure and time contribute to consumption can be used
to estimate the consumer gains from a good using just the data on time use and the opportunity cost
of people's time (i.e., the wage). The theory predicts that higher wage internet subscribers should
spend less time online (for non-work reasons) and the degree to which that is true identifies the
elasticity of demand. Based on expenditure and time use data and our elasticity estimate, we
calculate that consumer surplus from the Internet may be around 2% of full-income, or several
thousand dollars per user. This is an order of magnitude larger than what one obtains from a back-of-
the-envelope calculation using data from expenditures.

I. Introduction

        Recent years have witnessed a surge in studies using micro data on consumer

demand to estimate the welfare gains that new goods bring to consumers.1 These papers

typically estimate demand curves for a product and use them to impute the consumer

surplus generated from the good. For some goods, however, like watching television or

using the Internet (for fun), direct expenses are miniscule and the main cost of

consumption is the amount of leisure time spent using the product. For such goods,

estimating the price elasticity from expenditures can be quite difficult and thus welfare

calculations highly uncertain.2

        In this paper we show that thinking about that distinction can open up new

avenues for estimating welfare. We will focus on the particular case of residential use of

the Internet as our example because it has many of the relevant features: low marginal

costs (zero for people paying a fixed fee per month), almost no cross-sectional variation

in prices (Greenstein and Downes, 2002), a very small share of spending, and time costs

making up the vast majority of the cost of consuming the product.

        We show that, by relating the time consumers spend on a good to the opportunity

cost of their time in a simple utility model, we can estimate the demand curve and

compute the consumer surplus from Internet access in a way that is distinctly different

from a conventional calculation based on observed price and expenditure data.

  Recent examples include Hausman (1999), Petrin (2002a), Nevo (2003), Goolsbee and Petrin (2004) and
papers in Bresnahan and Gordon (1997).
2
  The distinction between expenditure and consumption was first analyzed in Becker (1965) but has had
little impact on the analysis of consumer innovations. Petrin (2002b), which uses data on utilization to
improve conventional estimates of consumer welfare, is an exception. Aguiar and Hurst (2005) show the
importance of distinguishing Consumption from Expenditure for understanding behavior over the lifecycle.


                                                                                                       2
        The model will let the utility function for a good include consumption in the form

of direct expenditures as well as in the form of time. The results suggest that consumer

gains from the Internet (as of January 2005) are quite high, perhaps more than a thousand

dollars per year for the median person. This contrasts sharply with the back of the

envelope calculation one might make using standard data, which would put the value at

less than $100.



I. Model

        To account for both time and market spending for a good, we specify utility of the

form

                                            1−1/ σ                           1−1/ σ
(1.1)                       (
                          θ CIα I L1I−α I   )                 (
                                                     + (1 − θ) COαO L1O−αO   )        ,

where CI denotes purchased Internet services and LI the fraction of time devoted to

enjoying the Internet (not work related). For simplicity, all other purchased goods and

services form a composite CO , and LO is the fraction of time spent on the composite. θ

scales the importance of the Internet bundle compared to the composite bundle.

        Consumers maximize utility subject to the budget constraint

                            PI CI + FI + PO CO = W (1 − LI − LO ) ,

where W is the wage and PI and PO are the prices of Internet services and the composite

good, respectively. FI is any fixed fee for subscribing to the Internet in a given period,

whereas PI is any marginal cost of using Internet services. In practice, this is essentially

zero (because Internet costs a flat fee per month).




                                                                                             3
        For good j, call the combined Cobb-Douglas consumption Yj and the weighted

averages of the price of market goods and the value of time (i.e., the wage) j. Then

             αj             1−α j
        Pj          W
λj =                                 , and the optimal choices for people with Internet access are
        αj         1− α j

                                                                                       σ−1           σ
     W − FI                 W − FI                 λI                                        1− θ
YI =             and YO =                where Γ =                                                       .
     λ I (1 + Γ)          λ O (1 + 1/ Γ)           λO                                         θ

These break down into


                                    Cj =
                                           α j λ jY j
                                                           and L j =
                                                                         (1 − α j ) λ jY j
                                               Pj                                  W

for good j (either Internet, I, or composite, O).

        When the Internet is not available, CI and LI (and thus YI ) are 0 and all

consumption is the composite. Expenditure functions with and without the Internet are

                                                                                                     σ

                  E ( PO , PI , FI , W , u | YI > 0 ) = FI +                                                  and
                                                                                     1
                                                                                             1− θ
                                                                      (1 + 1/ Γ )   σ−1


                                                                                           σ
                                                                              u           ο−1
                                    E ( PO ,W , u | YI = 0 ) = λ O                              .
                                                                             1− θ

Consumer surplus from the Internet, measured as an equivalent variation, will then be:

                        EV = E ( PO , W , u ( PI , FI , PO , W | YI > 0 ) | YI = 0 ) − W
(1.2)                                               1/( σ−1)
                                                                                                          .
                            = W (1 + 1/ Γ )                    (1 − FI / W ) − 1

        As expected, the surplus depends on σ, the elasticity of substitution between the

Internet bundle and the bundle of other goods and services. This is very similar to a

conventional demand analysis. To identify the sensitivity of demand to price, though,




                                                                                                                    4
would then require variation in prices. Rappoport et. al (2003) argue there is enough

variation to estimate the elasticity of demand and put it at -0.27 for dial-up access and -

1.49 for broadband access. The true elasticity σ, however, would be dramatically larger

since the access fees make up only a small part of the full cost of using the Internet

(because of the time component).

        An alternative to using Internet Service Provider fees is to use variation in the

opportunity cost of time to estimate the elasticity σ. The theory above predicts that, as

wages rise, people should use the Internet less. How quickly use declines will indicate σ.

Since wages vary a great deal across individuals, this also gives us a chance to identify

the elasticity in a way that is very difficult using only purchase prices.

        Using the optimal allocations implies that

        The Internet costs a flat subscription rate so the relevant case is α I = 0 and FI > 0.

Moreover, the fixed cost itself is typically very small relative to full income (0.2% or

less), so that FI / W ≈ 0 . As a result, the left-hand-side of (1.3) is approximately equal to

(1 − LI ) / LI . Taking natural logs of (1.3) yields

                   1 − LI                                                         1−θ

The left-hand-side is (the log of) time spent on non-Internet pursuits relative to time spent

on the Internet. Ln(A) is constant across individuals and we will illustrate below that


                                                                                              5
(α O − α I ) is approximately -0.62 so we can directly translate the coefficient from a

regression like (1.4) into an estimate of σ. We envision that the error term in this

regression arises from individual variation in the preference for the Internet good relative

to the composite, from (1.1). Below we will discuss how this variation might affect our

parameter estimate.



II. Data

           To assess time spent on the Internet, we use the 2005 Consumer Technographics

data of Forrester Research. This was a mail survey conducted in early of 2005 of more

than 60,000 households and is meant to be nationally representative. More detail about

the Forrester data can be found in Goolsbee and Klenow (2002). The survey includes

demographic and socio-economic information as well as information on how many hours

per week the respondent spends on the Internet for personal reasons (i.e., not for work).

The answers are grouped (e.g., 0 hours, 1-4 hours, 4-8 hours, and so on), and we take the

smallest number for each category, though this proved inconsequential. The average

subscriber spends about 7.7 hours per week on the Internet for personal reasons, or 6.9%

of non-sleep time (assuming 8 hours of sleep per day).

           Only 0.21% of consumption spending went for Internet Service Providers in 2004

(from Table 2.4.5U of the NIPA accounts). Scaling this up to account for the 37% of

people that are not online in our data, typical consumption of a subscriber would be

around 0.33%.3 The time share is some 30 times larger than the expenditure share so the

Internet would is an extremely time-intensive type of consumption.


3
    Adding computer hardware and software, including video games, the expenditure share is 1.3%.


                                                                                                   6
        Using the equations above, we can get a plausible value for the time intensity of

the composite good: one minus the ratio of direct expenditures on the good to direct plus

time expenditures (i.e., wage times leisure time spent). By this measure, the time

intensity of the composite would be 0.38 versus a time intensity of the Internet of 1.4 To

compute welfare in our model, we will also use the fact that consumer spending on

Internet access relative to full income (wage income plus the value of leisure time) is

.0012, so that the share of non-sleep time spent online is .069, the share devoted to other

leisure is .574 and the rest, .357, goes to work.

        In Table 1 we estimate equation (1.4) and the implied value of σ. The positive

coefficients confirm that those with higher incomes report spending less time on the

Internet. This result may seem surprising given that Internet subscription is concentrated

among higher income people (something our model can produce if FI > 0 and σ is not

too high). But conditional on subscribing, the higher the value of one’s time the less one

uses the Internet. The coefficient of 0.12 in the first row corresponds to a σ of 1.3.

        In the second row we tried the same regression using time spent on the Internet

for work-related reasons, which is somewhat outside the control of the consumer and

should not, necessarily, show the pattern of our model. The results indicate that while

higher income people use the Internet less for leisure, this is not true for work.

        In row three, we tried including a variety of demographic variables which might

correlate with Internet usage, such as a dummy for whether the respondent has children,

for whether they are single, as well as dummies for educational attainment, gender and


4
 This is derived from x = Px Cx / (Px Cx + WLx), dividing numerator and denominator by income, W(1- LI –
LO), and plugging an expenditure share of .0033 for the Internet and .9966 for the composite and using 7.7
hours per week for the Internet, 40 hours for work and the rest of non-sleep time to the composite good.


                                                                                                        7
race. The implied σ barely changes. In row four, we add controls for time spent on the

Internet for work-related reasons and dummies for how many years the individual has

had access to the Internet. These variables are positively related to personal use of the

Internet—the more time spent working on the Internet and the more years one has had

Internet access, the more time one spends on the Internet for personal reasons. But

inclusion of these controls does not reduce the relationship of personal Internet usage and

the value of time. The coefficient is actually twice as large as in the baseline case but the

implied σ is 1.6 versus 1.3.

       In the fifth row, we allow for income to affect demand for the Internet

independent of the opportunity cost of time (e.g., if Internet content caters to high-income

people) by including dummies for the total value of assets owned as an indicator of non-

wage income. Again, σ barely changes.

       We will use these demand estimates to calculate surplus from the Internet. Since

we conditioned on subscribers, though, there may be a selection problem in the estimates:

usage of the Internet falls with income but the probability of having Internet access rises

with income. While this could be caused by the existence of a fixed cost of getting

access for the first time, there is also likely to be considerable heterogeneity across

people in their taste for technology. In future work we hope to ground the sign-up and

usage decision in one larger framework. The problem we face here is the absence of

factors correlated with whether a person signs up for Internet access but unrelated to the

amount of time spent using the Internet conditional on access. It is difficult, therefore, to




                                                                                              8
do a Heckman-type selection correction.5 In practice, we are not especially concerned

with selection because our estimate of σ does not vary much when we confine the sample

to people with a college degree that are younger than 50 years old as in the sixth row of

Table 1. The unconditional probability of having Internet access among this group is

almost 95%, so selection is not especially relevant for them.



IV. Welfare

        Assuming Internet subscription is at a flat rate with no marginal cost (so FI > 0

and α I =0), the equivalent variation in (1.2) is

Each of the variables in the formula can be measured in the data.

        As a comparison, take the standard 'triangle' approach to approximating demand

described in Hausman (1999). Here one linearizes the demand curve and estimates the

welfare (as a share of income) as CS=-.5*(expenditure share)/(elasticity of demand).

With an expenditure share of 0.3% and an estimated price elasticity of -.27 or -1.49, this

would be 0.1% to 0.6% of income, or only $50 to $290 at the median income in the

sample. If estimating the price elasticity has problems, however, because of the lack of

variation in prices and the small share of prices in the total cost, this estimate should be

viewed with caution.

 We tried doing the correction using a dummy variable for whether the person uses a computer at work and
obtained a very similar σ. Since Internet use at work is probably correlated with the preference for the
Internet elsewhere, this doesn't really solve the problem.


                                                                                                               9
         Our approach uses the estimates of σ from above and the model to compute the

welfare gain. Doing this with the log demand curve will, of course, generate a much

larger total gain since the utility from the first units of consumption are so high. To limit

the importance of that, we can also construct an analogue to Hausman’s methodology by

linearizing the “leisure demand curve” instead of the goods demand curve. The area

underneath the linear leisure demand curve yields an EV as a share of full income of

approximately 0.5*LI/ , where the elasticity of leisure demand, , is σ (1 − LI (1 − FI / W ) ) .

         Table 2 gives the surplus, relative to full income, under various values of σ. The

Table shows that linearization would yield surplus of 2% to 3% of full income, and with

log-linear demand substantially larger.6 At the median full income in the sample (actual

income plus the value of leisure time), surplus would be $2,500 to $3,800 in the linear

case.


         Thus we are able to get estimates of the welfare gain from the product using only

data on time use. We add two important caveats, however. First, we are valuing leisure

time at the wage. If people value their time less than the wage then the time component

will be reduced and the welfare gains as well.7 The second is that our simple model with

only a composite alternative assumes there are no closer, time-intensive substitutes.

Television would be a potential counter-example. If television and the Internet are very

close substitutes, then our surplus estimate is too large. This same issue arises with

conventional demand curve analysis, and argues that future work should consider a

  One reason to be wary of the log demand model is that it predicts that virtually all households would
subscribe to the Internet given the low price of doing so. In the data, some 37% of people were not online.

  If people value their time at some constant fraction of their wage, this would not affect the estimates of σ

multinomial setting where people can choose between different uses of their time when

estimating the demand curve for the Internet.8


V. Conclusion

         Consumption of every good arguably involves both expenditures and time. The total cost

of some goods, like the Internet, are primarily comprised of time costs rather than monetary costs.

In such cases, estimating conventional price elasticities can be hard and welfare gains from the

products highly uncertain. Using data on the time spent using the Internet and a simple model of

utility, we show that for time intensive goods, one can get a direct estimate of the welfare gains

from consumer products using only the time use data.

         Although Internet use illustrates our point nicely, our simple model may overstate the

gains from its availability by treating all other leisure pursuits as equally substitutable with

Internet use. Some activities are liable to be much closer substitutes than others, for example

reading a newspaper or watching TV. Still, given a set of goods and their substitutability, taking

into account the time-intensity of the Internet can amplify its importance. And, as we have done,

one can use variation in the value of time across individuals to estimate the substitutability

between goods which differ in their time-intensity.

  Such a program is well beyond the scope of this paper, but we did check whether Internet usage varied
systematically with the price of cable television in an area (which changes the relative price of television)
using the data in Goolsbee and Petrin (2004). We found no relationship. As a first pass, this may suggest
the two activities are not such close substitutes.
