        LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS IN PRODUCTION BASED ASSET PRICING MODELS


                                   ABSTRACT


     This paper explores the time series implications of introducing credit
constraints into a production based asset pricing model. Simulations are
performed choosing parameter values which generate reasonable values for
aggregate fluctuations. These results show that mean reversion in simulated
returns series, measured by variance ration tests, is enhanced with the
introduction of binding credit constraints. Without these constraints there is
very little evidence of mean reversion. This is consistent with financial
market data where the weak evidence for mean reversion is stronger in small
firm returns. Other tests are run on the simulated series including checking
the standard deviation, skewrless, and kurtosis. These other tests do not show
strong differences between the constrained and unconstrained firms in the
model.
