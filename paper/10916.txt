This paper explores ways to integrate model uncertainty into policy evaluation. We first describe a

general framework for the incorporation of model uncertainty into standard econometric calculations.

This framework employs Bayesian model averaging methods that have begun to appear in a range

of economic studies. Second, we illustrate these general ideas in the context of assessment of simple

monetary policy rules for some standard New Keynesian specifications. The specifications vary in

their treatment of expectations as well as in the dynamics of output and inflation. We conclude that

the Taylor rule has good robustness properties, but may reasonably be challenged in overall quality

with respect to stabilization by alternative simple rules that also condition on lagged interest rates,

even though these rules employ parameters that are set without accounting for model uncertainty.

I. Introduction


       This paper explores issues related to the analysis of government policies in the
presence of model uncertainty. Within macroeconomics, increasing attention is being
given to the positive and normative implications of model uncertainty.          One major
direction of this work has been initiated by the seminal contributions of Hansen and
Sargent (2001a,b,2002,2003) on robustness in policy analysis. Examples of contributions
to this research program include Giannoni (2002), Marcellino and Salmon (2002),
Onatksi and Stock (2002) and Tetlow and von zur Muehlen (2001) and our own Brock
and Durlauf (2004a,b) and Brock, Durlauf and West (2003).2 In this approach, model
uncertainty is defined relative to a given baseline model; specifically, a space of possible
models is constructed by considering all models that lie within some distance ε of the
baseline. In evaluating policies, the loss associated with a given policy is determined
relative to the least favorable model in the model space, i.e. preferences are assumed to
follow a minimax rule with respect to model uncertainty. As such, this program follows
the approach to decisionmaking initiated by Wald (1950).

                                           1
        Our approach to model uncertainty analyzes model spaces that are non-local in
the sense that we do not require that the different models are close to each other
according to some metric. For many macroeconomic contexts, it seems clear that model
uncertainty is sufficiently severe that very disparate models should be regarded as
potential candidates for the true or best model. In the context of monetary policy, there
has been no resolution of the role of expectations in determining the effects of policies on
macroeconomic outcomes; some authors favor backward looking models which eschew
any role for expectations (e.g. Rudebusch and Svensson (1999)) while some prefer
forward looking models, (e.g. Woodford (2003)) and some advocate hybrid models with
both forward and backwards looking features (e.g. Galí and Gertler (1999)). Model
uncertainty also exists within these classes. For the classes of models that employ
expectations, one finds differences with respect to how they are formulated, with
disagreement about the use of rational expectations versus survey-based measures, for
example. Yet another source of differences concerns the dynamic specification of a
model in terms of lag length structure.
        Formally, we treat uncertainty with respect to the true model in a fashion that is
symmetric to other forms of uncertainty. From this perspective, the analysis of policies
based upon a single model may be thought of as producing conditional probability
statements in which one of the conditioning elements is the model. This approach to
understanding how models effect policy evaluation leads to the use of model averaging
methods, in which one first evaluates the conditional probability of some unknown object
of interest given data and a choice of model and second eliminates this conditioning on a
model by integrating out the model “variable.” Eliminating this dependence amounts to
taking weighted averages of the model-specific probabilities, where the weights
correspond to the probabilities of each model being the correct one. Model averaging
represents an important recent development in the statistics literature; major contributions
include Draper (1995) and Raftery, Madigan and Hoeting (1997). Model averaging
methods require the specification of probabilities across models in order to compute
posterior probabilities concerning parameters or other unknowns (such as forecasts) of
interest.

                                             2
       Within the economics literature, these model averaging methods are achieving
increasing prominence. Areas of application include economic growth (Brock and
Durlauf (2001), Brock, Durlauf and West (2003), Doppelhoffer, Miller and Sala-i-Martin
(2000) and Fernandez, Ley, and Steel (2001)), finance (Avramov (2002)), and forecasting
(Garratt, Lee, Pesaran and Shin (2003) and Wright (2003a,b)) Some initial work on
applications to monetary policy evaluation appears in Brock, Durlauf and West (2003).
       While model averaging is a powerful tool in addressing model uncertainty, one
can imagine contexts in which a policymaker will want more information than simply a
summary statistic of the effects of a policy on outcomes where model dependence has
been integrated out. For example, a policymaker may be interested in policies whose
effects are relatively insensitive to which model is the correct one. Alternatively, a
policymaker may wish to engage in model selection, and would like to know how this
selection affects the likely efficacy of the policy.    One reason for this is that a
policymaker may not wish to adjust policies in response to the updating of model
probabilities. For this reason, we believe that proper reporting of the effects of model
uncertainty should also include descriptions of how model choice affects the form of a
policy rule and the payoffs associated with that rule. This dependence leads us to
calculate statistics that measure the degree of outcome dispersion, which characterizes
how the losses associated with a model-specific optimal policy rule depends on the
model, and action dispersion, which measures how the optimal policy differs across
alternative models in a model space.
       Our work is most closely related to Levin and Williams (2003). This analysis
compares policy rules under theoretically distinct models; models are averaged by
assigning equal weights to each model; this approach differs from Bayesian averaging as
their weights do not represent posterior model probabilities. Nevertheless, this paper is
important as it is the first extensive analysis of model averaging methods as applied to
monetary policy. A significant virtue of Levin and Williams over our paper is that they
are able to work with a much richer theory set than we do, in particular they include a
model-consistent forward-looking model in their model space. On the other hand, they do
not address the implications of model uncertainty that arise because of dynamics. Our

                                           3
work is complementary to Cogley and Sargent (2004) who consider US monetary policy
but with a positive rather than a normative focus. Cogley and Sargent consider
adjustments to US monetary policy generated by changes in the weights assigned by the
Federal Reserve to different models of inflation, showing that such model uncertainty
helps explain the dynamics of inflation after 1970.
       Our major concern in the empirical work in this paper is with the appropriate way
to present the results of policy evaluation exercises. One obvious way to think about this
problem is simply to compute expected losses under different policies where the
expectation calculations account for model uncertainty. This approach requires the
specification of prior probabilities on the space of possible models. Alternatively, one can
apply a minimax criterion even though the model space we study is non-local. As argued
in Brock, Durlauf, and West (2003), one may interpret Leamer’s (1983) extreme bounds
analysis as doing this. However, our purpose is not to defend a particular way in which
decisions respond to model uncertainty but rather to describe ways to report predictions
concerning policy effects in a way that communicates how model uncertainty affects
these predictions. We will therefore emphasize some informal quantitative and visual
tools to communicate how model uncertainty enters policy evaluation.
       We apply our general analysis to some standard questions on monetary
economics. In our empirical analysis, we consider two classes of standard New
Keynesian models. Models in each class include three equations: a dynamic IS curve
relating output to a real interest rate; a dynamic Phillips curve relating inflation to output
and expected inflation; and a monetary policy (Taylor) rule relating the interest rate to
output, inflation and a lagged interest rate. The two classes differ in their treatment of
expectations. Our backwards class, which builds on Rudebusch and Svensson (1999),
treats expected inflation as a distributed lag on past inflation. Our hybrid class, which
builds on Rudebusch (2002), uses survey data on expected inflation in estimation but
assumes model-consistent expectations in evaluation of alternative monetary policies.
Within a given class, models vary only in terms of the number of lags included on the
right hand sides of the IS and Phillips curves. We consider the effects of alternative
monetary policy rules using a loss function based on a weighted average of variances of

                                              4
output, inflation and interest rates; we refer to the losses incurred under this specification
as risk. Our analysis of the model space reveals that the hybrid models possess a posterior
probability that is an order of magnitude higher than that of the backwards looking
models. So while we do average within classes, we do not average across the model
classes, and rather report results for each class separately. We do so because our model
classes are defined around models that themselves were data mined for distinct model
spaces. We regard the question of how to construct model spaces around data mined
models to be an important outstanding research question.
       We conduct three different empirical analyses. First, we consider the behavior of
the losses associated with the classic Taylor (1993) rule when model uncertainty is
present. Our findings suggest that risk estimates for the Taylor rule are quite robust in the
sense that our risk estimates show relatively little variation across models. Second, we
compare the performance of the Taylor rule with the performance of an interest rate rule
that sets current rates as a function of the lagged rate, current inflation, and current
output. We choose the parameters of the rule such that the parameters are optimal for the
model with the maximum posterior probability in each of our classes. We find that for the
backwards models, the optimized rule systematically dominates the Taylor rule, except
for a small (in posterior probability sense) set of models where the optimized rule induces
instability in the system. For the hybrid class, the optimized rule uniformly dominates
the Taylor rule. Our final exercise considers how optimal three-variable interest rate
rules vary across models. In this exercise, we compute optimal rules and associated risks
for each model in the two model classes. Our analysis of outcome and action dispersion
is largely visual as it consists of the presentation of dispersion figures. As such, it is
somewhat hard to identify simple messages from the exercise. One conclusion we do
draw is that there appears to be some systematic relationship between the coefficients in
the model-specific optimal rules and model complexity.
       The paper is organized as follows. Section II of this paper describes our basic
framework. Section III contains our various empirical exercises. Section IV provides
some interpretation of the findings in the context of a general dynamic linear model.
Section V provides conclusions.

II. Incorporating model uncertainty into statistical analyses


       Our basic argument concerning the analysis of policy in the presence of model
uncertainty is that such uncertainty should be explicitly incorporated in the calculation of
the effects of a policy.     In other words, we argue that from a decision-theoretic
perspective, model uncertainty is not a property that should, via model selection
exercises, be resolved prior to the evaluation of a policy rule, but rather is a component of
that evaluation. To see why this is so, we follow the discussion in Brock, Durlauf, and
West (2003); other analyses that advocate an explicit decision-theoretic approach to the
analysis of data in economics include Chamberlain (2001) and Sims (2002).               This
analysis is a straightforward application of standard statistical decision theory arguments,
cf. Berger (1987).


i. general framework


       Suppose that a policymaker wishes to evaluate the effect of a policy rule p on an
outcome θ . We assume that the policymaker’s assessment of the outcome depends only
on the outcome so that one can separate the preferences of the policymaker from the
probability measure characterizing θ given the policy. In assessing policies, the question
of model uncertainty arises in the context of specifying the information set on which the
assessment is conditioned. Typically, one begins with a specification of the data
generating process, i.e.


                                      θ = m ( p , β m ,η )                               (1)


where m denotes a model, p is a policy, β m is a vector of parameters that indexes the

model and η is a set of unobservable shocks that affect θ . It may be assumed, without
loss of generality, that when evaluating policies, the data generating process and

                                               6
probability measure for the innovation, µη are known even though the realizations of the

shocks are not, so that policies are evaluated based on the conditional probability measure


                                      µ (θ p, m, β m )                                   (2)


This formulation indicates the first level at which the effects of policies are uncertain.
Even if the data generating process and associated parameters are known, there is
uncertainty due to the unobservability of η .
       Eq. (2) implies that a policymaker possesses a great deal of information about the
data generating process. Such information is typically not available to the researcher, and
its absence must be accounted for to provide appropriate statements about the effects of a
policy. The relaxation of the information implicitly assumed in (2) may be done in two
steps. First, assuming that the model is known, there is typically uncertainty about the
values of the model parameters β m . Operationally, this means that one computes


                                       µ (θ p, m, d )                                    (3)


The difference between (2) and (3) is that in (3) one is implicitly using the available data
d to construct estimates of the model parameters. For macroeconomic problems, this is
generally regarded as a second-order; exceptions to this include Giannoni (2001) and
Onatski and Williams (2003). While we do not address parameter uncertainty in our
empirical examples, we note that the lack of importance of parameter uncertainty has by
no means been established as an empirical matter and is in fact contradicted by
Gianonni’s and Onatski and Williams’s findings; this is a topic that warrants further
research.
       For our purposes, the key issue of interest is how to move beyond (3) to account
for uncertainty in the specification of the data generating process, which we will refer to
as model uncertainty.     This level of uncertainty captures that of strong knowledge
concerning economic theories, functional form specification (including threshold effects,
switching regimes, etc.) and heterogeneity in the data generating processes for individual
                                                7
observations. Brock, Durlauf and West (2003) provide a typology of forms of model
uncertainty along these lines. One goal of a policy evaluation may be the calculation of


                                            µ (θ p, d ) .                               (4)


In other words, one way a policymaker can deal with model uncertainty is to treat it as
another type of unobservable similar to η and β m and evaluate policies in a way that
accounts for this.
       As recognized originally in Leamer (1978) and developed in subsequent work
such as Draper (1995), this idea may be operationalized using standard probability
arguments to eliminate the conditioning on m that is present in (3). To do this, suppose
that an analyst is working with a space M of possible data generating processes. We will
implicitly assume that the true model is an element of this space when discussing how we
interpret empirical findings; none of the empirical findings we present are themselves
dependent on that assumption.3 Without loss of generality, we take the space to be
countable.
       Standard application of conditional probability arguments implies that the
µ (θ p, d ) may be characterized as follows:


                           µ (θ p, d ) = ∑ µ (θ p, m, d ) µ ( m d )                     (5)
                                            m



In this expression, µ ( m d ) is known as the posterior probability of model m given data

d. From the perspective of (5), model uncertainty is treated in a fashion that is symmetric
to any other source of uncertainty in θ .
       Eq. (5) reveals how the incorporation of model uncertainty into policy analysis
requires the calculation of a class of objects, posterior model probabilities, which simply
do not appear when one evaluates policies after engaging in model selection. To



                                                 8
understand what these probabilities mean, by Bayes’ rule, these probabilities are the
product of two terms, i.e.


                                µ (m d ) ∝ µ (d m) µ (m)                               (6)



where µ ( d m ) is the likelihood of the data given model m and µ ( m ) is a prior

probability assigned to model m. This derivation illustrates two features concerning the
role of model uncertainty in policy evaluation.
       First, if one starts with a space of possible models which is constructed without
knowledge of which models fit particularly well, then model averaging can ameliorate
problems associated with data mining. Eq. (5) indicates how probability calculations can
employ all models in the model space, incorporating the relatively greater likelihood of
some models versus others via the µ ( d m ) terms. Hence, the standard problem of data

mining, drawing inferences about a model without accounting for its selection, does not
arise. This observation requires two caveats. First, it is important in constructing the
µ ( d m ) terms to avoid overweighting more complex models simply because of their

superior goodness of fit. As we shall see below, model complexity penalties (in our case,
based on the BIC) are needed when calculating posterior model probabilities. Second, in
some cases it may not be possible or practical to analyze the set of all possible models.
Hence, data mining problems may occur because of limits in the analysis that exist in the
model space in the way we have described.
       Second, the issue of model selection does not arise when one takes the averaging
perspective. Heuristically, one may understand model selection exercises as choosing a
model based on its relative goodness of fit (adjusted for model complexity). In the
context of our approach, model selection of this type is equivalent to placing a posterior
probability of 1 on the model with the highest posterior probability. Thought of this way,
it is easy to see why model selection can lead to very misleading assessments of policy

3
 Bernardo and Smith (1994) discuss the interpretation of model spaces under alternative
assumptions as to whether the true model is in the space.
                                            9
efficacy. For example, model uncertainty calculations avoid situations where one model
may far outstrip others by a selection criterion, yet the posterior model probability is
small relative to the space as a whole.
        Third, any analysis of model uncertainty will be dependent on a researcher’s prior
beliefs about the relative plausibility of different models, as quantified through the prior
probabilities µ ( m ) .   Very little work has been done on the question of appropriately

formulating priors over model spaces. Most papers assign a uniform prior across the
model space.      One alternative, suggested by Doppelhofer, Miller, and Sala-i-Martin
(2000) penalizes complex models by assigning relatively lower prior weights to them.
Brock, Durlauf, and West (2003) discuss ways to use economic information to structure
priors that reflect theoretical, specification, and parameter heterogeneity differences
between models. However, this is a question that needs much more research.
        Calculations of this type make clear how model uncertainty affects policy
evaluation. Suppose that a policy maker evaluates policies according to a risk function4
R (θ ) and that the policymaker evaluates a policy rule based on the expected loss it

generates. Standard policy analyses calculate


                          E ( R (θ ) p, m, d ) = ∫ R (θ ) µ (θ p, m, d )dθ               (7)
                                                Θ



whereas an analysis that allows for model uncertainty should calculate


                             E ( R (θ ) p, d ) = ∫ R (θ ) µ (θ p, d )dθ                  (8)
                                                Θ



In contexts such as stabilization policy, one usually is interested in the first two moments
of µ (θ p, d ) . These moments were originally computed by Leamer (1978) and are

discussed in great detail in Draper (1995):

ii. model uncertainty and ambiguity aversion


       Our discussion has so far treated model uncertainty in a way that is equivalent to
innovation uncertainty (i.e. lack of knowledge of η ) and parameter uncertainty. There
are reasons to believe that one may not want to assume this equivalence. One of these
reasons derives from the body of experimental work that is associated with the Ellsberg
paradox. Consider two scenarios: in scenario A, a bet may placed on the color of a ball
drawn from an urn when the distribution of colors is known to be 50/50 between black
and red whereas in scenario B a bet may be placed on the color of a ball drawn from an
urn where the distribution between black and red is not known, but where the subject can
choose the color. The Ellsberg paradox refers to the observation that in various
experiments, subjects place a higher value on the former bet; the paradox occurs since by
symmetry, the fact that one can choose which color ball to bet on makes it impossible to
differentiate the second bet from the first bet in an expected value sense.                        Such
observations have led to a recent literature on ambiguity aversion, exemplified by Gilboa
and Schmeidler (1989) and Epstein and Wang (1994). Following Epstein and Wang
(1994), ambiguity aversion can be introduced by considering the modified expected loss
function



                                                (
                 (1 − e) ∫ l (θ ) µ (θ d )dθ + e sup m∈M
                        Θ                                  ∫Θ l (θ ) µ (θ m, d )dθ )               (11)

                                                11
This loss function places an additional weight on the least favorable model in the model
space beyond that which is done in a standard expected loss calculation.5 This function
nests the expected loss approach ( e = 0 ) and the minimax approach ( e = 1 ) that is
employed in the macroeconomics robustness literature, cf. Hansen and Sargent
(2001a,b,2002,2003).


iii. model uncertainty and stabilization policy


          We now specialize these formulas for the analysis of stabilization policies. To do
this, we consider the scalar case where the policymaker is interested in stabilizing output
relative to trend, yt . We assume that a policymaker evaluates rules according to their

limiting effect y∞ , specifically the policymaker’s loss function is


                                             var ( y∞ p, d )                           (12)


This loss function is timeless in the sense of Woodford (2003) and thus avoids problems
of time inconsistency. We assume that the policy cannot affect the long-run mean of the
series, so that


                                      E ( y∞ p, d ) = 0 ∀p                             (13)


This is a substantive economic assumption and one that is frequently built into
macroeconomics models, for example to reflect a long run Phillips curve. Under this
assumption


                         var ( y∞ p, d ) =   ∑ µ ( m d ) var ( y
                                                               ∞   p, m, d )           (14)
                                             m∈M




5
    A remarkable early formulation of this type appears in Hurwicz (1951).
                                              12
Relative to (10), the second term on the right hand side (RHS) disappears when (13)
holds.
         In the context of analyzing stabilization policies, one can further observe that the
overall variance associated with a given policy, Var ( y∞ p, d ) , may be contrasted with

two other calculations which are suggested by our discussion:


Var ( y∞ p, m, β m ) = overall within-model variance due to unobserved innovations; this

level of variance is irreducible in the sense that it is present even if a model and
associated parameters are known


Var ( y∞ p, m, d ) = overall within-model variance due to parameter uncertainty given a

model


As one moves from uncertainty due to innovations and parameters to uncertainty that also
reflects lack of knowledge of the true model, one moves from conventional model
exercises to the approach we advocate. Put differently, if one engages in model selection,
one typically computes Var ( y∞ p, m, β m ) or Var ( y∞ p, m, d ) whereas we would argue

the correct object for study in policy analysis is Var ( y∞ p, d ) .

         Finally, we consider how to evaluate uncertainty about the variance we have
described; we focus specifically on the “variance of the variance” associated with a given
policy. While a mean/variance loss function is not affected by this calculation, other
preferences structures are. To perform these second order variance calculations, notice
that by (13), Var ( y∞ p, d ) = E ( y∞2 p, d )   We can thus use formulas (9) and (10) to

calculate Var ( y∞2 p, d ) . Since E ( y∞2 p, d ) is, unlike E ( y∞ p, d ) , dependent on p , one

has



                                                 13
                                          var ( y∞2 p, d ) =
                                                                                                            (15)
          ∑ µ ( m d ) var ( y   p, m, d ) +   ∑ µ (m d )( E ( y       p, m, d ) − E ( y∞2 p, d )   )
                                                                                                       2
                            2                                     2
                            ∞                                     ∞
          m∈M                                 m∈M




The second term on the RHS of (15) captures the distinct role that model uncertainty
plays in assessing the payoff associated with a policy. The first term represents the
uncertainty contribution given the models. This decomposition into a within-model and
across-model uncertainty corresponds to the analysis in Gustafson and Clarke (2004).
Notice that the only reason why E ( y∞2 p, d , m ) − E ( y∞2 p, d ) is nonzero is variability

across models.
       These calculations lead to a hierarchical view of policy assessment. As we have
claimed     above,    conventional       policy          evaluation    exercises       calculate           either
Var ( y∞ p, m, β m ) or Var ( y∞ p, m, d ) where the model m is chosen by some criterion

that trades goodness of fit against model complexity. Such calculations are of course
important. What we argue is that in addition to such calculations, one should also
compute Var ( y∞ p, d ) , which describes the consequences of the same policy without the

assumption that the model selection exercise has identified the correct model. The
discrepancy between these two measures will provide a metric for the economic
significance of model uncertainty. Notice that there is no necessary ordering between
Var ( y∞ p, d , m, β m ) , Var ( y∞ p, d , m ) and Var ( y∞ p, d ) as model uncertainty may

lower the variance associated with a policy if the policy works better for those parameters
that have not been assumed or for a different model. It is possible for the introduction of
model uncertainty to reverse the relative rankings of models.


iv. implementation issues


a. priors and the reporting of results




                                                    14
       The calculations we have described require the specification of prior probabilities
for the elements of the model space M. The construction of priors continues to be a
knotty problem in Bayesian statistics. One difficulty in the construction of priors derives
from the difficulties inherent in translating vague prior beliefs possessed by a researcher
into probabilities. This difficulty has led to a large literature on Bayesian probability
elicitation, an approach that has not been pursued in the model uncertainty context. Most
studies of model uncertainty and model averaging assume that all elements in M possess
equal prior probabilities, a standard assumption when one wants to employ a
noninformative prior, i.e one that expresses ignorance.6 Other authors have modified the
equal probability assumption either by assuming the model probabilities are themselves
random, which in essence makes the prior a mixture distribution (Brown, Vannucci, and
Fearn (1998)) or by assigning higher prior probabilities to simpler models (Doppelhofer,
Miller, and Sala-i-Martin (2000)). None of these approaches use social science reasoning
to construct priors. Brock, Durlauf, and West (2003) argue that priors should possess a
hierarchical structure that reflects the differences between theory uncertainty and
specification uncertainty conditional on a theory. It is unclear that these different
approaches are of major importance operationally.
       An alternative perspective is that the goal of a policy evaluation analysis is to
communicate to a policymaker the effects of a policy under alternative assumptions
rather than to perform expected loss calculations per se. As we have argued, assumptions
about the theoretical basis and specification of the model of the phenomenon of interest
are of primary importance in this respect. To the extent this is true, and recognizing the
possibility that ambiguity aversion means that a policymaker may react to model
uncertainty differently from parameter uncertainty, for example, then the averaging
approach may not be sufficiently informative. A policymaker may want to know if there
are outlier models in the sense that a policy works particularly poorly when they are
correct. Notice that this is not the same thing as asking whether certain models are
outliers in terms of certain parameter values, overall goodness of fit, etc. For this reason,


6
 There are many conceptual problems in defining what it means for a prior to be
uninformative; these issues are not germane to our discussion.
                                           15
we argue that a significant part of a policy evaluation exercise is the presentation of
different perspectives on how model uncertainty affects one’s conclusions. We are
therefore concerned to identify useful statistics and visual representations of policy
effects as they vary across models.


b. Bayesian versus frequentist


       Our discussion has been explicitly Bayesian in that our analysis has focused on
the construction of probability measures on the unknowns θ given observed data and
prior information, i.e. µ (θ d ) . These calculations, in turn, employed Bayesian within-

model posterior probabilities µ (θ d , m ) .           That being said, the logic of our model

averaging arguments really only depend on the use of posterior model probabilities
µ (m d ) .   If one can identify an interpretable way of constructing these model

probabilities, then one can integrate these with frequentist objects in order to address
model uncertainty without fully committing to Bayesian methods. For example, if one is
interested in constructing an estimate θˆ which is not model-dependent, this can be done
via


                                      θˆ =   ∑ θˆ µ ( m d )
                                             m∈M
                                                   m                                      (16)



Doppelhofer, Miller, and Sala-i-Martin (2000), who perform such calculations in the
context of OLS regression parameters when there is uncertainty about the choice of
controls, call this approach Bayesian averaging of classical estimates (BACE); Brock,
Durlauf, and West (2003) refer the general approach of averaging frequentist objects
using model weights as a pseudo-frequentist procedure. What is important, of course, is
not the terminology, but the idea that incorporation of model uncertainty into a data
exercise can provide interpretable results. This is extremely important since frequentist


                                                   16
methods dominate policy evaluation analysis.         We employ this pseudo-frequentist
approach in the empirical section of this paper.


vi. beyond model averaging: outcome dispersion and action dispersion


       As suggested in the Introduction, in evaluating the role of model uncertainty in
policy assessment, we believe it is useful to think about two concepts: outcome
dispersion and action dispersion. Outcome dispersion captures the variation in loss that
occurs when one considers different models. When working with a fixed policy, the
variation of losses under the policy traces out the range of the loss function, where the
latter is interpreted as a function of the policy. Averaging calculations can thus be treated
as data reductions of the support of the loss function; a data reduction in which a
(posterior probability) weighted sum of the range is computed.
       When a policy is allowed to depend on a model, one can define an analogous
notion of action dispersion. Each model induces a distinct policy, so the model space
traces out a range of policies. For example, one can compute how the parameters of a
simple monetary policy rule, say one that maps last period’s Federal Funds rate, the
current inflation level and the current output level into this period’s Federal Funds rate,
varies across models. Why might such information be of use to a policymaker? One
reason is that calculations of action dispersion can reveal how sensitive a policy rule is to
model choice. To the extent that a policymaker decides to condition policies on a model,
action dispersion can reveal the extent to which this matters. In turn, one can argue that a
desideratum of a policy rule is that its formulation is relatively insensitive to certain
details of the economic environment in which it is applied. Giannoni and Woodford
(2002) make this idea precise in a theoretical context; our calculations of action
dispersion provide an empirical representation to their ideas.




III. Model uncertainty and assessment of simple monetary policy rules



                                             17
          In this section, we provide an illustration of the methodological discussion using a
simple empirical example; the example extends work in Brock, Durlauf, and West
(2003).


i. framework


          We suppose that a monetary policymaker is contemplating the choice of
parameters in a simple monetary policy rule. This class of rule is studied in many papers,
a thorough example is Levin, Wieland and Williams (1998). Denoting the output gap as
yt , inflation as π t and the nominal interest rate on 1-period government bonds as it , we
assume that the policymaker employs a nominal interest rate rule


                                          it = gπ π t + g y yt + gi it −1                                    (17)


Following standard assumptions and terminology in the monetary rules literature, losses
are calculated via a risk function R, defined as


                              R = var (π ∞ ) + λ y var ( y∞ ) + λi var ( ∆i∞ )                               (18)


In our risk calculations, we will always assume λ y = 1.0 and λi = 0.1 .                           This choice of

weights is arbitrary but is in the range assumed by earlier literature using similar loss
functions, e.g. Levin and Williams (2003).
          Our alternative models represent examples of the New Keynesian model
exposited in Woodford (2003). The particular representations we employ are taken from
Rudebusch and Svensson (1999) and Rudebusch (2002). These models may be
understood as two equation systems. The first component of the system is an IS curve
that relates output to real interest rates and an unobservable disturbance uIS ,t :


                                                                      ⎡ 4             ⎤
                      yt = α y1 yt −1 + α r ( it −1 − Et −1π t +3 ) + ⎢ ∑ α yj yt − j ⎥ + uIS ,t             (19)
                                                                      ⎣ j =2          ⎦
                                                         18

where it =     ∑
             4 j =0
                    it − j , π t = ∑ π t − j and uIS ,t is an unobservable disturbance. The second
                                  4 j =0
component is a Phillips curve that relates inflation to expected inflation, lagged inflation,
lagged output and an unobservable disturbance uPC ,t . The weights on inflation are

constrained to sum to unity in order to ensure that the curve is vertical in the long run.


                                                                     ⎡               4            4           ⎤

                                                                     ⎣              j =2         j =2         ⎦             (20)
                                                                             4
                                         subject to β 0 + (1 − β 0 ) ∑ βπ j = 1
                                                                             j =1




In eq. (20) and throughout, we suppress inessential constants for expositional simplicity;
these were included in all our empirical work.
       Model uncertainty exists at two levels in our framework.                                         The first level
corresponds to our notion of theory uncertainty as it relates to the way in which
expectations are formed by agents. First, backwards looking and hybrid models are
differentiated by treatment of Et −1π t +3 . For backwards looking models,


                                  Et −1π t +3 = .25 (π t −1 + π t − 2 + π t −3 + π t − 4 )                           (21)


whereas for hybrid models.


                           Et −1π t +3 = survey data on 1-year ahead inflation                                       (22)


The backwards looking modeling follows Rudebusch and Svensson (1999) whereas the
hybrid modeling follows Rudebusch (2002). As well, the backwards model sets the
coefficient on expected inflation in the Phillips curve to 0 (i.e. β 0 = 0 ). We refer to the
backwards and hybrid cases as our two classes of models.


                                                           19
       Second, there is specification uncertainty that exists once one has conditioned a
given theory. This uncertainty is modeled with respect to the terms in brackets in
equations (19) and (20).     Different lag structures correspond to alternative ways of
capturing output and inflation dynamics; these dynamics are not constrained by economic
theory but rather are included in order to capture serial correlation in the model errors. In
each class of models, we estimate 4 different IS curves, with one, two, three and four lags
of output on the RHS. We estimate 16 different Phillips curves, with one to four lags of
output and one to four lags of inflation in the RHS. Thus within each class of models
there are 64 = 4 × 16 specifications; each specification corresponds to a specific set of lag
structures for the IS/PC system.
       Under the assumption that policy is deterministic, we use estimated values for the
parameters of the IS and Phillips curves to solve the model and compute values of the
loss function under alternative policy parameters. Our analysis assumes that the IS and
Phillips curves are structurally stable over the 1970-2002 sample. We are aware of
evidence to the contrary, but leave this complication to future work. We also do not
allow for one class of models to represent a better approximation of the underlying data
generating process in some periods but not others.7 Our simplifications are made to
facilitate the exposition of how one might incorporate model uncertainty in evaluating the
losses associated with alternative policies.    For each model and a given set of policy
preference parameters λ y and λπ , we use a grid search procedure to solve for the values

of gπ , g y , and gi that minimize the loss function (18).

       We calculate losses as follows. For a given model m, let Rˆ m denote model risk,

when uncertainty associated with estimated parameters is ignored. Let Lˆm denote the
BIC-adjusted likelihood for the model. For a given set of models, the expected risk
R̂ associated with model uncertainty is

           We assume that all models within a model class have equal prior probability.
While we would prefer to assign priors in ways that are suggested by economic
reasoning, we have yet to develop a natural way to do so in this context. We also see no
reason why more complicated models warrant smaller (or larger) priors than simpler
ones. Our uniform prior assumption implies that µ ( m d ) is proportional to Lˆm so that

           We consider a number of ways to communicate the importance of model
uncertainty in policy choice. In addition to various averaging calculations, we quantify
our notions of outcome and action dispersion. Dispersion is measured in several ways,
including support width (absolute value of the difference between the maximum and
minimum values of the object of interest as it varies across models), standard deviation
and interquartile range of risk across models.                    In reporting outcome dispersion, we
acknowledge that one would like to consider outcome dispersion with respect to a range
of policy preference structures but do not do so here. Finally, note that action dispersion
                                           gπ               g
is measured by dispersion in g% π =             and g% y = y and gi .                 We employ the
                                         1 − gi           1 − gi

normalizations g% π and g% y in order to evaluate variation in the long-run effects of income

and inflation on interest rates respectively.
           As part of our goal is to report visual descriptions of the properties of the model
space, we will associate each model with a number. This relationship is described in
Appendix 1.


ii. data

                                                    21
        All estimation is done using quarterly data from 1970:2 to 2002:4, with data from
1969:2 to 1970:1 used to provide lags. Apart from survey data, this is the same data
studied in Brock, Durlauf, and West (2003). Inflation π t is measured as the annualized

change in the GDP deflator. The output gap yt is computed as the difference between
real GDP and the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of potential GDP. The interest
rate it is the quarterly average Federal Funds rate.                  We constructed the survey

expectations measure of Et −1π t +3 from the median price expectations of the Survey of

Professional Forecasters. Let Pt et denote the period t survey expectation of the GDP

deflator (GNP deflator prior to 1992) in the current quarter and Pt e+ 4 t denote the

expectation     of   the    deflator       four   quarters   (one    year)    from    t.      We     set

                     (                 )
Et −1π t +3 = 100 × log Pt +e 3 t −1 / Pt −e 1 t −1 . For two quarters (1970:3 and 1974:3), Pt e+ 4 t was

missing; we substituted an extrapolation of the three-quarter-ahead expectation Pt e+3 t .


iii. basic properties of the model space


        We first consider some properties of the model space. Table 1 presents regression
results for the backward and hybrid specifications with the highest posterior probability.
These are the models that would be selected if one were using the BIC criterion to choose
one model within each class. The results are consistent with those for the backward
specification of Rudebusch and Svensson (1999) and the hybrid specification of
Rudebusch (2002). In the IS curve, the BIC-adjusted likelihood chooses three lags of
output in the backwards specification, two lags in the hybrid specification. The sum of
regression coefficients and the interest rate elasticity are similar in both specifications. In
the Phillips curve, both specifications choose one lag of output.                      The backward
specification uses three lags of inflation, while the hybrid combines the survey
expectation with a single lag. (Recall that by construction, the sum of the lags (and lead,


                                                    22
for the hybrid specification) on inflation is 1.) The hybrid specification puts substantial
weight on the survey expectation, with βˆ0 = 0.32 .
          The maximum posterior probability hybrid model involves two fewer parameters
than does this backwards model. For this reason, as well as some other quantitatively
less important ones, the BIC-adjusted bivariate likelihood for the hybrid model is two
orders of magnitude higher than that of the backward looking model (not reported in the
table).    We do not interpret the relative BIC-adjusted likelihoods as arguing for great
posterior weight on hybrid versus backwards models. We came to this specification only
after experimenting with various model consistent measures of expectations (not
reported), and by choosing the very best fitting specification in Rudebusch (2002). For
example, we do not include terms on forward looking output in the IS equation, because
Rudebusch (2002) found these to not be significant. We return to this point below when
we combine backward and hybrid models.
          How do model probabilities differ across the model space? Table 2 presents
summary statistics on the distribution of the posterior model probabilities across the 64
models in each of the two classes. To do this, we focus on the relative likelihoods of each
model m within a class, defined as


                                                Lˆm
                                        Pm =                                                   (25)
                                               ∑ Lˆ
                                               m∈C
                                                        m




where the sum in the denominator runs over the 64 models in a given class (backward or
hybrid). By construction, 0 < Pm < 1 and   ∑P
                                           m∈C
                                                    m   = 1 . In each class, the relative likelihood

is clustered around a handful of models. Row (6) in Table 2 indicates that only 8
(backward) or 13 (hybrid) models have likelihood as much as 1/20 of the likelihood of
the model with the highest posterior. We will designate this group of models as
possessing “high” likelihoods or “high” posteriors in our subsequent discussion. The
factor of 1/20 is made to facilitate highlighting those models most consistent with the
data and follows ideas that have appeared elsewhere in the model averaging literature,
                                               23
e.g. Gustafson and Clarke (2004); minor changes in the definition of what is meant by a
posterior probability would not change any qualitative features of our discussion. Row 8
of Table 2 indicates that in each class of models the 16 models with highest posterior
probability dominate the relative likelihood.


iv. the original Taylor rule revisited


          Our first analysis using the model space considers the effects of model uncertainty
on evaluation of the risk associated with the original Taylor (1993) rule8:


                                       it = 1.5π t + 0.5 yt                             (26)


This rule may be evaluated with respect to outcome and action dispersion. Relative to our
earlier discussion, action dispersion is by definition 0 since the rule is constant across
specifications. Outcome dispersion is described in Table 3, which characterizes the way
in which the risk associated with the original Taylor rule varies across the model space.
Overall, for the class of backwards looking models, the risk values appear to be relatively
stable. When one concentrates on relatively likely backwards models, the risk estimates
are all in the range of 19.1 to 23.2; the same exercise for hybrid models yields the
somewhat broader range of approximately 15.2 to 31.9. There do exist outlier models
with very different risk values: the support for Taylor rule risk for the backwards models
is appropriately 17.5 to 51.6 and the support for the hybrid models is 12.5 to 44.7. Row 8
of the Table provides the model averaging calculations, in which the model specific risk
of the Taylor rule is averaged using posterior model probabilities according to (24). It is
interesting to compare our model averaged risk estimates, 22.0 for the backwards class
and 23.6 for the hybrid class, with the respective risks that occur for the maximum
posterior probability models in each class, 23.2 and 24.1 respectively. The averaged
numbers are lower, indicating that the Taylor rule works better for at least some models
that would be ignored if one simply focused on the maximum posterior models.

8
    We report the demeaned version of the rule but used constants in the empirical work.
                                              24
       This exercise suggests that the Taylor rule generally has good outcome robustness
properties.


v. comparing simple rules


       As a second exercise, we consider the relative performance of the original Taylor
rule against an optimized three-variable rule of the form (17). To do this, we calculate
values of gπ , g y and gi which minimize the risk function (18) using the weights

described below the equation for the backward model with the highest posterior
probability and hybrid model with the highest posterior probability. As described in the
next section, we found these parameters by a grid search. The results of the grid search
are:


        backwards: g% π = 3.2, g% y = 2.1, gi = 0.2; hybrid: g% π = 3.2, g% y = 4.7, gi = 0.55 (27)


Both policies are more aggressive than the original (1993) Taylor rule.
       Our objective is to compare the performance of these rules with the Taylor rule.
The optimized rules will of course outperform the Taylor rule when the posterior model
with the highest probability in a model space is the true one; what we wish to ascertain is
how this comparison is affected when one accounts for the presence of model
uncertainty. In order to do these comparisons, we perform two sets of exercises. First, we
compare the Taylor rule to the model-specific three-variable rule where the rule is
computed for the same class on which the comparison is done. These comparisons mean
that the policymaker is confident that his given choice of model class is the correct one,
and is concerned only with misspecification within that class. Second, we do the same
comparisons when the policymaker has chosen the wrong class. This means we compare
the Taylor and three-variable rule optimized for the higher posterior backwards model on
the class of hybrid models and vice versa. This exercise will be of interest to a
policymaker who has tentatively chosen a model class but wishes to understand the costs
if the other class in fact better captures salient features of the economy.
                                               25
       Figure 1 presents a graph of the relative risks of the optimized 3-variable and
Taylor rules across the model space for both our exercises. Models are reported using the
numbering described in Appendix 1. All relative risks are the ratios of the risk using the
optimized rule to the risk using the Taylor (1993) rule, eq. (26). We depict those cases
where the hybrid rule produced instability, which happened to occur for some backwards
but no hybrid models, with a solid line truncated at 1.8; this is done for readability.
       Figure 1 yields several interesting findings. We first focus on the two graphs in
the first row, in which the policymaker is confident a given class of models is the correct
one.   As the Figure indicates, for the hybrid models, the optimized rule uniformly
dominates the Taylor rule across the model space. Second, for the backwards models, the
relative risk of the optimized 3-variable rule is either 40% smaller than the Taylor rule or
greater than 1. An examination of the specific models for which the Taylor rule
outperforms the optimized rule explains why this is happening. For this subset of models,
the optimized rule produces instability in at least one of the state variables, thereby
producing infinite risk. The possibility that a rule that is optimal for one model produces
instability in another is, as a theoretical matter, not surprising, and has been recognized
by other authors, cf. Levin and Williams (2003, pg. 953). How serious a problem is this?
The posterior probability for the set of models for which the optimized rule produces
instability is .003.9   Hence, the probability of instability appears to be quite small.
Because of the loss function that is assumed, if any of these models receives a positive
weight in the expected loss calculation, the case that the Taylor rule will be preferred.
This is an example where we believe the visual presentation of evidence is of particular
value to a policymaker since the assessment of large (in this case, infinite) risk with small
probabilities is something that may be poorly captured by simply reporting model
averaged risk numbers.
       When the policymaker has chosen the wrong theory, one again finds that for the
hybrid case, the model-specific optimized rule strictly dominates the Taylor rule. This is
interesting as it indicates that the failure to condition on lagged interest rates is a serious




                                              26
deficiency of the Taylor for the hybrid case. For backwards models, one once again finds
that there are 4 models for which the optimal rule induces instability, these are of course
different from those found when the optimized rule is conditioned on the correct theory;
the total posterior probability of these rules is .002.10 In addition, one finds that there are
some models for which the Taylor rule outperforms the optimized rule even though the
latter produces stability. There are 8 models of this type with posterior probability .08.11
Interestingly, the models are generally those with longer lag lengths.
          We next consider model averaging exercises that can reduce the information
contained in Figure 1 down to a set of simple statistics. Table 4 reports risk ratios for
model averaged risks. As noted above, the optimized rule produced instability for some
backwards models, which would imply a value of infinity for the risk under the rule and
would mean under an averaging calculation that the model averaged risk ratio and ratios
of model averaged risk are both infinite. In order to produce nontrivial averaging
calculations, for any model with infinite risk under the optimized rule we use risk values
that produce a model-specific risk ratio of 5 and 20. Some authors do propose assigning
a finite risk to unstable models (e.g. Del Negro and Schorfeide (2004) who suggest the
risk ratio 5 as a benchmark) while others assign infinite risk, (e.g. Levin and Williams
(2003)). We also report (in column 5) the replacement values that will produce overall
risk comparisons that render one indifferent between the Taylor and optimized rules; we
remind the reader that this is only relevant for backwards models since the hybrid models
are never unstable.
          Our model averaging exercises uniformly provide support for the optimized rule
over the Taylor rule. Interestingly, the optimized rule outperforms the Taylor rule even
when the policymaker has erred in terms of choice of model class. This illustrates the
value of allowing an interest rate rule to depend on lagged interest rates. We would also


9
    Letting ( i, j , k ) denote the model specification with i income lags in the IS equation, j
income and k inflation lags in the Phillips curve equation, the models in which instability
occurs are (1,1,1), (2,1,1), (3,1,1) and (4,1,1).
10
   The models which are unstable in this exercise are (1,2,4), (2,1,1), (3,4,4), and (4,1,1).
11
   The models where the Taylor rule outperforms the model-specific optimized rule are
(4,1,3), (4,1,4), (4,2,3), (4,2,4), (4,3,3), (4,3,4), (4,4,3) and (4,4,4).
                                                 27
note that one needs to assign model-specific risk ratios of about 65 for unstable models in
order to conclude that the Taylor rule performed as well as the optimized rule.
       Table 5 reports some summary statistics for our two exercises when the Taylor
rule/optimized rule comparisons are restricted to models in which neither rule produces
instability. Similar results hold for the cases for rules optimized on the highest posterior
model in the correct class of models and rules optimized on the wrong class. One
important feature of the Table is its demonstration that the relative risk between the two
rules is extremely stable across the model specifications. As might have been expected
given the findings in Table 4, this applies whether or not the rule is compared to the class
whose maximum probability model was the basis of the rule. This implies, given our
analysis of outcome dispersion for the Taylor rule, that the theory and model-specific
optimized rule, modulo models where instability is induced, also has good properties in
terms of producing stable (across models) outcome dispersion. In addition, it appears that
assuming the backwards theory is true when it is not has low costs to a policymaker, at
least in terms of comparisons to the Taylor rule.
       These findings lead to the conclusion that virtues of the Taylor rule relative to an
optimized rule derive from its ability to avoid producing model instability and otherwise
that the optimized rules are uniformly better.


vi. outcome dispersion and action dispersion for optimal 3-variable rules


       In our third exercise, we explore the sensitivity of optimal 3-variable rules to
model choice. The idea in this work is to understand how the specification and associated
risk of an optimal rule varies about specifications. Unlike the previous exercises, we do
not specify a single rule and look at its behavior across models; each model is associated
with its specific optimal rule. Table 6 presents information on the distribution of policy
parameters and risk across models. The parameters were found with a grid search, with
step size of 0.1, except for gi for hybrid models in which a secondary grid search with
steps of 0.02 was used because initially there was almost no variation across models to
the first decimal place. Note that each column presents statistics across all 64 models.

                                            28
To interpret the table, consider, for example, in the class of backward looking models, the
minimum values presented in line (3). The minimum value of g% π of 2.9 need not have

been found in the same specification that yielded the minimum value of g% y of 1.5, and

neither of these specifications need have yielded the minimum value of risk R of 8.8.
       We first consider the median values presented in line (5) of panel A. Consistent
with previous literature such as Levin and Williams (2003), the hybrid model, which was
solved treating expectations as model-consistent and thus forward looking, yields a
lagged interest rate weight gi that is higher than that for the backward model. In other
respects the parameters are also congruent with earlier research. For example, in results
not reported in the table we found that increasing λi shifts the distribution (across

models) of the associated optimal gi upwards; increasing λ y also shifts the distribution

of the associated optimal g y upwards.

       We have argued that there is relatively little outcome dispersion within a given
class of models, at least if we focus on models with high posteriors. Table 7 illustrates
that the same conclusion applies when we combine models from the two classes. We
combine using a simple arithmetic average, as in Levin and Williams (2003). We do not
weight by likelihood, as in much of the model averaging literature as well as our previous
work (Brock, Durlauf, and West (2003) because, as noted above, the hybrid model
explicitly was derived after a larger than usual amount of data mining. Panel A in Table
7 asks about outcome dispersion if we simply hold fixed the parameters at the values that
are optimal for the likeliest backwards model (columns (1)-(3) in panel A) or likeliest
hybrid model (columns (4)-(6)). Outcome dispersion is very small in columns (1)-(3);
that is, a policy maker who is committed to using the parameters that are optimal for the
likeliest backwards model is unlikely to be perturbed if he suddenly contemplates the
possibility that hybrid model has a large element of truth as well. Outcome dispersion is,
however, perceptible in columns (4)-(6).
       The asymmetrical outcome results from the way we treated the two model classes.
One could instead solve for parameters that are optimal given weights to each model.
Results for this approach are given in panel B. The weight on the backwards model is

                                            29
denoted θ ; results for θ = 0 and θ = 1 repeat results in Table 5.C and are given for
reference. As one would expect, the policy parameters move smoothly as θ is varied.
Unsurprisingly, action dispersion is small for g% π and moderate for g% y and gi .

       These tables may be complemented visually by graphs of the distributions of
outcomes and actions across models. This is done in the set of pictures contained in
Figure 2. As occurs in the reporting of objects such as impulse response functions from
vector autoregressions, the visual reporting of outcome and action dispersion can suffer
from a surfeit of information. We now turn to some suggestions on how these figures can
be used by policymakers to inform decisions.
       We first discuss action variance. Figure 2.A reports the different values of g% π , g% y

and gi that appear across the model-specific optimal rules in the backwards class. The
panels depict visually the information on dispersion summarized in Table 6: there is a
reasonable degree of dispersion across models with respect to g% π (in the sense of a

support width of 1.0)12, large dispersion with respect to g% y (support width of 1.8) and

moderate dispersion for gi (support width of .4). This implicitly means that the width of

the support of the nonnormalized parameter gπ is about half that of the nonnormalized

parameter g y . Hence, policymakers can conclude that gπ is relatively insensitive to

model specification. Within this variation, gi is almost always greater than 0. This helps
explain why the Taylor rule was generally inferior to three variable rules even when the
latter was optimized on the wrong model. When one turns to the posterior weighted
results, Figure 2.B, the main modification of these conclusions is that in some cases the
supports of the parameters shrink when one focuses on those models whose posterior
likelihoods are within 1/20 of the maximum posterior model. When one concentrates on
these relatively likely models, one finds much smaller variation in g% π and g% y (measured

by support width) than appears in Panel A.           Interestingly, there is relatively less


12
 We focus on support width in our discussion of dispersion, information on standard
deviations and interquartile ranges are available in Table 6 and yield qualitatively similar
conclusions.
                                             30
diminution of the support width of gi for the relatively likely models. However, for the

relatively likely models, gi is always at least .1.
        Similar results obtain for the hybrid model. Figure 2.C indicates that for this class,
there is a larger support for the g% π and g% y parameters than in the backwards case (with

support widths of 1.0 and 2.2 respectively). Compared with the backwards case, the
variation in gi is quite small, with a support width .1. When one turns to the posterior
weighted results in Figure 2.D, one finds little reduction in support width when attention
is restricted to the relatively likely models.
        What conclusions might a policymaker draw? One conclusion is that conditioning
on lagged interest rates is a robust feature of optimal policies. A second conclusion is that
if one conditions policy on the hybrid class, the interest rate parameter in a three-variable
interest rule of the form (17) is insensitive to lag length specification whereas in other
contexts, the optimal rule parameters can vary substantially across specifications.
        We next consider the dispersion of risk for the backwards models and the hybrids
and compare. An examination of dispersion in risk across all the models for backwards
and we see clustering at around 10, 15, and 25 whereas for hybrids risk is essentially
clumped around 6 or 7 (lower right panels of Figures 2.A and 2.C). A policymaker who
believed strongly in a backward looking world will want to proceed cautiously and look
closely at what is generating this dispersion in risk.        Perhaps most of the models
generating the wide dispersion have low posterior probability. If one then examines the
posterior weighted dispersion plot in the lower right hand panel of Figure 2,B it is evident
that the risk clumping around 15 and 25 is generated by models with very low posterior
probability.   The policymaker may now be quite relieved and simply concentrate on
managing the cluster of models whose risk clumps around 10.           Further information is
provided by focusing on relatively likely models.           This restriction would lead a
policymaker to concentrate attention on managing in a world dominated by the four
models that clearly stand out on the plot as having the bulk of the posterior probability.
        For the hybrid class, risk dispersion is very narrow in comparison to the
backwards looking models. Whatever dispersion is observed is reduced further when
computed with posterior weights and clumps around about 7.4 when one focuses on the
                                        31
relatively likely models. This indicates substantial robustness for the optimal rules for
hybrids.
          This type of discussion, in which one compares the plots of unweighted and
posterior weighted results, with further attention to the relatively likely models, enables a
policymaker to get a good overview of the risk dispersion it must face and whether it is
caused by models that are supported by the data in the sense that their posterior weights
are relatively high. As such, this discussion suggests potential ways of dealing with
critiques of the minimax criterion as being too fragile in the sense that it is influenced far
too much by models that have extremely small probabilities either in a posterior sense or
in some judgmental sense.          The performance of the minimax criterion might be
improved by applying it to a data determined “trimmed” subset of the possible models,
e.g. the subset consisting of the 1/20 of the likeliest that we have employed. This same
argument might be applied with profit to any criterion that can be unduly influenced by
models with small “believability” whether believability is measured by posterior
probability or some other method.


vii. patterns13


          We finally note that there exists an interesting pattern that relates model
complexity (in our context, length of lags) and the policy parameters. As indicated in
Figure 3, while there is weak association between the total complexity of a model and the
associated parameters, relatively strong patterns emerge when one considers IS curve
complexity (the number of lags in eq. (18)) and with Phillips curve complexity (the
number of lags in (19)). For backward looking models, the magnitude of gi decreases in

IS complexity but increases in PC complexity. The magnitude of g y is decreasing with

respect to both IS and PC complexity.
          Different patterns emerge for the hybrid models. For this model class, one finds
that gi increases in IS complexity. The g y parameter is increasing in both IS and PC


13
     Giacomo Rondina has greatly helped us in identifying these patterns.
                                             32
complexity. These patterns are the opposite of what holds for the backwards-looking
model.
         These systematic pattern relationships for backwards-looking and hybrid models
suggest some interesting avenues for future research. One question is whether these
patterns are sensitive to the choices of λi and λ y . A second broader question concerns

the existence of patterns for more complex versions of the policy rule, such as rules
which allow for policy lags beyond a single period. Brock and Durlauf (2004b) shows
how, when control is costless, as the number of lags in the policy rule is allowed to
become arbitrarily long, the variation in the state variables of a system is reduced to the
variation of the i.i.d. drivers of the system. We conjecture that this also holds when the
cost of control is small, i.e. λi is much smaller than λ y in the current context. Hence a

system in which the number of control parameters is highly restricted will not be able to
achieve the Brock and Durlauf (2004b) reduction to fundamental i.i.d. shocks. The more
complex the state equation, the greater the implicit restrictions on a simple rule such as
(17) and hence the greater the “strain” on the rule to achieve this limit. We conjecture
that there is something analogous to a Le Chatelier principle that produces a relationship
between the Taylor parameters as the complexity of the state equation increases.




IV. Interpretation


         In this section we consider some interpretations of our results in the context of an
abstract dynamic system. We consider the backwards-looking class of models. This
system is one dimensional, unlike the system we have studied empirically; we employ a
one dimensional system as closed forms solutions are straightforward to develop for this
case whereas for higher dimensional cases they are far more complicated and lead to a
loss of intuition. Let xt denote the state of the system and ut denote the scalar control
available to the policymaker. The state evolves according to


                                 xt = a ( L ) xt −1 + b ( L ) ut −1 + ξt                (28)

                                                  33
where the Wold representation of ξt is denoted


                                           ξt = w ( L )ν t                               (29)


We assume that w ( L ) is invertible. A policymaker has access to linear feedback rules of

the form


                                         ut −1 = − g ( L ) xt −1                         (30)


and chooses a feedback rule in order to minimize


                                            Ex 2 + λ Eu 2                                (31)



We now consider a special case of this model: λ = 0 , and w ( L ) = 1 . For this class of

models, the optimal choice14 of g ( L ) = g * ( L ) will fulfill


                                                a ( L)
                                    g* ( L) =          = 1+ d ( L)                       (32)
                                                b ( L)



Eq. (32) is useful because it illustrates the basic Taylor principle for stabilization policy.
To see this, consider the special case a ( L ) = a ∈ ( 0,1) and b ( L ) = b , so that

                      a −b
g* ( L) = 1+ d = 1+        . Relative to the model in Section III, one can equate xt with
                        b
inflation and ut with the nominal interest rate. The Taylor principle is gπ > g y , so that

inflation innovations get greater weight than output innovations. By analogy, we have


14
  This finding is standard; we refer the reader to Brock and Durlauf (2004b) for a
rigorous development of necessity and sufficiency arguments for models of this type.
                                           34
the same tendency to react relatively strongly to inflation. For our special case, the
magnitude of the feedback from last period’s inflation to today’s nominal interest rate is
a −b      a −b
     . If      > 0 the feedback is more than one to one. This seems an empirically
  b         b
plausible case given the high persistence in the inflation series. One could also argue that
Friedman’s classic (1948) concern about long and variable lags is interpretable as
suggesting that the feedback polynomial b ( L ) is not that persistent.

        This model may be used to illustrate the concepts of outcome dispersion and
action dispersion we have described in Section III.vi. In doing this, we will ignore
parameter uncertainty.     We first consider the case where the optimal policy is not
constrained in terms of numbers of lags. Let the model space M be defined as


                                    M = {a ( L, m ) , b ( L, m )}                          (33)


Where a ( L, m ) and b ( L, m ) denote model-specific lag polynomials. In our analysis, we

considered a set of 64 different models for the model space (33).              Each model is
associated with a distinct fundamental driver ν m ,t with variance σ v2m .

        If w ( L ) = 1 , outcome dispersion is generated by cross-section variation in σ v2m ,

recalling our assumption that the lag length for the policy rule is not constrained. The
model-specific optimal rule eliminates all dependence in the state. Action dispersion in
this case refers to the variance of g *j , the coefficient associated with Lj in g * ( L ) . For

model m, which is a joint specification of a ( L, m ) and b ( L, m ) , there will is an

associated g * ( L ) , hence g *j may vary across models even if the outcome dispersion

does not. The variance of g *j can be written as



                                                   (
                                 var ( g *j ) = var 1 + d ( L, m ) j   )                   (34)



                                                 35
In this expression ( r ( L ) ) j = rj .

         These calculations assume that a policymaker may choose any lag length for the
feedback rule. One may ask similar questions about outcome and action dispersion when
policymakers are required to choose rules with restrictions on lag length; in fact many of
the “simple” rules that have been considered in recent monetary research, of which the
Taylor rule is a leading example, in fact do this.         From the perspective of model
uncertainty in lag structure, these simple rules run the risk of being unable to counter
longer-run feedbacks.
         To understand the costs of overly simple rules, we consider the case w ( L ) = 1 and

b = 1 . Suppose that the true model is one where the lag structure for a ( L ) contains N

lags. If one were to consider a sequence of optimal rules, in which the k’th rule is
constrained to only have k lags, then it is easy to see that the value of Ex 2 obtainable
with a k -lag rule is decreasing (in k) and will, when k = N equal σν2 . This simple logic
is suggestive of the factors that will determine the outcome dispersion for a model space
of the form M = {a ( L, m ) , b} . If the set of possible policy rules allows for lags lengths

up to N, then the minimum outcome dispersion may be obtained for every model in M.
         This basic argument has an important implication for outcome dispersion and
model uncertainty: outcome dispersion will decline to 0 as the number of lags in the
policy rule space increases. Conversely, if one defines a complexity gap as the difference
between the number of lags in the state equation and the number of lags in the policy
rule, one would expect the estimated risk to be increasing in this gap. The dispersion
plots for minimum risk in Figure 2 appear to possess this property. This is so because we
optimized over parameters for the single-lag structure where the total number of lags in
the behavioral equations increases from 3 to 12 as we move across the model space.




V. Conclusions




                                             36
       In this paper, we have attempted to outline some basic principles for incorporating
model uncertainty into the reporting of policy evaluation exercises. We have argued that
the policy analysis should not be done conditional on a specific model but rather should
reflect model uncertainty. This leads to model averaging methods that treat model
specification as an unobservable in a way parallel to any other type of unknown in data
analysis. We have applied these ideas to some monetary policy exercises.            These
exercises suggest that the Taylor rule has good robustness properties. These analyses
also suggest some ways to visualize the role of model uncertainty which may facilitate
communication with policymakers.
       To be clear, our analysis really only scratches the surface of the many questions
that arise when model uncertainty is incorporated into policy exercises. One important
question is how to operationalize our approach to richer model spaces, such as spaces
which incorporate various types of learning and nonlinearity. Another question concerns
the appropriate specification of prior probabilities on model spaces for macroeconomic
contexts such as monetary policy evaluation. Perhaps most important, our analysis
describes uncertainty for a fixed model space. Since progress in economic research
should have the effect of expanding the space over time, this expansion should be
incorporated into any decision problem. It might well also be the case that the choice of
rules should reflect the implications of a rule for how information about a model space is
produced. All of these questions suggest that model uncertainty research should prove an
active area of study.

1. Panel A presents estimates of equation (19), panel B estimates of (20). Constant terms
were included in all regressions. The backward and hybrid models differ in their
treatment of expected inflation, as explained in the text.

2. In panel A, the output gap is the dependent variable, αyj is the coefficient on output
gap at lag j, αr the coefficient on the annual real interest rate. In panel B, inflation is the
dependent variable, βy1 is the coefficient on yt-1, βπj the coefficient on inflation at lag j, β0
the coefficient on a survey measure of expected annual inflation.

3. The data are quarterly. The sample of 131 observations is 1970:2-2002:4. Inflation is
the annualized change in the GDP deflator; the output gap is computed from real GDP
and the CBO estimate of potential GDP; the interest rate is the average Federal funds

Notes:

1. This table presents the posterior weighted average ratios of risk R when monetary policy
follows the Taylor (1993) rule to risk when monetary policy follows certain optimized rules.
These optimized rules set the interest rate i as in (17), it = gππt + gyyt + giit-1. The parameters gπ,
gy and gi are chosen to minimize risk R given the estimates of the IS and Phillips curves
presented in Table 1 above. Denote risk from Taylor (1993) rule as R̂ T and risk from an
optimized rule as R̂ O, then the posterior weighted average ratio is:
                                         Σm∈CPm ( R̂ O/ R̂ T )

2. Lines (1) and (2) report the average ratio for the backward models using the optimized rule for
the likeliest backward model (in line (1)) and the optimized rule for the likeliest hybrid model (in
line (2)). Similarly, lines (3) and (4) report the average ratio for the hybrid models using the
optimized rule for the likeliest hybrid model (in line (3)) and the optimized rule for the likeliest
backward model (in line (4)).

3. Column (1) reports average ratios when unstable models are omitted from the calculation.
Column (2) and (3) report average ratio when the risk assigned to unstable models is so that their
ratio to Taylor (1993) is 5.0 (column (2)) and 20.0 (column (3)).

4. Column (4) reports the ratios that have to be assigned to unstable models in order to obtain an
average ratio equal to 1.0, meaning that the Taylor (1993) rule is equivalent to the optimized rule
when considering posterior weighted averages.

Notes:

1. This figure presents the ratio of risk R when monetary policy follows the Taylor (1993) rule to
risk when monetary policy follows certain optimized rules. These optimized rules set the interest
rate i as in (17), it = gππt + gyyt + giit-1. The parameters gπ, gy and gi are chosen to minimize risk
R given the estimates of the IS and Phillips curves presented in Table 1 above.

2. The policy rules are:
  Original Taylor Rule: gπ=1.5, gy=0.5, gi=0
  Optimized 3 Variable Backward: gπ=3.2, gy=2.1, gi=0.2
  Optimized 3 Variable Hybrid: gπ=3.2, gy=4.7, gi=0.55.

3. In panels A the denominator is the risk R obtained applying Taylor (1993) rule to backward
models: in (1) the numerator is the risk obtained using the optimized rule for the likeliest
backward model; in (3) the numerator is the risk obtained using the optimized rule for the
likeliest hybrid model.


                                                                                     42
In the panels B the denominator is the risk R obtained applying Taylor (1993) rule to hybrid
models: in panel (2) the numerator is the risk obtained using the optimized rule for the likeliest
backward model; in (4) the numerator is the risk obtained using the optimized rule for the
likeliest hybrid model. In either case, the ratios are computed using the IS and Phillips curve
estimates of 64 models in each class. See Appendix 1 for a mapping of the model numbers to
details of specification of IS and Phillips curves.

4. A ratio less than one means that the optimized rule delivers less risk than did the original
(1993) Taylor rule. If the optimized rule led to instability, the ratio is truncated at 1.8. The
original Taylor rule did not lead to instability in any models.

Notes:

1. Let R*b =12.9 and R*h =7.6 denote risk that obtains when the model that is likeliest
within a given class of models is used, see Table 6.C. In column (2) of panel A, Rh
denotes the risk that obtains for the likeliest hybrid model (parameter estimates in Table
1) when the policy parameters are held fixed at the values that lead to R*b. By
construction, Rh is at least as large as R*h. In column (4) of panel A, Rb is similarly
computed, using backwards model estimates presented in Table 1 and hybrid policy
parameters presented in Table 6.C.

2. Panel B present parameters that are optimal when the risk function is the indicated
arithmetic average of backwards and hybrid models. Risk for θ=0 and θ=1.0 corresponds
to what is called R*h and R*b in panel A.

Notes: The two top panels and the left bottom panel report the value of the optimal policy parameter for each model (indexed by model’s number, see Appendix
1). The right bottom panel reports the values of the minimum risk for each model corresponding to the optimal parameters found. Risk R is calculated using
preference values: λy = 1.0 and λi = 0.1, where R = var(π∞) + λyvar(y∞) + λivar(∆i∞).

Notes: Panels B report the same results as Panels A concerning the parameter values and the minimum risk. This time they are plotted against the relative BIC
adjusted relative likelihood of each model. The light shaded dots refer to models having a BIC adjusted likelihood at least 1/20 of the model with the highest BIC
adjusted likelihood.

This appendix maps the model numbers used in Figure 1 and 2 into details of
specifications of the IS and Phillips curves. For each model number running from 1 to 64,
three numbers are presented. These are: number of lags of y in IS curve; number of lags
of y in Phillips curve; number of lags of π in Phillips curve. For example, model 25 had 2
lags of y in the IS curve, along with 3 lags of y and 1 lag of π in the Phillips curve.
