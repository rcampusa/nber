This paper develops a growth model characterized by equilibrium unemployment and sustained
monopoly power. The level of demand is a key factor in deviations from the steady-state growth
path with a Keynesian-type spending multiplier despite the absence of any nominal rigidities. The
key friction in the model is the technological requirement that production of certain goods
requires a dedicated team of workers that takes time to train and assemble.

1   Introduction.
Many of us are persuaded that fluctuations in demand are a key driver of business cycles.
Production of automobiles and construction of new homes appear to fall in a recession not
because the items become more difficult to build, but instead because fewer people seem
willing to buy them. Evidence supporting this conclusion comes from Mian and Sufi (2014),
Michaillat and Saez (2015), and Auerbach, Gorodnichenko, and Murphy (2020), among many
others.
   A common understanding of the mechanism whereby a decrease in demand leads to lower
output is based on a failure of prices to adjust sufficiently quickly to the change in demand.
This paper contributes to an alternative literature that maintains that demand shocks can
cause real fluctuations even when prices are perfectly flexible. Examples include Hamilton
(1988), Murphy (2017), Angeletos (2018), Angeletos and Lian (2020), Auerbach, Gorod-
nichenko, and Murphy (2020), and Ilut and Saijo (2021). This paper is most closely related
to the models in Murphy (2017) and Auerbach, Gorodnichenko, and Murphy (2020) who em-
phasize the role of excess capacity and near-zero marginal production costs. In their models,
capacity is exogenous, whereas here, capacity and marginal cost are endogenously determined
in a general equilibrium growth model.
    The basic technological friction in this model that replaces the nominal friction in Key-
nesian models is the requirement that resources must be committed in advance in order to
produce certain goods. In this paper, labor is the only factor of production, and production
of some goods is only possible if a dedicated team of workers is assembled and trained in
advance to make that particular good. Training a new team is costly, but if it is successful,
the unit has a monopoly in producing the good, and chooses quantity and price to maximize
profits subject to a maximum capacity that the team is capable of producing. If demand falls
below capacity, profit-maximization calls for lowering both quantity and price. Prices do not
fall more than this because it would mean lower profits. Since marginal production costs are
zero, there is no market force to bid costs down further. And although the triggering event
was a change in relative demand, there is no offsetting gain from higher relative demand for
other goods. The reason is that the underutilized specialized workers cannot costlessly shift
to producing something else.
    A key state variable in this model is n1t , which is the fraction of the population without
a high-skill, high-paying job. The value of n1t is determined endogenously as individuals
evaluate the costs and benefits of trying to develop a new skill, but it is predetermined at date
t as a result of the training requirement. A sufficiently large drop in demand for good j may
induce team j to disband and try to develop a new skill, increasing n1,t+1 . But n1,t+1 is also a
factor in the demand for all goods, since unskilled workers have lower income on average than
skilled workers. There is thus an effect reminiscent of a Keynesian spending multiplier in this


                                               1
model; lower demand for some goods can have a feedback effect that lowers demand for all
goods.
    The model is consistent with a number of observed features of business cycles. The first is
an asymmetry: a decrease in demand can have a bigger effect on output than an increase of
the same magnitude. Empirical evidence of such asymmetry was provided by Weise (1999) and
Lo and Piger (2005), with Tobin (1972) and Ball and Mankiw (1994) attributing asymmetry
to the mechanics of partial price adjustment. Here the asymmetry arises even with perfectly
flexible prices. When demand falls below capacity, the profit-maximizing response is to lower
both output and price, whereas an increase in demand above capacity leads only to a price
increase. Second, the response of output to a demand shock is often found to be humped-
shaped, with the maximum effect observed many months after the initial shock. Empirical
support and alternative explanations for this finding were provided by Christiano, Eichen-
baum and Evans (2005), Hamilton (2008), and Auclert, Rognlie and Straub (2020). In the
model here, a humped shape can result when a reduction in demand slows the rate of hiring
of new skilled workers. As the number of unskilled increases over time, the demand pressures
get amplified, and output will remain below the steady-state level even after the initial shock
is completely gone. A third striking observation in the data is that the unemployment rate
has been remarkably stable despite a century of economic growth and technological innova-
tions. Martellini and Menzio (2020) noted the challenges in explaining this using standard
search and matching models and proposed an alternative explanation. In this model, a stable
unemployment rate in the face of long-term economic growth is an equilibrium implication of
the fact that the opportunity cost and potential benefits of being unemployed along with the
tax base that finances compensation paid to the unemployed all grow with the overall level of
productivity.
    The paper makes a number of contributions to the literature. It develops a unified model of
growth and fluctuations in which demand and other variables contribute to short-run fluctua-
tions while long-run growth is determined solely by increases in population and productivity.
It shows how monopoly power can be sustained in a growing economy even as new goods are
introduced and some old goods are discontinued every period. It develops a new characteriza-
tion of inequality as arising from successful gambles to create new goods. The costs associated
with trying to create new goods determine steady-state income differentials and unemploy-
ment as well as the speed with which the economy recovers from shocks. The model allows
for considerable heterogeneity, yet both individual and aggregate outcomes can be calculated
using only a handful of equations.

2   Demand for goods.
At time t the population consists of a continuum of individuals of measure Nt who each
consume a discrete set j  Jt of different goods. Goods are nonstorable, and there are no

subject to (1). Quadratic preferences have some advantages and some disadvantages relative
to the more common assumption of isoelastic preferences. As emphasized by Murphy (2017),
quadratic preferences imply that the elasticity of demand changes as we move along the
demand curve, which is important for understanding how decisions of monopolist producers
respond to changing conditions. A disadvantage of quadratic preferences is that q      ¯ijt is a
bliss point, a level of consumption that consumer i would never want to exceed. This would
not be sensible in an economy in which qijt is growing but q    ¯ijt is constant. Our approach
is to model the preference parameters ijt and q   ¯ijt as changing along a steady-state growth
path. We motivate this in terms of a second-order approximation to log preferences at point
   0
{qijt , j  Jt } along a steady-state growth path,

See the top panel of Figure 1.
    The advantage of taking (2) rather than the left side of (3) to be the specification of
preferences is that (2) allows the possibility that producers of j could be driven out of business
if productivity or demand is too low. If the price Pjt becomes too high, a consumer with
preferences (2) will choose qijt = 0, whereas the left side of (3) would imply that consumers
always buy every good in equilibrium, willing to pay Pjt   as qijt - 0. Allowing q             ¯ijt
      -1
and ijt to grow along the steady-state growth path as specified in (4)-(5) allows us to adapt
the quadratic preferences in (2) into a growth economy that shares some of the convenient

implications of a change in the individual price Pjt on it , the elasticity of demand is

    Expenditure shares. If the preference parameters are characterized by expressions (4)-(5)
       0
and qijt  is the quantity of good j that individual i would consume along the steady-state
growth path, then the magnitude jt in (5) turns out to be the expenditure share along the
steady-state growth path, as shown in the following proposition.
    Proposition 1. Suppose that there is a set consisting of Rkt different individuals at date
                                                                       0     0
t (denoted Mkt ) who are all on the same steady-state income path: qijt  = qkjt  for i  Mkt ,
j  Jt . Suppose that in period t the average quantity of good j purchased by members of the
group is equal to this common steady-state value:

                                      iMkt
                                             qijt di      0
                                                       = qkjt         j  Jt .                     (9)
                                          Rkt

Then in period t the group as a whole spends a fraction ajt of its income on good j :

                                          Pjt qijt di = jt                  yit di.              (10)
                                   iMkt                             iMkt

3    Production of specialized goods.
Good j = 1 can be produced by anyone without any training or coordination with others. By
contrast, goods j > 1 are specialized in the sense that their production requires a dedicated
team who work together to produce the good. Once the workers who form a team are as-
sembled, they enjoy a monopoly in producing good j and base their production and pricing
decisions on that monopoly power. Team j consists of a measure of Njt workers and has total
production capacity Xjt Njt where productivity per worker Xjt for the team evolves according
to an exogenous process. At the time that its production and pricing decisions for period
t are made, unit j takes Xjt and Njt as given and chooses Pjt and Qjt to maximize total
profits Pjt Qjt subject to Pjt = Ajt - Bjt Qjt , Pjt  [0, Ajt ], and Qjt  Xjt Njt . The number
of specialized goods is sufficiently large that unit j ignores the effect of its decisions on the
price and output of other units, so that maximizing nominal profits is the same decision as
maximizing real profits. The team's profit-maximizing strategy is to produce up to the point
where marginal revenue equals zero if there is sufficient production capacity and to produce
at production capacity if not:

                          Q                    ¯ jt /2
                           ¯ jt /2 if Xjt Njt  Q           [demand constrained]
                Qjt =                                                            .            (11)
                          Xjt Njt if Xjt Njt < Q¯ jt /2     [supply constrained]

We will describe production of good j as demand constrained in the first instance and supply
constrained in the second.
   New hiring. In period t, unit j takes its total capacity Njt Xjt as given. We assume that
the hiring decision for Nj,t+1 is based on the goal of maximizing expected revenue of the unit.
This is not the same as maximizing expected revenue per current worker. We think of an
observed firm as a collection of a large number of separate producing units, and the objective
of the firm is to maximize total profit subject to the constraint that individuals are available to
do the work at the offered terms. If instead we took the objective to be to maximize expected
income of existing team members, that would add an additional friction to hiring in the model.
           
    Let Nj,t +1 denote the level of employment that maximizes expected revenue:


                                 
                                Nj,t                      ¯
                                    +1 Et (Xj,t+1 ) = Et (Qj,t+1 /2).                         (12)

We assume that the technology does not allow the team to be productive if any current member
                                             
leaves, so workers are not laid off even if Nj,t+1 < Njt . The number of positions offered to new
                                                                     
employees who would begin working in t + 1 is thus Ojt = max{Nj,t      +1 - Njt , 0}.

4       Unskilled workers.
We will refer to an individual who is not part of a specialized team at time t as "unskilled."
Unskilled workers can choose between 3 options.
    Option 1: seek to join an existing specialized unit. To pursue this option, an individual
trains and applies in period t for a position to produce good j beginning in period t + 1. With
probability jt the individual will be successful. Each individual takes jt as given, though
in equilibrium jt will be determined by the number of people applying for the job and the
number of openings available. An individual who pursues this option will receive nominal
compensation Ct while unemployed, financed through a proportional tax levied on the income
of specialized workers during period t.
    Option 2: seek to create a new good. An individual who is trying to join a team that
creates a new good also receives unemployment compensation Ct during period t and has a
probability k of being successful. There is also a utility cost kU of making an effort to create
a new good. The parameters k and kU are exogenously fixed parameters that summarize the
importance of frictions in creating new goods. If k  1 and kU  0, the monopoly power of
specialized teams would not be sustained along the steady-state growth path.
    Option 3: produce good 1. Good 1 is assumed to be produced in a nonspecialized sector in
which anyone could work with no training or coordination with others. If individual i works in
sector 1, s/he could produce xit units of good 1. The productivity parameter xit is distributed
independently across workers and across time. A favorable productivity xit for individual i
at time t has no implications for that same individual's productivity at t + 1. The nominal

   Objective of unskilled workers. Unskilled workers choose between the above three options,
seeking to maximize
                                                           
                                                vit = Et          s log yi,t+s                              (13)

     This objective function can be movitated as follows. Maximization of a pure log utility function (the
left-hand side of (3)) subject to the budget constraint (1) has the solution Pjt qijt = jt yit which results in a
level of utility given by

                                       jt yit
                             jt log               = log yit +           jt log jt -          jt log Pjt .

   Let Yjt be the after-tax nominal income of each individual who is part of specialized team
j at date t,
                                  Yjt = (1 -  )Pjt Qjt /Njt ,

for  the tax rate. Let Vjt denote the value of (13) for such an individual:

                       Vjt = log Yjt +  (1 - kjt )Et Vj,t+1 + kjt Et V1,t+1 .                (14)

Here kjt is the probability that unit j will discontinue production in t + 1. If the good is
discontinued, next period those individuals will be unskilled. Since productivity xit is drawn
independently over time, the expected lifetime utility in the event that the team is disbanded
is Et V1,t+1 , the same for all individuals.
    If an unskilled individual successfully creates a new good, the expected lifetime utility is
Et Vt +1 , whose value will be described below. Thus the value of (13) for an unskilled individual
at time t is
           
            log(P1t xit ) + Et V1,t+1
                                                            if produces good 1

    Decisions of unskilled workers. Individual i chooses the most favorable of the options
                                                                                      
in (15). The optimal decision is characterized by a productivity threshold X1          t such that
                                                
individual i chooses to produce good 1 if xit  X1t and looks for something better otherwise.
                                                                                           
If some individuals choose to produce good 1 and others try to create new goods, then X1   t
would be the level of productivity at which the marginal unskilled individual is indifferent
between working or trying to create a new good:

                                                            
           log(P1t X1t ) + Et V1,t+1 = log Ct - kU + k Et Vt+1 +  (1 - k )Et V1,t+1 .        (16)

Expression (16) can equivalently be written

                                     
                            log(P1t X1                          ~
                                      t ) - log Ct = -kU + k Et Vt+1                         (17)

where V~t = Vt - V1t is the expected lifetime advantage of specializing in a newly created good
relative to being nonspecialized. Alternatively, when there is an incentive to try to specialize
in continuing good j, (15) would require

                      
             log(P1t X1 t ) + Et V1,t+1 = log Ct + jt Et Vj,t+1 +  (1 - jt )Et V1,t+1        (18)

                                       
                              log(P1t X1                      ~
                                         t ) - log Ct = jt Et Vj,t+1                         (19)

    ~jt = Vjt - V1t the lifetime advantage of specializing in j . In a typical equilibrium in
for V
which some individuals try to create a new good while others seek to join existing unit j, both
conditions (17) and (19) hold, requiring that in equilibrium jt must satisfy

                                       ~j,t+1 = -kU + k Et V
                                 jt Et V                   ~t+1 .                              (20)

   It follows from equations (15), (16), and (16) that the lifetime income of nonspecialized
individual i is characterized by

                                                                       
                                    log(P1t xit ) + Et V1,t+1 if xit  X1 t
                        vit =                                          
                                                                           .                   (21)
                                   log(P1t X1t ) + Et V1,t+1 if xit < X1t

The expression Et V1,t+1 is the expected value for vi,t+1 across individuals i. Since xit is dis-
tributed independently across time, we can find the date t value of V1t by taking the expected
value of (21) across all unskilled individuals i at time t:

                                                  ~ 1t ) + Et V1,t+1
                                    V1t = log(P1t X                                            (22)

Note that this definition of X^ 1t means that if N1t denotes the total number of unskilled
individuals (including both those working and those unemployed), the total amount of good
1 that is produced is given by
                                                      ^ 1t .

    Distribution of productivity across unskilled workers. We will be using a parametric dis-
tribution for xit for which simple closed-form expressions for the key magnitudes are easily
obtained. The assumption is that log xit  U (Rt , St ) where the bounds (Rt , St ) on the uni-
form distribution will grow over time at the same rate as productivity of specialized goods.
Implications of the uniform distribution are summarized in the following proposition.
    Proposition 2. Suppose that the log of potential productivity for producing good 1 is
                                                                                   
distributed independently across individuals as log xit  U (Rt , St ) and let log X1t  [Rt , St ] be
the threshold level of productivity above which unskilled individuals choose to produce good 1
            
(that is, X1 t satisfies (16) or (18)). Then:
    (a) the fraction of unskilled individuals who are employed is

which is monotonically increasing in X1  t;
   (c) the average output of unskilled individuals (expression (24)) is

Moreover, if Rt+1 = Rt + g, St+1 = St + g, and log X1,t+1 = log X1t + g, then:
  (d) h1,t+1 = h1t ;
  (e) log X~ 1,t+1 = log X

  (f) log X^ 1,t+1 = log X

Results (d)-(f) of Proposition 2 will be helpful in establishing that the equilibrium unemploy-
ment rate is constant along the steady-state growth path.

5    Entry and exit of specialized goods.
The set of goods produced Jt is potentially different for each date t. In this section we first
specify how the preference parameters adapt to these changes, and then provide further details
on what happens upon entry or exit of a particular good.
    Preferences in a changing world. Preferences over goods are determined by the parameters
                                                                                                0
ijt and q  ¯ijt in the utility function (2). We specify following equation (4) that q
                                                                                    ¯ijt = 2jt qijt
         0
where qijt    is the consumption of good j along the steady-state growth path for individual i
and jt is a potential additional factor influencing demand for good j at time t, with jt = 1
along the steady-state growth path and jt > 1 capturing stronger than normal demand for
                                                          0 2
good j . We likewise from (5) specify ijt = jt jt /(qijt     ) where jt is a slope-demand shock
with jt = 1 along the steady-state path. The first question we discuss is how to treat the
share parameter jt when new goods are being created and others are discontinued.
    We want to maintain the interpretation of jt as a share parameter by imposing the
normalization that j Jt jt = 1 for all t. We focus on an economy for which the share
parameter for the nonspecialized good is constant over time: 1t = 1 , so that in the absence
of demand shifts, the share of income spent on specialized goods 1 - 1 will be constant along
the steady-state growth path. We accomplish this by specifying that when new specialized
goods are created, they carve out some of the demand share that had gone to earlier specialized
goods, leaving 1 unchanged. We now describe the details of how this works.
    Demand for newly created goods. Let J2t denote the set of goods that were produced for
                                     
the first time in period t and t      = j J  jt denote their combined demand share. Let J2t
                                              2t

to be constant for all t. Let nt = j J2 njt denote the fraction of the population at date t
                                        t
who are producing newly created goods and n t =  j J  njt the fraction producing continuing
                                                        2t
specialized goods. Our assumption is that the more people n    t involved in the process of
creating new goods, the more success they have in creating products that consumers want:

                                             nt
                                   t =              (1 - 1 )                               (30)
                                          n     
                                           t + nt


Assumptions (29) and (30) imply that some of the success in creating new goods comes at the
expense of demand for continuing goods,

                                             n
                                  t =
                                              t
                                                    (1 - 1 ).                              (31)
                                          nt + n
                                           
                                                t


If nt is higher than normal, continuing goods will see a lower demand share.
    Discontinued goods. A good will be discontinued if the expected benefit to workers from
retaining that specialization is less than they could anticipate by returning to the pool of
unskilled workers:
                              if Et Vj,t+1 < Et V1,t+1 , then j  J2t .                  (32)

   Let kXt denote the fraction of goods in t that are discontinued in t + 1. If J2t = j J2t 1 is
the total number of specialized goods at time t, the fraction that continue into t + 1 is given
     -1
by J2t    j J  1 = (1 - kXt ). Along the steady-state growth path, kXt = kX will be constant.

   A parametric example. It is sometimes useful also to follow the market for individual
goods. For this purpose the following parametric example allows some simple closed-form
expressions. Suppose that goods are one of kJ different types in terms of their expenditure
share, where the fraction of nt who succeed in creating type  is determined by the parameter
a with a1 + · · · + akJ = 1:

                         njt = aj nt   for j  J2t and j  {1, ..., kJ }.

There are kJ different new goods created at each date, one of each type j , which acquire

    The parameter kJ determines the total number of specialized goods produced in any given
period along the steady-state growth path. Along the steady-state path, kX J2t goods are
discontinued and kJ new goods are created each period. The number discontinued will equal
the number created if
                                        kX J2t = kJ                                    (35)

and the constant number of specialized goods along the steady-state growth path is given by
 0
J2 = kJ /kX .

6       Equilibrium unemployment and the creation of new goods.
Here we describe unemployment dynamics in the case when some workers create new goods
while others apply for existing positions, so that (17) and (20) both hold. For a given value
of n1t (the fraction of the population who are unskilled), this involves finding 1 - h1t (the
fraction of unskilled workers who are unemployed), h0t (the fraction of unemployed who try
to create new goods), and hjt (the fraction of unemployed who apply for openings in j ), with
h0t = 1 - j J2t hjt .
    An individual worker takes jt as given. In equilibrium jt is determined by the number
of people who apply for the positions ((1 - h1t )hjt n1t Nt ) relative to the number of openings
Ojt available. For 0 < Ojt < hjt (1 - h1t )n1t Nt ,2

                                                       Ojt
                                        jt =                         .                                   (36)
                                                (1 - h1t )hjt n1t Nt

Given unemployment compensation Ct and the value of creating a new good Et V       ~t+1 , equation
                                              
(17) determines the productivity threshold X1t , which from (26) tells us (1 - h1t ). From (20)
we also know jt as a function of Et V ~t           ~
                                        +1 and Et Vj,t+1 . Figure 3 illustrates the equilibrium
value of jt in the special case when Et V~t        ~
                                           +1 = Et Vj,t+1 , a special case that in fact turns out
to characterize the steady-state growth path. When the advantage to specialization is a large
    2
     This differs from typical search models of labor frictions such as Kaas and Kircher (2015) in that here
hiring units can post multiple vacancies at zero cost and the primary uncertainty facing applicants is whether
they can successfully complete the training.


                                                     11
              ~t[1]
value like Et V +1 , equation (20) requires jt to be large which from (36) means hjt is small.
A higher advantage to specialization induces more workers to create new goods rather than
apply for existing positions.
    A key determinant of the advantage to specialization is n1 (see equation (41) below) --
higher n1 means a bigger value of V    ~ . From Figure 3, higher V   ~ induces more workers to
become specialized by creating new goods, which would bring future n1 and V        ~ down. The
                                                                       ~t that are constant, and
steady-state growth path is characterized by values of n1t , h1t , and V
thus a constant unemployment rate.

7    Steady-state growth path.
In this section we consider an economy in which productivity grows deterministically at rate
g and population grows at rate n. The key endogenous variables whose values we calculate
       
are X1 t , the level of productivity at which unskilled individuals decide to look for a better
job, h0t , the fraction of the unemployed who try to create new goods, and njt , the equilibrium
fraction of the population producing j.
    Unemployment compensation. Along the steady-state growth path, a constant fraction of
spending goes to good 1:
                                       j J2t Pjt Qjt   1 - 1
                                                     =       .                               (37)
                                         P1t Q1t         1
The numerator on the left side of (37) is the tax base, and from (25), the denominator is
        ^ 1t . With a total of (1 - h1t )N1t individuals collecting unemployment compensation,
P1t N1t X
the compensation per individual is

                                       j J2t Pjt Qjt    (1 - 1 )
                           Ct =                      =                  ^ 1t .
                                                                    P1t X                       (38)

    Advantage from specialization. Let Yst denote the average after-tax income per person of
skilled workers and n1t = N1t /Nt the fraction of the population that is unskilled. . Result
(37) establishes that

                        (1 -  ) j J2t Pjt Qjt   (1 -  )(1 - 1 )                   ^ 1t
                                                                          P1t N1t X
               Yst =                          =                                        .
                             (1 - n1t )Nt             1                  (1 - n1t )Nt

It turns out that along the steady-state growth path, all skilled workers earn the same income:
Yjt = Yst j  J2t . Let Y ~t be the ratio of Yst to P1t X
                                                       ~ 1t , the flow-equivalent income of unskilled
in (23):
                                                                       ^
                            ~t = Yst = (1 -  )(1 - 1 )n1t X1t .
                            Y                                                                   (39)
                                     ~ 1t
                                 P1t X            1 (1 - n1t )        X~ 1t
                                            ^ 1t /X
Along the steady-state growth path, n1t and X     ~ 1t are constant, meaning there is a constant



                                                    12
proportional income advantage to specialization.
   Setting kjt = kX and Yjt = Yst in (14) and subtracting (22) from the result gives

                                  ~t = log Y
                                  V        ~t +  (1 - kX )Et V
                                                             ~t+1 .                                (40)

      ~t is constant along the steady-state growth path, the discounted life-time advantage is
Since Y
given by

             ~ =          1                   (1 -  )(1 - 1 )n1t       ^ 1t - log X
                                                                                  ~ 1t
             V                          log                      + log X                           (41)
                    1 -  (1 - kX )                1 (1 - n1t )

which is also constant along the steady-state growth path.
   Creation of new goods. Let hY t denote the log difference between the income that the
marginal unskilled individual could earn from producing good 1 and the income collected
from unemployment compensation:

                                                     
                                     hY t = log(P1t X1 t ) - log Ct .                              (42)

From expression (38) this is

                                   (1 - 1 )                                 ^
                   hY t = - log             + log(1 - h1t ) + log X1t - log X1t .                  (43)
                                     1

We can write the equilibrium condition for creation of new goods (17) as

                                                         ~.
                                         hY t = -kU + k  V                                         (44)

Recall from Proposition 2 that h1t , X~ 1t , and X
                                                 ^ 1t are known functions of X1 
                                                                                 t . Substituting (43)
and (41) into (44) gives an expression in two endogenous variables, which are the fraction of
                                                           
the population that is unskilled n1t and the value of X1    t at which an unskilled individual would
be indifferent between producing good 1 and seeking to create a new good. We show in the
                                                                                          
proof of Proposition 3 below that given any n1t  (0, 1), there exists a unique log X1      t  (Rt , St )
for which (44) holds.
    New hiring. Along the steady-state growth path, condition (12) holds exactly and all
specialized goods will be on the knife edge between being supply- or demand-constrained:

                                                  ¯ jt /2
                                  Qjt = Njt Xjt = Q            j  J2t .                            (45)

In each period t, a fraction kX of producers learn of a change in demand parameters coming in
t + 1 that leads the workers to return to the pool of unskilled in t + 1. We will describe details
of such a change in Section 9. Surviving units add new workers at the population growth rate


                                                   13
n: Nj,t+1 - Njt = (en - 1)Njt for j  J2,t+1 . New openings with continuing units are thus

                                  Ot = (1 - kX )(en - 1)(1 - n1t )Nt .                                  (46)

Since each continuing unit offers the same lifetime advantage, the probability of successfully
applying for one of these positions is the same across all continuing goods. With (1 - h1t )(1 -
h0t )n1t Nt individuals applying for these positions, this probability of success from (36) is

                                          (1 - kX )(en - 1)(1 - n1t )
                                    t =                               .                                 (47)
                                             (1 - h1t )(1 - h0t )n1t

Individuals are indifferent between applying for existing jobs and trying to create new goods
when (20) holds:
                                                    ~ = t  V
                                          - kU + k  V      ~.                                           (48)

Since V~ and h1t are known functions of X1    
                                                t and n1t , expression (48) gives another restriction
                                      
on the three endogenous variables X1   t , n1t , and h0t .
    Changes in the number of skilled workers. Note that (1 - h1t )h0t k n1t Nt individuals will
join newly created units in t + 1 which would be added to the (1 - kX )(1 - n1t )en Nt workers at
continuing units. The total number of unskilled at t + 1, which could be written as n1,t+1 en Nt ,
would then consist of the total population at t + 1 (en Nt ) minus the total number of skilled
individuals:

                n1,t+1 en Nt = en Nt - (1 - h1t )h0t k n1t Nt - (1 - kX )(1 - n1t )en Nt

                         n1,t+1 = n1t + kX (1 - n1t ) - e-n h0t (1 - h1t )k n1t .                       (49)

Thus the fraction of unskilled workers will be constant if

                                 kX (1 - n1t ) = e-n h0t k (1 - h1t )n1t .                              (50)

                                                                                              
    The steady-state growth path is characterized by a value of h0t , n1t , and X1            t in which the
three equations (50), (48), and (44) all hold. The next proposition establishes that there is a
unique solution to these three equations.
    Proposition 3. Let h1t , X    ~ 1t , X
                                         ^ 1t , hY t , V
                                                       ~ be the functions of X1
                                                                              
                                                                                t and n1t given in (26)-(28),
(43), and (41). If k , kX , 1 , ,  are all  (0, 1) and n and kU are both positive, there exists
                       0     0     0
a unique value of (X1   t , n1t , h0t ) for which (50), (48) and (44) simultaneously hold. At this
solution, log X10                                                   ~
                 t  (Rt , St ) and the values of hY t and V are positive.
    The fact that V~ is positive means that individuals would prefer to be skilled if they could
acquire skills at no cost. The barriers to becoming specialized (a probability less than one of
being able to join an existing enterprise and a cost of trying to create a new one) require as


                                                     14
compensation that V     ~ be positive in equilibrium.
     We are now in a position to characterize steady-state growth in this model.
     Assumptions behind the steady-state growth path. Population grows at a fixed rate n start-

                                                                                0       0     0
of productivity among unskilled workers are given by (Rt0 , St0 ). Let (X1       t0 , n1t0 , h0t0 ) denote

                                                     1 and h0 denote the latter two values, a no-
tation in anticipation of the fact that they turn out to be constant along the steady-state
growth path. In each period t = t0 , t0 + 1, ... unskilled individuals maximize (15) resulting

        (e) the share of the population that produces good j and the demand share parameter jt

8        Dynamic adjustment.
In this section we consider dynamic adjustment in an economy in which the labor shares at
date t may not be the steady-state values (njt = n0   j ) and in which the preference parameters
                                                                                          0
q
¯ijt and ijt need not be the values associated with the steady-state path (denoted qijt      and
  0                              0                0
ijt ). We specify q  ¯ijt = jt qijt and ijt = jt ijt where along the steady-state growth path
the demand-shift parameters equal one (jt = jt = 1), and without loss of generality3 1t =
1t = 1. And while productivity grows at the constant rate g along the steady-state path
       0                  0                           0
(log Xj,t +1 = g + log Xjt ), here we allow Xjt = jt Xjt with jt = 1 along the steady-state path.
    Successfully introducing a new good means creating a demand (or recognizing a latent
demand) for good j that grows along the steady-state growth path according to

                                 0       [1 +  (1 - 1 )] 0 0

                                              n01

n0
 j governing this steady-state demand is determined by the number of people involved in

        A lower demand for good 1 could equivalently be expressed as jt > 1 j  J2t .

initially creating the new good: n0
                                  j = njt if j  J2t . Equation (34) then implies that the
                           0 2
demand share jt = ijt /(qijt ) eventually converges to

                                        0    0                0

which need not equal the value in (33) for jt = n0
                                                 j (1 - 1 )/(1 - n1t ) for the date t at which
the good was first created. In the examples below, after a good is created, the value of njt
may subsequently deviate from the initial n0j , but if the good survives long enough, eventually
the labor share and demand share will return to n0           0

   Discussion of Proposition 5. Result (a) establishes that an increase in n1t results in lower
total demand provided that 1 +  (1 - 1 ) < n0    1 . In interpreting this inequality, note that 1 is
the steady-state fraction of income that goes to unskilled individuals as a result of production
of good 1 and  (1 - 1 ) is the fraction collected as unemployment compensation. If the
sum of these is less than than n0 1 , the fraction of the population that is unskilled, then the
average after-tax income of an unskilled individual along the steady-state path is less than
that of someone who is skilled. This is all that is needed to conclude that H < 0. This
condition is almost guaranteed by Proposition 3, which established that V       ~ 0 > 0, meaning
that the log income of skilled workers exceeds the expected log income of unskilled along the
steady-state growth path. However, because of Jensen's Inequality, this is not quite enough
to conclude that skilled income exceeds the expected income of the unskilled, which is the
condition required by 1 +  (1 - 1 ) < n0    1 . For most parameter values, Jensen's Inequality
is not big enough to reverse the typical outcome. Appendix C provides sufficient conditions
under which H is necessarily negative. When this is the case, Q   ¯ jt is lower when the fraction
of unskilled individuals is higher.
    Note that we defined real GDP in (72) as the ratio of current to steady-state output. Thus
Qt > 1 means a value of real GDP higher than steady state and Qt < 1 means a value lower
than steady state. As an example of using this result, consider the special case when there
are no demand or productivity shocks (jt = jt = 1), all goods are demand constrained
(Qjt = Q¯ jt /2), and the population share of each good is the steady-state value (njt = n0j ). In
this case (74) becomes

Note that (1 - 1 )/(1 - n0                               0
                         1 ), is greater than 1 and (1 /n1 ) is less than 1. Thus when Ht =

                                                           1

Thus even if Ht and (X ^ 1 t /X
                              ^ 1t0 ) were unity, a higher fraction of unskilled workers would mean
lower GDP because fewer of the goods that consumers value are being produced. When
n1t > n0         ^ ^0
       1 , both (X1t /X1t ) < 1 because when more individuals are unskilled, a higher fraction
of them look for jobs,4 and also Ht < 1 due to lower demand. Both these are additional factors
pushing real GDP below 1 when n1t > n0   1.

   A demand shock arising from   jt > 0 shifts both the demand and marginal revenue curves
out (see the bottom panel of Figure 2). If the good is demand constrained, the result is an
increase in both output and price. If the good is supply constrained, only the price increases.
By contrast, a slope demand shock jt 
                                        > 0 tilts the demand curve without changing Q  ¯ jt , and
                                                                                     
only results in an increase in price regardless of the regime. A productivity shock jt has no
effect on income because it either has no effect on output and price or has offsetting effects
on output and price; see Section 10 for more discussion.
    Result (78) means that if two different goods j and k both experience the same propor-
tionate demand shocks (                         
                           jt = kt and jt = kt ), producers of the two goods will receive the
                           
identical income (Yjt  = Ykt ). This greatly simplifies analysis of the economy off the steady-
state growth path in the examples below.

                          jt = jt = jt = 1 j  J2t and t  t0 + M.

In this subsection we characterize dynamics for these examples beginning in period t = t0 + M .
    Note from (78) that when jt = jt = 1, real income differs from the steady-state value Yt0
by the same multiple for every skilled worker. Let Yt denote this common level of income in
period t: Yt = Yjt /P1t for j  J2t and t  t0 + M. Looking forward from t  t0 + M, all skilled
workers face the same stream of future income prospects and thus there is a single lifetime
benefit of specialization V~t that is common to all skilled workers at t. The two key dynamic
equations for t  t0 + M are then (71) and the common value for (67),

where n t+1 is the fraction of the population at t + 1 producing newly created goods and nt+1
                                                                                              

the fraction producing continuing specialized goods.
   Another state variable that helps simplify calculations is n¯ t , which is defined as the sum
of the steady-state employment shares n0     j of all specialized goods that are produced at t:
¯ t = j J2t n0
n                                                                                           0
              j . A fraction (1 - kX ) of goods in t survive to t + 1, and the value of nj for
these goods at t + 1 is by definition is the same as in t. In addition, for newly produced goods
the steady-state population share is the value when they were first introduced: n0    j = njt for
      
j  J2t . Thus the equation of motion for n   ¯ t is

                             n                nt + n
                             ¯ t+1 = (1 - kX )¯     t+1       t  t0 + M.                       (81)

the property that all goods have capacity to produce the profit-maximizing level Qjt = Q     ¯ jt /2

mined by (68):

Since each specialization offers the same income, in equilibrium there is a common probability
t of succeeding in specializing in a continuing good, which from (69) is characterized by

                                             
                                        log X1                      ~
                                              t - log(Ct /P1t ) = t Vt+1 .                                          (85)

The number of openings with continuing goods is given by

                                    Ot = n      n
                                           t+1 e Nt - (1 - kX )(1 - n1t )Nt .                                       (86)

With (1 - h1t )(1 - h0t )n1t Nt applicants for these positions, the probability of success is

                                   n     n
                                    t+1 e - (1 - kX )(1 - n1t )
                               t =                                         t  t0 + M.                               (87)
                                      (1 - h1t )(1 - h0t )n1t

We can solve this expression for h0t = 1 - {[n      n
                                               t+1 e - (1 - kX )(1 - n1t )]/[(1 - h1t )n1t t ]} and
substitute the result into (70) to find the fraction of the population at t + 1 who are newly
skilled:

           nt+1 = e
                   -n
                      (1 - h1t )n1t k - [nt+1 - e
                                                  -n
                                                     (1 - kX )(1 - n1t )]k /t                  t  t0 + M.           (88)

In the examples below, any good that survives from t to t + 1 will have the profit-maximizing
                                                        
level of employment at t + 1: nj,t+1 = Ht+1 n0
                                             j for j  J2,t+1 . Summing over j gives the fraction
of the population at t + 1 producing continuing goods:

                                     nt+1 = Ht+1 (1 - kX )¯
                                                          nt         t  t0 + M.                                     (89)

   Linearized dynamics in the absence of demand and supply shocks. Recall from Proposition
2 and Table 1 that log(1 - h1t ), log X               ~ 1t , and log X ^ 1t are simple functions of log X1 
                                                                                                           t with
derivatives 2 , 3 , and 5 , respectively, and from (58) that Ht is a linear function of n1t .
Thus equations (79)-(85), (88), and (89) comprise a system of 9 dynamic equations in the 9
                 ~t , n
variables (n1t , V                               
                      ¯ t , Yt /P1t , Ct /P1t , X1                              
                                                   t , t , nt+1 , nt+1 ). Let zit denote the deviation at t of the
ith of these variables from its value along the steady-state growth path.5 The behavior of the
system can be approximated by the following 9 linear equations (see Appendix B for details):

                                                                
                                              n1,t+1 = -nt+1 - nt+1                                                 (90)
   5                
    Specifically, zit  = zit - zi0
                                   for zit = n1t , V~t , n

    In the examples below, the initial periods t0 , t0 +1, ..., t0 +M -1 may be governed by different
dynamics from those in (90)-(98) as a result of demand or productivity shocks. However, in all
the examples it is assumed that exogenous variables return to their steady-state values after
a finite number of periods, and it can be shown that in each of these examples, all specialized
goods will have exactly the capacity needed to meet demand after M periods. In this case

9     Demand shocks.
In this section we consider an economy in which all exogenous and predetermined variables at
t0 are equal to their steady-state values, so njt = n0

the demand parameter jt =  = 1 for a fraction  of the specialized goods produced at t0 .
From (78) we see that the income of anyone producing a nonimpacted specialized good at t is
still given by Yt in (93) whereas anyone producing an impacted good has income Yt :

                                              Yt = 2( - 1) + Yt .                                                (107)

Let nt denote the fraction of the population at t specializing in goods for which jt =  and
 c

  Baseline parameter values. Our baseline examples use the parameter values in Table 2.
We assume that a period corresponds to one quarter, with n implying an annual population
growth rate of 1% and  an annual discount rate of 2%. Note that taxes in this model are used
solely to finance unemployment compensation, motivating a relatively low value ( = 0.02)
for the marginal tax rate.6 Productivity for all workers grows at some fixed rate g (which
does not affect any of the numbers reported here), and the proportional gap between the
most productive and least productive unskilled individual (St - Rt ) is constant at 1 for all t.
There are huge gross flows out of and into employment in a typical month in the U.S. Davis,
Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2006, Table 1) found that 10% of workers lose or quit their
jobs each quarter, and the estimates in Ahn and Hamilton (forthcoming) imply that 12% of
employed individuals will be unemployed or out of the labor force 3 months later. Our value
of kX = 0.02 assumes that involuntary separations account for less than 1/5 of these observed
gross flows. When the probability of successfully creating a new good is k = 0.25, the baseline
parameters imply a steady-state unemployment rate of u0 = 5.1%. The discounted lifetime
log income advantage of being skilled is V ~ 0 = 4.80, which translates into a per-period flow
                             ~ 0 = 0.12, or 12% higher after-tax incomes for skilled workers.

    9.1    A transient drop in demand.
In our first example, the number of people producing each good starts out in period t0 at the
steady-state values (n jt0 = 0 for all j  Jt0 ). In period t0 , one-quarter of the specialized goods
( = 0.25) experience a 10% drop in demand in t0 ( = 0.9) that lasts for only a single period
with jt for all goods j returning to unity for t  t0 + 1. From (76), the demand-impacted
goods lower their output by 10% (Q         
                                         t0 =  - 1). From (77), if there were no change in the
fraction of unskilled workers who are unemployed, impacted goods would also lower their price
by 10% in period t0 (Pt   0

drop in both price and quantity account for the 20% drop in income described in (107). Since
the shock lasts for only one period, the lifetime advantage at t = t0 of one of the impacted

decision of impacted units to continue is determined solely by Vt0 +1 = Vt0 +1 , so no impacted
unit has an incentive to discontinue. The decision of how many workers to add in t0 + 1 is
based on (62), which again from (57) is the same for all j . If (93) and (91) are understood
to characterize the values for producers of goods that are not impacted by the demand shock,
equations (90)-(98) thus all hold for t > t0 and almost all hold for t = t0 as well with the single

Expression (109) reflects the fact that the lower income of demand-impacted specialists (2( -
1) = -0.2) reduces unemployment compensation by -0.2 in equilibrium. Appendix B shows
that real GDP in the initial period is

                              Q

Output of the impacted goods falls by , and nonimpacted goods have no ability and no
incentive to increase production. Equations (90)-(98), (104) and (106) all hold as written
for all t > t0 , so for this example M = 1 and expression (109) is the only way in which the
dynamic equations for the first date differ from the usual adjustment dynamics. In terms of the
notation in expression (102), for this example A   t0 = A, B t0 = B, and ct0 = (0, 0, 0, 0, -2( -
               
1), 0, 0, 0, 0) .
    The solid green curves in Figure 5 plot the time paths of key variables. Real GDP (Panel E)
falls by 1.4% in t0 but almost completely recovers by t0 +1. The reason that real GDP does not
quite completely return to the steady-state growth path in t0 + 1 is that lower taxes collected
from specialized workers in t0 mean lower unemployment compensation, which induces slightly
more unskilled workers to produce good 1 in t0 (Panel C). Because fewer unskilled workers
spent t0 trying to develop a skill, the number of unskilled workers in t0 + 1 is very slightly
above steady state (Panel A). However, these persistent effects are quite small in size, and to
a first approximation the effects of the demand shock are limited to the single initial period
in which jt0 = 1, in which GDP essentially falls by the size of the drop in demand.
    9.2   A transient increase in demand.
Consider next the case in which a fraction  = 0.25 of specialized goods experience a 10%
increase in demand ( = 1.1) in period t0 with demand returning to normal in t0 + 1. Because
these goods would be producing at capacity in t0 if  = 1, they do not increase production but
instead increase price by about 20%. Equations (76) and (77) in this case imply Q

                       t0 . If X1t0 did not change, there would be a 20% increase in the incomes
of workers specialized in the now-favored good. There is no direct boost to GDP from the
demand shock, and (110) for this case becomes Q                
                                                    t0 = 1 5 X1t0 . Unemployment compensation
is still given by (109). In this example, unemployment compensation rises in t0 because of
the higher tax revenues from some of the skilled workers. The dynamic effects of the shock
are described by the dashed blue lines in Figure 5. The higher unemployment compensation
induces an increased fraction of the unskilled to try to develop a specialty (Panel C). This
means less production of good 1, and with no added production of any specialized good, GDP

                                               26
actually falls in t0 . Some of these individuals succeed in producing new goods, leading to
                       ~t0 +1 very slightly below the steady state. The latter means less incentive
values of n1,t0 +1 and V
to specialize, and the economy eventually returns to steady state. As in Example 9.1, the
changes resulting from unemployment compensation are quite small. To a first approximation,
a transitory increase in demand has no real effects.

    9.3   A large persistent but isolated drop in demand.
Next consider the case of a 50% drop in demand that affects only 5% of specialized goods
( = 0.5,  = 0.05). Note that the total size of the shock to demand is the same as in
Example 9.1 (( - 1) = 0.025 in both examples), but in Example 9.3 the drop in demand is
concentrated on a relatively small number of goods. If the low demand lasted only for a single
period, the results would be identical to those in Example 9.1. Here however we consider a
shock that lasts for D = 8 periods. We take the shock to be isolated in the sense that new
goods created beginning in t0 + 1 all enjoy the steady-state demand level jt = 1. From (107)
the period t log income for workers specializing in the impacted good would differ from that
of other specialized workers by 2( - 1) for each t = t0 , ..., t0 + D - 1. From (91) this means
that the lifetime advantage as of date t from being specialized in an impacted good differs
from the steady-state advantage V ~ 0 by

the horizontal black dashed line drawn at V~0 + V ~t = 0, the level at which producers of
the impacted good would be indifferent between waiting out the period of low demand and

abandoning their specialty. For this numerical example, V  ~  < 0, meaning that workers

who had specialized in the impacted good in period t0 would be better off joining the pool of
unskilled beginning in period t0 + 1 rather than wait for demand for their good to pick up.
These workers will produce their specialized good in t0 and then join the pool of unskilled
beginning in t0 + 1. This means that only a fraction (1 - kX )(1 - ) of the specialized goods
that were produced in t0 survive to t0 + 1. Expressions (81) and (89) for t = t0 in this example
become

After linearization this results in adding the following terms to the right sides of equations

                                                                    ( )

Also as in equation (109) we add 2( - 1) to the right side of (94).
    Beginning in t = t0 + 1, all the impacted goods are gone and newly created goods face
steady-state demand parameters, so that the dynamic equations for the economy for t =
t0 + 1, t0 + 2, ... are exactly the same as in (90)-(98). Hence this is another example in which
dynamics revert to the time-invariant system (90)-(98) after M = 1 period.7 However, the
effects of the shock at t0 have not gone away, because the extra inflow of workers into the pool
of unskilled causes n1,t0 +1 to be higher than the steady-state value n01 , shown in Panel A of
figure 4. This causes real GDP in (106) (Panel E) to be lower in t0 + 1 both because fewer
people are producing high-value goods and because lower-skilled workers have lower overall
demand for goods. Panel F shows the relative price that would maximize profits for impacted
units if they were to continue in operation beyond t0 . However, because V   ~t+1 < 0, they have
                                                                               0

all dropped out and these goods are no longer produced after t0 . Thus the same-sized shock
to demand (Examples 9.1 and 9.3) can have a bigger effect if it results in significant numbers
of skilled workers losing their jobs, as in this example.
    This example offers one possible explanation for why goods are always being discontinued
along the steady-state growth path. Suppose that along the steady-state growth path, each
period t a fraction kX of specialized producers learn that demand for their particular product is
going to experience a decrease of the magnitude considered here beginning in t + 1. Producers
of those goods would have an incentive to abandon their specialty after producing in t, and
choose to return to the pool of unskilled workers. Thus a shock of the kind considered in
Example 9.3 could be viewed as occurring all the time in this model. Everyone takes into
account the likelihood that it will eventually happen to them through the parameter kX that
   7
    For this example, the time dependence is captured by the t = t0 values of A  t0 , B
                                                                                       t0 , c
                                                                                            t0 . Although expression
(111) exhibits time-dependence up until t = t0 + D1 - 1, this equation is only relevant for the decision impacted
workers make in period t0 . For the parameter values in this example, workers abandon their specialty and
these goods are no longer produced after period t0 , so the only economically relevant equations after t > t0 all
take the form of (90)-(98).



                                                        28
enters every decision. Example 9.3 could be viewed as exploring what happens when these
regular demand shocks affect a larger fraction of goods than usual and catch the producers of
these goods by surprise in t0 .
    9.4   The role of technological frictions.
How long the adjustment process requires depends on how hard it is to create new goods.
Consider an economy in which the probability of successfully creating a new specialized good
is 0.60 rather than 0.25 in our baseline parameterization. With lower technological frictions
to developing new goods, there is a lower equilibrium unemployment rate (u0 = 2.4% ver-
sus 5.1% for the baseline parameters) and a lower equilibrium advantage to being skilled
(V~ 0 = 0.7 versus 4.8 for the baseline case). In an economy with more modest technological
frictions, workers would be much quicker to abandon their skill under adverse conditions (see
the horizontal dashed red line in Figure 5D). Although the surge in unskilled workers in t0 + 1
is the same as in Example 9.3, the economy recovers more quickly; the largest stable eigen-
value of  is 0.89 for the baseline parameters but only 0.79 when k = 0.6. Thus technological
frictions are the key determinant of the Keynesian multiplier effect.
    9.5   A persistent drop in demand for new and existing goods.
The assumption in Examples 9.3 and 9.4 was that newly created goods were immune from
the lower demand that hit existing goods, with the result that a surge in new good creation
was a key factor mitigating the economic downturn. In reality, starting a new business may
be harder than usual when the economy is weak. To study this possibility, we now consider a
demand shock that affects both new and existing goods. As in Example 9.1, we suppose that
25% of existing goods at t0 experience a 10% drop in demand ( = 0.25,  = 0.9). Unlike
that example, here we assume that the drop lasts for D = 5 periods and also affects any goods
that are newly created in t0 , ..., t0 + D - 1. In this case, the returns to creating a new good
will be determined not by V~t+1 but by V  ~t
                                            +1 . For the first D - 1 periods the condition for new
good creation (95) becomes

                
               X1           ~      X
                 t - Ct = k Vt+1 + t0 +D-t-1 2( - 1) t = t0 , ..., t0 + D - 2


for jX
       given by (112). The attractiveness of specializing in a nonimpacted good is still V  ~t+1 ,
so that the equilibrium probability t of obtaining one of those positions is still determined by
(85). As in the baseline model, we assume that successfully creating a new good provides the
new good with a steady-state demand based on the number of people who initially created
it, represented by n0
                    j = njt . No demand-impacted good, whether continuing or newly created,
will have an incentive to hire new workers during the first D - 1 periods. Assuming that
all goods continue to face the steady-state probability kX of being forced to discontinue, the

                                                        1 ), leading to a total number of skilled
workers given by 1 - n1,t+1 = n            c
                                  t+1 + nt+1 . After period t0 + D, the dynamics revert to the
system (79)-(89). For details see Appendix B.
    The cyan curves in Figure 5 show adjustment dynamics for this example. The drop in
production of impacted specialized goods in t0 by itself would lower GDP by 1.5%, just as in
Examples 9.1 and 9.3-9.4. However, in this case unskilled workers recognize at t0 the lower
probability of successfully specializing in an existing good and limited returns from producing
a new impacted good. More of them respond by choosing to produce good 1 rather than
try to develop a skill, with only 1 - h1t0 = 6.1% of them unemployed in t0 compared to the
steady-state value of 11.5%. This results in an increased production of good 1 in period t0 that
turns out to completely offset the lost production of specialized goods, so that real GDP at t0
is about the same as the steady-state value. The lower-than-normal rate of skill accumulation
results in a buildup in the fraction of unskilled over time, and this eventually brings GDP to
2.3% below steady-state by t0 + 4. The buildup in n1t also increases the incentive to try to
specialize, and by t0 + 4 a higher fraction than normal of the unskilled are searching for work.
The demand shock is gone for all goods beginning in t0 + 5, resulting in a sharp rebound in
real GDP. However, GDP is still 0.9% below normal in t0 + 5 and only gradually returns to
the steady-state growth path as the surplus of unemployed eventually develop skills.
    9.6   Shocks to jt .
Up to this point we have been discussing shocks to the preference parameter jt , which results
in a vertical shift of the demand curve for good j and changes the profit-maximizing level
of output Q¯ jt /2 (see Figure 2). Consider now a shock to the parameter jt , which changes
the vertical intercept of the demand curve but leaves the horizontal intercept and the profit-
maximizing level of output unchanged. From equation (76), this has no direct effect on output
regardless of whether the good is demand- or supply-constrained. Instead, from (77) and (78),
a 10% increase in jt leads to a 10% increase in price and income for good j . A 10% decrease
in jt leads to 10% decreases in Pjt and Yjt , again regardless of the regime. The changes in
income will result in a change in tax receipts and unemployment compensation which would
have general-equilibrium effects on h1t and n1t , but these would be secondary contributions of
the size noted in Example 9.1.
   It is possible that if a drop in jt is large enough and lasts long enough, the drop in
income for producers of the good would be sufficiently large to persuade them to discontinue
production. Note that the coefficient on jt in the income equation (78) is twice as big as the

                                               30
coefficient on jt , so it would take roughly twice as big a shock to jt to cause the good to
be discontinued. For shocks of moderate size, a change in jt would affect relative prices but
have negligible effects on any real quantities.

10     Productivity shocks.
In this section we consider an economy that begins period t0 with all exogenous and prede-
termined variables equal to their steady-state values with the exception that the productivity
parameter jt =  = 1 for a fraction  of the specialized goods in production in date t0 .
     10.1   A transient drop in productivity.
Consider first a 10% drop in productivity that affects 25% of the goods in t0 ( = 0.9,  = 0.25)
with productivity returning to normal in t0 + 1. Impacted goods are supply-constrained in
t0 and from (76) each lower their output by 10% (Q        
                                                        t0 =  - 1). From (77) this means they
raise their price by 10% (Pt0 = -( - 1) + 5 X1       
                                                      t0 ) which from (78) means no change in
           +       
income (Yt0 = Yt0 ). The last equation also means that there is no change in unemployment
                                            
compensation for t0 , and the elements of zt  are determined by equations (90)-(98) for all t.
With reduced production of the impacted goods and no increase in the production of any
other goods, real GDP in t0 falls by Q                                              
                                        t0 = (1 - 1 )( - 1) + 1 5 X1t0 with X1t0 = 0, and
then returns exactly to the steady-state growth path in t0 + 1.
    The time paths of key variables are shown in the solid green curves in Figure 6. Apart from
lacking the modest effects on n1,t0 +1 arising from the lower unemployment compensation in t0
in Example 9.1, the effects of a productivity shock in Figure 6 are essentially the same as those
of a demand shock in Figure 5. Note in particular we could not use measured productivity
as a way to distinguish between demand and supply shocks. In Example 9.1, productivity
of impacted goods falls by Q           
                               jt0 - Njt0 = ( - 1), whereas in Example 10.1, productivity of
impacted goods falls by Q           
                           jt0 - Njt0 = ( - 1). One could not tell by looking at the behavior
of output, employment, or productivity whether output fell because it is harder to produce
the good or because fewer people want to buy it. The one variable that could be used to
distinguish these two shocks is the relative price in Panel F of Figures 5 and 6. A demand
shock results in lower output and lower price, whereas a supply shock results in lower output
and higher price.
     10.2   A transient increase in productivity.
Consider next the case in which a fraction  = 0.25 of the goods in production at t0 experience
a 10% increase in productivity ( = 1.1), with conditions again returning to normal beginning
in t0 + 1. Although more goods could be produced in t0 , no one has an incentive to do so,
since Q¯ jt0 /2 is still the profit-maximizing level of production. There is no incentive to change
prices, and no incentive to make any changes for the future since conditions at t0 + 1 will be


                                                31
back to steady state. Thus in this example, the increase in productivity has no effect on any
real or nominal variable at any date.
    10.3     A persistent decrease in productivity.

Even if a drop in productivity is persistent, according to equation (78) it would not lead to a
change in the relative income received by producers of the impacted goods. This is because
(78) is derived from a linearization around the steady-state growth path. Along the steady-
state growth path, the elasticity of demand is unity meaning that the decrease in output equals
the increase in price. As the productivity shock becomes larger, the elasticity of demand is
pushed above unity, and the linearization becomes less accurate. If we wanted to examine the
effects of a very large shock to productivity, we should use the exact expression for income
(64) instead of the linearization (78). Apart from general-equilibrium feedback arising from
changes in n1t or Q1t , the direct effects of either demand shocks jt or supply shocks jt on
income Yjt in (64) come through their implications for Qjt or Q         ¯ jt : Yjt  Qjt (Q  ¯ jt - Qjt ). In
the case of a demand shock hitting a demand-constrained good, Qjt = Q            ¯ jt /2 = jt Ht n0 X 0 Nt .
                                                                                                   j 1t
When n1t = n0   1 , this  means  Y jt      2
                                           jt and  log Y jt = 2 log  jt . Hence    the   coefficient on    jt
in the linearization (78) is in fact the same as the coefficient in an exact representation, since
log Yjt is an exact linear function of logjt in the demand-constrained case.
    By contrast, in the case of a productivity shock hitting a supply-constrained good, Qjt =
            0
njt Nt jt Xjt and Q ¯ jt = 2Ht n0   0                         0               0
                                j Xjt Nt . Thus when njt = nj and n1t = n1 , we have Yjt  jt (2-jt )
and
                                        log Yjt = log[jt (2 - jt )].                                  (113)

For the 10% productivity drop in Example 10.1,  log Yjt = log[(0.9)(1.1)] = -0.01, a little
below the value of zero assumed in the linearization.
   To examine the effects of larger productivity drops, we can use (113) instead of the linear
approximation  log Yjt  0. In this case we would describe unemployment compensation in
t0 by
                                                             1
                 Ct0 =  log[ (2 -  )] + Yt  - 2 X1t0 - 0           n
                                          0
                                                       n1 (1 - n1 ) 1t0 .
                                                                0


If the productivity shock persists for D periods, the relative income and lifetime advantage of
impacted relative to nonimpacted goods

                                        Yt  = log[ (2 -  )] + Yt

                                   ~t  = V
                                   V     ~t + t
                                              X
                                                      log[ (2 -  )]
                                               0 +D-t


for tX given by (112) and t = t0 , ..., t0 + D - 1. For  = 0.5, log[ (2 -  )] = -0.29 and a
productivity shock of this size that persisted for D = 8 periods would not be sufficiently big to
persuade workers to surrender their specialty. However, an 80% drop in productivity ( = 0.2)


                                                     32
that lasted for 8 periods would induce production of impacted goods to be discontinued. This
is indicated by the solid black curves in Figure 6. Note that in order to scale this example so
that the period t0 shock to GDP is the same as in the other examples, we assume that the
fraction of goods experiencing the 80% drop in productivity is  = 0.03. Although the overall
patterns are similar to those in the persistent demand Example 9.3, the effects for t > t0 are
smaller because a smaller fraction of specialized workers are displaced.

11    Discussion.
In order to focus as clearly as possible on the role of specialization in determining the level of
economic activity, this paper abstracted from many details that play a key role in economic
fluctuations. Here labor was the only input, with specialization taking the form of training
and assembling a dedicated team of workers. Specialized capital is an even more important
commitment for most businesses (Ramey and Shapiro, 1998 and 2001). Production moreover
typically depends on inputs purchased from other firms that themselves specialize to be able to
provide those goods or services, amplifying the forces studied here through network connections
(Baqaee, 2018 and Baqaee and Farhi, 2019). This paper completely ignored financial frictions,
even though they appear to be a key factor in many economic downturns. And although
nominal frictions played no role in this model, they could well be an additional factor in
amplifying economic downturns.
    By focusing on just a single source of specialization and a single technological friction, the
hope was to shed light on the interaction between specialization and demand as a fundamental
short-run determinant of the level of GDP.

Condition (44) can be written

                                           
                                    hY t (X1               ~         
                                            t ) = -kU + k  V (h0t , X1t )                        (A3)

                                           
where hY t (X1t ) denotes the function of X1t given in (43).
                                                 
  From rows (2) and (5) of Table 1, as log X1    t increases from Rt to St , the left side of (A3)
monotonically increases from - to . For fixed h0t > 0, the right side monotonically
                                                                                          
decreases from  to -. Thus given any h0t  (0, 1), there exists a unique log X1            t  (Rt , St )
at which condition (A3) holds, that is, for which conditions (50) and (44) simultaneously hold.
                         
Denote this solution X1    t (h0t ).
    From (A2), a larger value of h0t lowers the right side of (A3) and thus is associated with
                                                                                            
a lower value of X1  t : X1t (h0t )/h0t < 0. As h0t  0, - log h0t   and log(X1t (h0t )) is
                                                                                             
driven to St . Since hY t (X1  t ) in (43) is monotonically increasing in X1t and since X1t (h0t ) is
                                                             
monotonically decreasing in h0t , it follows that hY t (X1    t (h0t )) is a monotonically decreasing
                                        
function of h0t . By the definition of X1t (h0t ), we know that


                                      
                               hY t (X1                      ~         
                                        t (h0t )) = -kU + k  V (h0t , X1t (h0t ))                (A4)

holds for all h0t . Monotonicity of the left side of (A4) as a function of h0t implies that the
right side is also a monotonically decreasing function of h0t .
    Next consider the incentives for applying for a position with continuing enterprises. Sub-
stituting (A1) into (47),

                                             (1 - kX )(1 - e-n )k h0t
                       t (h0t ) = max                                       ,1 ,                 (A5)

                                                      41
allowing us to write (48) as

                                  ~ (h0t , X1
                         - kU + k V                              ~         
                                             t (h0t )) = t (h0t )V (h0t , X1t (h0t )).                              (A6)

               ~ (h0t , X1
Recalling that V         
                          t (h0t )) is a monotonically decreasing function of h0t , consider two
cases. Suppose first that V ~ (h0t , X  (h0t )) is positive at its lowest point (h0t = 1). Note from
                                      1t
(A5) that t = 1 at this point. With V         ~ positive and t = 1 > k , the right side of (A6)
must be larger than the left side at the lowest possible value for V         ~ , namely V~ (1, X  (1)).
                                                                                                1t
                               ~
As h0t decreases below 1, V monotonically increases and t monotonically decreases, the
latter eventually reaching 0 as h0t  0. Thus there exists a unique value h0                       0t  (0, 1) at
                                                                                       ¯
which (A6) holds; see the top panel of Figure 4. Call this value h0t . This value implies a
               ¯                               ¯                                 ¯
unique X1      t (h0t ), a unique h1t (X1t (h0t ) and thus a unique n1t (h0t ) from (A1). By construction
         0           0     0
(X1  t (h0t , n1t (h0t ), h0t ) satisfy (49), (48) and (50).
     Alternatively, suppose that V            ~ (1, X1
                                                     
                                                      t (1)) is negative (see the bottom panel of Figure 4).
Since V  ~ is monotonically decreasing in h0t and goes to  as h0t  0, there exists a unique
¯ 0t  (0, 1) at which V
h                                 ¯ 0 t , X  (h
                               ~ (h           ¯
                                           1t 0t )) = 0. At this point the right side of (A6) is zero and the
left side is negative. As h0t decreases below h             ¯ 0t , the value of V
                                                                                ~ increases without bound while
the magnitude t (h0t ) eventually goes to 0. Thus there again exists a unique h0                         0t for which
                                                            0          0     0
condition (A6) holds and for which (X1                 t (h0t , n1t (h0t ), h0t ) simultaneously satisfies (50), (48)
and (44).
      Proof of Proposition 4.
                              0     0
      (a) Let (X1       t0 , n1 , h0 ) be the unique solution to (44), (48) and (50) for date t0 . Then
(eg X1         0    0
         t0 , n1 , h0 ) solve these three equations for date t0 + 1, as can be verified as follows. From
proposition 2d-f, X1                       g                                       0       ^                  ^
                                ,t0 +1 = e X1t0 would imply h1,t0 +1 = h1 , log X1,t0 +1 = g + log X1t0 and
log X  ~ 1,t0 +1 = g + log X     ~ 1t0 establishing from (43) that hY,t0 +1 = hY t0 and from (41) that V         ~t0 +1 =
V~t0 . Hence (44), (48) and (50) are all satisfied at date t0 + 1, confirming that (eg X1                          0    0
                                                                                                             t0 , n1 , h0 )
is the solution. By induction, (eg(t-t0 ) X1                  0   0
                                                       t0 , n1 , h0 ) is the solution for all t.
      (b) Of the J2t0 = kJ /kX goods at initial date t0 , kX J2t0 = kJ will no longer be produced
beginning in t0 + 1. And since h0t0 > 0, kJ new goods (one of each type) will begin being
produced in t0 + 1. Thus J2,t0 +1 = J2t0 and by induction J2t is constant for all t.
      (c) Along the steady-state growth path, a fraction (1 - 1 )(1 -  ) of total income Y                           ¯t is
earned by skilled workers and the remaining [1 +  (1 - 1 )]Y                        ¯t is received by unskilled. Each
of these groups on average spends a fraction jt of their income on good j . Since njt Nt Xjt
units of good j get produced, (1 - 1 )(1 -  )njt Nt Xjt units of good j are consumed by the
skilled and the remaining [1 +  (1 - 1 )]njt Nt Xjt by unskilled. Dividing the first expression
by the total number of skilled workers (1 - n1t )Nt gives result (c). Result (i) below verifies
that this is in fact the same number for all skilled workers.
      (d) Dividing unskilled total spending on j , [1 +  (1 - 1 )]njt Nt Xjt , by the total number of


                                                           42
unskilled n01 Nt gives result (d). Since productivities xit are drawn independently over time, this
                                                                            0
is the average unskilled spending and is the level of consumption qnjt         along the steady-state
growth path.
    (e) With njt = n0    j , consumption of good j per individual in (52)-(53) grows at rate g so
that total consumption Qjt grows at g + n and equals total production in (45). Constant n0          j
also implies constant j in (34).
    (f) The ratio of nominal spending on good j to that for good 1 is (Pjt Qjt )/(P1t Q1t ) = j /1 .
Since Qjt = n0                                 ^        0               ^
                 j Nt Xjt , Pjt /P1t = (j n1t X1t )/(1 nj Xjt ). Since X1t and Xjt both grow at rate
g, the ratio X ^ 1t /Xjt is constant over time.
    (g) This follows immediately from applying results (c) and (d) to expression (8).
    (h) Total spending on good j is Pjt Qjt = j Yt , so the after-tax income per person producing
good j is
                                      (1 -  )Pjt Qjt    jt Yt (1 -  )
                                                     =                .                         (A7)
                                          njt Nt           njt Nt
Equation (51) establishes that at date t0 this magnitude is

                                (1 -  )Pjt0 Qjt0  Yt (1 -  )(1 - 1 )
                                                 = 0
                                    njt0 Nt0          (1 - n0
                                                            1 )Nt0


which is the same for all j  J2t0 . Thus the stated initial conditions imply that all skilled
workers earn the same income at date t0 . The income for a worker producing good j at date
t is Pjt Xjt , which from result (f) is eg(t-t0 ) times the income that individual received at date
t0 , the same constant factor for each j.
     For goods that are produced for the first time in period t, substituting condition (33) into
(A7) gives
                            (1 -  )Pjt Qjt   (1 - 1 )Yt (1 -  )
                                           =                         j  J2t ,
                                njt Nt          (1 - n0
                                                      1 )Nt

which is the same for each j  J2t and the same as the income received by those producing
continuing specialized goods.

affine function of z  1,t0 . In period t0 + D - 1, weak demand conditions persist so that Ct0 +D-1
                       

continues to take the form of (B48). But the forward-looking variables anticipate that demand
shocks will be gone in t0 + D and a 9-variable system similar to (99) characterizes the relation
between variables in dates t0 + D - 1 and t0 + D. This system is described by the three state
variables z1                           ~          ¯

first two elements of z   1,t0 +D-1 and the third can be found from the fact that

   Proof of Proposition C1.
   We first show that t =  is constant along the steady-state growth path:

                           [exp(St + g ) - exp(Rt + g )]      St + g + Rt + g
                t+1 = log                                 -
                                St + g - (Rt + g )                   2
                               exp(St ) - exp(Rt )       St + Rt     2g
                    = g + log                      -              -
                                    St - Rt                 2         2
                    = t .

   Let It0 = j Jt Pjt 0 0    0
                       Qjt /P1t denote steady-state real national income. The skilled receive a
total share (1 - 1 )(1 -  ) and the unskilled 1 +  (1 - 1 ), and thus per capita receive

                                                (1 - 1 )(1 -  ) 0
                                       Yt0 =                   It
                                                    1 - n01


                                       ¯10   1 +  (1 - 1 ) 0
                                       Y t =              It
                                                 n01

                                     ¯10   n0
                                            1 - [1 +  (1 - 1 )] 0
                               Yt0 - Y t =                     It
                                                n0       0
                                                 1 (1 - n1 )
                             ¯10
so (C3) holds whenever Yt0 > Y               ¯0
                               t . Note that Y1t could alternatively be calculated as

                        Y t =                        + 0                        .

                                     St                             log X1

Thus if Yt0 > Y~10               0  ¯0
                 t , then also Yt > Y1t . Thus the proof will be complete if we can show that
(C2) implies that Yt0 > Y ~ 0.

   From (44) and (40),

                                                                              ~0

                     ~ 0 = log Yt0 - log X
where from (39), log Y                   ~10           0
                                            t . Since hY > 0, (C5) implies


                                              ~0 >      [1 -  (1 - kX )]kU

                                         ~ 0 >  meaning log Yt0 > log X
Condition (C2) then establishes that log Y                                ~1

have succeeded in showing that log Yt > log Y ~1t if we show that log Y
