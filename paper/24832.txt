A large body of literature suggests that the first years of life are critical for long-term economic,
health and social outcomes. However, the effect of public programs on early life skills formation
is largely unknown due to data limitations. In this paper we use novel data from a large
longitudinal prospective cohort study to estimate the effects of WIC, SNAP, and home visitation
programs on early life outcomes up to two years of age. We find that participation in these
programs has a positive and statistically significant effect on language development and boosts
early life noncognitive outcomes.

1         Introduction

Human capital is an essential component of long-term economic growth (Lucas 1988, Romer
1990). Building upon seminal contributions by Schultz (1961) and Becker (1962), Cunha
and Heckman (2007) have argued that human capital production and skill formation is a
life cycle process that begins in the womb and continues throughout life. An increasingly
interdisciplinary body of evidence shows that gaps in skills originating from birth through
five years of age establishes a path for lifetime skill formation and long-term economic,
health and social outcomes. (Cunha, Heckman, Lochner and Masterov 2006, Hoddinott,
Maluccio, Behrman, Flores and Martorell 2008, Cunha, Heckman and Schennach 2010) The
economics, psychological and clinical literature offer some guidance in estimating the causal
relationships underlying early skills formation; however, the mechanisms of cognitive and
noncognitive skill formation outcomes have not been established. A central question of
interest is whether skill formation technology depends upon improved nutrition during early
childhood. If so, it is conceivable that policymakers can reduce ability gaps between children
from various socioeconomic groups and ultimately raise the productivity of society at large
through nutrition interventions at an early age.
        In this paper, we analyze the effect of the mother’s participation in WIC, the Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and home visitation on early cognitive and
noncognitive developmental outcomes as measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant Develop-
ment (BSID-III), a set of standardized measures commonly used within the field of develop-
                                                                                                     1
mental science for analyzing short- to medium-term outcomes of babies. (Bayley 2006)                     A
small number of studies in the scholarly literature have been able to carefully identify the
causal effect of assistance programs by exploiting the introduction of such programs under ex-
perimental or quasi-experimental conditions. (Wydick, Glewwe and Rutledge 2013, Barrera-
    1
    The BSID-III is a widely accepted developmental assessment instrument for children from birth through
42 months. (Sattler 2008)




                                                   2
Osorio, Bertrand, Linden and Perez-Calle 2011, Behrman, Parker and Todd 2011) Absent an
experimental rollout or random assignment into treatment, a suitable instrument for program
participation must be found, which has been difficult in practice for food programs. (Bitler
and Currie 2005) In our dataset we observe objective measures that determine eligibility
into these programs, and other measures that might influence the decision to participate
in these programs, such as maternal personality measures (IQ measures, motivation mea-
sures, emotional health), maternal knowledge of child development, the child’s health status,
measures on maternal-child contact and bonding, as well as measures on home and neigh-
borhood environments. To deal with issues of selection, we use mother-infant fixed-effects
models, which compare child outcomes over time among mothers who participated in assis-
tance programs and those who did not participate. This technique uses variation in program
participation status over time, and controls for unobserved mother-infant pair characteristics
and for family and environmental background attributes that are time-invariant.
   We find that a mother’s participation in WIC during pregnancy and in early childhood
has a direct effect on noncognitive skill formation at an early age. We find that WIC increases
on average receptive communication z-scores by 0.33, expressive communication z-scores by
0.15. Our results are robust to the inclusion of a rich set of possible confounding factors.
Overall, our results suggest that WIC and the home visitation program improve BSID-III
scores and that such programs might have the potential to decrease the gaps in child ability
across families of different socioeconomic status. We show that the mothers’ participation
in the WIC program increases the intake of those nutrients associated with early childhood
development such as iron, folic acid, B6 and B12.
   Our study is to our knowledge the first to use detailed data on prenatal, perinatal and
postneonatal nutritional exposures and developmental outcomes up to two years of age. Our
results, which focus on early childhood cognitive and non-cognitive skill formation, builds
upon previous research that finds a positive relationship between participation in federal



                                              3
nutrition assistance programs and longer term health outcomes. (Hoynes, Schanzenbach
and Almond 2016, Currie and Rajani 2015, Hoynes, Page and Stevens 2011). Our discussion
of the underlying biological mechanisms by which WIC might affect skills formation further
contributes to the literature.
    The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we summarize the
economics literature on the long-term effects of early skill formation interventions. In Section
3, we describe our data. In Section 4, we present the conceptual framework and empirical
strategy. In Section 5, we present the results. In Section 6, we extend our analysis to examine
possible mechanisms. We conclude in Section 7.



2     Related Literature

2.1    Food Assistance Programs

A number of scholarly papers find evidence that in the United States food and nutrition
assistance programs are linked to improved neonatal outcomes (Hoynes et al. 2016, Currie
and Rajani 2015, Almond, Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2011, Bitler and Currie 2005) and long-
term outcomes. We are only aware of one paper in the health economics literature on the
effect of U.S. federal or local food programs on early developmental outcomes. (Bolbocean
2015) In the health research literature, we are aware of two studies that have assessed the
direct effect of WIC on the Bayley scales of infant development (Jackson 2015) and on
intelligence quotient (IQ) and cognitive test scores in early childhood. (Hicks, Langham and
Takenaka 1982) These authors find positive effects of prenatal WIC on cognitive development.


2.2    Early Skills Formation

A large body of research shows that skill formation is a highly complex process influenced by
environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors in perinatal and postnatal periods. (Haworth


                                               4
and Plomin 2010, Stromswold 2006) Understanding the role and related mechanisms of nu-
tritional interventions on early skills formation is critical. The existing scientific literature,
using evidence from animal models, demonstrates that early nutrient deficiencies have sub-
stantial, long-term negative effects on early brain development. (Georgieff 2007, Meck and
Williams 2003, Salvati, Attorri, Avellino, Di Biase and Sanchez 2000) Some nutrients appear
to be more important than others for brain development; however, evidence that there are
critical and sensitive periods in brain synaptic plasticity is overwhelming. (Heckman 2012)
The study of skill formation through the nutritional channel is even more important in hu-
man beings because of the dynamic complementarity of the skills formation process. (Cunha
et al. 2006) Thus, if a child does not receive appropriate nutrients during early childhood, it
might be very difficult or even impossible to appropriately support brain plasticity, (Rosales,
Reznick and Zeisel 2009) which ultimately results in poor neurocognitive outcomes at a later
age. Better nutrition during childhood is also associated with better health and educational
outcomes in children. (Glewwe, Jacoby and King 2001, Winicki and Jemison 2003, Alder-
man, Hoddinott and Kinsey 2006, Victora, Adair, Fall, Hallal, Martorell, Richter, Sachdev,
Maternal, Group et al. 2008) However, there is compelling evidence that the first two years
of a child’s life are thought to be the critical period when nutrition has the greatest effect
on child health, growth and development. (Rosales et al. 2009, Victora et al. 2008)
   Evidence on the importance of ability in determining long-term socioeconomic success
is overwhelming. Interdisciplinary research has shown the existence of critical and sensi-
tive periods in the formation of skills. (Knudsen 2004) Persistent and substantial gaps
in noncognitive and cognitive abilities determine a variety of outcomes and have a direct
effect on wages, schooling, teen pregnancies and other socioeconomic outcomes. (Cunha
and Heckman 2009) However, early life skill formation is critical because numerous studies
in economics and human development have documented that cognitive and noncognitive
skills are produced in the early years of childhood. (Cunha and Heckman 2007, Cunha et



                                                5
al. 2010, Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua 2006, Christopher Auld and Sidhu 2005, Carneiro,
Heckman and Masterov 2005)
      Existing research shows that the technology of skill formation is both self-productive2 and
complementary3 , as skills beget skills in a complementary and dynamic way. (Cunha and
Heckman 2007) However, complementarity and self-productivity implies no equity-efficiency
trade-off for early investments, (Cunha and Heckman 2007) and that returns to later child-
hood investment are low. If a child does not receive the appropriate stimulation during early
childhood, it might be very difficult to later develop functions associated with improved
socioeconomic outcomes.


2.3       Nutrition and Early Skills Formation

The fetal, neonatal and postnatal period is a time of rapid brain development (neuro-
plasticity), and of critical acquisition of cognitive development and interpersonal skills.
(Kochanska, Coy and Murray 2001, Bouchard-Mercier, Paradis, Rudkowska, Lemieux, Cou-
ture and Vohl 2013) Evidence that nutrition is a direct biological and mediating factor in
brain growth and development is abundant in the scientific literature. A range of in vitro
human and animal models have been used to characterize the mechanistic linkages between
nutritional deficiencies, and structural or functional alterations in neurodevelopment and
impact on behavior. (Georgieff 2007) More recently, the epigenetic effects of nutrients are
documented in the emergent genetics literature.
      Extensive epidemiological, economics and health sciences researchers have explored the
role of nutrition in early childhood and the relationship to health outcomes in adulthood.
Given the fundamental role of nutrients in supporting all aspects of structural and func-
tional brain development, food assistance programs provide essential nutrients that must be
introduced by diet because they cannot be synthesized by the organism. Lack of nutrition
  2
      Self-productivity implies that the formation of skills has a higher return if baseline skills are higher.
  3
      Complementarity implies that early investment facilitates the productivity of later investment


                                                         6
has a negative influence on all aspects of development and can lead to adaptive physiological
responses that impair development with long-term consequences. (Bhutta 2008)
   With a combined spending of $82.85 billion per year, (USDA 2017b, USDA 2017a) WIC
and SNAP are the two fundamental safety net programs funded by the U.S. federal govern-
ment. As an entitlement program, SNAP is available to all income-eligible families and was
rolled out between 1962 and 1975, providing low-income families with vouchers that can be
used at grocery stores to purchase food. WIC aims to increase nutritional well-being among
low-income pregnant and postpartum women, infants and young children. Established in
1972, the program offers three types free-of-charge benefits to participants: a supplemental
food package, nutrition education, and referrals to health care and other services. These
packages include combinations of the following foods: iron-fortified infant formula, iron-
fortified infant and adult cereal, vitamin C-rich fruit juice and/or vegetable juice, eggs, milk,
cheese, peanut butter and/or dried beans or peas, tuna and carrots. Special infant formulas
and certain medical foods could also be provided by the WIC food package when prescribed
by a physician or health professional for a specific medical condition. Existing research links
participation in SNAP or WIC to health outcomes. The literature has focused on critical
birth outcomes, such as low birth weight, preterm delivery and infant mortality. (Hoynes et
al. 2011, Bitler and Currie 2005, Hoynes et al. 2016, Bitler, Currie and Scholz 2003)
   Much of the research on WIC’s effect on participants’ health faces a number of method-
ological challenges, in addition to issues of selection bias. Many outcomes develop over a
long period and require controlling for the complex interplay of diet and environment. Fur-
thermore, economic theory suggests that relationships between federal and local programs,
and associated eligibility criteria would induce individuals to optimize decisions related to
participation in different programs. For example, a majority of WIC participants also use
other assistance programs, such as Medicaid and SNAP. Moreover, the impact of local food
programs on health or developmental outcomes is largely unknown. This requires identifying



                                               7
whether the observed effect is due to WIC, SNAP, or to another program.


2.4    Home Visitation Programs and Early Skills Formation

Home visitation programs have been administered by the Tennessee Department of Health
since 1979. Approximately 3,700 families have received services from one of the evidence-
based, research-based or “promising approach” home visiting programs during the period of
July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014. Each of the programs has different enrollment crite-
ria and models of service delivery, which results in different outcomes for participants. All
programs support families with young children by frequently visiting them in their home
(weekly, bi-weekly or monthly) over a substantial length of time (1-5 years). Impacts found
include improved immunization status of children, decreased child abuse and neglect, in-
creased breastfeeding initiation, decreased smoking by mothers, increased screening of child
development, and delayed subsequent pregnancies by mothers receiving services. (TDH 2014)



3     Data

For this study, we use data from the Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development
and Learning in Early Childhood study (CANDLE). CANDLE is a prospective longitudinal
study of early cognitive development that extends from the second trimester of pregnancy
until the child reaches four years of age. (Sontag-Padilla, Burns, Shih, Martin, Tylavsky
and Chandra 2016) The main goal of the CANDLE study was to investigate the separate
and combined effects of a mother’s prenatal experiences, a child’s home environment and
experiences, exposure to potentially harmful toxins, and genetic makeup on the child’s brain
development from birth to three years of age. We describe the features of CANDLE and
provide the CANDLE data collection timeline in Appendix A.
    Table 1 provides an overview of our data. In the full sample, 62% of the mothers were



                                             8
African American, 48% of mothers were on Medicaid (TennCare) insurance, 47% with annual
reported income less than $24,999, 47% married, 9% reported tobacco use and 49% had a
high school diploma. Fifty percent of mothers reported participation in WIC and 44%
participation in SNAP; however, uptake in WIC declined over time much more than in
SNAP. In particular, second home visit participation in SNAP was virtually unchanged while
only 28% of women participated in WIC. Very few mothers reported uptake in local food
assistance programs during pregnancy (around 1%); however, enrollment in home visitation
programs was reported by 6% during pregnancy. The cohort had an average Apgar score of
9 at 5 minutes, and an average gestational age of 39 weeks. Consistent with findings from
previous literature, children born to mothers enrolled in federal assistance programs were
more likely to be low birth weight, to have low Apgar scores small for date. (Hoynes et
al. 2016, Hoynes et al. 2011) Consistent with Currie and Rajani’s (2015) observations, we
find that mothers of WIC infants were younger, less likely to be married, much less educated,
and more likely to smoke. They also were more likely to have complications of labor and
delivery as well as more likely to be on Medicaid.


3.1    Outcome Data

Evaluation of neurodevelopmental dysfunction or delay is a central aspect of developmental
psychology. The literature on standardized, developmental screening measures and associ-
ated instruments, particularly in the care of at-risk populations, is vast. (Johnson, Gliga,
Jones and Charman 2015, Woods, Rieger, Wocadlo and Gordon 2014, Visser, Ruiter, Van der
Meulen, Ruijssenaars and Timmerman 2013) Overall, the field of developmental psychology
and clinical pediatrics require that these instruments should have good concurrent and pre-
dictive properties and be readily employed in clinical settings or large studies where highly
detailed assessment is not feasible.
   We chose the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, which is a standard measure for an-


                                             9
alyzing short- to medium-term outcomes of babies and is commonly used within the field of
developmental science for children ages birth to 42 months. (Sattler 2008). BSID-III was de-
signed to identify possible developmental delay in infants, inform health professionals about
areas of strength or weakness when planning an intervention, and monitor the progression of
the child’s development. (Albers and Grieve 2007) It is based on assumptions of a model of
general intelligence that assumes that the more rapid attainment of such milestones reflects
higher intellectual ability. (Colombo 1993)
   The BSID-III consists of five scales (cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional, and
adaptive behavior) that assess areas of development for children from birth to three years of
age. The CANDLE study used only the cognitive and language scales. The cognitive scale
consists of 91 items. The language scale contains 97 items from the receptive (49 items)
and expressive communication (48 items) subtests that are designed to provide information
about a child’s ability to understand and respond to verbal stimuli, to name pictures and
objects, and to communicate with others. (Albers and Grieve 2007)
   To assess children’s cognitive outcomes at year one and year two, we use the Bayley-III.
(Bayley 2006) The Bayley-III includes items psychometrically selected from the more com-
prehensive BSID. (Bayley 2006) Internal consistency and test–retest reliability coefficients of
the Bayley-III for infants’ cognitive, receptive communication and expressive communication
subtests are high to very high, (Nunnally 1994) ranging from 0.76 to 0.93. (Bayley 2006)
The validity of the Bayley-III, examined by determining its classification accuracy with the
BSID-III scaled scores, showed correlations between the Bayley-III cognitive, receptive com-
munication and expressive communication subtests and the BSID-III comprehensive scales
of 0.93, 0.95 and 0.95, respectively. (Bayley 2006)
   Although the Bayley-III has five subtests, we selected the cognitive (nonverbal), recep-
tive communication and expressive communication subtests as phenotypic outcomes in this
study. (Bayley 2006) We chose these subtests because of their content similarity with other



                                              10
measures of cognitive development used later in childhood. Subtest scores are used to deter-
mine whether the child’s scoring is in the lowest risk or competent category, the emerging
risk category, or the at-risk category. At 1 year of age, the Bayley-III cognitive items focus
primarily on short-term visual memory, functional play and nonverbal problem-solving. Re-
ceptive communication items include pointing to common objects or pictures of actions in
a picture book, as well as responding to commands, while expressive communication items
quantify emitted sound and sound combinations at 1 year of age.
    A rigorous training was established to maintain Bayley-III reliability. After graduate
coursework in preschool assessment and child development, the cognitive examiners attended
didactic instruction on the Bayley-III. Inter-rater reliability attained through direct obser-
vation of test administration and scoring yielded reliability coefficients equal to or greater
than 0.90 on all subtests. A summary of cognitive, receptive communication and expressive
communication tests for each year can be found in Table 2.
    We provide a brief overview of the types of data used in our analysis to capture relevant
information about a mother’s and child’s psychosocial measures in Appendix B.



4     Conceptual Framework and Empirical Strategy

Consistent with models of skill formation, we model multiple dimensions of child skills (cog-
nitive, noncognitive) over a discrete and finite period. The production of cognitive and
noncognitive skills acquisition is a cumulative process, which means that past and current
inputs are combined with a child’s endowment (genetic) to produce a specific type of skills.
    We use a cumulative specification of skills formation with an endowment which is assumed
orthogonal to omitted inputs. (Todd and Wolpin 2007) Let Tija be the Bayley-III test score
measure of child i residing in household j at age a. Consistent with the existing literature,
we assume that the production of Tija is approximately linear in participation in WIC, as
indicated by Dia ,other explanatory variables Xija , and contains an unobserved endowment

                                             11
µ0ij with input effects being time-invariant. In particular,

                                                       a−1
                                                       X
                           Tija = Dia α +   µ0ij   +         Xija−k βk + εija               (1)
                                                       k=0


where εija is the stochastic error term that includes the effect of any omitted inputs and
measurement error.
   Our data contain repeated observations on cognitive and noncognitive outcomes and on
inputs for a given child at different ages. Because of this, we are able to calculate a first
difference in the test score, which structurally becomes

                                        a−2
                                        X
                     ∆Tija = ∆Dia α +         ∆Xija−k βk + Xij1 βa−1 + ∆εija                (2)
                                        k=0


As a result of differencing, any time-invariant input is eliminated from our model to be
estimated, including child i’s unobserved skill endowment.
   Previous studies have found that mothers who receive WIC during pregnancy tend to
be less educated, more likely to be of a minority race, less likely to be married and more
likely to be teen mothers. (Bitler and Currie 2005, Knudsen 2004). The subset of these ma-
ternal characteristics which are time-invariant are also eliminated by differencing. However,
time-varying maternal characteristics which affect participation in WIC or childhood skills
development must be included in (3) to ensure consistent estimates.
   To control for selection effects regarding program participation we use objective eligibility
requirements for WIC, SNAP and home visiting programs and previously unavailable mea-
sures that might influence the decision to participate in these programs. For WIC and SNAP
we observe both income and family size; additionally we observed whether the mother was
on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TennCare Medicaid, which automatically
qualifies the mother to receive WIC benefits. Shelby County home visitation programs serve
first-time mothers, teen mothers and low-income mothers, and participation is voluntary.


                                                   12
The decision to participate might also be driven by non-objective eligibility criteria. For
example, one can argue that a more knowledgeable, caring, or loving mother is more likely
to participate in these programs. Also, fetal or child health is another factor that might drive
the decision to seek help, or be referred to participate in these programs. We thus control
for possible selection effects using the following time-varying covariates: maternal personal-
ity measures (IQ measures, motivation measures, emotional health), maternal knowledge of
child development, child’s health status, measures on maternal-child contact and bonding,
as well as measures on home and neighborhood environments and others.
   Our basic model contains the following time-varying Xit covariates: child characteristics
(weight, developmental concerns, hospitalizations), maternal and household characteristics
(employment status, presence of a romantic partner, marital status, knowledge of infant
development, participation in SNAP program, participation in home visitation program),
child’s environment (quality of neighborhood index, crime index). We added a richer time-
varying covariate set in robustness checks. We estimate our specifications over the full
sample and each of the following subsamples: Medicaid participants, income-eligible mothers,
mothers who reported WIC uptake during pregnancy and African-American mothers.


4.1    Selection

CANDLE participants, when asked about their participation status in WIC, SNAP, and
home visitation programs, can report one of four possibilities: The mother participated in
both years, the mother did not participate in either year, the mother participated in year 1
but not year 2, or the mother participated in year 2 but not year 1. Prior to more formal tests
for selection, we present disaggregated summary statistics for maternal characteristics by
program particiaptioin status in Tables 3 and 4. We report first year maternal characteristics
disaggregated by participation status in Table 3, and second year maternal characteristics
in Table 4. Columns 2-5 in both tables disaggregate by WIC participation status, columns


                                              13
6-9 disaggregate by SNAP participation status, and columns 10-13 disaggregate by home
participation program status.
        Our specification can identify the coefficient of interest from equation (2), α, the effect of
changing participation in WIC, SNAP, or the home visitation program on skills formation,
only for mothers who change participation status, or switchers. Because of this, we analyze
only participants recorded in the final two columns of each group in Tables 3 and 4, mothers
who participate in year 1 but not in year 2, and mothers who participate in year 2 but not in
year 1. Our estimates of α consistently measure the benefits of program participation to the
extent that mothers who participate in both years, and one year but not the other, are similar.
To more formally assess the extent to which selection may be present, we present in Table
5 estimates of whether first year participation (but not second year) is a function of various
first period maternal statistical controls. In Table 6, we estimate whether participation in
the second year (but not the first) is a function of second year maternal characteristics. In
both Table 5 and 6, the only estimated coefficient that was significant above a marginal level
was the effect of income on participation in SNAP. Income has a negative effect significant
at the 5% level. Since the SNAP program is designed to supplement low income households,
this finding is not surprising. Across all other covariates, estimated coefficients are at most
marginally significant. We conclude that the two types of switchers are largely comparable.

5         Results

To illustrate the extent of selection problems into nutrition supplement and home visitation
programs, we estimate BSID-III scores from our data in the first and second years as a
    4
    We ran additional selection regressions not reported in which selection type was estimated as a function
of the following child-based covariates: sex, Nursing Child Assessment Parent-Child Interaction Teaching
Scale, evaluation by any health provider for any reason, illness not requiring a visit to a MD, Emotional
Stability Score, Child Abuse Potential Inventory Loneliness Total Score, Behavior Problems Total Score, and
Child Abuse Potential Inventory Happiness Total Score. We were unable to find any significant correlations.

function of participation in WIC, SNAP, and the home visitation program. The estimated
coefficients are presented in Table 7. Specifications (1) and (4) are simple OLS regressions
without any additional explanatory variables beyond the three shown. Specifications (2) and
(5) include participation in Medicaid and a variety of demographic variables. Specifications
(3) and (6) add a variety of control variables which include knowledge of infant development
and a variety of psychological and behavioral health outcomes. Coefficients which estimate
the effect of WIC, SNAP, and home visitation programs on standardized BSID-III measures
of aggregate development, receptive communication, cognitive skills, and expressive commu-
nication are all negative if significant at any level. Coefficient magnitudes are as high as
-0.493, indicating that the second year aggregate development scores of WIC participants
are 0.493 standard deviations less than that of non-participants. These estimates should not
be viewed as an estimate of the effect of program participation, as it does not correct for the
unobserved initial skills endowment, µ0ij from equation (1).
   To correct for the initial skills endowment, we estimate the change in skills test scores as
specified in equation (2). Estimated coefficients are in Table 8. We find that participation in
WIC, SNAP and home visitation programs has a positive and significant effect on standard-
ized BSID-III scores measuring aggregate development, receptive communication, cognitive
skills, and expressive communication. This effect persists when estimating the effects of these
programs jointly, and with both sets of additional control variables. We find that participa-
tion in WIC most reliably affects BSID-III receptive communication across all specifications.
Magnitudes range from 0.209 to 0.346 standard deviations, all significant at the 1% level.
The effect of SNAP participation is smaller in magnitude than for WIC, but has a positive
and highly significant effect on all four measured categories, all at the 1% level. Interestingly,
we found statistically significant effects of neighborhood quality on all BSID-III scores, ma-
ternal knowledge of infant development (on receptive and expressive communication scores),
developmental concerns and hospitalizations (on expressive communication scores only).



                                               15
    We next repeat our Specification (6) of Table 8 which uses the most comprehensive set
of controls, and iteratively add additional control variables. Table 9 presents the estimated
marginal effect of participation in WIC on the indicated skills measurement as additional
control variables are added. From Table 8, Specification (6), Panel A, The effect of partic-
ipation in WIC on aggregate development scores is 0.168 and significant at the 10% level.
In the first row of the first column of Table 9, as Parent-Child Interaction is controlled for,
the estimated effect of WIC on the change in aggregate development becomes larger, 0.20,
and increases in significance to the 5% level. As additional explanatory variables are added,
the magnitude and significance of the effect of WIC remains very stable. This pattern is re-
peated for cognitive scores, receptive communication, and expressive communication scores.
We interpret this as further evidence of the strength and robustness of the effect of WIC on
aggregate scores.

6.1    WIC, Food Choices, and Critical Nutrients

Having found robust evidence that exposure to WIC during early life improves children’s
skills formation, we further explore the potential mechanisms of WIC. As shown in section
2.2, critical nutrients shape biological formation of the skills formation process. We sought
to understand whether the WIC program increases the intake of foods rich in animal protein
and critical nutrients for fetal and early childhood development. To achieve this, we plot
kernel distributions, run median and Mann-Whitney tests for equality of means as well
as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for equality of distributions between WIC and non-WIC
participants for the following foods and nutrients: beef, pork, lamb, lean meat, eggs, fish
seafood high in Omega-3, fish seafood low in omega-3, folic acid (mg), iron (mg), vitamin
B-12(mg) and vitamin B-6(mg). In each of the plots, the distribution of nutrient intake for


                                              16
WIC participants appears to right dominate the distribution of non-participants. Likewise,
the median and Mann-Whitney tests reject the null hypothesis that the mean foods and
nutrients between WIC and non-WIC participants are equal, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test rejects the null hypothesis of common distribution of foods and nutrients for WIC and
non-WIC participants (Table 10). We conclude there is significant evidence that the intake
of foods rich in animal protein and critical nutrients is higher among WIC participating
mothers.



7     Conclusions

In this paper, we estimate the effect of mothers’ participation in WIC, SNAP and home
visitation programs on early childhood skills development as measured by the BSID-III.
We are able to identify the effect of these programs on neurodevelopmental outcomes and
credibly control for selection effects related to program participation through the use of time-
varying maternal and child characteristics. We find that maternal participation in WIC in
early childhood has a direct effect on language development, the effect of SNAP and home
visitation program are much smaller in magnitude. Our results are robust to the inclusion
of a rich set of possible time-varying confounding factors. Overall, our results suggest that
WIC and home visitation programs improve BSID-III scores and that such programs have
the ability to decrease gaps in child ability across families of different socioeconomic statuses.
    An important limitation of this paper is that we have no way to assess the generalizability
of our findings beyond our studied population of the children of Memphis, TN. An additional
limitation is that the statistical methods we use are second-best methods which may not fully
control for selection effects. This is true of all comparable studies, as the ideal methodology,
a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), is unlikely to ever be implemented due to
pragmatic considerations and concerns.

A      CANDLE

The CANDLE study was funded by the Urban Child Institute (UCI) with the following
specific research aims:

    • Determine whether nutrition factors (prenatal and infant diet) improve cognitive func-
      tion during the first years of life.

    • Estimate the effect that in utero exposure to environmental toxins can have on birth
      outcomes and neurocognitive development in a child’s first three years of life.

    • Explore psychosocial phenomena and patterns of mothers and children and assess the
      effects that intra- and interpersonal factors and social development can have on cogni-
      tive development in children over time.

    • Identify the genetic variants that contribute to mothers’ and children’s responses to
      nutrient intake and the physical and psychosocial environment that consequently con-
      tributes to birth weight and neurocognitive development.

    Roughly 1,500 pregnant women were enrolled throughout the duration of the study. There
were eight in-person data-collection points per family (two prenatal clinic visits, one hospital
visit at delivery, three clinic visits, and two home visits) and nine phone-based assessments
that occurred every 3 months, starting when the child in the study was 3 months old. Data
collection began during the second trimester and continued until the child’s third birthday.
CANDLE recruited 1,503 healthy pregnant women between 16.0 and 28.0 weeks of gestation,
who had normal singleton fetal pregnancies and lived in Shelby County, TN. (Sontag-Padilla
et al. 2016)
    The design of and results from the UCI CANDLE study provide an opportunity for
researchers to examine early drivers and markers of healthy early childhood development
and the influences of genetics, biology, family and community environment within a large


                                              37
racially and economically diverse sample. The multiple data points and multiple types of
data allow researchers to examine both objective (e.g., bio specimen) and self-reported (e.g.,
survey) measures.
       The study population includes women, recruited during their second trimesters of preg-
nancy, and the children who were born at the birth visit. The UCI CANDLE study consid-
ered a woman eligible for participation if she met all the following criteria:

    • A resident of Shelby County, TN

    • Pregnant between 16 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation

    • Between 16 and 40 years of age

    • Can speak and understand English

    • A low-risk5 , singleton pregnancy

    • Planned to deliver at one of the five participating health care settings in Shelby County,
         TN6

       Demographically, the CANDLE cohort closely resembles the Shelby County, TN census
tract, as shown in Table 1. The percentage of the population which is African-American
and Caucasian closely match, as does educational attainment. The income of CANDLE
participants appears somewhat lower than the Shelby County census tract, as might be
expected given the younger age of CANDLE participants relative to the population.

   5
      The UCI defined a pregnancy as low risk if it lacked all of the following: chronic hypertension requiring
therapy or vascular disease requiring therapy; maternal red-cell alloimmunization except Rhesus (Rh) factor;
hemoglobinopathy, including sickle-cell trait and severe iron-deficiency anemia (hemoglobin less than 9);
insulin-dependent diabetes; appreciable renal or cardiopulmonary disease; prolapsed or ruptured membranes;
oligohydramnios; complete placenta previa; endocrine disease; collagen disease (e.g., lupus erythematosus
or scleroderma); active or chronic hepatitis; renal disease; pulmonary or heart disease requiring therapeutic
medication or limitation of physical activity; major fetal anomaly (e.g., aneuploidy, major organ-system
defect); and human immunodeficiency virus.

B      Psychosocial Measures

We provide a brief overview of on the types of data used in the analysis to capture relevant
information about a mother’s and child’s psychosocial measures.
    Knowledge of Infant Development Inventory.
    The KIDI assesses a person’s familiarity with infant norms and milestones related to
infant development up to 24 months, developmental principles and processes, parenting
practices and child-rearing strategies, and health care and safety guidelines and practices
(MacPhee 1981). The KIDI does not contain subscales but can be grouped into four nonex-
clusive categories (derived from sampling of the literature on infancy) to obtain more specific
information on a person’s (1) knowledge on infant norms and milestones, (2) principles of
infant development, (3) parenting and (4) health and safety (Veddovi, Kenny, Gibson, Bowen
and Starte 2001).
    The KIDI is a 58-item inventory. Each item describes what a typical infant might be
like or what could affect the infant’s growth and behavior. The participant is asked to
rate her degree of agreement (agree, disagree, or not sure) on items that describe typical
infant behavior, what could affect infant growth or behavior, and the typical age at which
infants engage in a particular behavior. Three summary scores are calculated: (1) attempted
score = percentage of items attempted (i.e. not answered with “not sure”) as a measure of
confidence; (2) accuracy score = percentage correct of the attempted answers; and (3) total
correct score = percentage correct of all the KIDI items. Possible scores range from 0 to
100.
    Household Questionnaire
    CANDLE investigators created the Household Questionnaire to assess the number and
type of people living with the CANDLE participant and other information about the CAN-
DLE participant’s romantic partner and daily life. The Household Questionnaire contains
items about the number and type of individuals in the household (and relationship to the


                                              43
participant or primary caregiver). In addition, the questionnaire includes questions about
the father of the CANDLE child, the CANDLE participant’s romantic partner, attendance
at religious services, employment, and the CANDLE participant’s neighborhood.
   Child Abuse Potential Inventory
   The CAPI is used to determine a child’s risk of being physically abused (Milner and
Crouch 2012). The CAPI is a screening tool consisting of 160 statements with which the
respondent can agree or disagree. The CAPI contains a 77-item physical abuse scale, six
domains of abuse (distress, rigidity, unhappiness, problems with child and self, problems
with family, and problems from others), and three validity scales (lie, random response, and
inconsistency) that form three response-distortion indexes (faking–good, faking–bad, and
random responses) (Milner and Crouch 2012). The validity scales are used to determine
whether respondents might be exaggerating or distorting their answers. The CAPI also
contains two special scales: ego strength and loneliness. The sums of responses indicative
of abuse, distress, rigidity, unhappiness, problems with family, problems with child and
self, and problems with others are calculated for each scale, with some responses weighted
more heavily than others, as indicated in the CAPI scoring manual (Milner 1986). Scales
indicative of ego strength and loneliness are also calculated. Binary cutoff scores indicate
whether someone has elevated potential for each of the domains.
   Parent-Child Interaction Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training Teaching Scales
   The NCAST PCI Teaching Scales assess how children who might be biologically or en-
vironmentally at risk for developmental problems (e.g., low intelligence quotient, language,
or attention problems) interact with their parents (Pridham, Lutz, Anderson, Riesch and
Becker 2010). Barnard et al. developed the NCAST observational system for children up to
3 years of age, based on an ecological model (Barnard, Eyres, Lobo and Snyder 1983).
   The NCAST PCI Teaching Scales, currently referred to as NCAST PCI, is a 73-item
yes/no observational measure. The NCAST PCI contains four parent or caregiver behavior



                                            44
subscales (sensitivity to cues, response to child’s distress, social–emotional growth foster-
ing, and cognitive growth fostering) and two child-specific subscales (clarity of cues and
responsiveness to parent) (Sumner and Spietz 1996). Additionally, the NCAST PCI assesses
potential disengagement cues (e.g., back arching, choking, coughing, crawling away), length
of teaching time, name of task, setting, presence of others, child’s birth order, and child’s
state at beginning of teaching. Total scores are obtained for the mother alone, child alone,
and mother and child combined. Subscales for each of the domains and separate contingency
scores (items representing responsiveness of interactions) are also calculated. Subscale, con-
tingency scales, and total scores are the sum of the number of items with “yes” responses
(Horodynski and Gibbons 2004). The NCAST PCI has established clinically relevant cutoff
scores that identify “worrisome” cases. The NCAST database was used to determine the
10th-percentile score distribution obtained by healthy full-term infants and their mothers.
Scores higher than the 10th percentile are considered to fall within the normal range. Scores
lower than the 10th percentile suggest increased risk for poor mother-child interaction, and
dyads scoring below this level could be at risk for a variety of poor outcomes (Sumner and
Spietz 1996).
   Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment
   BITSEA was designed to screen infants or toddlers at risk for or currently experiencing
social-emotional or behavioral problems (Briggs-Gowan, Carter, Irwin, Wachtel and Cicchetti
2004, Karabekiroglu, Briggs-Gowan, Carter, Rodopman-Arman and Akbas 2010).
   The 42-item BITSEA is designed to assess children ages 12 months to 36 months. For
each of the 42 items, the mother provides a response that best describes her infant’s or tod-
dler’s behavior in the last month. BITSEA consists of two multi-item scales: the problem
total scale (31 items) and the competence total scale (11 items). The problem total scale con-
sists of three subscales: externalizing problems (six items identifying overactivity, aggression
and defiance), internalizing problems (eight items identifying anxiety and depression), and



                                              45
dysregulation (eight items identifying negative emotionality and eating and sleeping prob-
lems). The competence scale assesses social-emotional abilities such as empathy, prosocial
behaviors and compliance (Briggs-Gowan and Carter 2008).
