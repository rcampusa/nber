                       Interpreting Ex—Dividend Evidence:
                    The Citizens Utilities Case Reconsidered

                                    ABS TRACT


       Numerousempirical studies have attempted to measure the effect of changes
 in dividend policy on corporate equity values. One of the most popular study
 methodologies has 'been an examination of share price changes around ex—dividend
 days. Comparing the movement in a stock's price with its nominal dividend
 payment leads to estimates of the stock market's relative valuation of dividends
 and capital gains. Ex_day price studies are often interpreted as showing that
investors recognize their tax liabilities and therefore discount their dividend
income. These studies predict that finns which reduce their payout ratio should
rise in value, and buttress the view that an increase in dividend taxes would
reduce the value of the stock market.
       This study disputes these conclusions by presenting a "counterexample" which
suggests that ex—dividend day studies provide limited insight into the effects of
dividend taxes, or dividend policy, on corporate valuation. I analyze a firm
with   two different classes of common stock: one class pays taxable cash
dividends, while the other pays untaxed stock dividends. On ex—dividend days,
the taxable—dividend shares experience a price decline equal to about seventy—
five percent of their dividend payment, while the untaxed stock distribution
shares fall by the full value of their dividends. However, the prices of the two
classes of equity do not reflect this apparent market preference for non—taxable
distributions. The average price of taxable—dividend shares is approximately
equal to that of the untaxed dividend shares, indicating that the market
considers the two shares as equivalent.
       These findings are important for several reasons. First, they cast doubt on
earlier conclusions, based on ex—dividend day studies, about how a change in
dividend taxes or payout policy would affect the market value of equity capital.
Second, the results may provide new insights which help to explain why firms pay
dividends.    They deny the view that investors hold dividend paying stocks only
because they are necessary for diversification, and may suggest that there is
some attribute of cash dividends which investors genuinely value.

     The question of how dividend policy affects a firm's market valuation is

central to financial economics. When investors are subject to taxes on both

dividends and capital gains, tax preferences may be an important determinant of a

firm's optimal payout policy. Numerous empirical investigations have attempted

to measure the effect of changes in payout policy on share values. any of these

studies have also tried to predict the effects of changes in personal dividend

taxes on stock market valuation. One of the strongest sources of evidence that

investors consider the tax consequences of their investments and value dividends

less than capital gains is the so—called "ex-dividend" literature. By comparing

changes in stock prices on ex—dividend days with the value of dividend payments,

these studies purport to measure the stock market's relative valuation of

dividend and capital gains income.

     The usual finding is that share prices decline by less than their dividend

payout. If these studies are in fact calculati.ng the marginal value of

dividends, then they suggest that firms could raise their share values by

reducing dividends. Alternatively, these investigations imply that high marginal

dividend tax rates depress the stock market, since investors value the after—tax

dividend stream associated with their investments.

     Ex—dividend studies have recently been subject to criticism on several

fronts.   Miller and Scholes (1982) argue that one of the principal explanations

for previous findings using monthly data, such as the CRSP tapes, involves the

coincidence of ex—dividend dates and dividend announcement dates. Since a

dividend announcement conveys information about a firm's liquidity and possibly

about future profits, it should raise share prices. If a month contains both an

announcement date and an ex—dividend date then there are two opposite—signed
                                                                                2

 forces affecting share prices: the information or"announcement" effect raises

 the share price, while the dividend payment reduces it. The net effect is that

we observe the share's one month price decline to be less than the value of its

dividend. However, this finding could be perfectly consistent with the share

price declining by the dividend's full value on the ex—day. Miller and Scholes

demonstrate that after controling for these announcement effects, share prices

seemed to decline by amounts much closer to their dividend payout.

     The adjustment for announcement effects, although crucial in monthly data,

cannot explain the findings of other ex—dividend studies employing daily data

which also show price changes to be smaller than dividend payments. These

findings pose an unresolved puzzle. Securities dealers, brokers, and untaxed

institutions could all earn arbitrage profits if share prices in fact declined by

less than the dividend. Miller and Scholes argue that the presence of this

arbitrage should prevent the share price change from deviating from dividend

value; the failure of this arbitrage is difficult to explain.

     There are other technical criticisms of ex—day studies. Black and Scholes

(1973) showed that much of the unusual return activity which has been discovered

on ex—days disappears as trading periods of more than one day are considered.

While the one-day return from holding a share on its ex—day seems abnormally

high, the twenty—day return associated with buying the share ten days before the

ex—date and selling ten days afterward may not be excessive. Litzenberger and

Ramaswamy (1979,1982) have pointed out the importance of distinguishing between

anticipated and unanticipated dividends in ex—day studies.
                                                                               3

      Although these criticisms of ex—dividend study methodology are important,

 they do not address the more central question of whether ex—day evidence is

 relevant to understanding the effects of dividend policy or dividend taxes.

This paper presents an empirical "counterexasnple" to show that ex—dividend

studies may not provide a reliable guide to the effect of dividend taxes on share

values. The investigation focuses on the share prices and ex—dividend day price

behavior of one firm, Citizens Utilities (Cu), which maintains two different

classes of common stock. Class A shares pay untaxed stock dividends twice each

year, while Class B shares receive taxable cash dividends four times per year.

The company charter requires the two classes of stock to distribute approximately

equal amounts of dividends each year.

     The paper begins with a test of the "tax effects" hypothesis, which predicts

that a share's ex—day price decline equals the after-tax value of its dividend

payment. If most investors are either indifferent between dividends and capital

gains, or prefer capital gains, then the price of the taxable-distribution shares

should fall by less than their dividend. The share price for Class A stock

should decline by the full value of the stock dividend. The ex—dividend day

evidence for Citizens Utilities is supportive of the tax effects hypothesis and

consistent with earlier ex—day results.

     The ex—day results predict that cash dividend shares should sell at a lower

price than stock—dividend shares. This is where the theory's predictions

unravel. As Long (1978) observed, when averaged over dividend cycles and

adjusted for differences in dividend payout, Class A and Class B shares sell for

almost the same price. While changes in share prices around ex-dates accord with

the "tax effects" hypothesis, the levels of the two share prices do not.
                                                                               4

 The stock distribution shares appear to earn a higher return on non ex-days than

 the cash dividend shares. While this finding is difficult to reconcile with

 standard theories of asset pricing, it does suggest that ex—dividend studies may

provide unreliable answers to basic questions about dividends and taxes. It also

suggests that future dividend research should analyze the return on stocks with

different payout rates during months when they do not pay dividends.

     To investigate the Citizens Utilities case, I proceed in five stages. The

paper's first section summarizes models of portfolio equilibrium in the

presence of taxes which give rise to the tax-effects hypothesis. I try to relate

these models to ex-day share price changes. The second section describes the two

classes of Citizens Utilities equity, their tax treatment and their

prices. Empirical evidence concerning the ex—dividend day behavior of CU shares

is presented in the third section, as are several points of econometric

methodology. The fourth section analyzes the trading volume around ex-dividend

days to learn whether any unusual activity, indicative of arbitrage, takes place.

In the fifth section I attempt to pinpoint the paradox of the Citizens Utilities

case and explore several explanations for the divergence between price levels and

ex—day price movements. There is a brief conclusion.



I.   Modelling Ex-Dividend Day Price Changes

     The after-tax capital asset pricing model1 provides a useful starting

point for the analysis of share price movements. An investor, say investor h, is


1Brennan (1970) is the principle architect of this model. Gordon and Bradford
(1980) and Auerbach (1981) have recently applied it to the study of ex-day share
price movements.

The rarket's preference for dividends, however, is defined by

Individual investor's tax preferences are weighted .                       their   share of total

wealth, and rh, their reciprocal risk preference, in computing the market

dividend preference.

        Several important insights follow from the after-tax CAPM. First, provided

there are no short selling restrictions, the ex—dividend day price coefficients

on all firms should be the same.1            That is


            or.

            od.
               1


As both Auerbach (1981) and Gordon-Bradford (1980) note, it is only the presence

of short—selling restrictions or other constraints which produces "clienteles"

across firms. Second, there is no presumption that 0 < a < 1, which is the

assumption of most ex—dividend studies. For some institutional investors,                            1,

and for corporations, which are taxed less heavily on dividends than on capital

gains,       > 1. Since corporations and institutions are both wealthy (large                 si')


and not very risk averse (large 1h), their weight in determining a is large and

in equilibrium, a dollar of dividend income might be valued more than a dollar of

capital gains. Finally, note that if everyone faces the same tax rates, then


1 Hess (1982) has tested and decisively rejected this hypothesis.
                                                                                           7

In   general, however, it is inappropriate to think of a as the ratio of any
"marginal      investor's" tax rates; such a marginal investor need not eiist.

        The theory which led to equation (1.3) is appropriate for analyzing a share

which pays taxable dividends, such as CU Series B equity. However, if a firm

pays stock dividends, then the appropriate capital—market line becomes

unity.

     The finding that most ex—day coefficients are            less   than one leads to an

"arbitrage puzzle" of sorts. While one view holds that differing a's across

firms reflect differences in shareholder clienteles, another argues that such

variations cannot persist, due to the activities of arbitrageurs. I shall

consider each view in turn. Auerbacb (1981) has shown that when some investors

are constrained, the firm's ex—dividend coefficient, a1, i.s defined by

firm. The clientele debate essentially involves two questions. First, does the

set of capital market constraints imposed on investors result in different

clienteles for different firms? Second, are these clienteles in each firm stable

over time, or does the firm's shareholder population change, perhaps around the

ex—date?

     The "arbitraguer" view holds that clienteles are unstable over time. Many

institutions, and a small group of individuals,1 face an effective marginal

dividend tax rate of zero. They could earn tax arbitrage profits by trading

shares around ex—dividend days. If there were no transactions costs, the untaxed

investors could purchase the share on the day before the ei-dividend day, receive


1Nontaxable corporate and institutional investors are discussed by Green (1980)
and Auerbach (1981). Miller and Scholes (1978) and Feenberg (1982) examine the
possibility that tax provisions for interest deductability result in some
personal shareholders facing a zero marginal tax rate on dividend income.

 the dividend tax—free, and then re—sell the shares. Share prices would decline

 by at least the full value of their dividends in order to eliminate the untaxed

 investors' arbitrage profit. Of course, this argument neglects the fact that if

 share prices did decline by the full value of dividend payments, high marginal

 tax bracket individuals could earn substantial profits by shorting the stock

 prior to the ex—day and closing the short position afterwards.

        To explain why this arbitrage does not occur, and why share prices fall by

 less than dividend payments, some resort to a transactions cost analysis. The

profits from the round—trip ex-day transaction might not cover the cost of

trading. Kalay (1978) estimated the effective commission rate for a large round—

trip transaction in a stock costing $40 per share to be about 0.2% of the share

price. The deviation between a share's ex-day price movement and its dividend

payment is bounded by this transaction cost:1

where     is the marginal transaction cost as a fraction of share's price.

This may be rewritten to bound the price change-to—dividend ratio:

where ô is the opportunity cost term. The deviation between the ex—dividend day


1This bound is different from Kalay's, because it incorporates the risk adjusted
opportunity cost of the transaction. This is the right hand side of expression
(1.11). For plausible values, annual     = .20 and    = .10,     .6, this
"opportunity cost" is .06 percent per day.

price change and —1 cannot exceed the transactions cost plus the opportunity cost

divided by the payout ratio.   Citizens   Utilities (Class B) quarterly dividends

are equal to approximately two and one half percent of share value. When this

information is combined with Kalay's transactions cost data, the lower bound on

the ratio of the price change to the dividend payout is about 0.90.

     If the foregoing analysis correctly described the transactions costs facing

investors with low marginal dividend tax rates, then they should be able to earn

arbitrage profits. One explanation for the absence of this arbitrage is that

holding the shares exposes the arbitrageur to some extra risk for a brief period

around the ex—date. Even if most of this risk is diversifiable, achieving a

fully diversified position may entail still further transactions and brokerage

costs. Therefore the risk adjusted opportunity cost in (1.11) may be an

understatement, and total transactions costs to the arbitrager may greatly exceed

Kalay's estimate. This might imply a much lower bound on the range of admissable

security price changes. For a utility stock such as Citizens Utilities, however,

it is difficult to believe that the excess risk is very large.1

     The transactions costs bound may help to explain previous findings of

"clientele" effects. Auerbach (1981), Litzenberger and Raniaswamy (1982) and


1 Kalay's arguments also assume an infinitely elastic security supply. To reduce
transactions costs, however, investors must make large transactions.
Transactions which pay a commission rate of only 0.2 percent of the share price
would require a volume roughly equal to one and one third times CU's average
daily trading voluiie. If the CAPM with homogeneous expectations is replaced by
one with differing beliefs, then there may be a tradeoff between reducing
transactions costs with large trading volumes and inducing price changes,
especially in thin securities markets. This supply curve may explain why
observed ex—dividend day share price movements lie outside the transactions cost
bounds.

 others have found that                 tends to decrease (toward —1.0 and often to

 values such as —1.3) as the dividend payout ratio rises.' This is sometimes

 interpreted as showing that high payout stocks attract investor clienteles with

 low marginal tax rates. An alternative explanation focuses only on the lower

bound for price movements, since

an increase in the dividend payout ratio tightens the bound around -1.0.

Arbitrage is more profitable on firms which pay higher dividends, and this may

explain the observed "clientele".

     The central fact which must be reckoned with is that on the ex—day,

different shares experience price changes equal to different fractions of their

dividend. Numerous difficulties arise in the econometric implementation of the

ex—dividend models, and one approach is to attempt to explain the findings as

spurious. There has already been much debate over the measurement of expected

dividends the treatment of shares which trade infrequently, and the stability of

a across firms and across time. This debate will doubtless continue. In the

remaining sections of this paper, I hope to cast doubt on the value of this

debate. Even if we correctly measure the ex-day price effects, we may not learn

a great deal about how dividend policy affects firm valuation. First, however, I

must review the circumstances surrounding my "test firm", Citizens Utilities.


1 Poterba (1983) analyzes the ex—day price changes for these high-dividend payout
stocks and concludes that corporation tax preferences for dividends, and other
conventional explanations of ex—day coefficients less than -1, cannot explain
this phenomena.

II. Class A and Class B: The Citizens Utilities Story1

     Two classes of Citizens Utilities shares have been traded since 1956, when

the firm received an I.R.S. ruling allowing it to issue Class A common stock.

Class A shares receive regular stock dividends, which are not taxed upon receipt

but are subject to capital gains taxation when sold. Class B shareholders

receive quarterly cash dividends which are subject to the usual tax rules. When

the Class A shares were issued in 1956, existing shareholders were allowed to

choose which type of equity they wanted and to redeem their outstanding shares on

a one—for—one basis for either Class A or Class B shares.2

     Several important characteristics of the two classes of equity are described

below:

     (i) Shares of either class carry the same voting rights, and the same

priority in bankruptcy. In the event of a share split, they are split

simultaneously and in the same ratio.

    (ii) The corporate charter requires that "whenever a given cash dividend per

share is issued to Series B shares, a stock dividend per share of equal fair

value must be paid during the same calendar year to Series A shares" (Long, 1978,

p. 237).

   (iii) Except during the period between the declaration date of Series B

dividends and their ex—date, one share of Series A stock can be converted


1My discussion draws heavily on Long (1978). Readers who are interested in a
more detailed discussion should to consult his paper.
2when the two types of equity were offered, approximately three fourths of the
initial stock in the firm was returned for Class A (stock—dividend) shares. See
"Citizens Utilities Company", Harvard Business School Case #9-204—059 (1959) for
further discussion.
                                                                              13

 into one share of Series B stock. The option is not symmetric; Series B shares

 cannot be converted into Series A shares.1

     (iv) Citizens Utilities' dividend policy calls for paying only cash

 dividends to Series B shares, and only stock dividends to Series A shares. All

 Series A share dividends take the form of additional shares of Series A stock.

      Shortly after the letter ruling in the CU case, the IRS reversed its

position on the tax rules governing regular stock distributions. In a July 1956

 "proposed regulation", the IRS indicated that it would henceforth consider stock

dividends of the type issued by CU to be taxable as cash dividends. The IRS

denied all further requests from corporations attempting to establish two classes

of equity, making the Citizens Utilities case somewhat unique. In 1958, the IRS

indicated in a letter to Citizens Utilities that it would not rescind the

company's special tax status and even suggested that in the event of a

Congressional amendment to the 1954 Tax


1 The prohibition on exchanging shares between the declaration and ex—dates lies
 at the heart of Citizens Utilities Class A tax—exempt status. The IRS in 1956
 held that when the shareholder is permitted to elect to receive [a particular
 dividend in cash or stock .. .{that dividend] is taxed to him exactly as a cash
 dividend would be — as ordinary income on the receipt of shares". ("Citizens
 Utility Company", pp. 4—5). The 1955 Citizens Utilities Annual Report explains:
 "Prohibitions of conversion from Series A to Series B shares during the period
between dividend declaration and record dates proscribes shareholder election
during that interval in which election is significant. Conversion to JSeries B
during that period would enable the converting Series A shareholder to secure the
right to receive the cash dividend declared on the Series B. Obviously, if
shareholders convert Series A into Series B shares at times other than the
interval between dividend declaration and record dates — as they are freely able
to do, under the terms of our unique two—series common stock capitalization —
they obtain no rights to any individual dividend, since none has been declared.
The very absence in our charter of any absolute requirement that dividends on
either Series be in cash or stock, plus the banning of conversion from Series A
to Series B between dividend declaration and record dates, were decisive factors
in the issuance of our historic, favorable tax ruling by the Internal Revenue
Service in the first place."
                                                                               14

Code, there would probably be a "grandfather clause" protecting the Citizens

Utilities exemption. 1ben Congress finally implemented the IRS proposed

regulation as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, it specifically allod stock

distribution plans of the Citizens Utilities type to maintain their tax-exempt

status until December 31 , 1990.   This eliminated the uncertainty about the date

at which Series A shares would lose their tax-favored status.

     Two further aspects of the Citizens Utilities case deserve mention. First,

the dividends on the two classes of stock are paid at different times and

different frequencies. Class B shares receive quarterly cash dividends, while

Class A stock distributions are made only semi-annually. These asynchronous

dividend patterns give rise to movements in the relative price of Citizens

Utilities shares.   The relative price of Class A shares is highest just before a

stock distribution and lowest just before a Class B cash dividend payment.

     A more important point for later analysis is that the firm has not

distributed strictly equal dividends on Class A and Class B equity. Long (1978,

p. 240) reports that "in interpreting the 'equal fair value' requirement in the

charter amendment, the firm has very consistently declared the semi-annual Series

A stock dividends in amounts such that the market value of any given per share

stock dividend is about ten percent greater than the cash dividends per share on

Series B stock in the corresponding half year".

and Class B shares for the last decade. The average dividend payment on Class A

shares    was 1.12 times that on Class B shares.' The average relative price of

Class A shares, in terms of Class B shares, was 1.10. The stock market value of

Class A shares is therefore slightly less than would be       expected   if the shares

were priced in      proportion   to their dividend payments. There is    substantial
variation     in the   two share's relative prices over the investigation period.

Class   A share prices have averaged as much as sixteen percent greater than Class
B during a one year period, and the two have at other times been separated by
only a two percent differential. The relative price of Class A shares rose
through the mid-1970's, peaking in 1980.2
        Some explanation of the dividend payment differential can be found in          early

descriptions      of the Citizens Utilities dual capitalization plan:

              The size of the stock dividend, Mr. Rosenthal said, will be
              calculated by taking the market price of CU common shares on
              the day the dividend is declared; this price would be reduced
              by the estimated amount the shares would drop in value if all
              shareholders receiving dividends in stock turned around and
              sold them on the market. The depressed price is then divided
              into the size of the cash dividend, and the resulting figure
              is the fractional share of stock to be paid in place of cash.
              [Wall Street Journal, 5 January 1956, p. 15].

The notorious difficulty in predicting the amount by which share prices will

change in response to large trading volume makes challenging the company's

interpretation of "equal fair value" a delicate matter.



1 The value of Class A dividends was computed following Long (1978) as -4-
                                                                                  DEC'
where 8 =     fractional   share distribution per existing share and DEC is the share
price on the declaration date. If an investor owning N shares were to sell                    N
shares before the ex—date he would receive a stock dividend at rate 8 on holdings
of (1— --)N shares. His position after the ex-day is therefore (i-4i5)
(1 —   1-)N   =   N, so he retains the same number of shares as before.
2 I shall not speculate as to whether this reflects the gradual dissemination of
the information in John Long's 1978 paper.
                                                                              17

 The practice of marking—up the current spot price in declaring stock dividends is

 a common practice. It is designed to protect shareholders against sudden price

 movements, possibly caused by block trading.

      Moreover, it is clearly in the company's interest to pay higher dividends on

 Class A shares. If the price of A shares were to remain substantially below the

 price of B shares for an extended period, there would be pressure to convert A

 shares to B shares for an arbitrage profit. However, the conversion away from

 Class A would deny CU its pooi of retained earnings and subject it increased cash

 dividend demands. To avoid this conversion risk, the managers might attempt to

pay higher dividends on Class shares.'



III. The Ex-Dividend Behavior of CU Share Prices

III. A.   Standard Ex-Dividend Tests.

     The ex—dividend day price behavior of CU shares was investigated using daily

data on the closing prices of Series A and Series B shares for the period January

7, 1972 to October 5, 1982.   There were a total of 2,697 observations on closing

prices during this period.2 Class A shares declared 21 dividends, while Class B




1Most of the shares outstanding are Class A shares: 82.3%. This would give a
policy which explicitly reduced the value of Class B shares support from a
majority of the shareholders, but its illegality under the terms of the company
charter would probably make any explicit policy impossible.
2Almost all ex—day studies are plagued by non-availability of data on
transactions prices. By using closing prices, we run the risk of interpreting
for example, movements from one side to another of the 'bid-ask spread" as an ex—
day price change. However, as I show in the Appendix, these difficulties lead an
errors-in-variable problem which may be treated by using instrumental variables
estimators.
                                                                                                  18

shares went ex—dividend 43            times.          The larger nuber of er—dates for the cash
distribution shares       is due to their quarterly payout policy.

     To    begin my investigation,              I estimated simple equations of the type found      in
previous er—day studies:

             P-P                            D
(111.1)
                t—1
                          =
                                  ip        t—1
                                                  +
                                                      2Rt    +




where R1t is the one-day market return, measured by the one day change in the

value of the NYSE composite stock price index.1                    In this equation, 2 will

                 CU MKT                                     CU
estimate                      while         estimates a
            Var (RT)                    1



     Ex—dividend equations were estimated for both classes of CU shares, and are

reported in Table Il—A. Payment of a one dollar dividend on the stock—

distribution shares reduces their price by about ninety cents. By comparison,

the cash distribution share price seems to decline by oniy about seventy six

cents when a one dollar dividend is paid. This finding is consistent with the

predictions of the "tax effects" hypothesis, since the price change is smaller

for the taxable dividend payments than for the tax-free share distributions.

However, the difference is not very large.


1 Since there may be a nontrading problem in share prices, as outlined by Scholes
and Williams (1977), I have included both the current and the one—period lagged
value of the market return. While the findings with respect to ex-dividend
coefficients do not charge substantially when the lagged market return is
included, the coeffient on this variable is significantly different from zero and
I have therefore kept it in the specifications.
                                                                                     19

      The market return is included in ex—dividend day price equations such as

 (111.1) in order to measure the change in a share's price which is attributable

 to systematic market forces. A more accurate indicator of the systematic forces

affecting each class of Citizens Utilities shares is readily available, however:

it is the return on the other class of CU stock. To explain changes in the price

of Class A shares, therefore, I use a specification such as


             AA
             t       t—1   =
                                     DA
                                      t
                                            +
                                                      mkt +       B +

                                    t—1


where superscripts A or B refer to the different share classes and Rt is the
                                                                             B.

return on Class B shares, measured as the price change plus the dividend payout.

Once again I include lagged values of Rt and RB to treat non-trading effects.

Results of estimating these specifications are reported in Table Il—B, and are

only slightly different from the findings with specification (111.1). The

estimated ex—dividend coefficient for Class B shares rises to —.755, while that

for Class A falls to — .947.      The difference between these two coefficients is

barely significant at the 95% confidence level.

     There is a puzzle in these findings, however. The coefficient on the "other

return" variables,         of (111.2), is substantially less than one for both shares.

One explanation for this finding may be that share prices are measured with

error, inducing a classical errors—in-variables bias which forces the

coefficients closer to zero. I expected the returns on the two shares to be very

close to equal; after imposing this restriction, I obtained the following

estimates:

These findings suggest that Citizens Utilities shares behave in a fashion which

is consistent with the tax—effects hypothesis. Shareholders appear to value

taxable cash distributions less than they value tax—free stock distributions.1

      These findings provide evidence against Black and Scholes' (1973) claim that

one reason the market values dividends is because some types of return streams

could only be obtained by purchasing shares which pay dividends. Because of

their attractive diversification properties, investors might hold dividend

shares in spite of their payout policy. This cannot explain the demand for

Citizens Utilities Series B shares. Any individual who faced a higher tax rate

on dividend income than on capital gains could obtain the return stream

corresponding to Citizens Utilities without bearing the dividend tax liability.

The non—zero implicit marginal tax rate on cash dividends, however, may suggest


1 In their analysis of ex-day share price movements, Black and Scholes (1973)
found that while there were excess returns to shares on their ex—dividend day,
these returns disappeared if the holding period was extended to include several
days before and after the ex-date. When my equations were re-estimated for
holding periods of 20 and 40 days the ex—day coefficients were unstable and
sometimes reversed the pattern found on the ex-day.
                                                                                          23

 that some investors choose to hold the tax dis—favored shares to obtain the

benefit of steady dividend income.

       As a final test of the ex—dividend day behavior of CU shares, I attempted to

learn whether on the ex—days of Class A shares, the price of Class B shares

exhibited any unusual behavior. I examined this proposition by including the

dividend payments of both shares in the regressions explaining each share's price

movements. The results are reported in Table III. Except in one case, there

appears to be no systematic effect of one share's dividends on the other's price

movements. A large and statistically significant effect occurs when the price

behavior of Class A shares is being explained by the total return on Class B

                                                 DB
shares. The estimated coefficient on             Bt )   is   significantly negative, —.183.
                                                   1


However, this is not a finding that ex-dividend days for Class B shares affect

Class A share prices. Rather it reflects the earlier finding that in computing

the return on Class B shares, the market assigns a lower value to cash dividend

distributions than to capital gains. Thus, the finding just says that in

constructing a measure of Series B returns, the appropriate specification is

       BB      1
                   +   .8          •   Thus, the a for Class B shares is about .80.

   Notes:     Dividend value for stock distributions was computed using the procedure outlined
              Long (1978).  Equations were estimated using the instrumental variables procedure
              outlined in the appendix. Data provided courtesty of Data Resources, Inc.
                                                                                25

    In a similar spirit, I regressed the difference in the two shares' returns on

their dividend payouts. Such a specification could be derived from the after—tax

CAPN by using one share's return to substitute out the market risk variables.

Since both series of CU shares possess identical risk theoretically profiles,

their risk—adjusted after tax returns should be the same. My estimates are shown

below.


                                                 DA
     A B        .0001   - .252       +    .014

While there is clear evidence that dividends paid on Class B shares must be

"devalued", so that a for Class B is less than one, the hypothesis that dividends

and capital gains on Class A shares receive equal weight cannot be rejected.

These findings confirm the large body of pre-existing ex—day literature, and lead

inexorably to the usual conclusion that CU could raise its market value by

cutting its dividend on Class B shares.



III. B.      Some Econometric Issues.

     All of the preceding equations have been estimated under the standard
                                                                            -



assumptions of the general linear model. However, the stochastic process

generating   share price movements may not satisfy these assumptions. The

particular issues which I shall focus or involve changes over time in the

variance of returns. If prices are more volatile around event days than on non-

event days, the coefficient standard errors reported by least squares will be

inappropriate for making inferences about the ex—day model. Because these
                                                                                26

 standard errors are computed using the average residual variance over the entire

 data sample, they will not reflect the greater uncertainty which attaches to

 price movements around ex-dates. If all of the events whose effects we wish to

 measure occur during these periods of abnormal volatility, our confidence in the

 results must be smaller than it would be if the events occurred in other, lower

 return variance periods.

      This problem is a form of heteroscedasticity since the residual variance is

 related to one of the independent variables, the dividend payout. To explore its

 importance, I regressed the squares of residuals from the equatioss in Table 11—B

on a dummy variable corresponding to the ex-dividend day:

      Class A shares: e =    .822    +    .890 EXDAYA

                            (.047)       (.535)

     Class B shares: e =     .827 +       .440    EXDAYB

                            (.053)       (4.29)

The return variance on ex—days is larger for both shares; for Class A shares, it

is more than twice as great as the residual variance on nonex=days. Class B

returns display a somewhat less pronounced increase, about fifty percent. A

general test against heteroscedasticity, proposed by White (1980), was also

computed for each return equation by regressing the squared residuals on the set

of independent variables. The tests resoundingly rejected the null hypothesis of

homoscedastic errors


1 The calculated statistics are TR2 from the regression of e on the explanatory
variables in the returns model for the Class A and Class B equations,
respectively. These statistics are distributed as     under the null of
homoscedasticity; the 99% confidence value is 16.81. The actual test values
were between 30 and 90.
                                                                                           27

     The   finding of substantial heteroscedasticity led me to re-estimate the
standard   errors for the returns equations using White's (1980)

heteroscedasticity—consistent procedure. The resulting equations, with both OLS

and White—consistent statndard errors, are shown below:



     (t)A = 1.11       -   .946        +    .652    +   .035     R1 +    .131    + .095

               (1.81) (.058)               (.015)       (.015)          (.021)    (.021)


White
Standard       (1.80) (.083)               (.036)       (.028)          (.027)    (.025)
Errors



     (t) =      .463   -   .753   ()   + .627       +    .012       + .065         .036

              (1.78) (.078)                (.015)       (.014)          (.020)    (.021)

White
Standard      (1.80) (.088)                (.030)       (.020)          (.026)   (.024)
Errors


While all but one of the estimated standard errors increase, the effect on the

dividend payout's precision is particularly pronounced. The standard error in

the Class A equation increases by nearly fifty percent; that in the model for

Class B returns rises by a smaller amount. After making these corrections the

difference between the ex—dividend coefficients on Class A and Class B shares

remains statistically significant at a 10%, but not a 5%, confidence level.

However, the implications of excess volatility around event days extend far

beyond the present study. If this proves to be a general tendency in security

returns data, then many conclusions and inferences based on previous studies may

require re-examination.
                                                                                  28

      A second pattern which I discovered in the residuals from my return model

 was persistence of excess volatility. Days on which returns were unusually noisy

were, on average, followed by days with highly variable price movements. This can

be seen from the following residual-square regressions:

Class A: e= .472 + .726 EXDAYA + 1.94
                                      eti+ .072 c-2         .080       .073        .034


              (.051) (.512)          (.019)     (.020)     (.020)     (.020)      (.019)

Class B: e .497 + .488 EXDAYB + .108
                                     e?tj+ .077 e1+ .089 e3

              (.583) (.423)          (.019)     (.019)     (.119)

Only lagged values which were statistically significant were retained in these

equations. Serial correlation in the residual variances can make ordinary least

squares estimation highly inefficient.' Perhaps more importantly, however,

persistence in security return variances may require modifications in standard

option pricing and other security valuation rules.

IV. Transactions Volume around the Ex-Date

     Tax   arbitrage   around ex-dividend days may change the firm's clientele,

thereby reducing the effective tax rate on the firm's dividends. If this

arbitrage were taking place, then it should be detectable from a study of the

trading volume in CU shares. Green (1980) studied shares in the Dow Jones index

and found some evidence of unusual trading activity around ex—dates, particularly

"acceleration" of trades. Volume seemed unusually high on the few days

preceeding the ex—date. Volume tests should play a major role in future ex—day

investigations, since they provide one of the few mechanisms for understanding

whether firms actually face stable shareholder clienteles.


1Engle (1982) discusses these problems, which he refers to as "Autoregressive
Conditional Heteroscedasticity," and demonstrates in some cases OLS becomes infintely
inefficient relative to maximum likelihood. While procedures for estimating models
with ARCH exist, I have not yet explored their application.

      To examine CU volume fluctuations, I estimated two regression models. The

 first, based on Green's approach, focussed only on trading activity within one

 week of the ex—date:


 (iv.i)   VOLUNEt =   6o    i     EXDIVA2 + 62 EXDIVA1 +      ... + 65   EXDIVA2
                        +
                            111   EXDIVB2 + 112 EXDIVB1   +
                                                              ... + it5 EXDIVB2
                        +                 +
                            4 NYSEVOL.        Ct

VOLUME is the transactions volume in either Class A or Class B shares, EXDIVA and

EXDIVB are indicator variables for ex—dividend dates, and NYSEVOL is the trading

volume on the New York Stock Exchange.1 The 6. and it.
                                                               1
                                                                   coefficients   measure the

deviation   of volume from its average level, where EXDIVA              for example is an
                                                                    2

indicator variable for days which are two trading days before the ex-day.

     The results of estimating this model for the period 1972—1982 are shown in

Table IV. Although each type of share is unusually active on its ex-date, the

volume differences above normal are not statistically significant. The stock

distribution (Class A) shares experience volume eighteen percent above average on

their own ex-dates, and Class B shares' volume is up by about 22% on their ex—

date. These effects are substantial, even if statistically insignificant. I

exchange.

 also explored the "cross—effects" of one share's ex—date on the other share's

 volume. While ex dates for Class A shares seems to raise Class B share volume,

 the reverse appears to be true on Class B distribution days: Class A volume

 declines. There is no pronounced volume pattern before and after the ex—dates.

     There are two difficulties with this simple volume model. First, our

attention should not be confined only to the few days around the ex-date. There

are sound reasons for activity to increase far in advance of the ex—date. For

example, corporate dividend receipts are eligible for the 35% tax exemption only

if the corporation has held the shares for a period of more than 15 days before

the ex—date. This might lead to excess trading 16 days before the ex—day. The

second problem is that when trading volume rises for a period of several days, it

may be impossible to identify an increase on any particular day around the ex—

date but easy to find a sizable "week before" effect. These concerns led to an

alternative specification designed to capture trading movements further from the

ex—date:

           VOLUME =
(IV.2)                8+   5 EXDiVA to —10) + ô2 EXD1VA(11 to —2O

                                                                               + c.
                 111 DIVB(1 to -10) +        + 114 EXDIVB(+11   to +2O) 150L
The indicator variables on the right hand side now correspond to ten day

intervals around the ex-date.

     The results of estimating (IV.2) are reported in Table V. There is some

evidence of unusual trading activity in Series A shares. Trading appears to be

about nine percent above usual in the twenty days before the ex-date for Class A

Notes:      Both equations are estimated for the period 1972:007 — 1982:270
            using daily data on the volume of each share's trading. The
            explanatory variables are dummy variables for periods around the ex—
            date. For example, EXDIVA (—20 to -11) is 1 on days which are
            between 20 and 11 trading days before the ex—date of Class A
            shares.
                                                                                      33

stock.     This effect is statistically significant at the 95% level. Similarly,

activity is almost ten percent below normal in the twenty days preceeding an ex-

date for Series B shares. Trading in Class A shares rises after the Series B ex—

date.

        Class B shares exhibit much less unusual trading activity around ex—dates.

Almost all of the indicator variables' coefficients are substantially less than

their standard errors. In addition, the coefficients are small; even if they

were precisely estimated, they would not suggest particularly substantial volume

movements. The absence of Class B trading undermines the "tax arbitrage" theory

of ex--day behavior. While there should be trading around the ex-date for shares

with taxable distributions, there is no evidence that this trading actually

occurs for Citizens Utilities. The excess trading volume for Class A shares is

puzzling, since there are few tax advantages to be gained by trading around the

ex—date.

        One explanation for the absence of trading activity is CU's size. While

Citizens   Utilities is monitored by Value Line and several investment firms, and

there is some interest in CU for its unique capitalization, it does not appear to

attract active trading interest in many firms.1         This   may reflect a thin market

for the firm's shares, and may suggest that any attempts to take advantage of

arbitrage profits would result in substantial share price changes and thereby

become unprofitable.

     While   trading   volume   data   show no clear signs of changes in the firm's

clienteles around ex—dividend days, it is still of soiae interest to examine the


1 The 1982 Directory of Security Research lists only one analyst as a contact for
Citizens Utilities, and she informed me in a telephone interview that she does
not actively follow the company's shares. I also learned that the company is
rarely traded by institutional investors, and that its primary market consists of
"retail investors".
                                                                               34

shareholder composition of Class A and Class B shares. Unpublished data,

provided by Citizens Utilities, disaggregating shareholders into several

categories is shown in Table VI. Interpretation of shareholder information such

as this must proceed cautiously, since many of the "brokers" holdings are

probably beneficial holdings which should ultimately be assigned to individuals

or institutions. There is some evidence that individuals hold a larger fraction

of the outstanding Class A than Class B shares. Nominees and Institutions hold a

smaller amount of the A shares. In addition, the individuals holdings of A

shares are in substantially larger blocks than the B shareholdings. The

investment value of the typical individual A—shareholders' position is roughly

two and one half times the size of the average Class B shareholding.

     Some further insights into the role of the tax clienteles in the stock

market derives from the shareholder survey conducted by CU's Chairman, Richard

Rosenthal, in 1955. Shareholders were asked which type of dividend policy they

preferred: all stock, all cash, or a mix of the two. Sixty eight percent of the

shareholders participated in the survey; of the respondents, 55% voted for all—

stock dividends, 38% for the half stock-half cash plan, and 7% desired all cash

dividends.1 However, Business Week reported

         The all-cash minority is a powerful one because its
         shares are concentrated in large blocks in the hands of
         a few investment trusts and other institutional
         investors. Its preference is one reason why

          stockholders are getting the choice of a cash-paying as
          well as a stock-paying category. [Business Week,
          January 14, 1956, P. 107].

 These bits of anecdotal evidence suggest that stock market clienteles may exist.

 However, the fact that many CU shareholders in 1955 wished to receive both cash

 and stock dividends is difficult to reconcile with rational behavior taking

 account of taxes.1



 V.   Pinpointing the Paradox

      Ex—day price changes for Citizens Utilities shares suggest that investors

value taxable cash dividends less than they value non—taxable distributions.

However, the relative prices of the two classes of equity do violence to these

predictions. While the ex-day evidence suggests that after adjustment for

different levels of dividends the taxable dividend shares should sell for about

twenty percent less than the nontaxable shares, their average price during the

last 10 years has been two percent greater than the price of Class A shares.

The paradox is that the ex-day behavior of the two shares is inconsistent with

their relative prices. On days between dividend payments, the return on Class B

shares must be lower than the return on Class A shares. This is a significant

result, suggesting that the rate of return which investors demand on different

shares may depend upon their dividend policy-, even on days when no dividends are

paid. Findings such as this are difficult to reconcile with standard theories of

asset pricing.


1Some institutions such as pension funds might face identical (zero) tax rates on
both sources of income. However, their CU shareholdings are substantially below
the fraction of investors who voted for a half—and—half policy in 1955. The
annual reports often reveal letters from investors who hold both classes of CU
shares ("one for dividends, one for capital appreciation.") This is also
difficult to square with strict tax—clientele theories.
                                                                                                               36

        Before drawing conclusions from the CU case, it is important to explore any
 features of the two shares which could explain their paradoxical prices. First,

 the eventual expiration of Series A shares' dividend tax exemption could affect

 the shares' relative prices. While the difference between Class A and Class B

ex-day price movements should reflect the difference between marginal dividend

and capital gains tax rates, the difference between the share prices should

reflect the discounted value of the tax savings. For example, if the two shares

were identically taxed on all dividend payments except one, then prices would be

almost the same but they might experience widely different changes, as a fraction

of their dividend, on that dividend ex—day.

        Assuming that the Class A shares' tax exemption will be eliminated in 1990,1

we can calculate the value of each share.

where g is the growth rate of Class A dividends. The relative price of the two

shares should approach K as the date of expiration nears.2 We would predict that


There is some chance that Congress will choose to extend the grandfather clause,
allowing CU a tax exemption after 1990.
2 If on expiration the two shares become identical so that there could be no
differences in dividends, then the price ratio would approach unity.
                                                                                    37

the prices of Class A and Class B shares would have become closer in the last 10

years, However, as Table I shows, the prices have in fact diverged during the

last few years. This is prima facie evidence against the prospect of tax—exempt—

expiration driving the price movements.

     Further evidence comes from evaluating the relative price in expression

(v.3).   Assuming that Class A dividends will rise at 8 percent per year until
1990, treating a =    .75, the   payout rate on Class B shares as 10 percent, and

assuming an after—tax nominal discount rater of .10, the 1982 relative price of

Class A and Class B shares would be 1.32. The observed 1982 price ratio is 1.10,

which is substantially less than the calculations predict. The importance of

this calculation is that the two shares' similar prices cannot be attributed

solely to the expected expiration of Series A's tax exemption.

     An alternative explanation of the share's equal valuation is that investors

fail to perceive the tax system's important role. This seems unlikely since the

annual report for each year contains a discussion of the advantages of "unique

Two-Series Capitalization". The 1981 Report, for example, explains that:

            Series B shares meet the needs or desires those investors to whom
            conventional cash dividends are attractive, because their
            circumstances are such that they pay modest to no taxes on them.
            Our Series A shares have particular attraction to those investors
            whose purpose is to compound their investment at no additional
            cash cost and without taxation during the compounding period.
            [Citizens Utilities (1981), p. 46].

Investors who study the corporate documents should be aware of the tax issues

surrounding choice of share type, and ignorance should not explain the price

behavior.

     The clienteles, as discussed in the last section, might provide a partial

explanation. The puzzle for any clientele theory is why observed ex-day price
                                                                                 38

 changes appear to suggest that Class B dividends are worth only seventy five

 percent of their nominal value. Some investors are paying a substantial tax

 price for the priviledge of receiving cash distributions. Clienteles should form

 readily in CU shares since the problem of finding equivalent-risk high and low

 payout stocks does not arise. Both classes of shares should be equally risky, so

 investors should be able to choose the income stream which they prefer for tax or

 other reasons, without concern for risk differentials.

      The central result of comparing these shares is that even if clienteles have

 formed for the two shares, they have not completely eliminated the tax arbitrage

 opportunities. One explanation of this phenomenon which should not be ignored is

 that Citizens Utilities is too small to make tax arbitrage a highly profitable

activity. Investors who specialize in exploiting these tax differentials may

focus on stocks which admit large positions with relatively small changes in

price. This may not be possible for Citizens Utilities.



Conclusions

     A burgeoning literature has focussed on the accurate measurement of ex-day

price effects, but there have been few attempts to assess the value of these

investigations. The Citizens Utilities paradox raises substantial doubts

concerning the usefulness of ex—dividend day share price studies. While the

stock market's valuation of the dividends paid by the two classes of shares is

quite different, its valuation of the two shares is almost identical. This

suggests that using ex-day studies to draw inferences about the effect of

alternative dividend policies, or dividend tax regimes, on share values can be

misleading. The results also call into question the extent to which tax
                                                                                39

arbitrage affects ex-day price changes. For one class of Citizens Utilities

shares, ex—day price movements are substantially less than the value of

dividends.

     The findings suggest some leads for the explanation of corporate dividend

poUcy. "Signalling" theories cannot explain the premium on Class B shares,

since the payment of cash dividends on Class B shares can be observed by both

Class A and Class B shareholders. Owners of the taxable dividend shares acquire

no more information than owners of stock—dividend shares. The most plausible

explanation of the relative price behavior of CU shares rests on a fundamental

preference, by some classes of investors, for cash dividends. For some small

investors, this preference may be due to current consumption needs and the high

transactions costs associated with small portfolio liquidations. Other

investors, trusts and some institutions, may value current income more than

capital appreciation. Studies of how important these investors are should

constitute a substantial part of the future research program on dividend payout.

        Share transactions take place in units of eighths of a dollar. At any moment,

a security's recorded price is not its market clearing price. The market clearing prices

and recorded prices are linked by a "measurement error" attributable to round—price

trading:


(i)                 +



where        is the recorded price, P is the market clearing price, and                          is an error

term which is not greater than                       12.5   cents in absolute value. There may also be errors

in share prices which are closing prices and not actual transaction prices.

        To analyze the econometric significance of these measurement errors, consider the

simple er-dividend day model of Section III. The "true" model was specified as

The first bracketed term is the                                                               ratio for the independent variable, the

  dividend—payout   ratio. It is reminiscent of the usual result for regression models
  in   the presence of measurement error: the coefficients are biased toward zero, and

  the probability limits of the estimators are the true coefficient values times one

 minus the noise to signal ratio. The second bracketed term modifies    the     usual errors—
 in-variable expression, because there is a spurious correlation between the measured

 dependent and independent variables. An altenative expression shows this more clearly:


 (9) plim
                    xx                      xx
            a1= a1[_ 2Ql + [i                2Q]
 The second term depends upon
                                    Q/Q,     the regression coefficient of        on zt.
 These variables, w and z, are coefficients in the Taylor expansions for the

 independent and dependent variables in terms of the measurement errors. The estimated

a1therefore will be biased by increasingly large amounts as these linear terms become

 more highly correlated. Provided the dividend—price ratio exhibits some variation,

this second term is unlikely to vanish and resulting coefficients may be contaminated.

       A consistent estimation procedure can be developed by employing instrumental

variables. Since lagged values of prices contain measurement errors which are

uncorrelated with current prices, but systematic components which are highly

correlated,1 they provide particularly good instruments. The results which are

reported in the text correspond to IV estimators using Dt , Dt ,    etc.   as
                                                        t—2  t-3
instruments.


 The efficient markets hypothesis predicts that market—clearing prices evolve according
to a random walk, or something close to it. This means the correlation between
past market-clearing prices and current prices is particularly high.
