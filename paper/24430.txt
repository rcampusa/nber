How News and Its Context Drive Risk and Returns Around the World

                                          ABSTRACT

We develop a classification methodology for the context and content of news articles to predict
risk and return in stock markets in 51 developed and emerging economies. A parsimonious
summary of news, including topic-specific sentiment, frequency, and unusualness (entropy) of
word flow, predicts future country-level returns, volatilities, and drawdowns. Economic and
statistical significance are high and larger for year-ahead than monthly predictions. The effect of
news measures on market outcomes differs by country type and over time. News stories about
emerging markets contain more incremental information. Out-of-sample testing confirms the
economic value of our approach for forecasting country-level market outcomes.

1. Introduction

What is news and how is it associated with changes in stock market returns and risks? This is a

fundamental question in asset pricing and has been the subject of decades of research (for

example, Fama et al. 1969, Roll 1984). Recently, financial economists have brought new tools to

bear on this question, including the analysis of the relationships between market outcomes for

individual stocks or U.S. stock market indexes and various aspects of the words that appear in

newspaper articles and other textual sources (for example, Tetlock 2007, 2010, 2011, Tetlock et

al. 2008, Garcia 2013). This literature is still in its infancy, but already it has become apparent

that it is possible to quantify salient aspects of word flow and link these measures to market

outcomes. Moreover, the information contained in these textual analyses not only is associated

with changes in returns and risk, but can provide incremental predictive value over and above

other variables that are associated with changes in returns and risk (such as “value” or

“momentum” measures, or measures of economic activity or changes in related asset prices, such

as exchange rates or interest rates).


       The promising early work in the literature linking textual analysis and stock returns has

raised more questions that it has answered. Here is a list of nine important sets of questions that

have been raised, and how our study addresses them:


       First, and perhaps most importantly, how should one best measure news using word

flow? One approach is to apply atheoretical methods (i.e., those with no a priori position

regarding which particular words should be the focus of the analysis) to organize the flow of

words in a comprehensive and unconstrained manner in order to see which parts of word flow

matter for market outcomes. An alternative approach would be to identify, based on a priori

criteria, key lists of words or combinations of key words to see how their presence matters for

                                                  1
market outcomes (for example, Baker, Bloom and Davis 2016). A major advantage of the former

approach is that it does not require researchers to know in advance what aspects of word flow are

most relevant. The atheoretical approach also avoids data mining by imposing discipline on the

process by which text is analyzed. There are only a few atheoretical measures of word flow to

consider in empirical work: frequency, sentiment, unusualness (also known as entropy) of words,

and topical categories that are identified without imposing any a priori notions of how to group

words. In contrast, there is no limit to the number of a priori mappings that could be constructed

based on particular words or combinations of words. A potential advantage of the alternative a

priori approach, however, is that it may cut through noise by searching in more relevant places

for words or phrases that have likely importance.


       We adopt an atheoretical approach, and cast a broad net to see which aspects of word

flow are most relevant for market outcomes. We then compare that approach with one prominent

a priori approach (the Baker, Bloom and Davis measure of uncertainty), which confirms our

view that an atheoretical approach may have desirable properties.


       Second, which aspects of word flow should be the focus of measurement? There is a

large literature showing that “sentiment” has explanatory power for returns. Articles that contain

words with pre-identified positive sentiment value (as measured by a sentiment “dictionary”) are

associated with positive returns, while those with negative value are associated with negative

returns. But sentiment is only one dimension of word flow. The frequency of the appearance of

certain words or phrases (compared to their past frequency) may also be relevant, and it may also

be that the context in which words appear (which we label “topics”) is important to the meaning

of word flow. In addition to measuring sentiment, the contextual frequency of word flow, and the

way sentiment matters differently depending on context, other aspects of text flow may be

                                                 2
relevant. Glasserman and Mamaysky (2016a) show that the unusualness (entropy) of word

strings may have predictive power for market outcomes, especially when interacted with

sentiment. As we show below, the effects of measured sentiment and frequency do vary across

topic categories, so this decomposition of sentiment may be particularly useful in forecasting

applications.


       Our empirical approach will include these various measures of text flow and their

interactions, and explore their incremental information content relative to non-textual variables

often included in asset pricing studies. We also include controls that capture differences over

time related to the electoral cycle, which we thought might be relevant when measuring the

effects of news on market outcomes.


       Third, the patterns that link frequency, topics, sentiment and entropy measures of word

flow with market outcomes may vary over time. Regime changes over time ideally would be

captured in a neutral manner (identifying switches endogenously using data patterns).


       As a starting point, in this paper, we capture changes over time using a dividing point that

is identified by principal components analysis. We show that the mapping from word flow

measures to market outcomes changed somewhat after the global financial crisis. We further

explore dynamic changes in coefficients using a rolling elastic net regression – which allows for

model selection and coefficient shrinkage – for out-of-sample forecasting. We find that allowing

coefficients to change over time is important for out-of-sample forecasting.


       Fourth, given the potential importance of identifying topical context, how should one

identify topics? One could adopt an a priori approach to identifying topic areas, or alternatively,

employ an atheoretical approach that divides words into topic groups based on certain statistical


                                                 3
properties of the corpus. Within the set of atheoretical means of identifying topics there are two

common methods, namely the Louvain (Blondel et al. 2008) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation

(LDA, see Blei et al. 2003) approaches, as we discuss further below. The Louvain method

assigns salient words to mutually exclusive topic areas based on word co-occurrence (that is,

each word belongs to only one topic area). The LDA method allows words to appear in more

than one topic area (on a probabilistic basis).


        After verifying with some exploratory analysis that our regression findings are similar

under either approach, we focus on the Louvain method. The Louvain approach, variants of

which have been applied in diverse fields from sociology (Rule, Cointet and Bearman 2015) to

marketing (Netzer et al. 2012), has the major advantages of much faster computational speed,

which results from the simplicity of a mutually exclusive approach to assigning words to topic

areas, as well as greater ease of interpretability.1


        Fifth, should all market outcomes (i.e., both changes in expected returns and changes in

risk) be related to each of the identified word flow measures, or should some word flow

measures be more important for risk and other measures more important for expected returns?


        Our approach allows all word flow measures to matter for all of the market outcome

measures. Our findings suggest that when a word flow measure has positive content for expected

returns it also has negative content for changes in risk (i.e. risk, however measured, will be




1
  Rule, Cointet and Bearman (2015) discuss the pros and cons of various topic classification approaches, and reach a
conclusion similar to ours – that co-occurrence approaches are appealing due to their simplicity and the ease of
interpretability of results.

                                                         4
lower). In other words, word flow measures largely divide into “good” and “bad” news, where

bad news implies lower expected returns and higher risk, and good news implies the opposite.2


         Sixth, one must decide which market measures to include in any analysis of the effects of

word flow on market outcomes? Conceptually, the obvious focus, reflected in prior work, should

be on expected returns and on risk. For each country, returns can be measured using the change

in the value of the country stock market index. Risk, however, is a more subtle and problematic

variable to measure. As is well known, if the returns process is characterized by Brownian

motion and normality of the error term, then the standard deviation of returns (say, over a

particular month) will be a sufficient statistic for risk. Those assumptions, however, generally are

rejected, especially for emerging market (EM) countries, which exhibit pronounced momentum,

and non-normality, both with respect to skew and kurtosis (see Bekaert et al. 1998, Karolyi 2015,

and Ghysels et al. 2016).


         Given those facts, to capture risk, in addition to using the standard deviation of returns

(sigma), we also employ the “maximum one-year drawdown.” This measures, at any point in

time, the maximum percentage decline that occurs from the current index value during the next

year. This measure also is intended to capture the fact that “downside risk” may be treated

differently from “upside risk” (the standard deviation of returns treats them as identical).


         Seventh, the existing literature typically focuses on short-term analysis of individual U.S.

companies or the U.S. stock market as a whole.3 Do empirical patterns that apply to individual




2
  In particular, there is no evidence in our data of a risk-return trade-off in predictability. Sentiment measures do not
forecast higher returns because they forecast higher volatility. Instead, when they forecast higher returns, the news
measures also forecast lower volatility and lower drawdowns.
3
  A notable exception is Froot et al. (2017), who analyze media reinforcement effects at the country index level.

                                                           5
company stocks or the aggregate U.S. index also apply to other countries? When analyzing news

and stock market behavior, should countries be lumped together or analyzed separately?


         We analyze the aggregate monthly stock market returns and risks for 52 countries.4 We

divide countries into two groups: developed (DMs) and emerging (EMs) economies, which we

believe allows for important environment differences across countries while still preserving

sufficient statistical power. On the one hand, statistical power can be enhanced by a panel

approach. On the other hand, important differences across countries may be lost. As we have

already noted, there is a great deal of evidence suggesting that returns processes differ between

EMs and DMs. Furthermore, the amount of risk and the nature of the news that drives risk differ

dramatically between EMs and DMs (Beim and Calomiris 2001, Karolyi 2015). Those

categorical differences likely reflect fundamental differences in political contexts, which result in

different ranges of government policy choices, differences in information production for

securities markets, different market liquidity (Calomiris, Love and Martinez-Peria 2012),

differences in legal environment and corporate governance (La Porta et al. 1998), different fiscal,

monetary and exchange rate regimes (Calvo and Reinhart 2002), differences in sovereign default

risk (which is absent in most DMs but is relatively high in EMs, as described in Cruces and

Trebesch 2013), and differences in the frequency and severity of banking crises (Laeven and

Valencia 2014). EMs suffer larger and more frequent major drawdowns of stock returns than

EMs (Kaminsky and Schmukler 2008). For all these reasons, we divide countries into EMs and

DMs and perform separate panel analyses of each group of countries.




4
 We only use 51 countries in our panel regressions because we exclude Iceland, which experienced a drawdown of
95%. Including this outlier affected coefficient magnitudes in our regression models, and therefore, we excluded it.

                                                          6
       Eighth, what source of news should one use? Given our global interest (across EMs and

DMs) we need an English language news source covering many countries. Thomson Reuters

generously provided their entire database of news articles from 1996 through 2015.


       Specifically, our empirical study divides countries into two groups: DMs and EMs, and

estimates the connections between a comprehensive set of word flow measures and market

outcomes (returns, sigma and drawdown) for both samples, for the entire sample period (1998-

2015) and for two sub-periods (April 1998 – February 2007, and March 2007-December 2015).


       Finally, over what time frame should word flow predict risk and return? Much of the

existing finance literature on the effects of sentiment on individual stocks’ returns have focused

on high-frequency predictions. Glasserman and Mamaysky (2016a) are an exception; using the

U.S. stock market index, they find predictive power for risk several months following word flow.

Similarly, Sinha (2016) and Heston and Sinha (2017) find that it can be useful to aggregate over

longer periods of time when analyzing news for individual stocks. They find that when

aggregating news over a week rather than a day one substantially lengthens the time horizon over

which news forecasts returns. Weekly news predicts returns for 13 weeks, while daily news

predicts returns for only two days. Motivated by these findings, we aggregate news at a monthly

horizon, and then examine both one-month ahead and one year ahead predictions, and show that

our country-level aggregates exhibit stronger predictive power for one year ahead returns and

drawdowns than for one-month ahead forecasts of return and volatility.


       Section 2 describes how we derive measures of word flow used in the study and provides

a list of variables and sources for them. Section 3 presents regression results. Section 4 presents

out-of-sample tests of our model. Section 5 concludes by summarizing our findings.

2. Data Construction, Variable Definitions, and Summary Statistics


The analysis in this paper combines three types of data – market, macro and news – all of which

are aggregated into a single data set at the month-country level. Our country level stock market

index data are obtained from Bloomberg. Table 1 shows the mapping from each of our DM and

EM countries to the corresponding stock market index. All index returns are converted into US

dollar terms using end-of-day exchange rates from Bloomberg. For a given country, we

calculate its one-month ahead return (return), its one-year ahead return (return12), its realized

monthly volatility (sigma) and its one-year ahead drawdown (drawdown) using these US dollar

returns. Our macro data, such as interest rates, GDP growth rates, and credit ratios, are obtained

from a myriad of sources, like the World Bank and the IMF, as detailed in the Appendix. Our

textual data source is the Thomson Reuters Machine Readable News archive. This archive

includes all Reuters News articles from 1996 to 2015, from which we use only the English

language news. The measures of textual content we employ are constructed by us, as described

below (also see the Appendix for more details).


        Thomson Reuters News Analytics (TRNA) offers its own version of a sentiment measure

as a commercial product, which has been used by Sinha (2016) and Heston and Sinha (2017),

among others. The TRNA sentiment measure captures similar content to the sentiment measures

we construct, but the TRNA sentiment measure is only available for a fraction of the articles in

the Thomson Reuters database, and only from 2003.5 For this reason we use our own sentiment


5
  In response to a comment received after we completed our analysis, we purchased the TRNA sentiment data and
compared regression results for the post-2003 period using our sentiment measure with those based on the TRNA
sentiment measure. A detailed comparison is provided in Supplementary Appendix Tables A5-A9. We find that the
two measures are correlated (correlation coefficients of the two approaches to measuring sentiment are generally
greater than 0.3 and less than 0.4, depending on topical context), and using the TRNA measure in our regression
framework yields somewhat similar findings to those reported here, but the use of our measure generally results in
more precise estimation and higher R-squared.

News archive.




2.1 Construction of Text Measures


Our text processing can be broken up into four parts: (i) corpus selection and cleaning; (ii)

construction of the document term matrix and topic classification; (iii) extraction of n-grams to

allow for calculation of entropy; and (iv) calculation of article-level sentiment, topic and entropy

measures. Here we present a high-level overview of the process. The Appendix contains more

technical and methodological detail.


       In the first step, we select our text corpus and then clean and preprocess it. For the EM

analysis, our corpus consists of all articles tagged by Thomson Reuters with the N2:EMRG code,

which indicates an article about an emerging market country. Our EM corpus consists of 5mm

unique articles. Our DM corpus consists of all articles about the countries identified as

developed market economies in Table 1. The DM corpus consists of 12mm unique articles. All

textual analysis in the paper is done separately for the EM and DM corpora.


       In the second step, we calculate the document term matrix for the corpus under

consideration. The document term matrix, with rows corresponding to articles and columns

corresponding to words, counts the number of times a given word appears in a given article. For

a given document term matrix, let us write 𝐷𝑗,𝑤 for the number of times word w appears in article

j. We restrict the words whose occurrences we count to our econ word list. This is a list of




                                                 9
1,242 stemmed words, bigrams and trigrams6 that are descriptive of either market or economic

phenomena (pre-stemming examples include barriers, currency, parliament, macroeconomist,

and World Bank). This list was derived as follows: We began with the index from Beim and

Calomiris’ Emerging Financial Markets textbook. We then searched for words that co-occurred

frequently in our articles database with the words in that list. The list itself, as well as the

classification of each word into a topic, is available from the authors.


        To define topic groups, we use the document term matrix to measure the tendency of

groups of words to occur in articles together – we refer to this tendency as co-occurrence.

Information about the co-occurrence of words, as measures by cosine similarity (see Appendix),

is stored in the co-occurrence matrix (a symmetric matrix with a row and column for each of our

econ words). The co-occurrence matrix defines a network of our 1,242 econ words, to which we

apply the Louvain community detection algorithm to find non-overlapping clusters (i.e. a word

can belong to only one cluster) of related words – we refer to these clusters as topics and label

each one with what appears to us to be a natural topic title. Details of this procedure are given in

the Appendix, but intuitively we are looking for groups of words that tend to co-occur in articles

more frequently than would be expected by chance. This procedure yields five topics for each of

our DM and EM corpora.7 Figures 1 and 2 show the most frequently occurring words in each of

our EM and DM topics.8 For the EM corpus, we find five word groupings, which we label as:

markets (Mkt), governments (Govt), commodities (Comms), corporate governance and structure

(Corp), and macroeconomic topics (Macro). For the DM corpus, we find similar, but not


6
  Bigrams and trigrams (or 3-grams) are word phrases of length two and three respectively.
7
  We found that recalculating topics over different subsamples of our data yielded very similar word groupings to
those that were obtained over the entire sample. See the Appendix for more details.
8
  Figure 3 shows that the original Louvain clustering produced over 40 word groupings for each corpus, yet only 5
of these contained more than just a few words. We place words from the smaller groupings into the 5 large one for
each corpus. This is discussed in greater detail in the Appendix.

                                                       10
identical topics: markets (Mkt), governments (Govt), commodities (Comms), corporate

governance and structure (Corp), and the extension of credit (Credit).


           Table 2 shows that the word overlap between the topics we identify in our EM and DM

corpora is often, though not always, sizeable. Our measure of word overlap is the Jaccard index,

which for two sets A and B, reports how many elements there are in their intersection divided by

the number of elements in their union. The rows of the table correspond to DM topics, and the

columns correspond to EM topics. For example, we see when we compare the Govt topic

between our EM and DM corpora that 82% of all words common to the two topics are present in

each topic separately. This indicates that the words that tend to co-occur in government-related

articles in our EM and DM samples are quite similar. Similarly, the Jaccard overlap between the

Mkt topic in our EM and DM samples is 59%. There is some overlap in the Comms topic as

well. We also note that there is a large overlap (of 46%) between the Corp topic in EM and the

Credit topic in DM. Our EM Macro topic has no close analogue in any of the DM topics (the

closest is the DM Comms topic) – suggesting that news about EM economies tend to focus on

topics of macroeconomic interest in a way that articles about DM economies do not. Perhaps

this is because macroeconomic institutions in DM economies are more settled than their EM

counterparts and therefore require less news coverage.


           Tables 3 (for EM) and 4 (for DM) show four sample headlines of articles classified as

belonging to each of the topics we identify in our analysis, which provide some examples of how

our identified topics relate to articles used in our analysis.9 For example, in the emerging market

corpus an article titled “Clinton says Putin can build strong, free Russia” is classified as being in



9
    In these tables an article is classified into topic τ if between 80%-90% of its econ words belong to that topic.

                                                             11
the Govt topic. A Portuguese language article (which was wrongly coded by our data source as

an English language article) entitled “Sao Paulo volta a registrar inﬂacao no comeco de marco”

is classified – seemingly correctly – in the Macro topic. Presumably this article was included,

despite the fact that it is not in English, because the relevant stemmed Portuguese words are

identical to their stemmed English counterparts. While we explicitly select only English

language articles from the Thomson Reuters data set, some of their language metadata is

apparently incorrect. In the developed markets corpus, most of our sample articles seem to be

classified correctly based on their headlines. For example “BRIEF-NQ Mobile announces

termination of proposed divestment of Beijing Tianya” is in the Corp topic.


           Thomson-Reuters’ articles cover a wide range of topics. For example, sports articles are

included, although they are often discussed from the perspectives of the economic or business

implications of the sports-related event, which explains why sports articles have positive weights

in the topic areas we identify. We considered restricting our sample of articles to those that were

more narrowly focused on business, economics and politics topics, but we found that doing so

slightly reduced the explanatory power of news for stock returns and risk, and so we retained the

full sample of news articles for our analysis.


           The third step of our textual analysis is the extraction of n-grams. We use n-grams, or

more specifically 4-grams, to construct a measure of the entropy of a given article, following

closely the methodology proposed in Glasserman and Mamaysky (2016a). An n-gram is a

collection of n contiguous words.10 We do not allow n-grams to cross sentence boundaries – so

these are n-word phrases that appear entirely in a single sentence. Our measure of the entropy of



10
     The phrase “collection of n contiguous” is an example of a 4-gram.

                                                          12
a given 4-gram is the probability of observing the 4th word in the phrase conditional on seeing

the first 3 words. This conditional probability is estimated from a training corpus as follows


                                           𝑐̂ (𝑤1 , 𝑤2 , 𝑤3 , 𝑤4 ) + 1
                                      𝑚=                                                          (1)
                                              𝑐̂ (𝑤1 , 𝑤2 , 𝑤3 ) + 10

where 𝑐̂ counts how frequently a given 4-gram or 3-gram occurred in a training corpus. Adding

1 to the numerator and 10 to the denominator is a simple way to handle cases where the 3-word

phrase that begins the 4-gram was not seen in the training corpus. In the Appendix, we discuss

why this 1:10 rule is an appropriate choice.


       For a given month t, the training corpus includes all articles from either the EM or DM

corpus that appear from month t-27 to t-4 (we discuss this window choice in the Appendix). For

example, consider the 4-gram “central bank cuts interest.” Our conditional probability measure

for this 4-gram would be high if the word “interest” very often followed the phrase “central bank

cuts” in our training corpus. If many other words also followed the phrase “central bank cuts,”

then m would be small and we would consider this 4-gram unusual. We extend the concept of

entropy at the 4-gram level to the article level by calculating the negative average log probability

of all 4-grams appearing in that article. For a given article j, this measure is given by


                                         𝐻𝑗 = − ∑ 𝑝𝑖 log 𝑚𝑖                                       (2)
                                                   𝑖

where pi is the fraction of all 4-grams appearing in the article represented by the ith 4-gram and

mi is i’s conditional probability from the training corpus. This measure is also known as the

cross-entropy of m with respect to p, and we will often refer to it as entropy in our analysis.


       Intuitively, we characterize an article as unusual if it contains language that is unlikely to

have been seen in the past. We conjecture that such new language may be needed to describe

                                                 13
new market or economic phenomena, and that the presence of the latter may indicate heightened

(or perhaps reduced) market risks. In the same way that the context of a news story might matter

for its market relevance, the entropy of the news story may matter as well.


       Finally, we combine our topic analysis with article level sentiment. Our article level

sentiment measure for article j is defined as


                                                𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑗 − 𝑁𝐸𝐺𝑗
                                         𝑠𝑗 =                                                   (3)
                                                     𝑎𝑗

where POSj, NEGj, and aj are the number of positive, negative and total words in the article. We

use the Loughran-McDonald (2011) sentiment word lists to classify words as being positive or

negative. This is the standard measure of sentiment that has been used in the finance literature

(see, for example, Garcia 2013). Tables 3 (for EM) and 4 (for DM) show 𝑠𝑗 for the sample

articles discussed earlier. In each topic, we report two sample articles with a very negative

sentiment, as well as two sample articles with a very positive sentiment. For example, in the DM

corpus the article “Euro rises above $1.07 against dollar on war” in the Mkt topic plausibly

receives a very negative sentiment value of -0.20. Sometimes, the lack of semantic context

causes our sentiment classification to assign an inappropriate value, given the actual meaning of

the article. For example, the article “BRIEF-Moody’s revises Pulte’s outlook to stable from

positive” which appears (appropriately) in the Credit topic is assigned a very positive sentiment

score of 0.23 because it contains words like “positive” and “stable” – both positive sentiment

words in Loughran-McDonald – though clearly being moved to stable outlook from a positive

outlook is a mildly negative credit event. We regard these errors as inevitable noise in identifying

sentiment that arises from the inherent complexity of combinations of words, and the consequent

difficulty in coding sentiment of phrases using sentiment values of individual words.


                                                 14
       For topic τ, let us define 𝑒𝜏,𝑗 as the number of econ words in article j that fall into topic τ

and 𝑒𝑗 as the total number of econ words in article j. Then 𝑓𝜏,𝑗 = 𝑒𝜏,𝑗 /𝑒𝑗 defines the fraction of

article j’s econ words that fall into a specific topic (recall topics are defined as non-overlapping

sets of econ words). We refer to 𝑓𝜏,𝑗 as the frequency of topic τ in article j. We can decompose

an article’s sentiment into a context-specific sentiment measure via


                                            𝑠𝜏,𝑗 = 𝑓𝜏,𝑗 × 𝑠𝑗                                     (4)

For example, an article with a sentiment measure of -3% that was mostly about government

issues with 𝑒𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑡,𝑗 /𝑒𝑗 = 90% would have a government-specific sentiment of -2.7%. And its

sentiment allocation to the other topics would be close to zero. Note also that since ∑𝑗 𝑓𝜏,𝑗 = 1

we’ll have ∑𝜏 𝑠𝜏,𝑗 = 𝑠𝑗 , which justifies our use of the term “decomposition”.


       We are interested in testing in this paper whether article decomposition matters. Does

negative or positive sentiment matter more or less for forecasting future market outcomes when

it occurs in news stories about governments than when it occurs in news stories about

macroeconomics? And how do these distinctions change when we consider DM or EM

economies? Much of our empirical analysis will be focused on these and related questions.


       It should also be noted that a similar decomposition can be applied to the article level

entropy measure Hj. However, we did not find this decomposition to be useful and in all our

empirical results report article-level entropy. Following Glasserman and Mamaysky (2016a), we

compute article level context-specific sentiment interacted with entropy as follows


                                     𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑡𝐸𝑛𝑡𝜏,𝑗 = 𝑓𝜏,𝑗 × 𝐻𝑗 × 𝑠𝑗                                 (5)




                                                 15
SentEnt is intended to capture the possibility that extreme sentiment (either positive or negative)

may have more information content for future market outcomes when it occurs in articles that

appear unusual (i.e. have high entropy).




2.1.1. Aggregation of Article Data at the Daily and Monthly Level


Once we have article level data – either entropy, context specific sentiment or entropy, or topic

frequency – we aggregate these into a country level daily measure by weighting by the number

of words (total, not just econ words) in the article in question divided by the total number of

words in all articles about that country on a given day. For example, daily topic sentiment is

                                                      𝑎𝑗
                                           𝑠𝜏 ≡ ∑        × 𝑠𝜏,𝑗                                   (6)
                                                      𝑎
                                                 𝑗


where a is the total number of words in all articles mentioning a given country on a given day.

The analogous definition is applied for article entropy and frequency. The monthly measure of

either sentiment, entropy, or topic frequency for a given country is the simple average of that

month’s daily measures.




2.2. Data Summary and Preliminary Analysis


Table 5 contains a brief description of the variables used in our analysis, and Table 6 contains

summary statistics for those variables from 1998 to 2015. Several features of the data are worth

mentioning. Compared to DM, EM returns were higher (1.04% vs 0.65% per month), more

volatile (21.48% vs 19.20% annualized volatility), and subject to higher drawdowns (17.4% vs

15.3%). As reported by Ghysels et al. (2016), EM returns are also more right skewed as retpl

                                                 16
(the positive portion of returns) averages 3.9% for EM and only 2.8% for DM, and retpl is also

more persistent for emerging markets with an AR(1) coefficient of 0.12 vs 0.05 for developed

markets. Emerging markets grew faster (gdp), had higher inflation (gdpdefaltor), higher nominal

interest rates (rate), and lower private sector debt to GDP ratios (cp). The average number of

articles per day for EM countries is 26.0 and for DM countries is 106.7. The fraction of these

articles dealing with Corp, Govt, and Mkt topics are similar, and EM countries have many more

Comms articles (15.9% for EM vs only 2.7% for DM). Finally, the average article level entropy

for both corpora is roughly 2.45.




2.2.1. Structural Break Around the Financial Crisis


       Figures 4 and 5 provide factor loadings and plots for each topic category related to the

first two principal components for the 140 EM (5 series for 28 countries) and 120 DM (5 series

for 24 countries) time series of country-month-topic sentiment. The first principal component

(both for EMs and DMs) tracks the aggregate time series of market movements. For both EMs

and DMs, the second principal component appears as a step function with a break at the timing

of the global financial crisis. Interestingly, the second principal component has different factor

loadings (both in sign and in absolute value) across different topic areas. Govt sentiment enters

negatively and Mkt sentiment enters positively for the second principal component. That means

that, prior to 2007, the sentiment score of market topic-related articles was more positive than

government topic-related articles. That higher relative magnitude reversed after 2007, and the

sentiment score of market topic-related articles became relatively negative in comparison with

government topic-related articles. In our regression findings below, we find important related



                                                 17
breaks in regression coefficients (and some reversals in sign) that are related to this structural

break in 2007-2008.




3. Empirical Findings


Here we present our empirical findings about the connections between various measures of word

flow and our measures of expected return, the standard deviation of returns (sigma) and

cumulative downside risk (drawdown). As a starting point for our analysis, following Tetlock et

al.’s (20008) and Hendershott et al.’s (2015) analysis of company returns, we perform an event

study of country stock returns around days in which sentiment scores for news for a given

country are extremely positive or extremely negative. Specifically, we identify days for which

positive or negative sentiment lies in the top decile of the historical distribution, and we do this

for each of the five topical categories, separately for EMs and DMs. Figures 6 and 7 plot

cumulative abnormal returns (for EMs and DMs, respectively) for the 10 days prior to and

subsequent to the identified event dates (which appear as day 0 in the figures). Abnormal returns

for each country are the residuals from regressing that country’s US dollar returns on a constant

and the appropriate MSCI index (either DM or EM) over the entire sample period.11 We plot

these abnormal returns separately for positive and negative news dates, along with standard error




11
  When running lagged regressions prior to the event date as the control, we noticed that the pre-event estimated
alpha was correlated with the news event itself. Positive (negative) news days tended to be preceded by positive
(negative) alphas. Because of this, the pre-event window was not an appropriate baseline return model, and
therefore we used a regression over the entire sample as the control.

                                                         18
bands.12 We also plot (in between the positive and negative top deciles) the results for the middle

decile (45th-55th percentile) as a placebo.13


         Interestingly, the plots for EMs and DMs are quite similar for the four common topical

categories (Mkt, Govt, Comms, and Corp), and surprisingly, are also quite similar for the fifth

(dissimilar) topical category (Macro for EMs, and Credit for DMs). For both sets of countries,

the shapes of cumulative abnormal returns around event dates are often similar for negative and

positive news, although there are also some interesting asymmetries. Positive and negative

cumulative returns tend to occur in advance of, respectively, positive and negative big news

days, with the exception of negative news days for Govt and Comms in DMs and also positive

news days for Comms in DMs.


         One noteworthy aspect of the event studies is that news events appear to cause more of a

market reaction in our DM sample than in our EM sample (note the bigger event day price jump

in the former compared to the latter). This reflects either more timely reporting by Reuters in

their developed market news bureaus, or information leakage (perhaps due to weaker regulatory

enforcement) in EM economies.


         It is interesting to compare our event studies to those in Tetlock et al. (2008) – their

Figure 3. Our country level abnormal returns, relative to their US firm level abnormal returns,

have more pronounced pre- and post-event drifts around negative news events – a finding that



12
   Our standard errors are calculated under the assumption of serial and cross-sectional independence of events.
Both assumptions are problematic in our data. Furthermore, it is possible that the pre-event country index
performance has a causal relationship to the news event itself. Proper inference in this setting is beyond the scope of
the present paper, and our standard errors should be interpreted with this caution in mind.
13
   The decile cutoffs are calculated over the entire sample. Note that the numbers of events in our three decile
buckets are not the same. We bucket by the daily sentiment in each of the topic categories. Some of these event
dates are either on non-trading days (e.g. weekends) or within 10 days of the start or end of the sample. We do not
include such event days for the calculation of abnormal returns.

                                                          19
seems to hold for both EM (for Mkt and Comms topics) and DM (for Mkt and Credit topics)

markets. In Tetlock et al. (2008) abnormal returns on stocks seem to be very weakly mean-

reverting following negative news. Both their results and ours – in some cases – show a weak

positive drift after positive news events. This more pronounced post-event country-level drift

after negative news suggests that long/short news-based strategies may be more profitable at the

country level than the individual stock level. Though tentative, this is potentially further

evidence of the relative micro efficiency and macro inefficiency of markets (see Glasserman and

Mamaysky 2016b for a theoretical exploration of this question).


           In results not reported here, we investigated whether these extreme positive and negative

news days are predictable based on prior days’ sentiment scores. We found no evidence of a pre-

event drift in sentiment – sentiment did not decrease (increase) in the 10 days leading up to a

bottom (top) decile negative sentiment day. Our evidence suggests that news reports respond

more slowly to underlying market or economic developments than do returns. This does not

imply, however, that word flow measures lack predictive content for returns. Indeed, as our

monthly analysis below shows, lagged word flow measures (including sentiment) do have

predictive content for return, sigma and drawdown.




3.1 Panel Regression Analysis of Risk and Return in EMs and DMs


           Turning to our regression analysis, in Tables 7-12, we report regressions employing

country-month observations, divided into EM and DM samples, for our three dependent

variables (return12, sigma and drawdown).14 We regress month t values of the dependent


14
     Regression results for one-month ahead returns are shown in Supplementary Appendix Tables A3 and A4.

                                                        20
variables on lagged (either t-1 or t-2) values of our explanatory variables. Our regressions are

panels with country-month data, and country fixed effects. Section A.6 in the Appendix

discusses some associated econometric issues. In each table, we report nine different

regressions, which consist of three regressions for each of three time periods. The three time

periods are April 1998-December 2015 (the entire sample period), April 1998-February 2007

(the pre-global financial crisis period), and March 2007-December 2015 (the post-global

financial crisis period).


         Within each time period we first report a Baseline regression, which includes control

variables (non-textual predictors of the three dependent variables). Controls include two lags of

monthly returns (for the sigma regressions we use 𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑚𝑖 = max(−𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛, 0) instead based on

the findings in Bekaert and Hoerova 2014), two lags of monthly volatility, and single lags of

other financial, macroeconomic, and electoral cycle control variables, all of which are described

in Table 5. We included indicator variables that capture electoral timing by dividing time periods

into pre-election and post-election periods, as described in Section 2 and the Appendix.15


         In addition to the Baseline regression, for each time period, we report two additional

regressions which examine the incremental predictive power of various word flow measures.

Each of these specifications includes country level monthly entropy (entropyt-1), the monthly

average of daily article counts (artcountt-1), and the monthly frequency measure fτ for each topic.

The first specification (in column labeled Sent) includes each topic sentiment measure in its



15
  There is a large literature on forecasting country-level returns. The general conclusion has been that stock-level
effects largely are also present at the country index level. For example, lagged valuation ratios and lagged interest
rates have all been shown to forecast country-level returns (see Asness et al. 1997, Ang and Bekaert 2007, Angelidis
and Tessaromatis 2017, Hjalmarsson 2010, among many others). Also, momentum and reversal effects have been
documented (Asness et al. 2013 and Richards 1997). We control for these effects, and also introduce other market
(exchange rate changes) and macroeconomic (inflation, GDP growth, etc.) variables as additional controls.

                                                         21
simple form, i.e. 𝑠𝜏,𝑗 . The second specification (labeled SentEnt) includes the entropy interacted

versions of the sentiment variables (SentEntτ,j from (5)) . In the tables, we label rows showing

the loadings on 𝑠𝜏,𝑗 and SentEntτ,j as sMkt, sGovt, and so on; the column heading specifies

whether these refer to the simple or the entropy interacted topic sentiment. All sentiment

measures, except entropy, are normalized to have unit variance at the country level. See the

Appendix for more details about our regression specifications.


        Our findings with respect to Baseline variables’ effects generally are consistent with prior

studies and will not be commented on further here.16 Our results differ across EMs and DMs

(coefficient values are not consistent across the two groups of countries), and overall, return,

sigma and drawdown tend to be more predictable for DMs (as measured by higher R-squared).

This confirms the view that the nature of news, and the range of potential news outcomes, differ

in EMs and DMs (reflecting important differences in the political and economic environments,

which are reflected in returns outcomes). Further observations follow.


Similarity of effect for returns and risk. When a word flow measure has a positive (negative)

effect on return, it often tends to have a negative (positive) effect on sigma and a negative effect

on drawdown. In other words, news contained in word flow is often either “good” or “bad” for

all three dependent variables, where good news increases return and reduces risk measured either

by sigma or drawdown. In fact, we never observe a coefficient in a return regression that is of




16
  We observe, as have others (e.g. Fama and French 1988) very little forecasting power for one-month ahead
returns. One interesting finding is that GDP growth is negatively associated with returns and positively associated
with drawdown. We can think of many potential explanations for this finding. First, it may be that positive GDP
growth raises the probability of contractionary monetary policy, which may be bad news for the stock market.
Second, it is possible that GDP growth serves as a proxy for states of the world in which coefficients on other
variables in the model (such as momentum or value) would change if the model permitted time-varying parameters.

                                                        22
the same sign (and statistically significant) as the same variable’s coefficient in a sigma or

drawdown regression.


Incremental R-squared. The economic importance of word flow measures (incremental

contribution to R-squared) tends to be relatively small for return and sigma, both in EMs and

DMs, compared to their contribution to return12 and drawdown. Volatility (sigma) is the most

predictable of the three dependent variables, with values ranging from 0.45 to 0.48 in DMs and

from 0.32 to 0.40 for EMs. The usefulness of Baseline control variables is especially high for

predicting sigma in DMs, and the incremental contribution of word flow to sigma is small in

DMs.


Effects of Specific Text Measures. In EMs, the economic importance of word flow measures is

higher for all three measures, but it is especially high for return12 and drawdown. In DMs, R-

squared increases for return12 and drawdown, respectively, too (rising from 0.16 to 0.21, and

from 0.26 to 0.32 for the sample period as a whole). In EMs, the absolute value of the increase is

slightly larger, but the increase in R-squared as a proportion of Baseline R-squared is much

larger: for the sample period as a whole, including text measures roughly doubled the R-squared

for both return12 and drawdown (from 0.07 to 0.13 and from 0.06 to 0.12). For the pre-crisis

period, that difference between EMs and DMs is even greater: for EMs, R-squared for return12

and drawdown rise from 0.02 to 0.13 and from 0.08 to 0.22, while for DMs these increase from

0.27 to 0.30 and from 0.40 to 0.45. We interpret this as confirming that the nature of news tends

to be different in EMs and DMs: In EMs, where events reported in the news often contain

information about fundamental shifts in political and economic regimes (which is relatively

absent in DMs) the incremental value of tracking word flow is greater.



                                                 23
       The impacts of individual text flow measures on annual returns and drawdowns often are

economically large. In DMs, text measures are only significant for one year ahead returns (as

shown in Table 7) during the period after 2007. During that period, a one standard deviation

increase in entropy is associated with a 3.7% higher return over the next year (the product of its

standard deviation, 0.17, and its coefficient, 21.87). A standard deviation increase in sMkt is

associated with a 5.2% increase in return, while a standard deviation increase in sGovt is

associated with a 3.9% reduction in return.


       Magnitudes for drawdowns (shown in Table 11) are comparable for the aforementioned

variables (and signs are opposite), with the exception of the drawdown consequences of an

increase in entropy, which are about half as large in absolute value. Additionally, in the

drawdown regressions for the earlier subperiod, entropy and sCorp are statistically significant. A

one standard deviation increase in entropy now forecasts an increase in drawdown (of roughly

the same absolute value, and the opposite sign as observed for the later period). A one standard

deviation increase in sCorp forecasts a 1.5% decrease in drawdown.


       In EMs, as shown in Table 8, more text flow measures are statistically significant for one

year ahead returns. A standard deviation increase in artcount forecasts a 10.5% decline in returns

in the early subperiod; there is no significant effect in the later subperiod. entropy does not enter

significantly in either subperiod. fMkt switches signs from a large negative returns effect (-11.0%

per standard deviation) in the earlier period to a large positive effect (8.8%) in the later period.

fGovt enters negatively in the earlier subperiod with a large magnitude (-10.4%), but it does not

enter in the later period. sCorp enters negatively in the later period (-8.2%), but not in the earlier

period. fCorp enters negatively in the earlier period, but not in the later period. fMacro does not



                                                  24
enter significantly in either subperiod, but its sign is consistently positive, and for the combined

period, it shows a large and statistically significant effect of 5.9%.


        More variables are statistically significant in the EM drawdown regressions (Table 12),

often in both subperiods. Coefficient magnitudes are similarly large and, when statistically

significant, are of opposite sign to those observed in the returns regressions. A one standard

deviation increase in entropy flips from forecasting an increase in drawdowns of 5.9% (0.17 x

34.498) in the earlier subperiod to forecasting a decrease of 3.8% in the later subperiod. sComms

enters negatively in drawdowns, which mainly reflects its forecasting power pre-2007.


Entropy Interactions. Somewhat contrary to the findings in Glasserman and Mamaysky

(2016a) (which focused on financial corporations’ and US stock market returns, rather than

country returns around the world) we do not find that interacting sentiment measures with

entropy, the SentEnt specification, adds much explanatory power. Coefficient magnitudes and R-

squareds sometimes rise and sometimes fall across Sent and SentEnt specifications, but the

changes tend to be small; interacting sentiment with entropy adds little. By itself, however,

entropy enters as a significant in-sample predictor of drawdown for DMs and EMs in both sub-

periods, of sigma in EMs for the pre-2007 sub-period, of return in DMs in the post-2007 sub-

period and of EMs in both sub-periods, and of return12 for DMs in the post-2007 period.17


Time Variation in Coefficients. Consistent with our principal component discussion in Section

2, we find important differences in coefficient values for word flow measures over time – that is,



17
  As we discuss below, out-of-sample results shown in Figures 10-12 and Appendix Figure A2 confirm the
importance of including entropy in the model. We find that entropy is chosen for inclusion in the parsimonious
elastic net model, for both EMs and DMs, for return and return12, for drawdown, and for sigma, although its
importance and its sign vary over time. See also the discussion in Section 3.2.



                                                        25
differences between the pre-2007 and post-2007 periods. Tables A1 and A2 in the

Supplementary Appendix summarize our panel results by subperiod. A “+” (“-”) in the table

indicates that an explanatory variable enters with a positive (negative) coefficient, and is

significant at the 10% level or better. The symbol “Ø” indicates that the explanatory variable is

not present in that specification (for example, returnt-1 is not present in the sigma panels). For

DMs, negative coefficients on return for fGovt and sGovt are a feature of the post-2007 sub-

period, as is the positive coefficient for return for sMkt and sCorp. For EMs, positive fGovt is

associated with larger drawdown in the earlier sub-period, but not in the later. For EMs, the

coefficient on entropy in the return12 regression is zero across the two sub-periods, while the

coefficients on entropy in the drawdown regressions flip from positive to negative. For DM

return12, entropy matters (positively) only in the post-2007 period. entropy has no effect on DM

sigma. For DM drawdown, entropy flips from positive significant to negative significant as we

move from the earlier to the later sub-period. This sign flipping for entropy is examined in more

detail in Section 3.2 below.


Sign of Sentiment and Market Outcomes. Topical context matters for the influence of

frequency and sentiment. Coefficients for sentiment or frequency can be positive or negative,

depending on the topic area, and depending on the period. There is no general finding that

positive sentiment is always associated with good news. In DMs and EMs, positive sGovt or

fGovt can be bad news, and positive sCorp or fCorp can also be a negative news event; whereas

positive sMkt is typically good news for DMs and positive sComms and fMacro are typically

good news for EMs. Clearly, there is something to be gained by considering the context in which

positive or negative sentiment is expressed. Note that sentiment is statistically significant as bad

news only in the later sub-period (although frequency of market, government and corporate news


                                                 26
is negative in EMs in the earlier subperiod). sCorp has a significant negative sign for EM return

and return12 and marginally negative for DM return12 and a significant positive sign for

drawdown in EMs only for the later sub-period; and sGovt has a significant negative sign for DM

return and marginally negative for return12 and a significant positive sign for drawdown only for

the later sub-period.


       One interpretation of our findings on sentiment is that negative sentiment can indicate

good news if the negative sentiment is describing problems that government actions are trying to

address. The notion that negative sentiment in the context of government responses is reflecting

positive policy news events could also explain the post-crisis timing of the surprising coefficients

for sentiment. In Section 3.4, we show that Govt and Corp sentiment and frequency both predict

increases in future economic policy uncertainty (Baker, Bloom and Davis 2016) for DMs, which

suggests that a policy channel is potentially at work. A similar pre- and post-crisis difference in

influence could explain the observed sign flipping with respect to entropy. In the pre-crisis

period, unusual word flow generally indicates risky times, but in the context of the post-crisis

period, unusual word flow may be associated with unprecedented policy actions.




3.2 Pre- and Post-Crisis Differences in the Meaning of News Flow


To address this pre- and post-crisis interpretation of the two anomalies observed above – the

negative news content of sCorp and sGovt in the post-2007 sub-period, and the flipping of the

sign on entropy to imply positive news content in the post-2007 sub-period – we take a closer

look at the changing patterns of co-occurrence among entropy, sentiment, and topical frequency

over time. To examine the nature of the role of crisis influences, we divide the post-February


                                                27
2007 time-period into two sub-periods: the global crisis period from March 2007 to August 2011

(the midpoint of the post-February 2007 period), and the sub-period after August 2011. By

splitting the post-February 2007 period in half, we are able to investigate whether post-crisis

differences reflect changes that persist throughout the period, or changes that are only related to

the onset of the global financial crisis. As before, we consider EM and DM countries separately.


       Figures 8 and 9 display our results, for EM and DM countries respectively. We find that

there are, indeed, changes in the patterns of co-occurrence among entropy, sentiment and topical

frequency across time, and that these differ in interesting ways for EMs and DMs. In each

Figure, we plot sentiment and frequency by topic first for all country-days within each sub-

period, and additionally, for country-day observations in the top fifth percentile of entropy. Each

chart shows the difference between the average country-day sentiment in that sub-period/entropy

grouping (e.g., the early subsample-high entropy group, or the late subsample-average entropy

group) and the full sample average, normalized by the full sample standard deviation. For

example, the top-left chart in Figure 9 shows that in the 1996—2007 time period for DMs,

average government sentiment was 0.15 standard deviations lower than the full sample average,

whereas credit sentiment was 0.05 standard deviations higher. Our focus is on how sentiment

and frequency by topic vary across time and across high versus typical entropy days. Our

interpretation is that high entropy days contain particularly informative news flow, and are

therefore worth singling out for analysis.


       With respect to the top two panels of Figures 8 and 9, using all the articles in each sub-

period, we observe substantial changes over time in topical frequency and topic-specific

sentiment, which differ between EMs and DMs. This variation could account for the fact that our

regression specifications in Tables 7-12 gained little from including interactions between entropy

                                                 28
and sentiment (contrary to Glasserman and Mamaysky 2016). It may be that modeling sentiment

as topic-specific and including topical frequency as a regressor, in an environment with such

dramatic change over sub-periods in topical frequencies, captures much of the interaction

between entropy and sentiment that would not otherwise be captured.


       Conditional on observing high entropy country-days in EMs, the relative frequencies of

the five topics are nearly constant over time. High entropy days in EM are associated with fewer

market and more government related articles. Interestingly, high entropy days in EM are

associated with generally lower sentiment levels across all topics except markets relative to

average entropy days. Furthermore, high entropy EM days exhibit important changes over time

in topic-specific sentiment. In high entropy days, government topic-related sentiment becomes

less negative during the March 2007-August 2011 sub-period than it was before, commodities-

related sentiment scores become much more negative, and other topics show little change. In

other words, unusual news related to commodities during the height of the global crisis tended to

be negative in EMs. News related to government had slightly less negative sentiment during high

entropy days that it had in the first period. EM country discussions related to government (which

always tend to be sentiment negative in high entropy days) are less sentiment negative during the

height of the global crisis. After August 2011, the topic-specific sentiment scores for high

entropy days in EMs revert to their pre-March 2007 pattern.


       As in EMs, high-entropy days in DMs are typically associated with lower sentiment in all

topic areas (except markets). The sub-periods patterns for DMs during high entropy days are

somewhat different however. First, for the pre-March 2007 sub-period, the high-entropy-day

topical sentiment scores are quite similar to those of EMs. Second, as in EMs, during the second

sub-period government-related articles on high entropy days are less negative than before,

                                                29
although they are still very negative relative to average entropy days in that sub-period. But for

DMs, all the other topical areas on high-entropy days become more negative in their sentiment

scores during the post-February 2007 period (with commodities-related sentiment scores

showing the least change). It is not surprising that unusual DM news days related to commodities

during the crisis were less negative than for EMs, given that DMs tend to be users rather than

producers of commodities relative to EMs. Neither is it surprising that DMs, where the global

crisis originated (with housing and banking crises originating in the U.S., Ireland, Spain, and the

U.K.), are the countries where unusual news during the post-February 2007 period became

particularly negative for market, corporate, and credit topics.


       Even more striking is the fact that DM sentiment patterns for high entropy days did not

revert to the pre-March 2007 patterns, as they did in EMs. Instead, DMs saw a continuation of

the post-February 2007 topic-specific patterns for sentiment scores. It appears that the changes in

the structure and content of news related to the onset of the crisis were more persistent in DMs,

where the crisis and policy reactions to it were more long lasting. In additional tests not reported

here, we investigated whether that persistence of DM sentiment negativity for the four non-

government topic areas (relative to the first sub-period) is driven by a sub-sample of Eurozone or

European countries. We found that it was not isolated to Europe or the Eurozone, but reflected

persistent changes associated with the crisis that applied to DMs more generally.


       The patterns observed in Figures 8 and 9 reinforce the interpretation that the two

anomalies reported in Tables 7-12 – the negative news content of sCorp and sGovt in the post-

2007 sub-period, and the flipping of the sign on entropy to imply positive news content in the

post-2007 sub-period – are related to how news coverage and its meaning change during a crisis.

3.3 Persistence of Effects and Endogeneity of News: A Panel VAR Approach


It is noteworthy that the measured effects of news are greatest at long (one-year) time horizons.

This implies that our news measures likely capture fundamental economic influences rather than

transitory “animal spirits” (see also Sinha 2016).18 In the Supplementary Appendix, we provide

another perspective on the duration of news relevance by constructing Panel Vector

Autoregressive (Panel VAR) models, separately for DMs and EMs, which measure the linkages

among sentiment, entropy, monthly return and monthly volatility.19 These results are reported in

Figures A3-A6. This approach is also useful for gauging the extent to which news may itself

reflect past market outcomes. Because of the need to constrain the dimension of the model, we

collapse the various topical sentiment measures into a single sentiment index, which – by

ignoring the topical context – understandably reduces the measured importance of sentiment,

compared to the results reported above. We report two versions of the model: one that puts the

news variables first in the ordering (sentiment, followed by entropy), the other that puts the

return and volatility measures first, followed by sentiment and then by entropy.


         We find that, with minor exceptions, the effects of sentiment and entropy on returns are

similar for EMs and DMs. When sentiment and entropy are first in the ordering, they both

produce positive return responses in the first two months after the shock with no evidence of

subsequent mean-reversion – suggesting both are capturing long-term news and not transitory


18
   Shiller (2017) argues that “animal spirits” can, in fact, have large fundamental economic effects. In the present
work, we are not able to distinguish effects of long-lived animal spirits from news that forecasts economic
fundamentals, but we are able to reject the view that the news that drives market changes reflects short-lived animal
spirits. Shapiro et al. (2018) show that text-based sentiment measures forecast future macroeconomic outcomes in
the US; Thorsrud (2016) presents similar evidence for Norway.
19
   We estimate the VAR using monthly data with two lags and country fixed effects. The variables in the VAR have
units given in Table 6, except the sentiment measure, which scales to have unit variance. We are constrained to
include only variables that capture monthly variation. In particular, we do not include twelve month returns or
drawdowns in the VAR models. However, our impulse response functions allow us to gauge the persistence of
shocks to returns and volatility over many months.

                                                         31
“animal spirits.” When sentiment and entropy are second in the ordering, there is less evidence

of persistent effects on returns, but this is because we do not differentiate sentiment according to

its topical context; it is likely that this approach aggregates positive and negative responses

across different topics.20 Similarly, for both EMs and DMs, positive sentiment forecasts drops in

realized volatility that persist for over a year after the initial shock. This is true regardless of the

ordering of the VAR. In the case of DMs, entropy shocks depress realized volatility for several

months when entropy is the second variable in the system, and have no effect when entropy is

last in the system. Interestingly, in the case of EMs, entropy shocks increase realized volatility

regardless of the ordering of the variables. Sentiment and entropy are also dynamically related:

shocks to either of these variables produces protracted negative results in the other.


         We also find that intertemporal influence flows in both directions. Shocks to returns and

volatility have significant, and sometimes protracted influences on sentiment and entropy.

Return shocks increase sentiment and decrease entropy, while realized volatility shocks decrease

sentiment and increase entropy, again regardless of the ordering. These results highlight the

importance of examining long-term cumulative effects of news on returns and drawdowns, and

of including lagged measures of returns and volatility, as we do in our above models that

evaluate the predictive importance of news flow for future returns, volatility, and drawdowns.21



20
   Our panel regressions in Table 7-12 and our out-of-sample results in Section 4 both show that topic sentiment is
important for future market outcomes even after controlling for lagged returns and volatility. With only 18 years of
monthly data, we do not believe we can reliably estimate a VAR with topic-specific sentiment (with 2 lags this
requires estimating two 8x8 coefficient matrixes).
21
   Our modeling of the effects of text on returns, volatility and drawdown in Tables 7-12 employs one lag of each of
the twelve text measures, but two lags of returns and of volatility. In results not reported here, we also experimented
with adding additional lags of text measures. Doing so slightly improves the statistical significance of text measures
in some cases, raises R-squared slightly, and sometimes diminishes the importance of non-text measures. Overall,
the effect of adding additional lags of text measures is small, and usually divides the explanatory power captured in
the one-lag specifications across the greater number of lags of the text measures in the expanded version. We report
only the one-lag specifications of text measures because doing so is more conservative, and avoids falsely attributing
effects to text measures that can be explained by lagged volatility or returns.

3.4 Comparison with Baker, Bloom and Davis’ A Priori Approach


The Baker, Bloom, Davis (BBD) (2016) index of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) measures

the frequency with which newspapers in a given country mention the words “economy” and

“uncertainty”, along with references to political acts or actors in the same article. For a sub-

sample of EM and DM countries, it is possible to compare our approach to measuring news with

that of BBD (2016). Those countries include 11 DMs (the U.S., Canada, Germany, the U.K.,

Italy, France, Spain, Netherlands, Japan, Australia and Ireland), and 6 EMs (Chile, China, South

Korea, Brazil, Russia and India). Although these DM and EM sub-samples are a small

proportion of the total number of countries in our sample, they represent a very large proportion

of the total economic activity in the larger sample, and therefore, this is a highly relevant sub-

sample. Our sample time frame is from 1998 to 2015.


       In Table 13 we show that our word measures can explain substantial future variation in

the BBD uncertainty measure (Table 13 shows a panel regression of the time t value of EPU on

time t-1values of macro control variables and our text measures). It is interesting to note that we

explain a much larger portion of future EPU variation in the DM sample than the EM sample.

High Mkt sentiment and frequency, high Macro frequency for EM and positive Credit sentiment

for DM forecast lower future EPUs; whereas high Govt and Corp sentiment and frequency in

DM, as well as higher article counts in EM, forecast higher future EPUs. Perhaps this is one

channel through which positive sentiment and high frequency in the Govt and Corp topics

forecast adverse market outcomes, as we discussed in Section 3.1.


       Of greater interest is the explanatory power of the BBD economic policy uncertainty

measure (EPUt-1) for return12, sigma and drawdown, both by itself and in regressions that


                                                 33
include our word flow measures.22 Tables 14 and 15 evaluate the incremental explanatory power

of the BBD measure for those three variables. For each variable we report four regressions: a

Baseline regression that includes neither our word flow measures nor the BBD measure, a

second regression that includes only the BBD measure, a third that includes only our word flow

measures, and a fourth that includes both the BBD measure and our word flow measures.


        For DMs, in the second regressions for each variable in Table 14, the BBD measure does

exhibit incremental explanatory power, but the effects are small. R-squared for return12 is

increased by 0.008, for sigma by 0.002, and for drawdown by 0.011. In contrast, including our

word flow measures raise R-squared by much larger amounts. Furthermore, as shown in the

fourth regressions for each dependent variable, in the presence of our measures, the BBD

measure loses its statistical significance. In other words, the part of the BBD measure that

contains incremental explanatory power for return12, sigma and drawdown is subsumed by our

word flow measures, and our word flow measures also contain additional explanatory power.


        For EMs, the second regression results shown in Table 15, for return12, sigma and

drawdown, show that the BBD measure adds almost no incremental explanatory power for all

three variables relative to the Baseline. Only in the return12 regression does the BBD measure

enter significantly, and then only in the specification that includes all our text measures (adding

the BBD measure there results in a low R-squared increase of 0.008). In contrast, for EMs,

adding our word flow measures meaningfully increases R-squared for all three specifications.

We conclude that our atheoretical approach provides a more effective means of distilling the

information contained in news stories that is relevant for market return and risk.


22
  It should be noted that Baker, Bloom and Davis (2106) argue that economic policy uncertainty is useful in
forecasting macroeconomic – not market – outcomes.

                                                        34
4. Out-of-sample tests


       There are two important reasons to explore out-of-sample forecasting properties of our

model. First, as the above discussion of changes in estimated coefficients reveals, we observe

substantial variation over time in coefficient estimates reported in Tables 7-12, where the timing

of the split was suggested by the principle components analysis reported in Figures 4-5. Given

that variation, it is unclear whether a forward-looking application of our model would produce

useful forecasts of market return and risk. Second, the baseline and augmented models from

Section 3 contain many explanatory – text and non-text – variables which make them susceptible

to overfitting in any given sample.


       When over-fitting is a concern, the typical solution is to penalize coefficient estimates by

shrinking their absolute value based on an objective function that weighs each (normalized)

coefficient’s contribution to explanatory power (which receives a positive weight) against the

magnitude of that coefficient (which receives a negative weight). We use the elastic net estimator

(implemented in the glmnet package of Hastie and Qian 2016), which combines the least

absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression, introduced by Tibshirani (1996),

with a ridge regression, to ameliorate this over-fitting problem. In our panel setting, we estimate

rolling five-year regressions using the elastic net objective function, which is given by


                           1           ′       2
                    min      ∑(𝑦𝑖,𝑡 − 𝑥𝑖,𝑡−1 𝛽) + 𝜆(𝛼‖𝛽‖1 + (1 − 𝛼)‖𝛽‖22 /2)                    (7)
                     𝛽    2𝑁
                             𝑖,𝑡


where N is the total number of observations in the regression, 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 is the response variable,

𝑥𝑖,𝑡−1 is a vector of the predictors, ‖𝛽‖1 is the L1-norm of the coefficients (the sum of the

absolute values of the 𝛽 vector) and ‖𝛽‖22 is the L2-norm squared (the sum of the squares of the



                                                 35
𝛽 coefficients).23 In this specification, we implement country fixed effects by constructing

demeaned y’s and x’s within each country grouping – so a constant in the above regression is not

necessary. The choice of λ determines the penalty applied to the blended L1- and L2-norms of

the coefficients. This parameter is selected in each 60-month window to minimize the cross-

validation error. We set 𝛼 = 0.75 though this choice has little effect on the predictions obtained

from the model (setting 𝛼 < 1 improves the numerical behavior of the algorithm, as discussed in

Hastie and Qian 2016).


        Even a powerful model selection procedure has a hard time when confronted with too

many explanatory variables and a relatively small data set. Therefore, we impose some structure

on our estimation by using only a subset of our non-text variables for the out-of-sample tests:

one-month returns (for our volatility model we use only the negative portion of returns), one-

month realized volatility, our value measure, the private sector credit-to-GDP ratio, and the local

interest rate. Except the credit-to-GDP measure, all of these proxy for well-known asset pricing

effects. The credit-to-GDP ratio was very important in the in-sample regressions (perhaps

because of its predictive power for returns around the financial crisis), and so we keep it for the

out-of-sample tests. These five variables, with a country fixed effect, constitute our out-of-

sample Baseline model. Since we selected variables with known forecasting power for the

Baseline model, we effectively have raised the bar for our text measures to add any value.24 We

keep all our text measures for the out-of-sample tests, except we drop commodity frequency and

sentiment because these were unimportant in most of our full sample regressions. By dropping


23
   One important subtlety in the out-of-sample estimation for 12-month ahead returns and drawdowns is to truncate
the measured 12-month ahead outcomes in the pre time-t+1 estimation window to ensure that they do not overlap
with the t+1 through t+12 outcome that we are trying to forecast out-of-sample.
24
   Had we selected more non-text variables, the out-of-sample performance of the Baseline model would be
degraded because the elastic net would have too many degrees of freedom. Choosing variables that we know will
work a priori makes the Baseline model a tougher comparison.

                                                        36
only two text measures, as opposed to many non-text measures, we believe we are being

conservative in our out-of-sample tests.


        An elastic net regression performs both model selection – many of the β’s can be set to

zero – and shrinkage – the non-zero coefficient estimates are smaller than their OLS

counterparts. A measure of the degree to which elastic net coefficients are smaller than their

OLS counterparts is the ratio ‖𝛽‖1 /‖𝛽 𝑂𝐿𝑆 ‖1. In our empirical results this ratio (reported in the

upper left-hand corners of Figures 10-12 and A2) ranges from close to zero, to nearly 100

percent, meaning that the elastic net sometimes chooses an optimal in-sample model with no

explanatory variables (often this happens for our 1 month return forecasting regressions), and

sometimes chooses a model with coefficient estimates almost as large as their OLS counterparts

(for example, in many windows for forecasting 12 month ahead returns).


        Figures 10-12 show significant changes over time in the elastic net coefficient estimates

for the variables in our model, including the text measures. Coefficients magnitudes, when non-

zero, are large and similar to the statistically significant coefficients identified in Tables 7-12,

and have similar temporal patterns. For example, the flip in the sign of entropy for EM and DM

drawdowns and 12-month ahead returns is visible in the elastic net estimates. When interpreting

coefficient magnitudes it is important to bear in mind that multicollinearity (which, by

construction, is not apparent in elastic net estimates) leads to some non-comparability of

coefficient magnitudes reported in Tables 7-12 and in Figures 10-12. Nevertheless, the elastic net

results reinforce the message of Tables 7-12 about coefficient magnitudes and their variation

over time. One year-ahead return and drawdown display similar pictures (with opposite signs)

for individual variables for EMs and DMs. For example, both sets of results show similar

changes in model fit over time. Value plays an important but varying role in the regressions for

                                                  37
both EMs and DMs, as do sGovt and sMkt. Rate is important, but varying, in DMs. artcount and

fMacro are important, but varying, in EMs. Note that in out-of-sample tests, as well as in our

panel analysis, positive sMkt tends to be good news for future market outcomes, whereas positive

sGovt, fGovt, sCorp and fCorp tend to be bad news.


       It is noteworthy that some variables have very similar coefficient estimates for EMs and

DMs (such as entropy, sGovt, and sCorp), whereas others (like rate and artcount) only seems to

matter in one group (rate for DM, and artcount for EM) but not in the other. The entropy

measure, in particular, is associated with very consistent coefficient estimates between EMs and

DMs in all four of our forecasting specifications.




4.1 Trading Strategy based on Out-of-Sample Model Predictions


       To evaluate the economic importance of our text measures, we analyze how useful

textual information would be to a mean-variance optimizing investor who already had access to

our Baseline model’s out-of-sample forecasts. In other words, we assume an investor forms at

each time t an estimate of future returns and volatility using the five variables that constitute our

Baseline out-of-sample model. We then additionally allow this investor to condition, using only

out-of-sample data, on our text measures. We refer to this as the CM model. Finally, we also

allow an investor to estimate next period’s mean return and volatility for a given country using

only historical return data. We refer to this as the Naïve model (this model is just a rolling

country fixed effect).


       Following Campbell and Thompson (CT, 2008), we assume a myopic mean-variance

investor whose allocation to country i at time t is

                                                 38
                                                         𝑖
                                                   𝐸𝑡 [𝑟𝑡+1 − 𝑟𝑓 ]
                                      𝑤𝑡𝑖   =               𝑖
                                                                                                (8)
                                                𝛾 × 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑡 (𝑟𝑡+1 − 𝑟𝑓 )

This weight is applied to the month t+1 excess return of country i. Like Campbell and Thompson

we cap 𝑤𝑡𝑖 at 1.5, but unlike CT we allow short-selling by imposing a floor of -1.5. A floor of

zero makes sense in the CT setting because they analyze the allocation between cash and the

stock market; but in our context, negative information in our signals about a given country’s

stock returns is useful and ought to be used in the trading strategy, which is feasible given our

focus on country-level stock index trading. Furthermore, we set 𝛾 = 5 (it is 3 in their paper)

because with lower risk aversion our weights often hit the 1.5/-1.5 boundary rendering inter-

model variation less important. Finally, to aggregate country weights into a portfolio at time t

we divide all 𝑤𝑡𝑖 ’s by the number of countries for which we have a time t signal. These weights

are applied to time t+1 returns. The net portfolio position is invested in the US 6-month T-bill.


       The conditional moments in (8) are calculated using either the out-of-sample Naïve,

Baseline or CM model (the latter two are estimated using the elastic net model). We use the

model’s 12-month ahead return estimate to proxy for the forward-looking monthly return

expectation (estimating the model using one-month ahead returns does not identify the proper

dependencies in the data because the time horizon is too short – as we discuss further below),

and we use the square of the model’s one-month ahead volatility estimate for the conditional

variance (both quantities are reported in annualized terms). The portfolio is held for one month,

and then reconstituted at time t+1 (to then realize time t+2 returns) based on the month t+1

ending information. Since we use a five-year window, our first portfolio is formed in April of

2003 and our last is formed in December of 2015. The aggregate amount invested varies




                                                    39
between -0.5 and 1.4 times the portfolio capital, so the strategy we have parameterized is not

overly levered. We run the strategy separately for our EM and DM countries.


        We intentionally ignore portfolio level optimization (e.g., correlations across countries)

and also employ (as do Campbell and Thompson) a myopic investment rule, to isolate the

informational content of our text measures. Our approach follows DeMiguel, Garlappi and

Uppal (2007) in using (i) rolling 5-year estimates of conditional moments to form myopic mean-

variance portfolios, and (ii) an equal-weighted portfolio (in our case, equally weighted across

countries though each country allocation varies according to equation (8)). We use overlapping

12-month observations to estimate how expected returns depend on our predictors in order to

address the well-known problems of estimation error with using short-horizon returns.25 In fact,

Britten-Jones et al. (2011) show that a predictive model with overlapping returns can be

transformed into a predictive model for one-period ahead returns but with a properly transformed

set of regressors. Our use of the untransformed 12-month ahead forecast in a monthly

rebalanced myopic portfolio is certainly suboptimal,26 but is transparent and captures enough of

the underlying structure in the data to lead to meaningful results.


        To evaluate the economic significance of our results we estimate the three-factor

international asset pricing model suggested by Brusa, Ramadorai, and Verdelhan (2017),

henceforth BRV. Our factors are the net total return of the MSCI global index, the return on a

currency carry trade, and the return on an investment in the US dollar funded by borrowing

   For example, Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005) claim on p. 139 that to see the underlying economic structure in their
model for bond returns they can’t use monthly observations, and must use overlapping annual ones. Also see
Britten-Jones, Neuberger, and Nolte (2011).

against a basket of global currencies.27 Table 16 shows the results of these regressions. The CM

strategy generates lower market exposures than the Baseline and Naïve models. Both strategies

have minimal exposures to the currency carry factor, and are short the dollar (which is a

mechanical outcome of a net long in foreign stock markets without hedging the currency

exposure). We note that for both EM and DM strategies, the Naïve strategy (i.e. rolling country-

level means and volatilities) leads to very poor investment outcomes. The Baseline model is

better, and leads to an economically significant 6.8% annual alpha for DM countries (in general,

with a single series with 153 monthly observations we will not have much power against the

null), although the Baseline model delivers a much weaker 3.27% alpha for EM countries. The

CM model, which augments the Baseline model with our text measures, is the best performer in

both samples, with an annual alpha of 8.8% in each – this is a very large economic effect, though

the alpha is statistically significant only in the EM sample.


        Given our interest in the incremental information content of textual measures, perhaps the

more interesting aspect of our analysis is not the absolute values of the alphas but whether the

difference between the alphas of the CM and Baseline models is large. As Panel B of Table 16

shows, the difference is 2% per year for DMs and 5.5% percent per year for EMs. Both

differences are clearly important economically, and especially so for EM countries. Differences

are also statistically significant at standard levels.28 This confirms our finding from the in-



27
   The currency carry trade and US dollar index return data are available from Lustig and Verdelhan’s websites, but
do not cover our entire sample. Instead, for the carry trade we use the Deutsche Bank Currency Carry USD Total
Return Index, and for the US dollar index we use the US Dollar Index. The US Dollar Index is adjusted to have a
negative 1.8% per year carry to match the average return of the US dollar index obtained from Lustig and
Verdelhan. This adjusted dollar index and the Deutsche Bank carry trade index match the BRV factors very closely
in the part of the sample where they overlap. The MSCI returns and both currency series are obtained from
Bloomberg.
28
   The reason we have much more power to reject the null that the differences are zero is because the residuals from
the CM and Baseline models are highly positively correlated (over 90%) which leads to their difference having very
little volatility.

EM countries. In a carefully constructed out-of-sample test we have shown that by using modern

model selection techniques, we are able to use the information content of our text-based country

level measures to meaningfully improve on investment performance.




5. Conclusion


We believe this is the first study of country-level stock returns and risks that relates news to

future risk and return. We develop an atheoretical approach for capturing news through various

word flow measures, including sentiment, frequency, unusualness (entropy), and the topical

context in which these word flow outcomes occur. We apply that approach to 51 countries over

the time period 1998 to 2015. We find that it is possible to develop a parsimonious and flexible

approach to extract from news flow information that is useful for forecasting equity market risk

and returns. We find that news contained in our text flow measures forecasts one year ahead

returns and drawdowns. One interpretation of this finding is that word flow captures “collective

unconscious” aspects of news that are not understood at the time articles appear, but that capture

influences on the market that have increasing relevance over time. It may be that these

unconscious aspects of news even influence fundamental economic behavior in ways that

produce changes in returns and risks, as conjectured by Shiller (2017).


       We consider the importance of topical context by giving all news articles weights

according to the topics they cover. Topical context is defined using the Louvain method for

grouping words into clusters, or word groups. In our sample, there are five such topic clusters for

EMs and five for DMs, four of which are common to both sets of countries.


                                                 42
       It is useful to divide news analysis of countries by considering EMs and DMs separately,

because the basic statistical properties of news and returns are different for the two sets of

countries, as are the relevant topics for news stories.


       Principal components analysis of topic areas suggests a possible change in coefficient

values occurs during the onset of the global financial crisis. We divide our sample period into

two at February 2007 to take this change into account, and we find that coefficient values on

various word flow measures do change over time.


       Our word flow measures (sentiment, frequency, and entropy) capture important aspects

of news that are relevant for returns, volatility, and drawdown risk, and have incremental

predictive power over and above a Baseline specification of standard control variables.

Coefficient magnitudes of text flow measures are often large. News tends to divide into good or

bad news that is relevant both for returns or for risk (measured either by volatility or drawdown).


       The predictive content of sentiment, frequency and entropy not only vary over time, but

are also context-specific. Depending on the topic area of the article in which word flow appears,

and the timing, some positive sentiment news days appear as negative news events.


       Word flow measures tend to have greater incremental predictive power (measured in

terms of percentage improvement in R-squared) for understanding returns and risks in EMs,

although they also have important incremental predictive power for returns and drawdowns in

DMs.


       We compare the predictive power of our atheoretical approach to analyzing the word

flow of news with the Baker, Bloom and Davis approach to measuring economic policy

uncertainty through an a priori identification of key words. We find that our approach is

                                                  43
correlated with the BBD measure. The BBD measure, however, has much less incremental

explanatory power for returns, volatility and drawdown risk than our word flow measures, and in

regressions that include both the BBD measure and our measures, the BBD measure loses

statistical significance.


          We perform out-of-sample testing using an elastic net regression to investigate whether

our model is economically useful despite the large number of explanatory variables and the time

variation in estimated coefficient parameters. From the standpoint of out-of-sample trading

strategies, the additional alpha generated by using text flow measures is greater in EMs. For both

DMs and EMs, text measures contribute significantly to improvements in out-of-sample

forecasts relative to a Baseline model that excludes text measures.


          We conclude that the meaning of news flow can be captured usefully through a small

number of atheoretical measures (sentiment, frequency and entropy). The meaning of those

measures for stock market risk and return vary over time, vary across EMs and DMs, and vary

according to the topical context in which sentiment and frequency are measured. Thus, it is

important to distinguish across country types and topical contexts, and permit coefficient

estimates to vary over time, when using text to forecast risk and return. Nevertheless, we find

that it is possible to construct a parsimonious and flexible forecasting model that maps usefully

from these atheoretical, context-specific measures of news flow into equity market risk and

return.

Figure 6: Event studies of cumulative abnormal returns on days that are in the bottom,
middle (45%-55%) and top deciles by sentiment for each topic. Abnormal returns are the
residuals from a regression of US dollar country index returns on a EM market index and
a constant. Cumulative returns are shown in basis points, with two standard error bands.
The cumulative return on the day prior to the event is labeled. The number of events in
each study is shown on the plot. Events runs from Jan 1, 1996 to Dec 31, 2015.

Figure 7: Event studies of cumulative abnormal returns on days that are in the bottom,
middle (45%-55%) and top deciles by sentiment for each topic. Abnormal returns are the
residuals from a regression of US dollar country index returns on a DM market index and
a constant. Cumulative returns are shown in basis points, with two standard error bands.
The cumulative return on the day prior to the event is labeled. The number of events in
each study is shown on the plot. Events runs from Jan 1, 1996 to Dec 31, 2015.

Figure 8: The sample is split into three time periods – pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis.
Within each subperiod, the first row shows: the average sentiment by topic in that sub-
sample minus the full-sample topic mean, divided by the full sample standard deviation
of topic sentiment. The second row shows the same calculation but for topic frequency.
The third row shows the same measure (sentiment) as in row 1 but restricted to coun-

Figure 9: The sample is split into three time periods – pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis.
Within each subperiod, the first row shows: the average sentiment by topic in that sub-
sample minus the full-sample topic mean, divided by the full sample standard deviation
of topic sentiment. The second row shows the same calculation but for topic frequency.
The third row shows the same measure (sentiment) as in row 1 but restricted to coun-
try/day observations in the top 5% by entropy. The fourth row shows the same measure
(frequency) as in row 2 but again for only the top 5% of country/days by entropy.

Figure 10: The charts show the time series of coefficient estimates from a rolling elastic
net regression to forecast 12 month returns. The chart labeled “l1 % of OLS” gives the
ratio of the elastic net coefficient l1 -norm to the OLS coefficient l1 -norm in every time
period. The elastic net regressions are run over rolling 60-month windows, with weighting
parameter chosen to minimize cross-validation error. The penalty is 0.75 elastic net and
0.25 ridge regression.

Figure 12: The charts show the time series of coefficient estimates from a rolling elastic
net regression to forecast realized volatility. The chart labeled “l1 % of OLS” gives the
ratio of the elastic net coefficient l1 -norm to the OLS coefficient l1 -norm in every time
period. The elastic net regressions are run over rolling 60-month windows, with weighting
parameter chosen to minimize cross-validation error. The penalty is 0.75 elastic net and
0.25 ridge regression.

Table 1: List of EM and DM countries and their associated stock market index from
Bloomberg (“BBG Index”) as well as their country code (“TR Code”) in the Thomson-
Reuters Machine Readable News archive. The EM and DM rows refer to the MSCI EM
and DM indexes respectively, which are used as the market benchmark in several sections
of the paper. Iceland is used in our event studies and in the topic clustering analysis, but
is excluded from all our panel and out-of-sample forecasting analysis.

     Table 15: Results of the panel regressions from Tables A3, 7, 9 and 11 modified to include the BBD policy uncertainty index
     as an explanatory variable. Results are shown for the full period regressions. Countries included: Brazil, Chile, China, India,
     Russia, and South Korea. All text measures except entropy are normalized to unit variance. All panels include country fixed
     effects and standard errors are clustered either by time or by time and country (labeled “both”); the stderr row indicates the
     type of calculation, and “***”,“**”, and “*” indicate significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels respectively.

Table 16: Panel A shows coefficients estimates from the LRV 3-factor model estimated
with monthly returns. Alphas are reported annualized in percent. T-statistics are shown
in parentheses. Panel B shows t-tests of the differences of alphas between the CM and
Base models. All standard errors in both panels are calculated using Newey-West with
auto lag selection.
     The three forecasting models are: Naive which uses only in sample country fixed
effects as the forecasting variables; Base which includes lagged macroeconomic and lagged
market variables as the regressors; and CM which includes country specific article counts,
entropy, sentiment and frequency measures in addition to the variables from the Base
model. Forecasts come from rolling elastic net regressions. The elastic net regressions
are run over rolling 60-month windows, with weighting parameter chosen to minimize
cross-validation error. The penalty is 0.75 elastic net and 0.25 ridge regression.
