                                      ABSTRACT



         Recent work   demonstrates that dynastic assumptions gtarantee the
irrelevance of all redistributional policies, distortionary taxes, and
prices——the neutrality      of fiscal policy (Ricardian equivalence) is only

the "tip of the iceburg.'       In this paper, we investigate the possibility

of reinstating approximate Ricardian equivalence by introducing a small

amount of friction in intergenerational links. If Ricardian equivalence
depends upon significantly snorter chains of links than do these
stronger    neutrality results, then friction may dissipate the effects

that generate strong neutrality, without significantly affecting the

Ricardian result.       Although this intuition turns out to be essentially

correct, we show that models with small amounts of friction have other

untenable implications.      We conclude that the theoretical case for

Ricardlan equivalence remains tenuous.

 1.    Introduction
       In recent years, Robert Barro's [1974] version of "Ricardian
equivalence" has stimulated much controversy concerning the effects of
government   budget deficits and social security programs.              In his well—

known paper, Barro supplented           the traditional overlapping generations

model with intergenerational altruism, and argued, in essence, that

voluntary transfers between parents and children cause the represen-

tative family to behave as though it is a single, infinite—lived

individual——a "dynastic" unit.          From the point of view of the family,

neither debt nor social security alters available alternatives; both are

therefore neutral.      Thus,    Barro's analysis identifies the strength of

intergenerational altruism as a key factor in determining tne effects of

government   bond   issues and public pension programs.
      Recently, Bernheim and Bagwell [1988] have argued against the
applicability of Ricardian equivalence by demonstrating that Barro's
assumptions guarantee     the irrelevance of all          redistributional policies,
distortionary   taxes, and prices——the neutrality of fiscal policy is only

the "tip of the iceburg."         Their results rely on the existence of

intrafamily linkages, which arise whenever two unrelated individuals

produce a common child,         Bernheim and Eagwell concluded that, since

these other propositions do not hold even approxirrately,              one cannot

assert that the world is approximately dynastic.              Accordingly, all
conclusions following from the dynastic framework (including Ricardian

equivalence) are suspect.

      Bernheim and Bagwell       also   noted that   it   might be   possible to
reinstate approximate Ricardian equivalence without generating untenable
consequences by introducing a small amount of          friction'. Intuitively,
friction would      cumulate   with each link and would become substantial for
long chains.       Since Ricardian equivalence
                                           (for debt redeemed within a
few generations) presumably depends on short chains while the Bernheim—

Bagwell results presurrably depand on long ones (we note that these
presumptions may be erroneous——see section 7), the introduction of

friction      mit just
                     do      the trick,

         The purpose of this paper     is   to evaluate the preceding argument by

formally      introduciing various forms of friction into a model with

altruistically motivated intergenerational transfers. We focus on

frictions arising from three sources:          the derivation of pleasure

directly from the act of giving; incomplete information about others'

preferences; and egalitarian social norms that constrain parents to

divide transfers evenly between children. The first two sources of

friction turn out to be quite similar analytically, and give rise to

qualitatively similar results,        In particular, one can obtain

approxite       Ricardian equivalence by introducing a sufficiently small

amount   of   friction.    Furthermore, for any given amount of friction, one

can reinstate the relevance of other redistributional policies by taking

the population to be sufficiently large (it follows from this that taxes

will distort     behavior,prices will play an important allocational
                             and

role). However, there is a hitch: by simultaneously taking friction to
be snll and population to be large, one drives each individual's

marginal propensity       to consume out of wealth to zero.    In resolving
                                       —3-.




several   paradoxes posed by Bernheim and      gwell,   one   therefore merely
encoiters another.
       The   introduction of   elitarian constraints     generates some
intruiging results. Most importantly, one obtains exact Ricardian
equivalence in a world where other redistributional policies have
significant allocative effects.  Since there is no need to assume that

this   source of friction is "small," one does not encounter the own—

wealth effect puzzle noted above.      We are troubled however by the

rather ad hoc nature of this constraint.         In addition, its imposition

generates a new paradox:       we show that an exogenous increase in the

wealth of any given individual is never Pareto improving.           Consequently,

we conclude that the theoretical case         for Ricardian equivalence remeins
tenuous     even when one explicitly recognizes sources of economic

friction.

       We    ornize   our discussion as follows.     Section 2 lays out the

basic model, cescribes an appropriate notion of equilibrium,          and

presents     some technical results which facilitate the analysis of

subsequent sections.      In sections 3 through 6 we consider, respectively,

specialized cases in which a) there is no friction, b) altruists derive

utility in part directly from the act of giving,         c) agents have


incomplete information about each others' preferences, and d) parents

are constrained to divide transfers equally between their children.

Section 7 contains some concluding remarks.          We defer all technical

manipulations            to the appendices. Appendix A contains a
                 and proofs

complete treatment of comparative statics for cases b and c above, while
                                             —4—




Appendix B treats case d.            We present proofs of specific results in

Appendix C.


2.      The Model
        We    ccnsider an economy comprised of 2N households.          Despite the

fact that we treat each household as if it consists of a single

individual, one should for the purpose of interpretation think of

households as     nErried couples. The population         is   evenly divided between
two groups      of households, henceforth referred to as "parents" and
 children," Thus, there are N parents (labelled p., i = 1,...,N),
and N children (labelled k., i = 1,... ,N), Eve parent has two

children,     and every child has two       parents (reflecting the fact that
spouses      originally come from different households).          We assume in


particular that        p's       children are   k   and                    by
                                                          k1     (where,

convention,      kNl
                       =   kj.    It is therefore appropriate to think of

intrafamily relations as a kind of circle (pictured in figure 1),

consisting of an outer layer (parents) and an inner layer (children).

        This representation of intrafamily relations is unquestionably

highly stylized, and does not reflect the full complexity of family

networks, particularly in cases where these networks span more than two

generations (see Bernheim and Bagwell [1986]). On the other hand, this

framework has the advantage of rendering our current analytic objectives

tractable,     while   in all likelihood doing very little violence to the
underlying economic issues.           We   return to this point in section 7, and
argue   that more realistic modelling of family networks would only tend

to strengthen our conclusions.

          We    suppose that children are completely selfish,                               so that the well-

being of child               k.     is given by


                                                    u. =    u(c.)

With     probability              It, parent               is also completely selfish, so that his

well being          is   given by

                                                           =    u(Ci

(note that the felicity function for parents is identical to that for
children——this restriction is inessential). With probability

(1 —     it), parent          p.     is altruistic; this entails non—paternalistic

altruism for his child (as in                       Frro        [1974]), and possibly some concern

for the magnitude of his bequests (as in Andreoni [1986]):


                         =   u(C.)    +    [u(c,) + u(c.1)} +                 m[v(T.)   +   v(tj]

(a,     > 0).      For simplicity, we assume that              the   random events that

determine parental preferences are distributed independently over

parents.         Throughout, we also assuma that               u()    and    v()     are twice

continuously differentiable and strictly concave.

         The final allocation of resources is determined through a

simultaneous move game, in which each parent chooses his own

consumption, as well               as intergenerational transfers. Each parent's
preferences        are   private information; while parent              p.    knows whether or

not he himself is            altruistic, his fnformation concerning others                  is

limited to        owledge          of the distribution of preferences described

above.       It is therefore necessary to employ a solution concept that

allows for incomplete information.                    The natural choice is to focus

attention on Eayesian Nash Eauilibria (see Harsanyi [1967—68]).

         In a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (hencefort BNE), we assign                          to each

parent a         function mapping his preferences into decisions.                  These

decisions m.st maximize his expected utility given associated

preferences, and given the distribution of                     other parents' decisions
induced by their assigned fLmctions.                      In the current context, a         BNE   has
a particularly simple form.                  When   parent i     is selfish,    he   will
obviously        set          t.    =   0, rerdless       of what other     rents    do.    Thus,
                       T1,
we    need   only describe the choices,               (Tt1)    which are     contingent     upon
                                                                *     *N
parent       I    being   altruistic.         Accordingly, (T.,t.)i1          is a BNE if for

equals either 3              or     1     (so that        information   is complete), this

definition reduces to the sore standard                          notion of    a Nash equilibrium.


          Throughout much of our analysis, we will assume that                                    resources      are

initially distributed evenly within generations.                              That is,

fcr all         i.    When we assume symmetric endowments, we will also focus

attention on symmetric equilibria, which have the property that                                           the

magnitudes of all transfers (conditional upon the parent being
                                  *    *    *

           We now present three technical results which justify the

comparative          statics performed in             subseqnt        sections.          The first of

these      establishes existence.

           Theorem     1:    For all endowment profiles                 (W,w.)
                                                                         1 1 i1              ,
                                                                                                 a BNE     exists.

           Next, we show that symmetric equilibria do indeed exist when

endowments are symmetric.



           Theorem 2:        If endowments are distributed symmetrically,                                 then
                                                                                                                   *
there exists a symmetric BNE.                       Furthermore,       the associated              transfer, T
is independent of            N.


The second portion of this result establishes that                           the   allocation of

resources    is in     some       important sense independent of population size.
This conolusion wIll feature prominently in the ensuing analysis.
       Finally,       we    establish a iqueness result.

       Theorem 3:           If    a    > 0   or     it > 0,     then there is a unique     BNE.    If
a = 0 and a       =    0,

When altruism     is       imperfect         (a    or    it
                                                               positive),   equilibrium is unique.

In   particular,      we lose nothing at all by focusing on symmetric

equilibria for the case of symmetric endowments.                            In a frictionless

world, there mey indeed be a multiplicity of equilibria (more on                                this
later),    but all such equilibria are equivalent, so once                          ain   our

analysis    involves no loss of generality.
       Throughout the following                   sections,      we   will focus on interior
equilibria      (i.e., parents meke positive transfers to their children).

Since we will be priuarily concerned with environments that are "almost"

symmetric and frictionless, it is sufficient to assume that


                                             u'(W)       <    u'(w)


        As a final preliminary step, we describe two types                           of "fiscal"
policies of particular interest.                        The first of these corresponds to the

use of   governnt           debt.       The level of debt,            8, affects endowments as

follows:
                                                    -.9—

for all       i.     That is, the government redistributes resources from the

younger generation to the older generation, presunbly by deferring

taxes    into      the future.     Note that     this      experiment is a pure case of

intergenerational redistributIon, since all members of the same
                                                                    -
generation  are affected identically.
      The second type of fiscal policy considered here amounts to a pure

redistributions within the parents' generation. In particular,                     .
represents a         transfer to parent        p,     financed out of "general revenues'

         It would also be natural to analyze a third type of                 OliC
consisting of redistributions within the children's generation.

Analytically, such policies are extremely similar to redistributions

within the parent's generation, so we do not consider them explicitly.

Note that, taken together, these three sets of instruments are

comprehensive, in the sense that they allow the governrint to achieve

any conceivable distribution of resources.

        Throughout the rest of this paper, we focus on the extent to which

fiscal instruments redistribute consumption in equilibrium.                     For each

policy    p        (where p      is either public debt,         5, or an intragenerational
transfer,     tj,     we define        a distributional index:
                                                        —10—




                                                    dC              dc.

                                               N

                                           j   =1


The logic of this index is straightforward. If                            the policy      p    has no

effect on the consumption of any individual, then                            R   =   0.   Thus,

        0    corresponds to the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis, and

R 1 =         for all         i   corresponds to the Rernheim—Bagwell neutrality

proposition.            Note also that,        in   the absence of operative


intergenerational linkages, for each of the policies described                                           -



above,      R    =- 1      (redistributing endowments leads to a one—for—one

redistribution             of consumption).         Thus, a         iue of   R       between    0        and

1    tells      us   how    closely behavior conforms to each of the polar cases.


3,          Perfect Aitni
            We begin by considering a frictionless world, in which altruism is

perfectlynonpaternalistic (a =                           =    0).   Since such environrnts have
received much prior attention (see                       rro [1974] and Bernheim              and    gwell
[1988]), this section contains no                       new    results as such. Rather,             we


restate known neutrality results within the context of our current model
in order to provide a "base case" with which to compare the results of
subsequent           sections.

            Under the assumptions          specified in section 2, an interior
equilibrium nust satisfy

for   all        i.    Given our concavity assumptions, these conditions are also

sufficient to establish an equilibrium.                            Note that (4A), (4B), (5A), and

(58) form a system of 4N equations in 4N unknowns.                                Ordinarily, one

would think that the system would be fully determined.                                However, brief

inspection reveals that one of the equations given in (4A) and (48) is

redundant (recall that
                                    0N1
                                             S
                                                  01).       Thus, the       system is   under—

determined.

            This      does not, however,         reflect real           indeterrniriancy of resource

allocation.            To   see this,   we sum (5A)           and (58) over        i to    obtain


                                            *       *
                                        (C.1 + c.1       —   w.   —   w.1 ) = o
                                                              1



Note that          (4A),    (4B), and (6)        (omitting         the redundant equation) form a


system of 2N equations in 2N unknoms.                             Accordingly,     it seems likely
that    consumption is fully determined.                          In fact,     we have already

established that there is a a-uique solution to this system of equations

(Theorem 3).

            In contrast, transfers are indeterminant.                           To understand this

point,       refer      ain
                         to figure 1. Suppose that an                           equilibrium prevails.

If    every      parent simply increases                T.    by      $1   and decreases   t      by   $1,
                                             —12—




the   allocation of real resources retrains              unchanged.      Thus,   the new

profile of transfers is also an equilibrium.                      Equilibrium transfers are

therefore defined only up to an additive constant, with the sole

restriction that       all   transfers sist be positive.

        Accordingly, we       ny   ignore transfers completely, and describe the

equilibrium consumption profile directly through equations (4A), (4B),

and   (6),    Simple inspection of        these equations reveals that the

allocation        of resources depends     only upon        total wealth,
                                      N
                                      ]    (W.   +
                                     i=1

Changes      in   the distribution of wealth have no effect on the consumption

of any individual.

        Several neutrality results follow immediately from this

observation.        We begin with    rro's           [1974] well—iciown version of

Ricardian equivalence:


        Propositioni:         If   a=it=O,           then    5    =0.


The proof simply consists of noting that



                                                 +   wj)    = 0



and invoking the preceding observations.

        Bernheis and Bagwell [1988] have criticized                     rro's    analysis   on

two grounds. First, they argue             that,       in a world with intrafamily

linkages,     rro' s assumptions (perfect non—çaternalistic altri.iism
                                               —13—




coupled with     operative transfers) imply that                all redistributional
policies     are neutral. In the current context,                   we   obtain

        Proposition    2:    if   5 =     =    0,    then   R            0   for all     i



This result follows directly from the observation that




                                  3
                                      (ii1 (.    +   ))     =   0



analogously     to Proposition 1.

                  indicates that policies that redistribute resources
        Proposition    2

beten apparently unrelated members of the same generation have no
effects      on resource allocation.       Using this result, one can                   also   show

that,   in             elaborate environments, apparently distortionary
             somewhat more

taxes have no effects on behavior, and that prices are not only
indeterminate, but also play no role in the resource allocation process
see     Bernheim and    gwell     [1988] and Bernheim [1986]).

         Bernheim and Bagwell also offered, but did not emphasize, a second

criticism of the dynastic framework: as the population size increases,

each individual's merginal propensity to consume out of his own wealth

falls to zero.        As we shall see, this observation turns out to be

particularly important in models that incorporate small                            amounts   of

friction,       in the current context, we have
                                                                         *
                                                                    dC.
        Proposition    3:    If   a =      =    0,          lim              = 0   for all     I.

                                                            N-           i

        To   establish Proposition 3,           we   argue as follows.             8y   Proposition 2
(along   with a similar result for children), equalizing the distribution
                                                   —14-



of resources within generations has no effect on consumption.                                     Thus,   we

can invoke Theorem 3,             to   conclude that         the   distribution of consumption

is symmetric both before and after the incremental infusion of wealth.

It is trivial to check that                   C (s C
                                                    1

                                                                                              1
                                                                                                    for

all     i)    are both increasing in aggregate resources. Thus,

dC./dW.      < i/N,   from which the result follows immediately.

         Empirically speaking, Proposition 2 (along with its corollaries)

and Proposition 3 are both untenable, Indeed, since                             these properties do

not hold even as an approximation in the raal. world,                           eality       is in    dome

critical sense not even approximately like the                        model described         here.
Accordingly, rnheim and gwell conclude that it is inapropriate to
take the Ricardian equivalence result even as a "rule of thumb" guide to

policy,      without first specifying the nature of the approximation in

great    detail.      We   undertake this task in subsequent sections,


4.       Joy   of Giving

         in this section we analyze the case in                     which     all   parents   are

altruistic and, in          addition,        care directly about the size of the

transfers they aeke.              Formally, a > 0           and    m =   0.    Parent    i    chooses

the transfers               and              to satisfy
                      T1            t

(7A)                            u'(C.) =     u'(c.)     +
                                                            av'(T)

                                         =
(7E)                            u'(C1)       u'(c.1)        +
                                                                av'(t)

In deciding on the optimal transfers, parent i considers reducing his

owr    consumption,        C,    by one unit.      If   he transfers this unit to child
                                                            —15—




1,   the parent's utility is increased by
                                                                          u'(c)       +   mv'(Tj;        if he

transfers this unit            of    consumption good to child                            i +   1,    then the

parent's utility is increased by                            u'(c11)           +   av'(t.).           The first—order

conditions (7A) and (7B) show that                           a       consumer chooses           T1
                                                                                                       and    t    so

that    the   rrarginal utility loss from decreasing his own                                    consumption       is

equal to the nBrginal               utility       in         from increasing either
                                                                                                       T     or   t..


        To obtain       comparative static                   results for this model, one

differentiates the entire system                           formed        by equations (7A) and (7B) (for

each    i),   along     with the budget                   constraints.            The following result is

extremely helpful for evaluating the effects of specific policy

exercises.

        Since the formula for                     X       is quadratic, there are, of course, two

solutions.       Given the nature                 of      this formula, one root is simply the


inverse of the of the other.                      If        a ) 0, then the expression on the

right   hand side       strictly exceeds 2, so that one solution exceeds unity,

while    the other lies         beeen      C    and     1,     It is easy to check that           the
value    of     dC/dW k    does not depend        upon       whether one uses the larger or

smaller root.        For convenience, we henceforth adopt the convention that

0    < X < 1.

        Now consider the effects of a Ricardian redistribution in which

       is increased by one unit         and      w    is decreased by one unit             for   all

i.     It is of course feasible for all                 C     and
                                                                         c     to remain unchanged

in    the face of this experirint,              However,       this     inriance       of consumption
is    not, in general, optimal as argued below.                     -




         Suppose that      all   parents       intain their             own   consumption unchanged
and increase        T1    and    t   each by 1/2,             In this        case   all c. will    be

                                                                                                  fail
mchanged.        However, the first—order conditions (7A) and (7B) will

to    be satisfied because the increase in                   transfers leads to a reduction
in    av'(T.) and         av'(t).    Therefore, the narginal utility of parent i's

consumption, u'(Ci), would exceed the right—hand sides of (7A) and (7B),

which represent the narginal utility associated with an additional

transfer. To re—establish optimality, parent i would increase his own

consumption              his transfers. Therefore, the Ricardian
                 and decrease

experiment increases the consumption of parents and reduces the
consumption      of children.
        The argument       that         not remain unchanged in the
                                  consumption would
face of a Ricardian experinnt ss based on the fact that increased
transfers would reduce av'(T1) and av'(t.) and therefore violate the
first—order      conditions (7A) and (7B).               However, if            a    is srrll then

this effect will be small and the impact on consumption will be minimal.

Thus, we would expect the effect of deficits on consumption to be

continuous in                   a.     Likewise, one would expect to obtain                                   a   similar

continuity property with respect to the effect of transfer policies on

consumption.                   Formelly, we have


         Proposition 4:                      If   m   =   0 and the initial distribution of

            Proposition 4               tails us that by taking friction to be small we can

obtain both               Ricardian equivalence and the stronger neutrality properties
as    arbitrarily good approximations.                                      By itself, this result does not

bolster the Ricardian position. However, the key point is                                                          that for ¶.
the quality of the approximation depends upon N, whereas                                                          for & it
does not. Indeed, since public debt does not alter the symmetry of

endowments,                then by Theorem 2               R        is       completely independent of                      N.   In

contrast,             R

            In    keeping with the intuition given in the introduction to this

paper, we wish to explore the behavior of                                              R        as        N   becomes very

large.           We       therefore consider in detail the                                 effect of t.1           on the

distribution of                      consumption in large economies.                                Note that         dC/d       is

the    sum of tao components:                          (1) the direct effect of the increase in

parent       is           wealth,      dC/dW; and              (2) the effect on parent                           l's


consumption of the reduction                               in parent j's                   wealth by (N           —

for all           j            i.     To evaluate these components in a large economy, we

take the limit of the formula given in Theorem 4 (recalling that, since

endowments are symmetric, C,                              , and             T    do not depend on                 N):

Thus, an increase in            Wk   has a positive effect on            C.     but the

magnitude of the effect declines geometrically as                    j—k        increases——

friction dissipates the effect on more distant relatives. We depict

this pattern graphically in figure 2.

         Consider now the tao component effects of              ..            For a large

economy, the effect on parent j's wealth is negligible.                             Indeed, it

follows from Theorem 4 that even summing over all                    j         I,       there is no

effect on     arent     i's consumption (i.e. effect (ii) above is eaual to

zero).      Intuitively, in large economies almost all                   j    are only

distantly related to            i, so that the friction in any chain linking                      j

to   i     almost completely dissipates the effects of changes in j's

wealth.      Thus,    In a large economy, the effect on parent i's consumption

of the redistributive transfer            'r•    is the same as the effect on parent

i's consumption of an increase In parent l's wealth (effect (i) above).

Inspection of Theorem 4 reveals that, even in a large economy, dC/dW1

is positive.         This follows from the fact that if parent                      i     received an

additional ixit of wealth and did not increase his own consumption, then

he would increase his transfers                   and         thereby increasing
                                           T1           t1,

consumption, u'(C1), would exceed the right—hand sides of the first—

order conditions (7A) and (7B).            In order to satisfy the first—order

conditions, parent          i   would increase his own consumption.

        Finally, since the effects of wealth injections are localized, in

large economies we would expect                                        to redistribute consumption from

the general population to the close relatives of                                         1,   so that   in the

         Taken together,                      Propositions         4 and 5 may well appear to resolve

the difficulties raised by Bercheim and Bagwell.                                         Specifically, one can

obtain      Ricardian equivalence                         to an arbitrarily good approximation by

taking          a        sufficiently small.                 If    for   a given     a    the population is

sufficiently large then, as in a model with no altruistic linkages, a

one dollar intragenerational transfer will redistribute one dollar of

                                     1
consumption in equilibrium (i.e.  P     1). The recipient of such a

transfer            will      act      as though         he has received       an   injection of new wealth——

that is, he will                      completely ignore the fact that                    the governrrent acquired

these resources                   by levying taxes on individuals to whom the recipient is

operatively linked.                       Taking the population to be large does not,

       affect the approximate validity of Ricardian equivalence, Thus,
however,

with a small and N large relative to a1, deficits are approximately
neutral, but intragenerational redistributions are not. Formally,                                                we

cannot justify Ricardian               equivalence            simply by arguing that                 friction      is

small and the population               is large.             However,     the logical puzzle posed                 by

Bernheim       and                   for the moment
                         gwehl appears                                   to be mitigated.              It    seems
that one       must      turn to   empirical evidence in order to determine whether

the actual values of               a   and     N        are consistent with approximate

Ricardian equivalence, but inconsistent with the collateral neutrality

results.

        Yet this resolution is unsatisfactory.                             if one simultaneously

takes      a    small      (so that Ricardian equivalence                   is approxirrtely true)
and    Nlarge (so that intragenerational transfers remain relevant),
then in the limit each individual's consumption is necessarily unrelated
to his own wealth. More precisely,

Thus,     by introducing friction through                    5, one cannot         simultaneously

resolve        the difficulties         raised    by Propositions           2 and 3      of   section 3:

if one     takes friction to be small without                       letting the population get

very large, then in the limit everything is neutral;                               if    one takes
friction to be small while letting the population grow, then in the
limit each individuals marginal propensity to consume out of wealth
falls     to zero.

each      k.     Sy proposition 7, we know that in the limit consumption does

not depend upon an individual's own                     alth.          This seems to imply that

consumption depends upon aggregate wealth, from which it would follow

that all redistributive policies are neutral.                              Quite to the contrary,

proposition 6 tells us that R                         1.     The key to this puzzle is the

fact that, in the limit, consumption is a function of local aggregates,

rather than global aggregates.                   That is, the consumption of individual

i   depends only upon the wealth holdings of                          is     close" relatives.           In

the limit, i          has an infinite number of close realtives (even though

these relatives form a negligible subset of the entire population), and

so i's own wealth           is irrelevant.           However, a        redistribution of         one
dollar from i to j (where I                          and     j      are only very        distantly
related) will transfer one dollar                    of consumption from             i    and his close

relatives to          j   and     his   close relatives.

         In summary, we find that                   one       can simultaneously take friction

small        (a   -*   0) and population large (N -                        )        such    that   Ricardian

equivalence            holds arbitrarily well, and such that                           redistrjbutions     have

real effects (changes in wealth only affect consumption locally).
However, in doing so one necessarily produces an untenable result:                                             each

individuals' consumption is unrelated to his own wealth.


5.           Incowplete        Inforation
         Now consider an economy in which a fraction                                   it   of   the parents are

selfish and the retraining fraction 1 —                               it of   the parents are altruistic.

Each  parent knows whether he is altruistic or selfish, and knows the
fraction it of selfish parents, but does not know whether any other
particular parent is selfish or                      altruistic.                For simplicity, we        assume

that there is no joy of giving motive (a                                      0).

             Rather than treat this case in detail, we will simply indicate its

formal similarity to the joy of giving model.                                       Specifically, if       a > 0

and     it    =   0,   the utility of each parent is given by


(6)                    u(C.)   +   [u(y.)   +   u(y.1)J               + a [v(T.) +          v(tj]

choices conditional upon                j    being       altruistic, with the understanding

that       j   transfers       nothing if he is completely selfish).

       We note four differences between (8) and (9).                                 First,        in (9) the

second term is multiplied by                     (1 —    it). Clearly,          this difference in

scale can have no qualitative consequences, and even                                 quantitative
differences disappear            as     it
                                             goes        to   0.       Second, in (9) the third term

is multiplied by           it    rather      than       .     Yet      both it and        a    are riasures

of friction.        Merely changing the index is inconsequential. Third, in

(9)    u()      appears in place of                  v().        Since we never ruled out the

                                      and     v()        are identical, this too is
possibility that u(s)

irrelevant.        Finally, in (9)               w   +   T.      appears in place of               T


(likewise w.i+1 +          t.1    in place of             t.).

6.

        Despite      its apparent      promise, the introduction of friction does

not appear to resolve successfully all of the puzzles posed                           in   Bernheim

and    gwell's       analysis.       We now turn to a less obvious alternative,

which 15    isotivated     by the empirical            obsertion          that testators often
                                                                                                -

choose to divide bequests equally among their heirs (see Menchik

[1980]).        This phenornon has puzzled previous analysts, in that it

appears to contradict the implications of all widely subscribed theories

concerning bequest motives (see the discussion in                          rnheim,    Shleifer and

Summers [198]).            We offer no new explanation of equal division here,

but rather simply assume that altruistic                         rents     rraximize utility


subject    to an     elithrian constraint.                   Like   the introduction of friction
in section       4, the constraint itself is somewhat ad hoc, but, as we shall

see, its introduction generates some intniiging implications. We leave

the task of justifying the equal division assumption for future work.

        Accordingly, we set            a =   it   =    0,   and modify our basic model by

assuming that        parent     p.    maximizes utility subject to the constraint

that


                                                  t.   = T.
                                                   1      1


Formally,       Theorems    I   through 3 do not apply to this case.                 We therefore
                                                —25—




provide the following result:


        Theorem 5:         Suppose    a =   it = 0,      and that parents face egalitarian

constraints.         For every endowment profile                                    there exists a

unique equilibrium.           Furthermore, if endowments are distributed

symmetrically, then the equilibrium is symmetric, and the associated
                       *
equilibrium transfer, T ,             is
                             irideendent of N.


            As in section 4,    it is useful to derive some preliminary
comparative static results that allow us to compute the effects of

various policy experiments.                We therefore provide the following theorem:


        Therem 6:         Suppose     a = it=   0,       and that parents face egalitarian

constraints.         Let initial endowments be distributed symmetrically.                            Then


   dC             —2\(1 +   XN)_1(l    —   N)_1(1        —   X)1                         for   j   = k

where       X    solves


                                +X_1240)
            Once again, the formula for              X       is quadratic.         Since the right

hand side is strictly less than —2, one solution is less than                                  —1,


while the other lies          beten         0   and          —1       (one is simply the reciprocal

of the other).            For convenience, we choose the second root (both yield

the same value of                          and adopt the convention that                  0 > X > —1.
                            dC/dWk)
            We   begin   our analysis of egalitarian altruism by noting that
                                             —26—



Ricaran equivalence holds         exactly (i.e., not approximately, as in the
preceding sections). To        establish this property, we need not assume
that endowments      are distributed symmetrically——the result obtains even

when    the financial status of children differs within families,



        Proposition 8:     Suppose     a =   it = 0,    harents face
litarian constraints.           Then    Rd =


        it is important to qualify Proposition          8   in the following   way.
The   previous models yielded Ticardia equivalence             (or approxirnat

equivalence) for all transfers involving a parent and his children,

Here,   that is not the case,        Policies that entail differential treatment

of children within the same family           y well    have real effects, since the

egalitarian constraint prevents parents from offsetting such redistri—

butions,

        This observation leads naturally into our next result. Just as
the equal division requirement prevents parents from offsetting
redistributions within the family,           it precludes    private individuals from
offsetting more      complex transfer policies. Suppose for example that the

government   taxes    parent   p.,   and distributes    the procedes to
                                                                             P.        In

the absence of elitarianism, p.              will decrease     t   by the amount of

his incremental tax, and
                                p1+1
                                        will raise
                                                       T1     by his incremental

subsidy.    In the presence of an       elitar1an constraint,        these

           are proscribed. Instead, the actual responses of                           and
alternatives
                                                                               p
p11 will offset the policy only partially.
        Accordingly, one might well suspect that            egalitarianism   introduces

a kind of      friction,            which      attenuates the effects of a perturbation as
one moves    further from its source. In large populations, one might once
ain      find that policies of iritragenerational redistribution lead to
sensible consequences. Taking limits of the formulas in theorem                                                              6 (and

recalling that, with symmetric endowments, k and the equilibrium
allocation are independent of N), we obtain

As expected, the effect of p.'s                                       wealth on              p's           consumption declines

geometrically as                j    becomes "distant"                             from      i.        However, the most

striking feature of these formulas follows from the                                                          fact that   X     is
negative.       Accordingly, a windfall for parent                                                p.        raises the

consumption of             p.       (i         j)       when           i       —   j    is   odd, and lowers it when

i   —
        j is   even (see figure 3).

         A   moment's       reflection suggests that                                    this pattern is quite natural.

In response to an infusion of wealth, parent p1 increases both his

intragenerational redistributions in large econornies In fact, parent

         This result has     one   rather peculiar implication, which is that                    an
intragenerational transfer has            a   larger redistributive effect on

consurrtion    if   there are egalitarian intergenerational transfers, than

if   there are no private transfers at all (i.e.                  R'    > 1). That is,
contrary to    the implications of previous analyses,                  private transfers

serve    to magnify   rather than        dampen    the   redistributive effects of

government policies,

         Even so, it might appear that egalitarianism provides the ideal

resolution to the paradoxes raised by Bernheim and Eagwehl.                          After all,

one obtains exact Ricardian equivalence without assuming that                             this
source    of friction is small.          In contrast to previous sections, one need

not pass to    o    limits simultaneously, thereby producing a paradoxical

wealth effect.

         Yet this conclusion is premature, for the imposition of egalita-

rianism produces a paradox of its own.                   Specifically, consider the

welfare effects of an exogenous increase in the wealth of some

consumer.    Ordinarily,     we    would think      of this occurrence as
                                                      -29-




unambiguously desirable.                Not so within the context of the current

rnodelr        Indeed,    roughly speaking, only one half of the population would

benefit, while the other half would lose.                                Formally,


          Proposition 10:            Suppose          =    =       0,   and that parents face

egalitarian constraints.                Let     initial    endowments be distributed

symmetrically.

          a)     If   N    is even and          3     1, then
                                                                         dtj/dW1
                                                                                      < 0       1ff       3    is   odd.
                                                                                                               -
          b)     If   N    is odd and       I        niin(j,       N — 3 ÷ 2) < N/2, then

          Thus,    an exogenous increase in the wealth of any given consumer is

never a Pareto improvement.                 The intuition for this result follows

directly from our discussion of figure 3;                               if    parents       j   —   1    and       3 ÷ 1

consume more          (and,   accordingly, give less to their children), then the

resources of          js   family have declined, and                      3     crust be worse off even

after     adjusting his            own behavior optimally.

          The reader may well           feel that the implications of Proposition                                    10,

while surprising, are not obviously counterfactual.                                     We      do      not deny

this.      We    merely    note that one            cannot accept the egalitarian framework

without        reexamining the validity               of some very basic premises, and

abandoning        most simple guides            to welfare analysis.


7.        Closing     Reirks
          In    closing,      it    is important       to emphasize             that we         have conducted

this    analysis in a way that is likely to significantly overstate the

plausibility of approximately Ricardiari worlds.                                     More generally, the
                                         —30—



case for Ricardian equivalence is even less compelling for two reasons.

        First, our model spans only two generations.         While it is

therefore adequate for analyzing the effects of deferring taxes to the

next generation, it is unsuited for drawing inferences about the impact

of longer term debt,       Just as friction compounds through successive

linkages between families, it will also compound as intergenerational

chains lengthen.      Accordingly, in a more general model, we would expect

to   find that relatively    temporary deficits are approxirratelyneutral,

        relatively permanent ones are
                                                                 -

while                                     not.


              intrafamily linkages are actually much more complicated
        Second,

than the network modelled here. As we extend consideration to a larger
number of generations, we generate a proliferation of paths linking

different members of the      same   generation (see Bernheim and      gwell,
section 4,       detailed discussion). Linkages actually fora a "web",
              for a

rather than the circle illustrated in figure 1 As a result, the
"distance" between two arbitrarily selected individuals may be quite
small on average, even when the population          is quite large.     Suppose,   for
example,     that we add one more    generation, meintaining our assumption
that every parent has       two children, and    every child two parents. Then,
ioring redundancies         (i.e., sibling don't have the same       in—laws), each

grandparent     is directly linked through his grandchildren to 10 other

grandparents, who are in turn linked to 10 others, and so forth.              This

suggests that     each   household is connected through chains involving           L

or fewer links to on the order of                other households, rather than to

only    2L    households, as in the current model.       Formal analysis of
                                            —31—




random graphs indicates that         this   intuition is essentially correct (see

Bollabas   [1981]).
      These observation suggest that,               in   a more realistic model, the

Bernheim—Bagwell puzzles would be much more                 roixist.     If most individuals

are connected through relatively few links, then it may be very

difficult to eliminate the approximate neutrality of intragenerational

transfers without assuming       a    or     it
                                                    very   large.      Similarly, each

individual would in such a world have a tremendous number of "close"

relatives so that, once agedn, the marginal propensity to consume out of

own wealth might be extremely small in the absence of large friction.

      Overall, it is very difficult to see how one could introduce just

enough   friction in a model with a realistic pattern                   of   interfamily

linkages to produce approximate Ricardian equivalence without also
generating untenable results as in Bernheim and Sagwell. Jhile one can,
perhaps, avoid these problems by invoking an egalitarian constraint,
this alternative      seems very ad hoc,in addition generates some
                                                  and

disturbing welfare results. Conseqntly, the theoretical case for

Ricardian equivalence remains tenuous at best.

           This appendix presents the comparative statics analysis of a model

that nests the joy of giving model in Section 4 and the incomplete

inforn'tion model in Section 5.                          Recall        that

           C. =     consurrtion of        adult i

                =   transfer     from adult i to child i + 1.

Also    recall that

The equations (Al —                  A) contain both                the joy of giving model and the

The boundary condition in (A12) exploits the fact that the N adults

are   located around a circle and adult                   I is formally the same as adult

N +   1.
           For the purposes of our analysis, it is sufficient to allow

and   g2      to be nonzero and to restrict                   8.        0   for   j =   3,4,5,...,   N.

In this case, it follows from (All) and (A12) that

         Proposition 4:                        By Theorems 2 and 3,                             for    all symmetric endowment

levels     w    and              W, the unique                        equilibrium           is symzretric.                It can
therefore       be characterized by the first order condition


                u'(C) —               u'(w            ÷           - C) — avl(W_—_C) = o

Since       u       and      v        are concave, the equilibrium value                                        of    C    is also the

solution to


                                     sax       u(C1    ÷   u(w       +   W    — C) +           2av( W-C )
                                 0<c<W



(note      that      this        yields (Ci) as the first order condition).                                                Since this

problem satisfies all the hypotheses of the maximum theorem, its

solution is continuous in                             a.     Let         C°       denote the equilibrium value for

a    =0     (by assumption                     0    < C°< W); let                 C°           w   ÷W      — C°      and

      =   (w    - c°)/2.
           From      (Ci),           it follows that
                                           dC =                              v"(T)

We    have written this as the limit of the product of two                                                           expressions.

Property (i) IS straightforward to check.                                         Propeerty (ii) follows from

the fact that                  (1 —          XN)_1(l   + XN)      is     decreasing         in      N.       We establish

compact and convex.                           Further,             p's     utility is cor.tinuous, and concave in

T..       As in Theorem 1, we immediately have                                        existence.
              Next, note that                  if we have an equilibrium                           where     t.

relains an equilibrium when                               the constraint is imposed, since the effect
of this is only to limit deviations.                                            Thus,      the existence of a symmetric
equilibrium when endownnts are symritric is giaranteed by Theorem 2.
      Finally, we come to uniqueness. Throughout our argument, we will
refer to parents'                     first order                  conditions, which, for an interior
solution, can                  be    written as

              Now suppose,                contrary to tne theorem, that                             tnere    are       two distinct

Proceding exactly as in the proof of Proposition 5,                                                                      it then follows that

From (B17),               it is clear                   that

                First,    assume that                       N        is even.               Then it is easy to check that
