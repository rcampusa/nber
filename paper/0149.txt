        Age, Education, and Occupational Earnings Inequality


    The presence of a wide dispersion of earnings within narrowly

defined Census occupations raises two important questions about

the determinants of earnings behavior. First, what factors are

operative that cause individuals in the same occupation to be rewarded

differently? Second, do there exist systematic differences in these

determinants between occupations or groups of occupations? A response

to the second will have to await empirical investigation. In response

to the first, six explanations may be offered as hypotheses:

     (1) Differences in tasks. A given Census occupation may represent

a variety of tasks and functions. A tisecretaryn, for example, may engage

in typing, shorthand and dictation work, reception work, administrative

chores, budgeting, or some combination of these. A "lawyer" may work

on corporate tax returns, wills, estates, contracts or litigation.

Tasks within an occupation usually vary in difficulty, and the more

difficult are usually accorded higher compensation because of the addi-

tional training required or because of the limited supply of qualified

personnel. Differences in schooling or ability, insofar as they are

related to the tasks performed, may thus lead to differences in pay

within an occupation.

     (2) Different levels of efficiency. Workers in the same occu-

pation may perform the same task at different speeds or levels of

efficiency: Typists, prograimners and many kinds of operatives differ

in the speed and accuracy of their work. Differences in experience and

ability, insofar as they reflect the efficiency and reliability of
                                      —2—



the   work   performed,   may result in differences in earnings within an

occupation.

       (3) Institutional factors. Institutions will often set up dif-

ferential pay scales for a given occupation on the basis of education and

experience. Public school systems,        branches   of the civil service,

and large     corporations have set pay scales based on education or years
of service for many lines of work.        The   formulas used may   reflect

worker productivity or, as Ruggles (1970) argues,         they may reflect

cultural     and institutional systems of remuneration quite        contrary to

actual productivity. For whichever reason, earnings may vary directly

with age or education within an occupation.

       (4) Time worked. Differences in hours worked per week and employ-

ment stability over the year       will lead to differences in annual      earnings.

       (5) The demand for labor. Labor market conditions will often

vary from one locality to another, depending on the availability of

labor and the industrial mix of the regions. Differences in the demand

and supply conditions between areas will cause differences in compen-

sation for similar work.

       (6) Discrimination. The differential compensation of workers

with similar ability, qualifications, and work experience on the basis

of their sex or race will lead to a dispersion of earnings within an

occupation.

       In this paper, we will investigate the effect of these factors

on occupational earnings inequality across all occupations in our sample

and across occupations in five major Census subgroups. Age and

schooling will receive primary attention in our work and it will be
                                    —3—

shown that they are important determinants of earnings inequality among

professional and clerical occupations but not among skilled, semi—skilled

or unskilled occupations. Ability is also hypothesized as an important

factor, but no measure of ability is provided in our sample. Differences

in time worked and labor demand conditions, as measured by industrial and

urban—rural mix, will also be analyzed, and their effect on earnings

inequality is strong in most of the occupational subsamples. Differences

in   the race and   sex composition of occupations do not appear to be

significant   factors in occupational earnings inequality, and the
explanation offered is that discrimination takes the form of occupational
segregation   rather than differences in pay for similar work. In the

conclusion a sketch of a "structural" theory of income distribution is

proposed to account for our results.



                    I. Empirical Results and Interpretation


      To analyze the determinants of occupational earnings inequality,

we randomly drew a sample of approximately 200 workers for each of 291

occupations in 1960 and 439 in 1970 from the 1960 and 1970 Census 1/100

Public Use Samples.' We then computed the mean and standard deviation

of earnings, age, schooling and hours worked, an industrial dispersion

coefficient, and the percent urban, white male, white female, black

male, and black female for each occupation. For the purpose of regres-

sion analysis, the observational unit     was the occupation, and regressions



     11n the 1960 Census there were 295 occupations. Four, however,
had fewer than 50 occupational members and were omitted. Many occupa-
tions in the two years had less than 200 members but more than 50 and
were kept in the sample. The total sample size was 41,349 in 1960 and
63,661 in 1970.

were performed across all occupations and across occupations in

each of five major sub—groups ——       professional,    technical, and

managerial (professional); clerical and         sales   (clerical); skilled

and craft (skilled); semi—skilled and operative (operative); and

service   and   unskilled (service)


A.    The Level of Occupational Earnings Inequality
      We chose the coefficient of variation of earnings, defined as
the   ratio of the standard deviation of earnings to mean earnings

(SD(E)/i), as our measure of earnings inequality, since mean earnings

varied considerably between occupations and for a given occupation

between 1960 and 1970. The coefficient of variation for all those

earning wage and salary income in the economy was .953          in 1960
and .952 in 1970 (See Wolff (j975))•3 The average (unweighted)
occupational coefficient of variation across all occupations was

.683 in 1960 and .707 in 1970, lower than the overall level of

inequality in the two years (Table 1). The slight rise in the

average level of occupational inequality, despite the finer occupational

classification scheme in 1970, suggests that the presence of occupational

inequality is not a classification artifact but a substantive phenomenon.

On the other hand, when the coefficient of variation was regressed

on the occupational size (in millions of workers) across all occupations,

occupational size had a positive and significant coefficient.    This

suggests that occupations with larger populations are characterized

by more tasks and functions and that a finer occupational breakdown

may reduce the measured level of inequality.

     The mean coefficient of variation varied considerably between

occupational groups. In 1960 it was highest among service occupations,

followed by clerical, professional, operative and skilled occupations.

Between 1960 and 1970 the average degree of inequality rose in all

groups, except professionals. However, the rank order among the five

groups was identical in 1970 to that of 1960, suggesting the same set

of factors at work in the two years within each of the five groups.

to vary considerably from occupation to occupation. For those whose

     5Mincer (1974) shows quite convincingly that individual experience
is a better predictor of an individual's earnings than his age. In
our sample, where the unit of observation is the occupation, there is
little quantitative difference between using age and experience. (The
correlation between mean age and mean experience, estimated as age less
years of schooling less five, across occupations was .93 in both 1960
and 1970.) Moreover, the use of the standard estimate for experience
Is known to be poor for females and minorities, who are included in our
sample, and the use of experience rather than age raises the question
of whether total work experience or experience in a particular occupation
is more relevant for occupational earnings.

experience leads to on—the—job training and either increased eff 1—

ciency at a given task (typing, for example) or the assumption of more

difficult tasks (engineering, for example), we would anticipate a rise

in the pay rate with age. Among other occupational groups like

civil servants, school teachers and unionized crafts, where wage

scales are apportioned. to age for institutional reasons, we would

anticipate   a similar cross—sectional profile. Among semi—skilled

and unskilled occupations, like taxi drivers and maids, where experience

leads to little increase in productivity, we would expect little

bearing of age on earnings. Previous cross—sectional evidence tends

to confirm this pattern:(Wolff (1975), pp. 21—22 and 60—61). Within

most professional and clerical occupations earnings rise with age

until about age 60 and then level off. Within most skilled, semi-

skilled and unskilled occupations, earnings rise until about age 30,

level off, and then decline. For the labor force as a whole, the hourly

wage rate rises steeply with age until about age 27, then rises less

steeply, and finally levels off   at   about age 40. These results conform

with common observation. For many professional groups, like

programmers, air pilots, and college professors, administrative posi-

tions, particularly in public administration, and clerical jobs,

like secretaries, salaries will start low, increase rapidly in the

early years, then rise less rapidly, and, in many instances, level

off as institutionally—Imposed ceilings are reached. For occupational

groups, like garage attendants, bartenders, and janitors, earnings

will show little systematic relation to age.

     Moreover, the previous results suggest that the age—earnings

cross—sectional profile is approximately logarithmic in shape for the
                                                  —9—

pooled labor force and for professional and clerical occupations and

flat   for skilled, semi—skilled and service groups. In the former case,
an increase in mean age, with the age distribution around the mean
constant,    will result        in   higher mean earnings, a lover variance of

earnings, and thus a lower coefficient of variation.6                     In   the latter

case, a higher mean age will have no effect on the coefficient of

variation. The regression results in Table 2 confirm this hypothesis.

       The impact of the standard deviation of age on earnings inequality

is more difficult to predict a priori, since it depends on how the

shape of the age distribution shifts. If an increased standard

deviation of age reflects a greater concentration of younger workers,

then earnings inequality would rise, since mean earnings would fall

but the variance of earnings rise. Conversely, if it reflects a

greater concentration of older workers, inequality would fall, since

mean earnings would increase but the variance decline. In 1960




       6Suppose in a given occupation, earnings                  E = k     (in Ai) + c
for an individual i of age Ai. Mean earnings E and the variance of
earnings V(E) are thus given by

             I            E   in A1 + c        and          V(E) =   E   E (Ei —

Mean earnings will therefore rise. Moreover,

the   only significant àoefficieat of the standard deviation of age

at the five percent significance level was in the professional

group, but it was negative. In 1970 the coefficients in the pooled,

professional, and skilled samples were positive and significant at,

at least, the five percent level and   the   coefficient in the clerical

subsample was positive and significant at the ten percent level.

This difference in results between 1960 and 1970 can be attributed

to the change in the age composition of the work force during this

period. Between 1960 and 1970, the median age of those employed fell

from 41 to 39, the percentage of workers 21 or under increased from

16 to 20, and the percentage of workers 26 or under from 25 to 30 (see

Wolff (1975), p. 27). In the professional and clerical groups the

mean age was stable but the standard deviation of age increased and

in the skilled group mean age fell sharply while the standard deviation

of age remained constant, suggesting that in each of these groups

there was a higher concentration of new entrants in 1970 than in

1960 (Table 1). Given the change in the age composition of the

work force, the stronger positive effect of the standard deviation of

age on earnings inequality in 1970 than in 1960 would serve to

confirm the hypothesized cross—sectional age profiles for the occu-

pational groups.


C. Schooling

       Previous work suggests a wide variation in education—earnings

profiles among occupations (Wolff (1977)). For professions like

lawyers, doctors, and university teachers, where an advanced degree

is required, there is almost no variance in schooling and thus little
                                  — 13 —




relation   of earnings to education within the occupation. Among other

professions like school teachers, nurses and engineers, schooling

generally varies from two to eight years of college, and earnings

generally rise with schooling in this range. Among many clerical

occupations, education varies from two years of high school to four

years of college and earnings tend to rise with education. Among

skilled occupations there is a wide variance of educational attainment,

and earnings tend to rise with schooling through the high school

years and then level off. For operatives and service workers, for

whom relatively little training is required, there is a wide range

of schooling levels but little relation of earnings to schooling.

Additional evidence suggests that among many professional, most

clerical, and some skilled occupations, earnings rise with schooling

after some minimal level of education, though less slowly as advanced

education becomes increasingly less relevant to the actual tasks

performed, and usually up to a ceiling (Wolff (1975), Pp. 53—56).

Thus, we would expect logarithmic education—earnings cross—sectional

profiles within the professional, clerical and perhaps skilled

occupational groups, and flat profiles within the operative and

service groups.

     The regression coefficients of mean schooling (S) confirm this

hypothesis at the five percent significance level for professionals

in 1960 and at the one percent level for professionals in 1970 and

clerical workers in both years. Moreover, the coefficient of mean

schooling is negative and significant at the five percent level in

1960 and at the one percent level in 1970 for the pooled sample.

The other coefficients of mean schooling are insignificant, except
                                     —14 —



for   service workers in 1960, where it is positive. The effect of the

standard deviation of schooling on earnings inequality is more diff i—

cult to predict, since, as in the case of the standard deviation of age,

it depends on the other moments of the education distribution. The

coefficient of the standard deviation of schooling was positive and

significant at, at least, the five percent significance level for the

pooled sample in both years, clerical workers in 1960, and skilled

and service workers in 1970.

      Between 1960 and 1970 the educational composition of the work

force changed substantially. The percentage with 8 or less years

of schooling fell from 33 to 22; the percentage with a high school

degree or more rose from 51 to 55; and those who attended college from

17 to 23 (Wolff (1975), pp. 21—22). However, the distribution of the

labor force among the five occupational groups was almost constant

in this period, except for a shift between operatives and service

workers (Table 1). As a result, the more educated "filtered down"

the occupational ladder. The mean education among professionals

increased slightly between 1960 and 1970, that of clerical workers

and operatives somewhat more, and that of skilled and service workers

by about a full year. To determine whether the effect of schooling

on mean hourly earnings had altered over this period, we tried two

additional regression forms across the pooled sample and the subsamples:

The coefficient estimates of mean schooling and the logarithm of mean

schooling were significant at, at least, the five percent level for

the pooled, professional and clerical samples in 1960, insignificant

for the skilled, operative, and service groups in 1960, and significant

for all groups in 1970 (Table 3). These results suggest that as

job opportunities closed out for the more highly educated new entrants

in the professional and clerical field, they filtered down to the

higher—paying occupations in the skilled, operative and service groups.

This would explain the significant correlation of mean schooling and

mean hourly earnings in these groups in 1970 and its absence in l960.

However, this is a relation across occupations. Within skilled,

operative, and service occupations there Is as little relation between

education and earnings in 1970 as there was in 1960.


D. The Interaction of Age and Schooling

     For professional and clerical workers, we would expect a positive

relation between earnings inequality and the age—education Interactive

variable, whereas for the other groups no relation. In fields like

engineering, programming, administration and secretarial work, entry

salaries tend to be fixed primarily by schooling level. The variance

In earnings will thus be low for a young cohort. As the cohort ages,

the importance of formal schooling for job performance lessens and

that of experience increases, and earnings spread out as factors like




     7The 1970 coefficient estimates of mean schooling and the logarithm
of mean schooling in these three groups are approximately half of
what they are in the other groups, suggesting a much weaker relation
between schooling and earnings in these groups as opposed to the
professional and clerical groups.

ability,   drive, and the occurrence of opportunities assert themselves.

The positive impact of the interaction variable on earnings inequality

is verified for the professional, clerical and pooled samples in

Table 2.


E. Other Factors

      1. Time Worked

      With a fixed hourly wage rate and a fixed distribution of hours

worked around the mean, an increase in mean hours worked will

cause an increase in mean earnings and a decline in the coefficient of

variation. With the hourly wage rate and mean hours worked fixed,

an increase in the standard deviation of hours worked will result

in   increased earnings inequality. This is confirmed for the pooled
sample and most of the occupational subsamples (Table 2)8



     8The variable used was total hours worked per year (H), which
was computed as the product of weeks worked in the year preceding
the Census year and the hours worked in a prespecified week in the
Census year. Only those with a positive number of weeks and hours
worked were included in calculating the mean and standard deviation
of hours worked.
     Results from regression forms (1) and (ii) (see Section C)
indicated that the hourly wage rate was positively and significantly
related to hours worked in the pooled and all subsamples, except for
professionals in both years and clerical workers in 1960. This may
reflect overtime payments, the lower compensation of part—time and
marginal employees and the like. This finding is, in fact, what Barzel
(1973) predicts. Mincer's (1974, p. 94) results also suggest a
positive correlation between weekly earnings and weeks worked, after
controlling for schooling and experience. Mincer (1975) later argues
that firms which train employees are more reluctant to lay them off
and employees are more reluctant to switch jobs because their marginal
product would be lower elsewhere. This, plus more efficient search
procedures, would account for the smaller unemployment of those with
the higher wage rates. This issue deserves fuller exploration at
a later time. For our present purposes, the hourly wage rate gradient
with respect to hours worked does not appear sufficiently great to
offset the postulated effect of the mean and standard deviation of
total hours on earnings inequality.

     2.   Alternative Employment Opportunities

    To control for the industrial mix   of   an occupation, wà introduced

the following "industrial dispersion coefficient" C:


                   —       f   (JJ —   1)2

for occupation I across industries j, where E is the mean earnings

of occupation i In industry j, E the mean earnings of occupation i,

and f Is the percentage of occupation I employed in industry          This

index Is higher the larger the dispersion of occupational membership

across industries and the larger the difference In mean earnings

across Industries. It roughly measures the availability of alternative

employment opportunities for an occupation in different industries

and tends to reflect differences In tasks between industries. (For

example, a bank economist might forecast interest rates, while a

government economist might design national account estinating proce-

dures.) We would expect the dispersion index to have a positive

Impact on earnings inequality. In 1960 this relation is confirmed

in five of the six cases at, at least, the five percent level and

in the sixth case at the ten percent level. In 1960, it is confirmed

at, at least, the five percent level in two cases and at the ten

percent level in one.




     9The 16 industrial groups used in the index are as follows:
1) AgrIculture, Forestry, and Fisheries; 2) MinIng; 3) Construction;
4) Manufacturing (durables); 5) Manufacturing (nondurabls9); 6) Trans-
portation; 7) Communication; 8) Utilities and Sanitary Services;
9) Wholesale Trade; 10) Retail Trade; 11) Finance, Insurance, and
Real Estate; 12) Business and Repair Services; 13) Personal. Services;
14) Entertainment and Recreation Services, 15) Professional and Related
Services; and 16) Public Administration.
                                        — 19 —



       To control for the geographical spread of an occupation's employ-

ment, we introduced into the regression the square of the difference

between the percentage of an occupation employed in an SMSA and

50 percent)0 Previous work had          indicated   that   mean annual earnings

were almost uniformly higher for workers employed in SMSA's than those

employed outside them in a given occupation (Wolff (1975), p. 50).

Moreover, in running the following regression:


                         —p-—
            (iii)
                                c0 + c1 + c2K + c3 + c4(Z SMSA) + w
                          R
we obtained a positive and significant coefficient at, at least, the

five percent level, in the pooled samples and all subsamples in both

years, except for clerical workers in both years and            operatives   in

1960. The previous work had      also   suggested that the variance of

earnings was approximately the same for SMSA workers and non—SMSA

workers in most occupations (Wolff (1975), p. 50). The overall variance

of earnings is therefore maximized when there is an even split in

the occupational work force between SNSA and non—SMSA employment.

Mean earnings, on the other hand, rise as the percentage employed in

SMSA's Increases. Thus, the coefficient of variation either declines

as the percentage employed in an SMSA increases or rises as the SMSA

percentage increases from zero, peaks at or before fifty percent,

and then declines. The percent SMSA less fifty percent should there-

fore have a negative coefficient. The results for 1960 show significant

and positive coefficients for the pooled, professional, and service

samples at the one percent level, and those for 1970 show three
coefficients positive and significant at the one percent level, one

at the five percent level, and the other two at the ten percent

ievei)
     One- possible explanation for this somewhat paradoxical result

is that the urban—rural mix of an occupation is a relatively invariant

characteristic of that occupation. Except for services, the percentage

employed in SNSA's remained relatively stable in the occupational

subsamples   between 1960   and 1970 (Table 1). Previous results had

shoved   this   even more strongly (Wolff (1975), p. 50). Thus, what our

results indicate is not that shifts in the urban—rural mix lead to

greater or less inequality within an ocupation but rather that between

occupations more mixed occupations have less inequality than less

mixed ones. This latter possibility might be due to greater competitive

forces   in the mixed   occupations and a greater tendency to wage rate

equalization     for similarly qualified workers. This hypothesis warrants
further   investigation in the   future.
     Another interesting     feature   of the results is that, except for
services, all the coefficients of the deviation form of the percent         SMSA


variable were more significant in       1970 than in 1960.12 On the   other hand,



     11We also tried the percent employed in an SMSA instead of the
deviation form of the percent employed in the regression with far
fewer significant coefficients. Farbman (1973), whose unit of observa-
tion was the county and whose sample consisted of southern states,
found relatively few significant coefficients for percent rural.


     12The rise in the minimum wage during the sixties and the extension
of its coverage to many kinds of service workers may have narrowed
the earnings differential between urban and rural areas for service
workers and accounted for the lower t—ratio of the variable for service
workers in 1970.
                                      —21—


all the regression coefficients of the industrial dispersion coeffi-

cient were less significant in 1970 than in 1960, except for the pooled

sample. This suggests a trend towards reducing occupational earnings

differences across industries while increasing them between rural

and urban areas. This too might warrant further analysis in the future.

     3. Expected Earnings

     To determine whether a trade—off existed between expected earnings

and its risk, as measured by the coefficient of variation, we included

mean earnings (E) in the regression. The only case of a significant

and positive coefficient was for professionals in 1970, suggesting

that this group has a choice between a low risk, low return job, like

teaching, and a high risk, high return job, like administration.13

     4.   Discrimination
     Having controlled   for time worked, age, schooling, industrial

dispersion,   and geographical mix,   we   wanted to determine whether there
existed   any systematic tendency to underpay females and minorities

with respect to white males within a given occupation. In the case

of minorities, which constitute a small percentage of most occupations,

the effect should show up as a positive relation between the coeffi-

cient of variation and the percentage of minorities employed in the

occupation. In the case of females, where they constitute approxi-

mately one—third or more of an occupation, this should show up as a

negative relation between earnings inequality and the square of the




            skilled workers in 1960 and service workers in 1970 had
significant negative coefficients. This suggests that the high wage
earners in these groups also enjoy the steadier employment. In the
case of skilled workers, this may be due to the heavy presence of unions.
                                    — 22    —




difference   between percent female   and   fifty percent.

     Different forms were tried for the pooled sample and each of the

sub samples in the two years. The results varied very little        between
forms, and Table 4 shows the results of adding       the   deviation totm
of percent females and   the   percent black and   Hispanic   to the variables
in Table 2.14 The change in the R—squared from adding these two
variables was,   relatively small in all cases except for operatives in
1960 and service workers. The only occurrences of significant coeff i—
cients in the hypothesized directions were for the percent black and

Hispanic in the operative group in 1960 at the one percent level and

for the deviation form of percent females in 1970 in the pooled sample

at the five percent level and for the service group at the one percent

level. The coefficient estimates of the other variables changed

vey little from adding these two variables.15 By and large no

systematic   pattern of differential compensation for white males,
females,   and minorities within occupation could be inferred from our

regression results.




     L4other variables tried were the percent female, the percent
white female, the deviation form of the percent white female, the
deviation form of percent black and Hispanic, the percent black and
Hispanic males, the percent black and Hispanic females, and the
deviation forms of the latter two.

     15The major exceptions were the following: 1) the standard
deviation of schooling became insignificant for clerical workers in
1960; 2) mean earnings became insignficant for
3) mean age, the standard deviation of age and the age—education inter-
active variable became significant, at. the five percent level, for
service workers in 1960; and 4) the standard deviation of schooling
became insignificant for service workers in 1970.

    These results conform to those reported in an earlier study

(Wolf f (1976)). In this study the work force was divided into 32

occupational groups, and the overall differential in earnings between

whites, and blacks and Hispanics, and males and females was decomposed

into two effects: one from differences in their occupational distri-

bution and the other from differences in mean earnings within occupation.

In the case of blacks and Hispanics, "occupational segregation" was

the more Important factor of the two, while in the case of females

both factors were of similar import)6 However, no adjustments were

made for hours worked, age, education, or differences in labor demand

conditions, as in the present study. Moreover, here we use a much




     16Even with a division of the labor force into five occupational
groups, we can see sizeable differences in the occupational distri-
bution of white males, white females, black and Hispanic males, and
black and Hispanic females (Table 1).
                                    — 24   —




finer   occupation breakdown. Therefore, in our sample occupational

segregation should show up as a much stronger determinant of differences

in earnings between white males    and other groups, and differences
in pay for the same work a much weaker force, as the results in Table 4

tend to support.

     This argument would also help explain the findings of Chiswick (1974)

of a flatter age—earnings profile for non—white males than white

males, of Hanushek (1973) that    the mean     regression coefficient of

experience   for blacks was about half   that of whites, and of Hanushek (1973)

and of others of a smaller rate of return to schooling for blacks

than whites. These results would occur if discrimination forced

blacks into those occupations where schooling and experience were un-

related to earnings, which are precisely the low—paid occupations.

Chiswick   argued   that the flatter age—earnings profile of non-whites

was probably due to their smaller post—school investment. Yet their

smaller   "investment" may be due to their placament in those occupations
where training is irrelevant. Welch (1973) found that the returns to
schooling    for those entering the work force in 1960 were greater for

blacks (compared to other blacks) than for whites (compared to other

whites), while for those entering the work force in the 1930's and

1940's the returns were less for blacks (and in some cases negative).

This would be the case if the more educated blacks in the younger

cohorts now have access to the upper part of the occupational ladder

while the less educated are forced into their "traditional" slots

at the bottom of the occupational ladder. This hypothesis might

warrant further investigation in the future.

              II.   Conclusion and Comparison with Other Studies


     One way of summarizing our findings is to look at the percent

of the inter-occupation variance in earnings inequality explained by

the factors we have used in our model (Table 2). The coefficients

of determination (R2) vary between .50 and .91. The explained variance

is highest for the clerical group in both years, followed by skilled

and service workers, and then by professionals and operatives. If the

residual is primarily due to the structured and institutional charac-

teristics of the occupation, then these characteristics se strongest

for professionals and Operatives and weakest for clerical workers.

Between 1960 and 1970, the R2 declined in each group, except skilled

workers, suggesting that institutional forces became more important during

the decade.

     The "human capital" factors, schooling and age, were strongly

significant for the professional. and clerical groups, marginally

significant for skilled labor, and almost entirely insignificant for

operatives and service workers. This suggests that human capital

factors may be relevant to perhaps half the labor force. The fact

that the human capital factors are highly significant for the pooled

samples must be construed as an artifact of aggregation, where the

significant relations between earnings, schooling and age in the pro-

fessional and clerical groups dominate the random relations in the

other groups. Moreover, the fact that Mincer (1974) and Chiswick

(1974) obtain significant coefficients for schooling and experience

across the entire labor force is likewise due to the aggregation of
                                     — 26 —




relevant   with non—relevant groups.17

    An alternative explanation for our results to one that might be

inferred from a human   capital   model is that   the   distribution of earnings

slots is fairly well fixed within occupation and that the occupational

distribution (and by implication the industrial composition) is the

primary determinant of the overall distribution of earnings. This

interpretation is consistent with Soltow's (1960) early findings that

historically the change in income inequality in the United States was

due more to the redistribution of workers over occupations than their

distribution over schooling level or age. It is also consistent with

Hanushek's (1973) finding that differences in industrial and occupa-

tional structure among regions account for over 80 percent of the

variance in mean earnings across regions and to Osberg's (1975)

finding that once controlling for differences in structure between

counties, personal characteristics like age and education are unimpor-

tant in explaining differences in mean earnings and earnings inequality

across counties.

     The function of schooling would then be to "rank" individuals

within a relatively well defined set of occupational slots. This is

consistent with our finding that the secular change in the schooling

distribution between 1960 and 1970 had relatively little impact on

occupational earnings inequality. What appeared to happen instead

was that the better educated new entrants in the labor force "filtered

down" the occupational ladder as professional and clerical positions




                                                                                   .
     17Actually, their samples are restricted to males between 25 and
65, to white males between 25 and 65 in some cases, and white non—farm
adult males in other cases.
                                    —27—


closed up to the higher paying occupations within the skilled,

operative, and service groups. This would explain the significant

relation between mean earnings and mean education across occupations

in these latter three groups in 1970 and their insignificant relation

in 1960. However, the more highly educated new entrants in these

occupations apparently did not receive greater wages than their less

educated co—workers, since the increased mean schooling in these groups

still had an insignificant impact on earnings inequality. It appears

instead that the educational requirement for a given job in these

occupational groups was inflated during the 1960's to meet the composi-

tion of the new labor force, but the tasks remained relatively unchanged

and pay remained commensurate with the task.'8 Thus, it does not appear

that, given a structure of occupational tasks, education is intrinsically

productivity—augmenting. Rather, it appears to serve as a ranking

device for prospective employees throughout much of the occupational

ladder.

     The effect   of   experience on earnings would also vary among occu-

pations, depending on the characteristics of the occupation. For

professional, clerical, and some skilled occupations Mincer's (1962,

1974, 1975) argument that differences in post—school investment in

training leads to differences in earnings is consistent with our

findings. Moreover, special studies of professional groups by Link

(1973) for chemical engineers, Katz (1973) for university faculty,




     LSprom our personal experience we know that in a public utility
company in New Jersey an appliance repairman did not require a high
school diploma in 1965 but he did in 1970, though the job changed very
little over this period.
                                       — 28 —



Johnson and Stafford (1974) for academic economists, and IClevmarken

and Quigley (1976) for    Swedish engineers all show a positive relation

between earnings and experience. However, for operative, service

and certain skilled occupations age (and by implication experience)

seems to have little bearing on earnings.

     Our finding that earnings inequality decreases with mean age within

an occupation is not inconsistent with Chiswick's (1974) finding that

the variance of age is positively related to earnings inequality

across states, to Mincer's that the relative dispersion in gross

earnings rises as a schooling cohort ages until peak earnings are

reached, or to a previous finding that the Cmi coefficient fell for

age cohorts between 18 and 30 and rose thereafter (Wolff (1975)).

These findings can be reconciled if the occupational composition shifts

as a cohort ages and, in particular, if the more able, more ambitious

or better schooled move up the job ladder to the more technical or

administrative positions while the less able, less ambitious, or

less schooled remain "stuck"     in   their entry—level occupations. This

is consistent with the findings of both Rause (1972) and Taubman and

Wales (1973) of increasing impact of ability on earnings with age.

This interpretation is similar to one offered by Becker (1975, p. 217)

to explain the earlier peak. of earnings with age for less skilled than

more skilled workers. This interpretation is also consistent with

Alexander's (1974) finding that firm      experience   is a more Important

determinant of earnings   than   age for low and medium income workers,

but a less important one for high income workers. This would be the

case if the high income workers can move up the occupational ladder

faster by switching firms, whereas the low and medium income workers,
                                  — 29 —



as Alexander argues, start at the bottom of the ladder when they

switch firms.

      The attenuation of the impact of schooling on earnings with age,

observed by us, Chiawick (1974), and Mincer (1974), can also be

explained by this model. Suppose that entry into occupations in the

top part of the ladder is set by schooling level and that in the bottom

part is relatively free and that entry—level wages are relatively

fixed in an occupation. As the cohort ages, promotions and raises

will be based on performance, and the more able, better educated

and more ambitious will obtain better positions and receive higher

earnings. (See Taubman and Wales (1973) for a similar argument.)

However, since post—school training and ability play a more Important

role in the later working life, the effect of schooling on earnings

will decay over time. This model can help explain Mincer's (1974)

findings that earnings inequality is less for the highly educated than

the less educated early In working life, but the order is reversed

later in working life, results which Mincer says "are in no obvious

way related to secular trends in human capital, such as the upward

trend in schooling" (pp. 108—9). At the entry level stages, the highly

educated are more concentrated in the occupational ladder than the less

educated and thus have a amaller relative dispersion of earnings.

As the cohort ages, the less educated remain in their initial occupa-

tions and, relatively speaking, their earnings tend to converge.

Among the more educated there will be greater opportunity for some

to   move up the occupational ladder and the earnings within this
group will tend to diverge with age.

    The alternative argument we have presented is, at this     stage,
simply a sketch of a model in which the function of schooling and

experience can   be   understood in the context of an exogenously

determined occupational structure. We hope this work will lead to

further development of the argument by ourselves and other researchers.
