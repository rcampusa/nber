Since the 2008 global financial crisis, and after decades of relative neglect, the importance of the financial
system and its episodic crises as drivers of macroeconomic outcomes has attracted fresh scrutiny from
academics, policy makers, and practitioners. Theoretical advances are following a lead set by a fast-growing
empirical literature. Recent long-run historical work has uncovered a range of important stylized facts
concerning financial instability and the role of credit in advanced economies, and this article provides
an overview of the key findings.

                                1.    INTRODUCTION

The global financial crisis of 2008 was fundamentally a credit crisis on a massive,
international scale. Nothing remotely like it had been seen since the 1930s.
As the world still grapples with this event, from its origins to its aftermath, a
dramatic rethinking has been taking place in the so-called advanced economies.
Without doubt, many deep questions raised by this unexpected and costly financial
disturbance remain unanswered in government, policy, and financial circles, where
many of the shocks are still being felt. But research programs in economics have
also been overtaken by events. Where do we stand, and what fresh evidence can
guide us?
    One way to frame an interest in and an understanding of the crisis, within and
outside academe, is to start by asking which prior assumptions were exposed by
events, how they were found wanting, and what damage this did. Summarizing
his recent book The Shifts and the Shocks, Wolf (2014) of the Financial Times
pinpoints the essential delusion in the advanced economies:1 In short, we did
not think something like this could happen. This mistaken belief had two flawed
ingredients. First, we saw the chances of a financial crisis as almost impossibly
remote—we thought these events happened to others, like emerging markets,
but not to us. Second, even if we did admit some tiny risk of crises, we thought
they would not be too painful: We could cope and clean up satisfactorily using
the policy tools and skills at hand. All seemed well, and faith rested on the
Great Moderation, inflation targeting, policy rules, financial development, efficient

                                                1
markets, and a slew of institutional reforms. But after hubris came nemesis: Wolf
argues that the huge costs of the crisis—lost output, slow growth, unemployment,
insecurity, etc.—mean that there is a heavy price to pay. Now the elites, the policy
makers, but also the economists have ended up discredited, diminished, and
widely distrusted.
    If this bleak postmortem is correct, what can restore intellectual credibility?
Seeing the social costs of these macroeconomic crises, and with extra doses of
humility and the scientific method, we might at least avoid making the same
mistakes again. A vigorous recrudescence of macrofinancial economic research
is now seeking better evidence and new ideas that respond to the perceived
shortcomings and complacency built into the precrisis worldview. Of particular
interest, the inductive approach has risen in importance, and new empirical
findings from history have emerged, which can strengthen arguments beyond a
reliance on introspection and the deductive approach alone. So although new and
improved theories are essential, they may prove more resilient next time around if
they are rooted in facts. Indeed, a better knowledge of the historical record could
have led us to a very different understanding in the run-up to the 2008 global
financial crisis. Fortunately, there is now a greater appreciation of the value of
broader perspectives, and this article reports on a new stream of work from an
empirical project in macrofinancial history that is part of the new research agenda.


             2.   THE AGE OF FINANCIAL INSTABILITY

In what follows, set in the context of a substantial body of past and current
work by many other scholars, I lay out the findings from an ongoing macro-
financial economic history project over the past five years that provides new data
and analyses to exhaustively study credit and financial crises, compile relevant
stylized facts, and investigate their causes and consequences in the entire modern
history of the advanced economies since 1870.2
    Arguably, the two issues that should be at center stage in such work are those
just highlighted above as the key flawed assumptions prior to the crisis: the
misperceptions as to the expected likelihood and the expected costs of financial
crisis events in advanced economies. So can careful empirical work based on
history provide us with better estimates of these key measures?

                                         2
    We start with a look at simple unconditional estimates, but because financial
crises are rare events, it is obvious that reliable estimates of these expected values
are impossible in small samples using conventional, short-horizon, contemporary
macroeconomic data sets. While a recession occurs perhaps once every 5–10 years,
a financial crisis happens on average only every 15–20 years. That amounts to five
or six crises per century, meaning that robust statistical inference requires a data
set that is substantially expanded in either the space or time dimension, or both.
For this reason, recent research has focused on building larger data sets covering
wider samples of advanced economies (15–25 countries) and longer spans of time
(more than 100 years).


2.1.   Historical Frequency of Financial Crises
Why do we study financial crises, and what are they? We start by taking for
granted that financial crises are not normal events and that they are therefore
worthy of special study. That may not be a given, but as demonstrated in the rest
of the article, it can be easily shown that they are indeed highly unusual as judged
by a number of quantifiable criteria, should the readers fail to be persuaded by
the outturn of events they have witnessed since 2008.
    For quantitative purposes, a financial crisis, at its simplest, is a binary on-off
event. Although more refined definitions could be implemented in principle, for
example, based on the intensity of the crisis, such approaches have not yet been
found workable. But even to study the frequency of binary financial crisis events,
and ultimately model their probability, we need a satisfactory and agreed-upon
definition of what constitutes a financial crisis.
    Some of the most important work done in the classification of financial crisis
events has unsurprisingly originated from the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, including recent well-known studies by Laeven & Valencia (2008,
2012) and going all the way back to seminal works by Caprio & Klingebiel (1996,
2002). In their pioneering study, Bordo et al. (2001, p. 55) follow a standard
definition in this literature to define financial crises as “episodes of financial-
market volatility marked by significant problems of illiquidity and insolvency
among financial-market participants and/or by official intervention to contain
those consequences.” This is sometimes a judgment call, but most subsequent


                                          3
works in economic and financial history (e.g., Reinhart & Rogoff 2009) built upon
the same approach, although for some countries and episodes different authors
may disagree about whether an event counts as a crisis. I adopt the same criteria
in this article, using a standard indicator definition based on the above literature
that takes a value of 1 in the first year when a financial crisis event occurs, and 0
otherwise.3
    Using the above definition, Figure 1 shows the historical annual frequency of
financial crisis events in the world since 1800, drawing on the Reinhart-Rogoff
event classification for the broadest sample of countries, for both the advanced
(high-income; n = 23) and the emerging/developing (middle- and low-income;
n = 44) groups. Some features of the data stand out. There were no financial crises
recorded in emerging markets before the 1860s, but this reflects in part missing
data and small samples; it also reflects the relative financial underdevelopment of
poorer countries at that point in history, which left them with insufficient financial
infrastructure to cause any crisis of macroeconomic scale. After that, over the long
sweep of history, the average probability of being in a financial crisis was small,
but not negligible, and was at a similar level of approximately 6% for both groups
after 1870. In contrast, advanced economies have been experiencing financial
crises almost continuously since 1800 (indeed, the first modern financial crisis
was arguably the 1797 banking and currency crisis in Britain). Crises have not
occurred uniformly, and there have been spikes here and there, especially at times
of globally synchronized distress, such as 1929 and 2008, and at lesser peaks, such
as 1890 and 1907. The one exception was the postwar oasis of calm seen from
the 1940s to the early 1970s, coinciding with an epoch of the financial repression
of domestic banking systems in the post-1930s (e.g., high capital requirements,
strict regulation and supervision) and restrictions in the Bretton Woods era on
cross-border capital flows (i.e., exchange controls). In those years, the number of
crises in emerging markets was only two or three, and in advanced economies,
there were exactly zero.
    A few key takeaways emerge from these data. First, financial crises are not
black swans but are rare events: First, for the typical country, they occur every 15–
20 years on average; thus, we need a large sample of countries and time periods
to do serious empirical work. History matters. Second, in the long run, the
frequency of financial crises has actually not been that different between advanced

and emerging economies; the two groups of economies are not so different after
all, and it was quite complacent to imagine that the advanced world had escaped
from financial crisis risk. Third, the immediate decades following World War II
were an unusually and deceptively calm era without any financial crises, creating
a false sense of security. For some special historical or institutional reasons, it may
have been a period of unusually stable finance-capitalism dynamics, as compared
to the rest of modern macroeconomic history since the early nineteenth century.


2.2.                                              Historical Costs of Financial Crises
The above evidence shows that financial crises have a frequency that is low but
not negligible. But they have recently become a focus of intense interest because
of their many distinctive characteristics—most particularly because they are now
known to be associated with significantly worse economic performance in the
short to medium term. The aftermath of the 2008 crisis quickly focused attention
on this issue because these cumulated costs seem worryingly high, prompting the
question as to what explains the costs and thus what steps might mitigate them.
    It is well known that emerging-market economies often suffer painful reces-


                                                                                               5
sions after financial crisis events (Kaminsky & Reinhart 1999, Hoggarth et al. 2002,
Cerra & Saxena 2008, Reinhart & Rogoff 2009). Of course, it is then natural to
wonder if these empirical regularities merely reflect something different about
the fragility and volatility of emerging economies, for institutional or other rea-
sons (Acemoglu et al. 2003). Indeed, after the 2008 global financial crisis, policy
makers in advanced countries at first invoked an exceptionalism argument to
downplay concerns about the likely costs of the crisis relative to typical emerging-
market cases. This excuse became unpersuasive, however, as the sluggish recovery
dragged on.
    The rest of this article focuses exclusively on the historical experience of the
advanced economies to sharpen the evidence for this group while averting any
risk of complaints about the inappropriate pooling of advanced and emerging
subsamples. This approach can pay off provided one takes a longer historical
view so as to develop a sample size sufficient to deliver statistical power.4
    Focusing on the historical recession experiences in our sample, Figure 2 docu-
ments the basic stylized facts on the costs of financial crisis recessions, compared
to the baseline case of normal recessions, using the most recent and compre-
hensive sample of advanced-country data. Following Jordà et al. (2013a), we
start by applying simple event-study methods to compute average unconditional
recovery paths following what we call a normal recession (N) and a financial crisis
recession (F). To fix ideas, we can think of the N’s as the control group and the
F’s as the treatment group. We define the latter as a recession with a peak most
closely coincident with a financial crisis, plus or minus two years; the former are
all other cases. The figure shows unconditional means of log real GDP per capita
relative to a peak out to a five-year horizon for all recessions and recoveries since
1870 in a sample of 17 advanced economies, covering 223 recession events in total.
The country sample consists of Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and events in or close to
the two world wars are excluded. Roughly three in four of these recession events
are normal recessions, and one in four are financial crisis recessions.5 Cyclical
peak years are denoted year 0 and were assigned using the Bry & Boschan (1971)
algorithm applied to real GDP per capita; they line up with narrative chronologies
of recession dates where available.

    Figure 2a shows the results for all years. Normal recessions are mild on
average; they have negative growth for one year, with a loss of approximately 2%
in real GDP per capita. Growth then resumes at a rate of approximately 1.5%
per year out to year 5, leaving real GDP per capita on average approximately 4%
above its previous peak. Financial recessions are strikingly different, and much
more severe on average; they have negative growth for two years, with a total
decline of approximately 3% in real GDP per capita. Growth then resumes at
a rate of about approximately 1% per year out to year 5, leaving real GDP per
capita on average at about the same level as its previous peak. Formal statistical
significance tests confirm that these paths are different after year 1.
    Figure 2b,c breaks these paths down for the pre– and post–World War II
samples, respectively. Before World War II, the paths are flatter; this results from
weaker growth in that era in all years, plus the inclusion of the Great Depression
in the sample. After World War II, trend growth is faster. However, the same basic
patterns hold true as in the full sample: The financial crisis recessions exhibit
much more adverse recovery paths compared to those of the normal recessions.


                                                                                                             7
In fact, this difference seems to have become more extreme over time: In Figure
2b, the two pre–World War II paths almost converge by year 5, and are within 2%
of each other, but in Figure 2c, the two post–World War II paths remain far apart,
with a difference of 4–5% still in year 5.
    Figure 3 reinforces the argument that financial crisis recessions are quite
atypical phenomena as compared to normal recessions, as seen by the average
unconditional paths for real investment per capita, real credit (bank lending) per
capita, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) price level, and the short-term (nominal)
interest rate, where again the same event definitions are used for the analysis. In
the normal case, real investment per capita drops a few percentage points for one
year, then picks up, returns to its peak level by year 3, and resumes growth. Real
credit per capita continues to grow in all years, as does the CPI price level, and
the short-term interest rate is lower for the next five years by approximately 200
basis points. In financial crisis recessions, real investment per capita collapses
by as much as 20% out to year 3 and does not recover even by year 5; real credit
per capita grows only about half as fast as in the normal case. The CPI price
level remains flat for five years, and short-term interest rates are lower for longer,
dropping by approximately 400 basis points.
    The message from these data is striking. Financial crisis recessions are far
deeper and longer than normal recessions. This is true for the distant pre–World
War II era of the gold standard and hard money, fiscal orthodoxy, and no bailouts,
but it is also true, and to an even greater degree, for the post–World War II era of
activist central banks, fiat money, automatic stabilizers, and financial regulation
and backstops. Despite many efforts by policy makers to moderate business cycles,
not only are the damaging effects of financial crisis recessions still recurring, they
bring with them costs as high as before, if not higher.


2.3.   Explicanda
We now take the stylized facts as given. For over a century, financial crises
have been recurring phenomena associated with very costly recessions and other
pronounced macroeconomic shocks. Moreover, these crises have not been confined
to emerging markets but are as likely to afflict advanced economies too.
    Two major questions naturally follow, which have preoccupied economists and

policy makers and which are the focus of the rest of this article. Given the stylized
facts based on the unconditional frequencies and sample averages of the sort seen
above, we must ask whether further conditioning information can reveal anything
about the mechanisms behind the unusual patterns in the data.
    First, can we identify any economic factors that can help us understand the
probability of financial crisis events occurring (Figure 1)? Are these crises simply
random chance, or do some measurable covariate patterns in the macroeconomic
environment indicate when we are more or less likely to be at risk of an incipient
crisis? Here quantitative historical research has ventured into signal detection and
binary classification methods; the key result here will show how credit buildup
has always been a powerful warning signal of rising financial instability risk,
consistent with contemporary research.

                                                                                     9
    Second, can we find any factors that can help us to understand why, conditional
on a financial crisis event, the subsequent macroeconomic performance is so much
worse than that in a normal recession and is characterized by large output losses
(Figure 2) and sharp deviations in other macroeconomic variables (Figure 3)? Are
the adverse means seen here along the recovery paths simply ineluctable, or are
there macroeconomic covariates that can help us account for the distinct shifts
between the two paths? Here our quantitative work draws on local projection (LP)
methods. The key result will be that overhang from the credit buildup is strongly
associated with worse recovery performance, explaining a substantial fraction of
the economy’s inferior performance after crisis events.
    In summary, the evolution of private credit over the business cycle is not
uniform over time and space, and significant historical variations in the cycli-
cal behavior of credit help predict both the onset of financial crisis events and
their subsequent impact as measured by macroeconomic drag. These findings,
documented below, form a platform for ongoing and future research. Gathering
more empirical evidence, with finer levels of detail and more robustness, we
can sharpen our focus on the key mechanisms at work, hopefully informing the
development of more realistic theoretical models at the macrofinance nexus. If so,
when the next crisis threatens, we might be a little bit wiser than last time.


                      3.   THE ASCENT OF CREDIT

What role, if any, can the study of credit play in explaining the above patterns
and providing answers to our two key questions? This is by no means a new
area of inquiry, and past macroeconomic debates can certainly inform our search
for a better intellectual framework. Although little noted, indeed virtually for-
gotten, in the run-up to the global financial crisis in 2008, the idea that credit
or leverage might shape macroeconomic outcomes is a very old one indeed, but
with hindsight, it is obvious that we have witnessed something similar to an
old-fashioned banking crisis, although with some distinctive modern features
(Gorton 2010, 2012; Gorton & Metrick 2012). Yet attempts to understand emergent
financial fragility go way back, to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Britain,
the first country to enter a phase of capitalistic economic growth built upon a
recognizably modern money and banking architecture. From the earliest analyses

                                        10
of macroeconomic fluctuations and crises by British scholars, the role of paper
credit in a private banking system, and its potentially destabilizing role, was seen
as a key mechanism even under a seemingly inelastic monetary regime like the
gold standard (e.g., Thornton 1939 [1802]; Attwood 1817; Bagehot 1873; Hawtrey
1913, 1919).
    These ideas did not immediately take hold in the face of gold-based orthodoxy,
but their time would come, and they would eventually spread far and wide.
Referring to the opening quotation from Laughlin (1902) in Section 1, we can see
how these views had permeated US economic thinking by the start of the twentieth
century. They would underpin the Federal Reserve’s financial stability doctrines
concerning safe versus unsafe credit from 1923 up until their abandonment in the
1960s (Rotemberg 2014). Similarly, with regard to the other opening quotation,
from the Macmillan Committee (1931), over in the United Kingdom, there was a
shift in thinking away from Bank Rate and a narrow monetary policy operating
under golden fetters toward an awareness of macroprudential concerns arising
from credit-driven boom-bust cycles. The committee stated bluntly that “credit
is essentially unstable,” and this view gained sway in the post–World War II
era. Qualitative and quantitative credit controls were then in use by the Bank of
England up to the 1970s, when they too were finally cast aside.6
    Still, notwithstanding some landmark twentieth-century works on debt-driven
booms and busts, such as Fisher (1933), Minsky (1986), and Kindleberger (1978),
each unduly neglected for years but now suddenly read by so many, the issues of
credit and crises were to be largely peripheral in the post–World War II ideas of
the economic and policy worlds in advanced economies up to 2008. An exception
was the literature on the financial accelerator (Bernanke 1981, 1983; Bernanke &
Gertler 1989; Bernanke et al. 1996), which set out a role for levered finance as an
amplification mechanism, even if it placed the driving shocks elsewhere. Still, up
to this point in the history of thought, very little large-scale systematic empirical
evidence had been presented to supplement a priori theories or a reliance on a
few case studies, with few exceptions—most notably the work from the Bank of
International Settlements (BIS) by Borio and collaborators exploring the recent
post-1970 evidence on credit, asset prices, and financial instability (e.g., Borio &
Lowe 2002a,b; Borio & White 2004).7
    Now, in the wake of crisis, the role of credit is much more at center stage,

                                         11
with new research focusing on how increasing crisis risk can emerge over time
and how deleveraging after a crisis can create a worse recession. In Gorton
& Ordoñez (2014), credit booms can start with lenders paying little effort to
get costly information about collateral quality, but over time the quality decays,
and financial fragility emerges endogenously and can be triggered by even a
small shock. In Eggertsson & Krugman (2012), the role of heterogeneous agents
allows differential responses to shocks among debtors and creditors, leading to
adverse aggregate demand conditions, exacerbating liquidity traps in zero–interest
rate conditions, building on the empirical analysis and historical account of the
Japanese “balance sheet recession” put forward by Koo (2009). As important as
new theory, we now also see more systematic empirical work, some intranational
and some international. In an influential book, Mian & Sufi (2014) use cross-
location analyses of US state- and county-level trends before, during, and after
the 2008 crisis to convincingly establish a causal link between the levering up of
households before the peak, especially via mortgages, and the intensity of the
subsequent demand collapse and downturn at the local level (key supporting
papers include Mian & Sufi 2009 and Mian et al. 2013). These authors, like Wolf
(2014), draw policy lessons from the instability of credit-based macroeconomic
systems. But not all the answers are in when it comes to credit and financial
stability, and a tension clearly exists as an academic research agenda slowly gears
up and ponders old questions, while a policy world in shock hastens to design
and implement new macroprudential policies to stave off the next crisis and close
the stable door.


3.1.   Historical Evolution of Credit
New historical findings complement these new directions in economic research
and establish stylized facts for a wide range of countries over a broad sweep of
history. After a long and exacting process to gather historical annual data on
aggregate credit in advanced economies since 1870, we have discovered that the
patterns seen in the recent crisis turn are not unusual at all: They are consistent
with the coevolution of cyclical credit and macroeconomic conditions witnessed
ever since the birth of finance capitalism approximately 150 years ago. The
empirical findings also complement recent studies that have used short, wide


                                        12
panels of pooled samples of both advanced and emerging economies, such as
Kaminsky & Reinhart (1999), Borio & Lowe (2002a), and Gourinchas & Obstfeld
(2012). Our work on the advanced economies in a long, narrow panel maintains a
large sample size but minimizes the risks of pooling countries at different stages
of development.
    The core data we use are long-run time series from 1870 to now for 17 countries
for private credit, which is defined as total domestic currency lending by private
banks to the nonfinancial sector, as detailed in Schularick & Taylor (2012) and
Jordà et al. (2013a). This measure includes loans to households and businesses. It
excludes loans to government, interbank lending, and foreign currency lending,
and it covers only the loan books of banks. All monetary institutions are covered,
including savings banks, building societies, and some other bank-like entities.
Securities in the trading book are not included, and any market-based credit or
nonbank (shadow banking) credit is excluded as well.8 Significant efforts were
needed to make the data as clean and consistent as possible and to track down
obscure secondary and primary sources. Statistical concepts and definitions of
banks and monetary institutions vary over time and space, and we relied on help
from many scholars and organizations to assemble data for the first time in a
coherent form.9
    A major stylized fact to emerge from the data is shown in Figure 4. From 1870
to the present day, the advanced economies have at almost all times operated with
ever-increasing levels of leverage, as measured by bank loans relative to GDP. The
figure shows the simple average in each year, as well as the minimum-maximum
and 1 standard deviation ranges. The only major exception to the tendency of
rising leverage was the 1930–1950 period, when due to the Great Depression and
World War II there was the near collapse of the financial systems in advanced
economies, dramatic deleveraging, followed by slow recoveries, and then a shift
to a planned war economy followed by an era of postwar financial repression.10 It
took until 1970 for the average 1929 level of bank lending to GDP of 50% to be
attained once more, but since 1970, this ratio has climbed to unprecedented levels,
with the average breaching the 100% level for the first time on the eve of the 2008
global financial crisis.
    Figure 5 confirms that the result is not driven by a peculiar subset of countries
and shows the ratio of bank lending to GDP for each country at key selected

benchmark dates. The trend has not been driven by the United States, the Anglo-
Saxons, or any specific country group. All countries have experienced a dramatic
rise in their private credit ratio to GDP measured by our bank lending data,
from 1870 to the present. In some cases, such as Australia, the Netherlands,
and the United Kingdom, the change is most dramatic in the past few decades.
In other cases, such as Denmark, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland, the ratios
were high early on but kept rising. In some countries, the banking system was
almost nonexistent in 1870 but is very large today, such as Portugal and Spain.
Other countries saw temporary declines in the ratio, such as Germany from 1900
to 1929, only to bounce back higher. Although the yearly averages in Figure 4
clearly conceal some country-specific variations in the path of credit expansion,
the details in Figure 5 show that the long-run financialization trend toward a
larger role for bank credit has been common to all advanced countries.

emerging economies. Possibly one reason for this, until 2008, was the relative
infrequency of advanced-economy crises in the post–World War II sample of
easily accessible data. But crises had happened somewhat regularly in emerging
economies since the 1970s, which became the main area of concern. Studies found
that multiple signals were informative of elevated crisis risk, but one consistently
strong and reliable signal was credit, measured by either rapid recent growth or
an unusually high level (or gap) relative to the trend, although the two measures
end up being highly correlated, by construction (Kaminsky & Reinhart 1999, Borio
& Lowe 2002a, Gourinchas & Obstfeld 2012).
    For a focus on the advanced economies, we need a longer historical sample, and
much primary data collection work was required to make this possible. Indeed,
with few exceptions (e.g., Eichengreen & Mitchener 2003, focusing on the 1920s),
the empirical investigation of credit-driven booms and busts in historical eras


                                                                                          15
has been quite hampered by a lack of systematic data sets. With that challenge
surmounted, the door is now open to deeper quantitative analysis. Our first
task was then to assess and thus confirm the robustness of the credit signal as a
forewarning signal of incipient financial crises in advanced countries. For this
exercises, various papers (Schularick & Taylor 2012, Jordà et al. 2013b) have used
tools from the theory of binary classification and signal detection, principally the
correct classification frontier (CCF) (Jordà & Taylor 2011) as explained in Box 1.
    We adapt these tools to explore the role of credit in predicting the onset of a
financial crisis event, using the traditional crisis binary indicator noted above.11
Formally, in our panel data, suppose that a binary indicator CRISISit takes the
value 1 when a financial crisis happens in country i at time t and is 0 otherwise.
A vector of macroeconomic variables Xt−1 known at time t − 1 can be used as
predictors of the crisis variable in an empirical probability model. Consider, for
example, a standard fixed-effect logit model of the form

(LOGIT)         logit( pit ) = β 0i + β 1 ( L)CREDITit + β 2 ( L) Xit + eit ,

where logit( p) = ln[ p/(1 − p)] is the log of the odds ratio for the CRISISit = 1
event, L is the lag operator, and fixed effects are included for each country in the
panel. The CREDITit variable is our measure of private credit, bank loans divided
by GDP, and the lag polynomial β 1 ( L) allows us to investigate whether the lags
of credit are informative. The lag polynomial β 2 ( L) allows for other possible
causal factors in the form of an arbitrary set of additional macroeconomic control
variables in the vector Xit . We assume that the error term eit is well behaved.
    Table 1 and Figure 6 present CCF diagrams and estimation results based
on logit models of the above (LOGIT) form, where for simplicity there are no
additional controls X, and the lag polynomial in CREDIT takes the form of a
five-year moving average of the change in total bank loans relative to GDP. The
two world wars are excluded from the estimation sample. In all cases, the credit
signal is seen to have predictive value at the 95% confidence level, where the test
is based on the AUC statistic, for which inference is relatively simple because
the distribution is asymptotically normal. In the three cases, the AUC is 0.5 for
the uninformative classifier, as shown by the diagonal reference line in the figure.
In our case, we specify a null logit model with country fixed effects only and a


                                            16
Suppose that dit is a binary outcome (0 or 1), δ̂it = β̂Xit is a parametric continuous
(real) signal from a model (possibly estimated) that might predict the outcome based on
observables X, and let c (real) be some threshold value. A binary classifier is a prediction
dˆit = I (δ̂it > c), where I () is the indicator function. We define the sensitivity of the
classifier as the true positive rate, TP(c) = P(dˆit = 1|dit = 1), and the specificity of the
classifier as the true negative rate TN (c) = P(dˆit = 0|dit = 0).
    We define the correct classification frontier, or CCF, as the plot of the true positive
rate TP(c) against the true negative rate TN (c), for all real thresholds c. If the threshold
c becomes large and negative, the classifier is very aggressive in making crisis calls,
almost all signals are above the threshold, and ( TN, TP) converges to (0, 1) as c → −∞.
Conversely, when c becomes large and positive, the classifier is very conservative in
making crisis calls, almost all signals are below the threshold, and ( TN, TP) converges
to (1, 0) as c → +∞. In between these extremes, an informative classifier should deliver
a CCF curve above the simplex or the 45◦ -line of the null uninformative (or coin toss)
classifier, as shown in the figure below. The CCF is a variant of the better-known receiver
operating characteristic curve.
    The area under the CCF, known as the area under the curve (AUC), is 0.5 for the
null uninformative classifier and 1 for a perfect classifier. Concerning inference, testing
whether a classifier is informative, or better than an alternative classifier, is simple with
the AUC statistic because it is asymptotically normally distributed with a variance that
can be easily estimated. The test is also independent of the operator’s preferences. Such
tests are available in most statistical packages, including STATA, which we have employed
in our work.

an AUC well above 0.7 and significantly different from the respective null model’s
AUC.
    In summary, for policy makers and researchers, the lesson of macroeconomic
history is that we ignore credit at our peril. Credit booms often go wrong.
Although no indicator can predict perfectly, credit aggregates contain predictive
information about the likelihood of future financial crises. Sometimes credit
expands normally to support real economic gains, but recurrent episodes of
financial instability have more often than not been the result of abnormal credit
expansion. If the costs of financial crises are judged too harsh, and policy makers
seek indicators of when to use macroprudential tools to cool a dangerous boom,
a simple credit indicator is a plausible candidate signal that is both useful and
noncomplex, attributes that align well with the drift of recent policy proposals
(Turner 2010, Drehmann 2013, Haldane & Madouros 2013, Aikman et al. 2014).

3.3.                                 Costs of Financial Crises
The previous results sought to address one of the two main issues: What makes
financial crises likely? The strong empirical correlation over 100 years in 17
advanced countries between a run-up in bank lending and the probability of a
crisis event suggests that credit booms play a significant part in raising crisis
risk. Without the careful historical work to construct the credit data, this kind of
evidence has been hitherto unknowable.
    Now we turn to the other main issue: What makes the recessions associated
with financial crises so painful? Our research shows that the evolution of bank
lending plays an important role here too, in that larger credit booms also cause the
pace of economic recovery to significantly drag after recessions. These findings
again make important use of our new and unique data set, and they resonate with
very recent work highlighting how balance sheet effects shape recessions in both
theory and practice (Koo 2009; Mian & Sufi 2009, 2014; Eggertsson & Krugman
2012; Mian et al. 2013), while connecting to the older economic traditions noted
above (Fisher 1933, Kindleberger 1978, Minsky 1986). Still, further quantitative


                                                                                                                      19
historical work can build on these results, some discussed below, and much of it
lying in the future, so as to establish in more detail the channels through which
these effects are felt.
    But how can we establish the stylized facts? Look back for a moment to
Figure 2, which shows that financial crisis recessions are far more painful than
normal recessions, as measured by the depth of the downturn and the delay
to the recovery path. Yet this evidence was simply taken from unconditional
raw averages. To go further with formal empirical analysis, we can construct
conditional responses, in which we control for the state of the economy entering
the recession using a rich set of macroeconomic observables Xit to see whether the
differences remain when other potentially important covariates enter the model.
    Crucially, we want to include our bank lending measure CREDITit , in some
way, to allow for the role of credit booms and busts in shaping the recovery path.
To do this, Jordà et al. (2013a) construct a measure of excess credit, EXCESSrit ,
for each business-cycle expansion, defined as the change per year in bank loans
relative to GDP (in percentage points per year) from trough to peak, as a proxy
for the credit intensity of the boom phase, for recession type r equal to N or F,
and relative to its mean for each type r.
    We can then estimate a conditional path via LP, that is, a forward conditional
path of log real GDP per capita or any other variable of interest (here denoted
y), starting at the peak year of each expansion t, in country i, and running over
future years at each annual horizon h (Jordà 2005):

(LP)       yi,t+h − yi,t = aih + θ Nh Nit + θ Fh Fit
                         + β Nh Nt EXCESS Nit + β Fh Ft EXCESSFit + Γh ( L) Xit + uit ,

where the LP approach provides an analog to a vector autoregression estimate of
an impulse response, only with far more flexibility in form and far less parametric
intensity.
    In the above (LP) equation, the coefficients and estimate average conditional
paths in normal and financial crisis recessions, respectively. (For comparison,
the unconditional paths in Figure 2 would result from estimating the same LP
equation but with no other controls, i.e., with the restrictions β = Γ = 0.) The
coefficients β Nh and β Fh estimate the average response in each type of recession


                                            20
to increments in the credit intensity of the expansion measured by our EXCESSrit
variable. Lastly, although not of interest here, the lag polynomial term coefficients
Γh ( L) serve to capture the average response to changes in other macroeconomic
state variables Xit that are observed in peak year t.
     Based on data from Jordà et al. (2013a), Table 2 and Figure 7 report results
of ordinary least squares fixed-effect panel estimates of the above (LP) equation
with our new credit data set matched to a long-run macrohistorical data set of
additional controls for the full sample. The conditioning variables added (with up
to two lags) in Xit are: (a) the growth rate of real GDP per capita; (b) the growth
rate of real loans per capita; (c) the CPI inflation rate; (d) short-term interest rates
on government securities (usually three months or less in maturity); (e) long-term
interest rates on government securities (usually five years or more in maturity); (f)
the investment to GDP ratio; and (g) the current account to GDP ratio.12
     Results are shown for six response variables of interest: real GDP per capita,
real investment per capita, CPI price level, real private credit (bank loans) per
capita, and short- and long-term interest rates. Compared to Figures 2 and 3, the
sample size, now much reduced because of the requirement that data be available
for all the conditioning variables, is 132 recessions (101 normal, 31 financial) in the
full sample. Note that all of these paths are potentially different from those in the
earlier figures because of both the presence of the conditioning variables and the
resulting change in samples. For brevity, Table 2 reports only the estimates of the
above (LP) equation for real GDP per capita. Similar to all the LPs, it allows for
the coefficients on EXCESS to vary by recession type as above, although a test for
equality shows that an equality restriction on the coefficients cannot be rejected:
The drag from credit overhang is present in both financial crisis recessions and
normal recessions.
     There are two key takeaways here. First, our basic findings from the raw data,
even when subject to the additional rigors of LP estimation with a large control
set, are robust. In terms of output costs, financial crisis recessions are significantly
longer and deeper than normal recessions, and in terms of other correlates, the
differences are large, statistically significant, and of the expected direction. If
there is a crisis, the recession is characterized by larger collapses in investment, a
lower rate of price inflation, contractions rather than expansions of credit, lower
interest rates, and a shift to current account surplus. All these differences can be

seen, as before, by comparing the normal recession paths with the financial crisis
recession paths in Figure 7, where all variables in the above (LP) equation are set
to their sample average values (in particular, excess credit is set to zero).
    The second key finding, however, concerns the way in which the prior credit
boom affects the subsequent path of the economy. We evaluate this counterfactual
in our LP model by a set of experiments that compare the above baseline paths
with alternate paths that would be predicted to unfold when the level of excess
credit is given a perturbation. Specifically, suppose that excess credit (the change
per year in bank lending over GDP in the expansion phase) were set at a level
+1 standard deviation above its mean; we then ask how the paths of the macroe-
conomic variables would be predicted to change, and again Figure 7 displays
these counterfactuals for the case of normal recession and financial crisis recession

paths.
    These paths help explain a second danger of credit booms; they not only
make financial crises more likely, they are also associated with deeper and longer
recessions. In Figure 7, the path of real GDP per capita is much more adverse when
excess credit is perturbed +1 standard deviation. In the full sample, real GDP per
capita is perturbed approximately 1.5% lower after five years in a normal recession
and 3% lower in a financial crisis recession. In the latter case, the economy remains
far below its previous peak. When the excess credit variable is elevated, we also
see larger collapses in investment and sharper credit contractions. Thus, the bigger
the credit boom, the bigger are the reversals in all these variables. By comparison,


                                                                                                                                    23
the effects on inflation and public debt are small and less significant.
   In summary, we refer to this phenomenon as “credit bites back,” and with
the first result, it helps to unravel the mystery of why credit booms can lead to
more painful recessions. For one thing, a credit boom makes a financial crisis
more likely, and we clearly saw that financial crisis recessions are worse than
normal recessions, on average. But even holding that effect constant, credit booms
also lead to a debt overhang, which makes both types of recession more painful,
conditional on whichever type of recession happens to take place.

The analysis above focuses on run-ups in the simple aggregate economy-wide
credit-to-income gearing ratio, proxied by bank lending relative to GDP. This
is a key predictor of both financial crisis fragility and the subsequent drag on
economic growth after a recession begins. This has been true for more than a
century, a period covering the entire duration of modern macroeconomic history
under finance capitalism, in the advanced economies.
    But how robust is this result to alternative empirical approaches that allow
for other potential causes? Our research has focused on two potentially rival
explanations.13 The first comes from those worried about the risks from global
imbalances—according to this view, excessive external current account deficits
could amplify or spillover into the risk of financial crises and recessions. The
second comes from those worried about fiscal excess—according to that view,
rising public sector debt levels could spillover into the risk of financial crises and
recessions. However, neither of these hypotheses follows unambiguously from
theory, so the question turns out to be an empirical one in each case.


4.1.    Risk of Financial Crises: Other Predictors
To see whether these alternative predictors make a difference, Table 3 and Figure 8
show rival CCF results from logit models with a different auxiliary variable added.
In Figure 8a, the added variable is the five-year lagged moving average of the
change in the current account to GDP ratio, and in Figure 8a, the added variable
is the five-year lagged moving average of the change in the public debt to GDP

ratio. Each model can be run with credit, the auxiliary variable, both, or neither
(the null being a simple country fixed-effect specification, again). Relative to the
null or to the baseline model with the credit variable, these auxiliary variables
do little to augment the predictive power of the logit crisis prediction model, as
judged by the AUC statistics. Still, this result on crisis risk does not mean that
public debt has no effects of interest in our analysis, and we consider public debt
overhang and economic performance below.
    For the current account, the raw data can provide some clarity as to why this
is so. It turns out that credit booms and busts can be driven just as easily by
domestic savings as by foreign savings. Following Taylor (2014), suppose we
compute the correlations between external inflows (current account, percent of
GDP) and the change in aggregate credit (change in bank loans, percent of GDP).
If we divide the panel into 20-year periods from 1870, excluding the two world
wars, the answer is that over the long run the correlation of these two measures
has been essentially zero. Only in one period, 1870–1889, was there a significant
negative correlation between the current account and changes in bank lending.

This is not surprising: It was a peak period of settler economy capitalism with
large capital flows out of high-saving core economies. In one later period, the
postwar years 1949–1968, there was a positive correlation: High-saving economies
had current account surpluses but also rapidly expanding credit.
    Over the course of history, current accounts have been imperfectly correlated
with credit and hence perform poorly in a horse race to explain the probability of
crises. In the nineteenth century, this was obvious: Britain was a surplus country
for decades but had recurrent banking crises. Even in the 2008 global financial
crisis, this was evident: Although many deficit countries suffered financial crises,
banks also fell into distress in a number of surplus countries. Thus, although there
may be cases in which large debt-driven capital inflows feed into a potentially
dangerous domestic credit boom, the warning signs in the balance of payments
will likely echo the credit signals in the domestic banking system, through which
most of the funds will pass. In other cases, a domestic credit boom may have
(and has) occurred without such inflows, so it is the bank credit indicator that is
inevitably a more direct and reliable signal of domestic financial crisis risk.
    Turning to the other candidate auxiliary variable, public debt, a similar logit
model comparison adds the five-year lagged moving average change in public
debt to GDP ratios as a crisis predictor, and the results are shown in Table 2 and
Figure 8b. The public debt variable clearly has no benefit as a predictor even
as compared to the country fixed-effect null. Thus, the idea that financial crises
have their roots in fiscal problems is not supported over the long sweep of history.
Some such cases may of course exist, like Greece today, but these have been the
exception not the rule. In general, in countries such as Ireland and Spain today,
financial crises can be traced back to original developments in the financial sector
itself, namely excess credit, with fiscal problems emerging later as a symptom not
a warning signal. However, as shown below, although public debt may not play a
role in predicting a crisis event, it is not irrelevant in all respects. Public debt can
play a significant role in shaping the paths of recessions and recoveries associated
with financial crisis events.
    In summary, over 140 years, there has been no systematic correlation of
financial crisis risk with either prior current account deficits or prior growth in
public debt levels. Private credit has always been the only useful and reliable
predictive factor.

                                          27
4.2.   Costs of Financial Crises: Other Predictors
The second question is whether the proposed auxiliary variables, external imbal-
ances and rising public debt, even if they have no predictive power for financial
crisis risk, still might influence the depth and duration of recessions as much
as, or instead of, the effect we have identified as being driven by credit boom
overhangs.
    To investigate this question, we can estimate the LP models for the trajectory
of the economy’s real GDP per capita following a business-cycle peak, as above,
but now with the proposed auxiliary variables added as additional conditioning
information. Table 4 reports these LP results and a baseline model, in which the
added covariate is the five-year lagged moving average of the current account or
change in public debt. The baseline model in top part of the table is as before, but
the coefficients on excess credit are uniform across recession types (that restriction
could not be rejected in Table 2).
    The results show that our earlier baseline findings in Table 2 are robust. First,
the results in Table 4 with the addition of the current account variable are weak.
The coefficient is possibly of the expected positive sign, in that a larger prior capital
inflow bonanza (i.e., a negative current account) would predict the likelihood of
a worse recession, but the statistical significance does not rise to even the 90%
confidence level at any horizon. Most importantly, the magnitude and statistical
significance of the effect of the prior credit boom are unaltered by the inclusion of
this variable.
    Similarly, the results in Table 4 for the addition of the public debt variable are
not significant. Rising public debt in and of itself does not exacerbate the pain
suffered in a recession, in this simplest formulation. It is systematically only high
private credit that poses the greater threat to economic recovery, in the form of an
overhang of leverage in the private household and business sectors.
    Even so, in the most recent work from our ongoing project, some further
refinements to these results have taken on importance. We have found that public
debt, under some circumstances, can pose a threat to the economic recovery, and
not all forms of private credit are equally dangerous. These results follow from
empirical investigations using more general logit and LP specifications to evaluate
the complex nexus of financial risks.

4.3.   The Role of Public Debt
The first finding worth noting here presents a caveat to the result that public debt
is not an important factor in financial crises. Jordà et al. (2013b) find the above
result that the level of public credit does not affect the recession and recovery path
when it enters the LP specification linearly but do find a strong and significant
effect when it enters nonlinearly and is interacted with the growth of private
credit, especially in the case of financial crisis recessions. According to this result,
when rapid run-ups occur in private credit, a high level of public debt may create
the risk of slow recovery.
    The result provides support for the argument that governments might need to
retain fiscal space if they want to be better able to take lender-of-last-resort and/or
countercyclical policy measures (i.e., financial sector support, fiscal stimulus, mea-
sures to offset private deleveraging) in the event that a highly leveraged financial
crisis recession should occur. This would be a good example of what Obstfeld
(2013) refers to as policy makers “keeping the powder dry.” The eurozone crisis
experiences in Ireland and Spain are only the latest example of countries lacking
policy space (given the rules of the euro) and being left with few macroeconomic
tools as a deep depression takes shape; yet, as our research shows, this is a pattern
that holds more generally across the broad sweep of history.


4.4.   The Role of Mortgages
The other result to mention concerns whether different types of private credit
pose greater or lesser danger of financial crisis risk or the risk of a more painful
recession event. To study this question, we have returned to collect more data
and examine disaggregated measures of bank credit in our sample. In new
work, Jordà et al. (2014, 2015a) make a second pass and revisit all of their
primary and secondary sources, and many new documents, to construct detailed
disaggregated credit data for each country’s banking system back to 1870, with the
most crucial decomposition turning out to be the difference between mortgage and
nonmortgage credit, that is, loans secured by real estate versus typical business
loans for industrial and commercial purposes.
   Revisiting the analysis described above, we find convincing evidence that the


                                          30
financial systems in advanced countries, and the risks they generate, have shifted
considerably in the past 100 years, a change we refer to as “the great mortgaging.”
The share of mortgages on bank balance sheets was one-third a century ago but is
two-thirds in recent years, reflecting a reorientation of the banks’ business models
away from the classic textbook loanable funds view of banks intermediating
between household savers and business investors and toward a different model in
which banks largely provide housing finance for buyers of mostly existing real
estate.
    Alongside this shift, mortgage credit growth has become a more dominant
driver of financial crisis risk, and mortgage credit overhang now weighs more on
economic performance in recessions. In contrast, in recent times, nonmortgage
lending creates lower risks and less drag. To be sure, mortgage lending does not
appear to be a macroprudential risk at all times and in all places. These patterns
hold in the post–World War II era, but they were absent before that time; this
could lead to speculation that changes in policies, institutions, or other trends
after 1945 have taken the advanced economies in a new direction, with greater
housing leverage posing a new threat to macroeconomic stability. Such topics
undoubtedly cry out for future research.


4.5.   Other Predictors and Directions for Future Research
Subject to data availability constraints, there are of course many other potential
indicators that could be explored in our historical data context as having possible
additional influences on either the risk of crisis or the costs of financial crisis
recessions. For example, Schularick & Taylor (2012) find that although credit
growth is a good predictor of crises, broad money is a less robust predictor
(especially in the post–World War II era), and narrow money is entirely useless
as a predictor of financial crises. This argues for policy makers to focus less on
central bank balance sheets, or even broad money, and more on board credit
aggregates when evaluating crisis risk. An important set of potential indicators
includes asset prices, in particular equity and housing price movements. In some
very influential work, Borio & Lowe (2002b), followed up by Borio & Drehmann
(2009), find that rapid credit growth combined with increases in asset prices raise
the probability of an episode of financial instability in a contemporary data set


                                        31
of 34 advanced and emerging economies from 1960 to 1999. In our next stage of
work, in progress, we have compiled long-run data on equity and housing prices
since 1870 for 14 advanced economies, and we find some evidence that asset price
signals, combined with credit growth, might have played an influential role in
the very much longer run in predicting crises and worsening recessions (Jordà
et al. 2015b). In particular, we find as a regular feature of history that leveraged
bubbles are particularly dangerous, especially so when they are in the form of
synchronous house price and mortgage credit booms. In this sense, the crisis of
2008 was less of a black swan event, and more of an acute recurrence of a chronic
condition.


                             5.   CONCLUSION

The 2008 global financial crisis and Great Recession have placed the issues of
credit and financial stability back at the center of academic research, which is
where they were when the field of macroeconomics began. They have pushed the
same issues back onto the list of key policy-making responsibilities that modern
central banks must accept as part of their remit, which is also where they were
when modern central banks began.
    The challenge now is no less than that after the last great test of academic
research and policy making in the Great Depression, and a pessimist might
conclude that we have made very little progress in the meantime. At least in this
article, I hope to have shown that empirical macroeconomic science, backed by
far-superior historical data and more advanced statistical methods, is now much
better placed to evaluate the evidence, theories, policy problems, and trade-offs
than our predecessors 80 years ago.
    Credit and financial stability are intimately linked, with potentially grave
consequences for macroeconomic performance. Ignoring these connections risks
exposing the world to many more crises like the one just experienced. The same
would have been said in the 1930s. An economist time traveler from that earlier
era would alight today in an all too familiar landscape and might wonder what
had happened in the meantime and if we had actually learned anything along
the way. Witness the sentiments of the Macmillan Committee (1931, p. 131) in
their closing words on the international problems of credit and monetary policies

                                        32
facing central banks, which deserve to be quoted at length:

     Yet a Central Bank, if it attempts to curb an upward movement, may
     and will be criticised for cutting short the country’s nascent prosper-
     ity. Even when the recent American boom had grown to very great
     proportions, there was strenuous and widespread opposition in every
     quarter, even the most authoritative, to any attempt seriously to control
     it. To the difficulties of the control by a Central Bank of its own market
     must be added the additional difficulty of securing concerted action
     by several. Even if it were conceded that such concerted action would
     generally be effective if it were taken soon enough, it may be argued
     that it is not in fact practicable to detect and interpret the obscure
     premonitory signs of the financial weather soon enough or accurately
     enough, or with a high enough degree of probability, to procure con-
     certed action amongst a number of independent authorities, each of
     which is likely to have its own ideas based on its local information and
     to maintain them with tenacity. Here again only time can show. There
     is no need to minimise the difficulty of the high enterprise which we
     should like to see the Central Banks of the world put in hand.
       It is possible, indeed, to prescribe the objective of Central Bank
     policy. It is possible to suggest ways of increasing the means at the
     disposal of the Central Banks. But the use made of their discretionary
     power to vary the value of currency and credit, and the terms on
     which the latter is granted, must depend on experience and the daily
     exercise of prescience and a wide discretion. Any great measure of
     success, indeed, will only be reached as a result of a long process of
     experiment and evolution. At present, any deliberate effort at stability,
     however crude in its methods and partial in its success, would be a
     great improvement. It is sufficient for the time, therefore, to indicate
     the direction and objective of progress.

            APPENDIX A: SYSTEMIC FINANCIAL CRISES
The crisis prediction classification models in the article employ data on all systemic
financial crises from 1870 to 2011. Dates of systemic financial crises provided in Appendix
Table 1 are based on Jordà et al. (2011) and Schularick & Taylor (2012), sources therein,
and updates.

APPENDIX B: NORMAL AND FINANCIAL CRISIS RECESSIONS
The LP analysis in the article employs business-cycle peaks from 1870 to 2006, excludes
windows around the two world wars, reports projections out to five years ahead, and
uses the annual panel sample data for which the last year’s projections from 2006 end in
2011. As a result, peaks from the 2007–2011 period are not used in the sample, meaning
that the empirical work does not include the global financial crisis as an in-sample event.
The peak dates used are shown in Appendix Table 2. The peak-trough dating method
follows Jordà et al. (2011) and uses the Bry & Boschan (1971) algorithm.

1. Wolf (2014) provides a survey of the issues in the book’s preface, introduction, and
conclusion (for a video interview, see http://video.ft.com/3765028307001/Martin-Wolf-
lessons-from-the-crisis/World).
    2. I am indebted to my colleagues and coauthors on this project, Moritz Schularick
and Òscar Jordà. I draw extensively on our joint works, which are listed in the Literature
Cited (Schularick & Taylor 2012, Jordà et al. 2011, 2013a,b, 2014, 2015a,b).
    3. Of course, different financial crises may last for varying amounts of time, but the
end of such an event is a concept that is not easily measured, defined, or agreed upon,
and hence it is rarely used in the crisis literature.
    4. Our sample construction can be compared with other major studies using panel
data. Kaminsky & Reinhart (1999) study 20 countries from 1970 to 1995, looking at crisis
years for a total of 26 banking crises and 76 currency crises in the sample. Bordo et al.
(2001) examine annual panels of 21 countries since 1880 and 56 countries since 1973. Cerra
& Saxena (2008) study 190 countries from 1960 to 2001. Reinhart & Rogoff (2009, chapter
14) look at GDP for a sample of 14 major crises in the 1977–2001 period (their figure 14.4)
with somewhat larger samples for other variables and some samples that include Great
Depression episodes. All these other studies pooled advanced and emerging/developing
countries in their data sets. Since Bordo et al. (2001), ours is the first study to go back
to the nineteenth century with a comprehensive data set, starting in 1870 and running
through the 2008 crisis, and restricting attention to only the experience of the advanced
economies.
    5. The exclusion of war periods and neighboring windows, and missing data for
some countries in some years before 1900, results in an average of approximately 100
observations per country, or approximately 1,700 country-year observations total. In these,
the frequency of financial crisis recessions (n = 67) is approximately 1 in every 25 years
or 4%, and the frequency of normal recessions (n = 156) is approximately 1 in every 11
years or 9%. Of course, some financial crises occur in the sample at a greater distance
than two years from a peak. They are considered isolated in that they do not coincide
with a recession in this coding. This is not especially common. To see this, note that
the raw frequency of financial crisis events (as in Figure 1) is 6%, and that of financial
crisis recessions is 4%, as just noted. Thus, at least two-thirds of crisis events are linked
to a recession in our coding. We can say “at least” because, in the nineteenth century
especially, expansions are short, and thus many recession peaks are within five years of
each other, yet we classify only the most proximate as financial crisis recessions. In the
case of so-called isolated financial crises, those not coincident with recessions, it is also
less clear what the control group is for comparisons of growth costs, so this motivates the
focus here only on F’s versus N’s.
    6. The 1959 Radcliffe Report marked a fleeting triumph of this paradigm shift, and
the reader is referred to critical reviews by Gurley (1960) and Kaldor (1960). Capie (2010)
provides the official history of the Bank of England’s tools and practices during this
period. After the 1970s, various policy regimes came and went at the Bank of England:
monetarism, fixed exchange rates, inflation targeting. All of them ignored credit.

     7. Subsequently, after the 2008 global financial crisis, the BIS updated and strengthened
its findings (e.g., Borio & Drehmann 2009).
     8. Shadow banks were important in the past two decades, mostly in the United States
and United Kingdom. The United States has always had a significant private bond market,
but for other countries, especially in continental Europe, bank-based lending has been
dominant since the nineteenth century.
     9. In our work, we also looked at other measures of credit and money, including total
bank assets and measures of broad and narrow money. The first, bank assets, behaves
similarly to credit but is typically larger (twice as big) as it includes all bank balance sheet
items (e.g., loans to governments and foreign currency lending) plus interbank credit.
Narrow money behaves very differently from credit and has zero predictive power for
financial crises. Broad money behaves similarly to credit up to World War II, but thereafter
credit diverges and grows more rapidly, reflecting the growth of leverage and later the
rise of nonmonetary funding liabilities (e.g., wholesale funding). Space does not permit a
detailed discussion of all these measures here, and credit has emerged as the most useful
indicator in our work, and that of others, for the problems studied here.
     10. There was arguably a similar hiatus in World War I in the 1914–1919 period, but
this was soon reversed in the fleeting boom in the 1920s before the massive retrenchment
began.
     11. In other work, we have also explored the predictive ability of credit indicators to
distinguish between normal and financial crisis recession events, as used in our recession-
recovery analysis above, and we find similar results, with the credit variable having strong
predictive power. Owing to space limitations, these largely duplicative results, which are
anyway less precise given the smaller sample of recession events within the full sample,
are not reported here.
     12. The saturated specification reported here is a conservative approach. Notice that
including the growth rate of real loans per capita and its lags as controls stacks the odds
against finding that the credit buildup during the boom (EXCESS) matters in explaining
the path of the recession and subsequent recovery. We can also run the results with fewer,
or no, conditioning variables and obtain qualitatively similar results. Of course, the real
credit growth variable is measured differently (rate of change, contemporaneous at the
peak) from the EXCESS variable (change in credit as a fraction of GDP averaged over all
years in the previous business-cycle expansion phase), so these two variables are far from
perfectly correlated.
     13. This section draws on some ideas in the survey by Taylor (2014).
