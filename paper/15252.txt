                                             ABSTRACT

Commonly used frictional models of the labor market imply that changes in frictions have large effects
on steady state employment and unemployment. We use a model that features both frictions and an
operative labor supply margin to examine the robustness of this feature to the inclusion of a empirically
reasonable labor supply channel. The response of unemployment to changes in frictions is similar
in both models. But the labor supply response present in our model greatly attenuates the effects of
frictions on steady state employment relative to the simplest matching model, and two common extensions.
We also find that the presence of empirically plausible frictions has virtually no impact on the response
of aggregate employment to taxes.

1    Introduction

Two frameworks dominate analyses of aggregate employment—frictionless models that follow

in the tradition of Kydland and Prescott (1982), and frictional models in the tradition of

Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). While frictionless models necessarily imply that changes

in employment entirely reflect changes in desired labor supply (i.e., choice), the simplest

specifications of frictional models imply that changes in employment entirely reflect changes

in the probability of receiving an oﬀer (i.e., chance). It seems clear that both choice and

chance influence individual employment outcomes in reality; that is, at any point in time

some individuals are not employed by choice, while others are not employed by chance.

There is good reason to believe that these two features could have interesting interactions, in

that the presence of frictions may attenuate the labor supply responses in frictionless models,

while the presence of an operative labor supply margin might similarly attenuate the eﬀects

of frictions. In this paper we assess the relative importance of these two forces in shaping

aggregate steady state employment.

    We carry out this analysis in the model of Krusell et al (2009). That paper built an

empirically reasonable model that features both frictions and an operative labor supply mar-

gin. The claim to being empirically reasonable was based on the model’s ability to capture

the key features of the flows of workers across all three labor market states: employment,

unemployment and out of the labor force.

    We use this model to ask two simple questions about the forces that influence steady


                                              2
state employment and unemployment. The first question is how changes in frictions aﬀect

aggregate steady state outcomes. In the simplest matching model, the level of frictions

(captured by both the oﬀer arrival rate and the separation rate) critically aﬀects the level

of both aggregate employment and unemployment. We assess the extent to which this is

altered when one embeds the frictional model in a context where individuals also solve a

nondegenerate labor supply problem. Intuitively, if employment opportunities are harder

to come by (or jobs do not last very long), individuals can adjust lifetime labor supply by

extending the length of employment spells when employed, or by accepting more employment

opportunities when not employed. In our calibrated model we find that the increase in

unemployment is very similar to that implied by a simple matching model. In contrast, we

find that labor supply responses greatly attenuate the direct eﬀect of frictions on employment.

Specifically, we find that a decrease in the arrival rate of employment opportunities leads to

a large increase in the unemployment rate but only a small decrease in the employment rate.

We conclude that while the role of frictions for steady state aggregate unemployment seems

robust to adding a nondegenerate labor supply decision, the impact of frictions on steady

state employment is probably significantly overstated in simple matching models. We show

that this same result holds even in versions of the matching model in which match formation

and match termination decisions are introduced.

   Second, we use our model to assess the eﬀects of increases in labor taxes used to fund

lump-sum transfers. This question, recently examined in a frictionless model by Prescott



                                              3
(2004), seems a simple and sharp example of how an operative labor supply margin influences

steady state employment. We ask how these eﬀects are altered by the presence of reasonable

frictions. We find that the employment eﬀects are eﬀectively unchanged by the presence of

frictions. This result holds not only for tax increases but also tax decreases, which is perhaps

more interesting since it is more likely that frictions will interfere with the desire to increase

the fraction of time spent in employment.1 We conclude that frictions do not seem to be

of first order importance in the determination of steady state employment. Interestingly, in

our model with frictions, higher taxes lead to both higher unemployment and higher non-

participation, even holding the level of frictions constant. So, although the aggregate eﬀects

on employment in our model are eﬀectively those found in the frictionless version of the

model, the analysis shows that this does not imply that there are not also eﬀects on both

the level and nature of unemployment.

       There is one important qualification regarding the above results. A key feature of the

calibrated model of Krusell et al (2009) is that the distribution of idiosyncratic shocks is

continuous. It turns out that this assumption is potentially very important for our results

regarding frictions and employment. In particular, we show that one can calibrate a model

in which there are only two values for the idiosyncratic shocks, and do a reasonable job of

matching the flow data, but with very diﬀerent results than those mentioned above. Specifi-

cally, in such a model it is possible that increases in frictions have equally large (but opposite)
   1
    A similar result was found in Krusell et al (2008), but the calibrated model in that paper was not consistent
with worker flows.




                                                       4
eﬀects on employment and unemployment, and that taxes have no eﬀect on employment. Key

to these results is that the calibration is carried out so as to provide no scope for individuals

to marginally adjust the amount of time that they spend in employment. Moreover, in such

a model there is no scope for aggregate factors to influence participation rates. While this

type of specification does deliver very diﬀerent answers to the questions that we answer, we

conclude that it does not seem to fit well with other observations.

   Our paper is related to many papers in the literature. Merz (1995) and Andolfatto (1996)

were the first to introduce frictions into an otherwise standard version of the growth model. A

key feature of these models is that employment is completely determined by frictions, just as

in simple frictional models. The model in Alvarez and Veracierto (1999) is closer to ours, since

it features both a standard labor-leisure choice and frictions, but it cannot be calibrated to

match worker flows since worker flows are indeterminate in their equilibrium. Moreover, they

do not ask the question of how changes in frictions aﬀect steady state outcomes. Ljungqvist

and Sargent (2006, 2008) consider models that feature indivisible labor and frictions, but

do not consider the impact of frictions on aggregate employment. Low et al (2008) consider

a model with frictions and a nondegenerate labor supply decision. They consider a richer

model of frictions and income support programs, but their analysis is partial equilibrium and

they address very diﬀerent issues than we do.

   An outline of the paper follows. Section 2 describes the model. Section 3 describes the

calibration of the model and presents the implications of the calibrated model for labor mar-

ket flows. Section 4 analyzes the eﬀects of changes in frictions on steady state outcomes

in a simple matching model, while Section 5 considers the same issue in some extensions

of this model. Section 6 presents the results for analyzing tax and transfer programs. Sec-

tion 7 discusses robustness issues regarding the nature of idiosyncratic shocks and Section 8

concludes.


2       Model

The economy is identical to that in Krusell et al (2009).2 The economy is populated by a

continuum of workers with total mass equal to one. All workers have identical preferences

over streams of consumption and time devoted to work given by:

                                            ∞
                                            X
                                                  β t [log(ct ) − αet ]
                                            t=0


where ct ≥ 0 is consumption in period t, et ∈ {0, 1} is time devoted to work in period t,

0 < β < 1 is the discount factor and α > 0 is the disutility of work. Individuals are subject

to idiosyncratic shocks that aﬀect the static payoﬀs of work relative to not working. While

many shocks may have this property, e.g., shocks to market opportunities, shocks to home

production opportunities, health shocks, family shocks, preference shocks etc..., we represent

the net eﬀect of all of these shocks as a single shock, and model it as a shock to the return

to market work. In particular, letting st denote the quantity of labor services that they
    2
   Several papers have recently analyzed labor supply in models with idiosyncratic shocks and incomplete
markets, including Floden and Linde (2001), Domeij and Floden (2006), Pijoan-Mas (2006), and Chang and
Kim (2006, 2007). Relative to these papers the distinguishing feature of our model is the presence of frictions.




                                                         6
contribute if working, we assume an AR(1) stochastic process in logs:


                                    log st+1 = ρ log st + εt+1


where the innovation εt is a mean zero normally distributed random variable with standard

deviation σ ε . This process is the same for all workers, but realizations are iid across workers.

   We formulate equilibrium recursively and focus solely on the steady state equilibrium.

In each period there are markets for output, capital services and labor services, but there

are no insurance markets, so individuals will (potentially) accumulate assets to self-insure.

We normalize the price of output to equal one in all periods, and let r and w denote steady

state rental rates for a unit of capital and a unit of labor services, respectively. If a worker

with productivity s chooses to work then he or she would contribute s units of labor services

and therefore earn ws in labor income. We assume that individual capital holdings must

be nonnegative, or equivalently, that individuals are not allowed to borrow. There is a

government that taxes labor income at constant rate τ and uses the proceeds to finance

a lump-sum transfer payment T subject to a period-by-period balanced budget constraint.

In steady state, the period budget equation for an individual with kt units of capital and

productivity st is given by:


                        ct + kt+1 = rkt + (1 − τ )wst et + (1 − δ)kt + T.


   The production technology is described by a Cobb-Douglas aggregate production function:


                                         Yt = Ktθ L1−θ
                                                   t   .

                                                7
Kt is aggregate input of capital services and Lt is aggregate input of labor services:

                                               Z
                                      Kt =         kit di
                                               Z
                                      Lt =         eit sit di.


Output can be used either as consumption or investment, and capital depreciates at rate δ.

   Frictions in the labor market are captured by two parameters: λw and σ, where λw is the

employment opportunity arrival rate and σ is the employment separation rate. Specifically,

we assume there are two islands which we label as the production island and the leisure

island. At the end of period t − 1 an individual is either on the production island or the

leisure island, depending upon whether they worked during the period. At the beginning of

period t each individual will observe the realizations of several shocks. First, each worker

receives a new realization for the value of their idiosyncratic productivity shock. Second,

each individual on the production island observes the realization of an iid separation shock:

with probability σ the individual is relocated to the leisure island. Third, each individual

on the leisure island, including those that have been relocated on account of the separation

shock, observes the realization of an iid employment opportunity shock: with probability λw

an individual is relocated to the production island. In terms of connecting our model with

the literature it is intuitive to think of σ as the exogenous job separation rate, and λw as the

exogenous job arrival rate. Once the shocks have been realized, individuals make their labor

supply and consumption decisions, though only workers with an employment opportunity

can choose e equal to 1. An individual on the production island who chooses not to work

                                               8
will then be relocated to the leisure island at the end of period t and will therefore not have

the opportunity to return to the production island until receiving a favorable employment

opportunity shock.

      While it is not necessary to follow the results in subsequent sections, for completeness we

formally present the decision problems solved by individuals in the steady state equilibrium.

An individual’s state consists of his or her location at the time that the labor supply decision

needs to be made, the level of asset holdings, and productivity. Let W (k, s) be the maximum

value for an individual who works and N (k, s) be the maximum value for an individual who

does not work given that he or she has productivity s and capital holdings k. Define V (k, s)

by:

                                   V (k, s) = max{W (k, s), N (k, s)}.


The Bellman equations for W and N are given by:


        W (k, s) = max
                     0
                       {log(c) − α + βEs0 [(1 − σ + σλw )V (k0 , s0 ) + σ(1 − λw )N (k0 , s0 )]}
                    c,k




                            s.t. c + k 0 = rk + (1 − τ )ws + (1 − δ)k + T




                                             c ≥ 0, k 0 ≥ 0


and

                 N (k, s) = max
                              0
                                {log(c) + βEs0 [λw V (k0 , s0 ) + (1 − λw )N (k0 , s0 )]}
                             c,k


                                                    9
                                s.t. c + k0 = rk + (1 − δ)k + T




                                         c ≥ 0, k 0 ≥ 0


Let μ(k, s, l) denote the measure of individuals over individual states after all of the idiosyn-

cratic shocks have been realized and before any decisions have been taken, where l indexes

location and can take on the two values 0 and 1, with l = 1 indicating the production island.

There are three decision rules: one for c, one for k 0 , and one for e (which can only take on

the values of 0 or 1).


3    Calibration

We calibrate the model as in Krusell et al (2009), and so refer the reader to that paper for more

a more detailed analysis and discussion of the calibration. A key aspect of the calibration

procedure is to choose parameters so that the distribution of workers across states and the

flows of workers between states are similar to those in the US economy. In what follows we

will use E to denote the employment state, U to denote the unemployment state, and N to

denote the not in the labor force state. A necessary step is to take a stand on how to allocate

the nonemployed workers in the model between the unemployed and out of the labor force

states. As in Krusell et al (2009) we call a worker in the model unemployed if they did not

work in period t but would have preferred to work if they had the opportunity. In order to



                                               10
have a consistent definition in the model and the data, we use this same criterion to define

unemployed workers in the data. Since our definition is somewhat broader than that used by

the BLS, our unemployment rate is somewhat larger (8.3% versus 5.1%) and we also need to

compute flows for our notion of unemployment. As a practical matter it turns out that this

adjustment has very little eﬀect on the flows.

   Having described how we will measure flows across states in the data and the model,

we now consider how to calibrate the model’s parameters. The model has nine parameters

that need to be assigned: preference parameters β and α, production parameters θ and δ,

idiosyncratic shock parameters ρ and σ e , frictional parameters σ and λw , and the tax rate τ .

The length of a period is set to one month. Because our model is a variation of the standard

growth model, we can choose some of these parameter values using the same procedure that is

typically used to calibrate versions of the growth model. The features of incomplete markets

and uncertainty implies that we cannot derive analytic expressions for the steady state, and

so cannot isolate the connection between certain parameters and target values. Nonetheless,

it is still useful and intuitive to associate particular targets and parameter values. Specifically,

given values for λw , σ, ρ, and σ ε , we choose θ = .3 to target a capital share of .3, δ to achieve

an investment to output ratio equal to .2, the discount factor β to target an annual real

rate of return on capital equal to 4%. The other preference parameter α, which captures the

disutility of working, is set so that the steady state value of employment is equal to .632.

This is the value of the employment to population ratio for the population aged 16 and older



                                                11
for the period 1994 − 2007.3

       The tax rate is set at τ = .30. Following the work of Mendoza et al (1994) there are

several papers which produce estimates of the average eﬀective tax rate on labor income

across countries. Examples include Prescott (2004) and McDaniel (2006). There are minor

variations in methods across these studies, which do produce some small diﬀerences in the

estimates, and the value .30 is chosen as representative of these estimates.4

       It remains to choose values for the λw , σ, ρ and σ ε . We choose λw so that the steady

state unemployment rate in our model (i.e., U/(E + U )) is equal to .083, which is the average

value for our notion of the unemployment rate in the US data for the period 1994 − 2007.

We choose σ to target the flow rate from employment to unemployment.

       Krusell et al (2009) showed that the ability of the model to account for the flows between

states remains relatively constant for a wide range of values of ρ and σ ε . What mattered most

was that ρ was reasonably persistent (at least .5), but not too close to being a unit root (say

less than .97), and that σ ε was not too small. In their benchmark calibration they assumed

ρ = .92 and σ ε = .21 expressed on an annual basis. These values correspond to one set of

estimates of idiosyncratic wage shocks for prime-aged working males, as reported in Floden

and Linde (2001). A key issue for our quantitative exercises is the extent to which diﬀerent

specifications of the shock process influence our results, despite having relatively little impact
   3
     We calibrate to values for the period 1994-2007 because this is the period for which we have consistent
measures of labor market flows.
   4
     Note that Prescott (2004) makes an adjustment to the average labor tax rate to arrive at a marginal tax
rate that is roughly 40%. For purposes of computing the eﬀect of changes in taxes this adjustment plays no
role.



                                                    12
on worker flows. It turns out that the results are relatively unaﬀected by considering diﬀerent

calibrated values for ρ and σ ε , given that in each case we recalibrate the remaining parameters

to continue to hit the same targets. As a result, we will only present results for this one set

of values for ρ and σ ε .

      Table 1 shows our calibrated parameter values.

      A major discrepancy has to do with the flow of workers from U to N . As discussed in

Krusell et al (2009), this discrepancy is much less if we consider male workers aged 21-65

instead of the whole population. Additionally, assuming some survey response error that

causes spurious transitions between N and U also removes much of the discrepancy.5 While

there is room for additional improvements relative to this simple model, we feel that the

match is suﬃciently close to justify using this model to revisit some basic questions about

the forces that shape steady state employment and unemployment.
  5
    Survey response error also lowers the measured flow rate from U to E since some of the people counted
in U are actually in N and therefore transition to E with much lower probability,


                                                        13
        Even accounting for survey response error as noted above, the flow rate from U to E is

somewhat high relative to the data. If one is concerned about the calibrated level of frictions

being reasonable, this might be viewed as an important target. Krusell et al (2009) also

presents an alternative calibration in which the flow rate from U to E is targeted instead

of the stock of U . While we do not report any results for this alternative calibration, we

note here that all of the results presented below are eﬀectively identical for this alternative

calibration.


4        Frictions and the Steady State I: A Benchmark Comparison

One of the defining features of the Pissarides matching model and its many variants is that the

level of frictions play a key role in determining not only the level of aggregate unemployment

but also in determining the level of aggregate employment.6 Intuitively, labor supply con-

siderations will attenuate the impact of changes in frictions on aggregate employment. The

reason for this is that if it becomes harder to find employment opportunities, then workers

will be more willing to continue with a job opportunity once they find it, or decide to accept

employment at lower productivities. The goal of this section is to explore the quantitative

importance of these eﬀects in our model relative to standard frictional models.

        We begin by exploring the impact of exogenous changes in the level of λw , that is, we

evaluate the impact on the steady state of an exogenous change in the level of frictions. We

are primarily interested in the extent to which the responses in our model are diﬀerent than
    6
        See Pissarides (2000) for a variety of models that have this property.



                                                         14
those that would emerge in a benchmark version of the Pissarides matching model. In the

simplest Pissarides model, the match separation rate is exogenous, but the job oﬀer arrival

rate is endogenously determined by the volume of vacancy posting. In this model all job

oﬀers are accepted, so the job oﬀer arrival rate is also the probability that an unemployed

worker becomes employed. If the match separation rate is σ and the job oﬀer arrival rate is

λw , and we assume that individuals can begin to work in the same period as receiving a job

oﬀer, then the law of motion for the unemployment rate is:


                          ut+1 = (1 − λw )ut + σ(1 − λw )(1 − ut ).


It follows that the steady state employment rate is given by:


                                            σ(1 − λw )
                                   ū =                   .
                                          λw + σ(1 − λw )


   We set σ = .039 as in our benchmark calibration, and then set λw so that the steady

state unemployment rate is equal to .083, which was the same target that we matched in

our calibration. The implied value of λw is .301. We will then consider equal proportional

changes in the value of λw in the two models, i.e., we increase or decrease λw by the same

percentage in the two models. Although the value of λw is endogenously determined in the

Pissarides model, we do not model the source of this change. Rather, we focus simply on the

consequences of such a change for employment and unemployment.

   Table 3 shows the eﬀects for the aggregate employment to population ratio (E/P ) and

the unemployment rate in the two models, for our benchmark calibration. We emphasize


                                              15
that the predictions of our model are very similar for diﬀerent values of ρ and σ ε , and for

the alternative calibration procedure in which λw is targeted to match the E to U flow. In

the interest of space we only report results for the benchmark calibration.
                                         Table 3

              λw = 0.6     63.5%     4.6%       λw   = 0.414   94.8%     5.2%
              λw = .436    63.2%     8.3%       λw   = 0.301   91.7%     8.3%
              λw = 0.4     63.0%     9.3%       λw   = 0.276   90.7%     9.3%
              λw = 0.2     61.0%     18.8%      λw   = 0.138   80.4%     19.6%

   In reading this table each row represents the same percentage change in λw relative to

the two benchmark calibrations, which by construction each have the same unemployment

rate. A striking result emerges. If one looks at the responses of unemployment, one observes

that the eﬀects are very similar across the two diﬀerent models. Moreover, the eﬀects are

large—when λw is decreased from the benchmark setting to the lowest value in the table, the

unemployment rate roughly triples in both cases. But when one looks at the employment

rate responses one sees dramatic diﬀerences. In the Pissarides model, changes in the un-

employment rate and changes in the employment rate are necessarily mirror images of each

other since by construction all workers are in the labor force. Hence, the Pissarides model

also predicts large employment responses as a result of changes in λw . In sharp contrast,

our model predicts very small changes in employment rates. The change in the employment

rate in our model is only about one-sixth as large as the change in the Pissarides model. For

example, when moving from the benchmark specification to the lowest value of λw in the

table, the employment rate decreases by more than 10 percentage points in the Pissarides

                                               16
model but only by about 2 percentage points in our model.

   To see why the two models give such diﬀerent employment responses it is instructive to

examine the durations of employment and unemployment spells.
                                            Table 4

                         λw = 0.6    19.9   1.6    λw   = 0.414   43.8     2.4
                         λw = .436   18.7   2.1    λw   = 0.301   36.7     3.3
                         λw = 0.4    18.7   2.3    λw   = 0.276   35.4     3.6
                         λw = 0.2    20.0   4.3    λw   = 0.138   29.7     7.2

   In both models a decrease in λw leads to an increase in the duration of unemployment, and

the proportional changes are very similar in the two models. But the changes in employment

durations are actually opposite in the two models. In the Pissarides model a decrease in

λw leads to a decrease in the duration of employment spells. The reason for this is that

decreases in λw make it less likely that a separated worker finds a new job during the initial

period of the separation, thereby preserving the employment spell. If we had instead assumed

that workers necessarily spend one period out of employment following a separation, then we

would have found that the duration of employment spells is constant. In contrast to either

of these outcomes, in our model the duration of employment spells increases significantly in

response to decreases in λw . In moving from the benchmark value of λw to the lowest value

in the table, the duration of employment in our model increases by more than one third.

   It is instructive to examine how the distribution of employment across productivity states

is influenced by changes in λw . Figure 1 plots the mass of employment at each productivity

level in the support of the distribution for various values of λw , as well as the mass of workers

with each productivity level.

       As frictions increase, some mass from the employment distribution is shifted from the right

tail to the left tail. Intuitively, if there are no frictions, then all workers with suﬃciently high

productivity will work, but in the presence of frictions, some of these workers are not able

to work because they do not have an employment opportunity. But what is interesting to

note is that even for a very large change in frictions, the increase in mass at the bottom of

the productivity distribution is quite small, and it remains true that the lowest productivity

workers do not work at all.7

       We can also repeat the above analysis to examine how the two diﬀerent models respond

to exogenous changes in σ, the separation shock. Proceeding as above, Table 5 presents the

    It is important to keep in mind that our model includes a government transfer program, so that individuals
do receive some income even when not working.

      Changes in unemployment rates in response to changes in σ are about one half as large in

our model as in the Pissarides model. And the employment response is only about one-tenth

as large in our model as in the Pissarides model. Table 6 shows that the reason for the large

diﬀerences in employment rate responses has to do with a labor supply eﬀect.

      In the Pissarides model, changes in σ lead mechanically to changes in employment dura-

tion. The implication is that the large changes in σ are associated with large and proportional

changes in employment duration. In contrast, in our model, decreases in σ lead to what in

comparison are only very moderate increases in employment duration. The reason is due

to the response in labor supply. When σ is high, it is less likely that an individual has an

employment opportunity in any given period, and as a result they respond by being willing
  8
    Because the values of σ are the same in the two benchmark economies we now consider equal changes in
the two economies.


                                                  19
to work at lower productivity levels. This in turn implies less "voluntary" separations. But

when σ decreases, the reverse is true, and individuals become choosier about when to work,

leading to more voluntary separations.


5    Frictions and the Steady State II: Extensions

One of the key findings in the previous section was that labor supply responses greatly

attenuate the eﬀect of frictions on steady state employment. Readers familiar with the

matching literature might reasonably argue that this result is heavily influenced by our choice

of the benchmark model. In particular, a key feature of the benchmark model is that given

the level of frictions, there are no other margins of adjustment that work to at least partially

oﬀset the eﬀect of frictions. But while this is a property of the benchmark model, simple and

popular extensions of this model, including those in Pissarides (1985) and Mortensen and

Pissarides (1994), do include an additional choice margin that might play the same role as

the labor supply channel in our model.

    In Pissarides (1985), when a meeting between a worker and a firm occurs, the pair receives

a random draw of a permanent match quality. The optimal decision about whether to form

a match is characterized by a reservation rule, i.e., proceed with forming the match if the

draw for match quality is above some threshold. In this setting, steady state employment

will depend on both the level of frictions and the reservation value. Intuitively, if frictions

become more severe, workers will become less choosy about which matches to form, thereby

giving rise to a force that can at least partially oﬀset the direct eﬀect of more severe frictions.

                                                20
   Similarly, in Mortensen and Pissarides, all matches start at the same high level for match

quality, but this quality subsequently evolves stochastically. In this setting a key decision is

when to terminate a match, which under fairly standard conditions will again be characterized

by a reservation rule. In this setting an increase in frictions can lead to a lower reservation

value, implying that match terminations will decrease. Once again, this creates an opposing

eﬀect on steady state employment relative to the direct eﬀect.

   The question that we ask in this section is whether our finding about the quantitative

importance of the labor supply channel for employment responses remains when we compare

our model with either of these extensions. We note at the outset that although one naturally

expects these extensions to lessen the diﬀerence between our model and the benchmark

Pissarides model, there is good reason to think that a significant diﬀerence will remain. This

is due to the specification of linear utility in the matching literature. In a standard model

of labor supply, including the model we are using in this paper, when a worker decreases the

fraction of life spent in employment, average consumption decreases, which in turn increases

the marginal utility of consumption and creates an incentive for the individual to increase the

fraction of time spent in employment. In contrast, a decrease in average consumption in a

model with linear utility does not increase the marginal utility of consumption, and therefore

does not contain this force leading to higher employment.

   In fact, we will find that our labor supply channel is a substantially more powerful oﬀ-

setting force than the margins present in either of these extensions. We conclude that even



                                              21
these extended versions of the basic matching model imply much larger eﬀects of frictions on

steady state employment than does our model. We proceed to describe in more detail each

of the two extensions described above.

5.1   Extension 1: Adding a Match Formation Decision


In this subsection we analyze an extension to incorporate the match. In the spirit of our

earlier calculation, we consider a continuum of workers, each of whom solves the same decision

theoretic problem with the following features. Preferences are given by:

                                         ∞
                                         X
                                               β t [ct − bht ]
                                         t=0


where ct is consumption in period t, and ht ∈ {0, 1} is time devoted to work. If the individual

begins period t not employed, then he or she will receive a job oﬀer with probability λw .

Conditional on receiving a job oﬀer, the wage associated with this oﬀer is a random draw

from the distribution with cdf F (w). The wage associated with this job will remain fixed for

the duration of the match. If the worker decides to accept the oﬀer, he or she will begin the

job in the same period as the oﬀer was made. As in our earlier models, any match that existed

in period t−1 ends with probability σ at the beginning of period t. In this case the individual

is in the same situation as someone who began the period unemployed. Consumption in each

period is equal to labor earnings. Letting V (w) be the value of employment at wage w and

U be the value of being unemployed, the Bellman equations are:


                           V (w) = w − b + β[(1 − σ)V (w) + σU ]


                                                  22
and
                                                     Z
                          U = (1 − λw )βU + λw             max(V (w), βU )dF (w),


It is easy to show that the optimal job acceptance decision for this worker is characterized

by a reservation wage, which we denote by w∗ . One can also show that decreases in λw or

increases in σ lead to decreases in the reservation wage. The dynamics of the employment

rate, et , is

                         et+1 = (1 − σ)et + λw (1 − F (w∗ ))(1 − (1 − σ)et ).


       We focus on the steady state behavior of the unit mass of workers that each solve this

problem, and in particular will ask how changes in the two frictional parameters λw and σ

aﬀect steady state employment. For our numerical calculations we consider a period to be

a month, and set the values of β, λw , and σ to be the same as in our calibrated model.

An important consideration in comparing results across models is that one might expect the

shape of the distribution characterizing the uncertainty, in particular in the vicinity of the

reservation wage. With this in mind we we calibrate this model so that the cdf F (w) is the

same as the cdf for the stationary distribution of the idiosyncratic shock process from our

calibrated model. We then choose the value of b so that the steady state employment rate is

the same as in our calibrated model, i.e., equal to .632.9 These last two choices imply that

    We solve the model using value function iteration. We use a grid with 10000 points on w on the interval
[−2σw , 2σw ], where σw is the standard deviation of the distribution described by F (w), and applied Tauchen’s
(1986) method for the discrete approximation.

sense, the marginal decision is in the same place in the distribution.10

5.2    Extension 2: Adding a Match Termination Decision


The second extension is in the spirit of Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). Preferences are the

same as in extension 1. As in extension 1, we continue to assume that if a worker receives an

oﬀer, the wage is drawn from a distribution with cdf F (w). However, if the job is accepted,

it will evolve stochastically in future periods, according to an AR(1) process:


                                      log wt+1 = ρ log wt + εt+1


where ε is an iid normally distributed random variable with mean zero and standard deviation

σ ε . The timing is as follows. For any worker who was employed in period t − 1, at the

beginning of t − 1 they are subject to a separation probability that occurs with probability

σ. If a separation does not occur, a new draw for ε is realized, at which point the worker

decides whether to continue with the job. If not, they separate and are in the same position

as a worker who started the period not employed, or who experienced a separation shock.

Letting G(w0 |w) denote the cdf for next period’s wage given this period’s wage is equal to w

implied by the stochastic process for wages on the job, the Bellman equations are

                                                Z
                  V (w) = w − b + β[(1 − σ)         max(V (w0 ), U )dG(w0 |w) + σU ]


and
                                                    Z
                         U = (1 − λw )βU + λw            max(V (w), βU )dF (w).

  10
    This cannot hold exactly, since employment decisions in our model are determined by both productivity
and assets.


                                                    24
       Our timing assumptions imply that an optimal search strategy for this individual will be

described by two reservation wages: one for which new oﬀers to accept, which we denote by

wu∗ and one for which jobs to separate from, which we denote by we∗ .11

       Denote the measure of employed workers over wages by Mt (w). Then the law of motion

for the employment rate in this model is described by:

                                  R
               et+1 = (1 − σ)(et − (1 − G(we∗ |w))dMt (w))
                                                         R
                      +λw (1 − F (wu∗ )))(1 − (1 − σ)et + (1 − G(we∗ |w))dMt (w)).


       The evolution of Mt (w) is described by:

                Mt+1 (w0 ) = λw (1 − et ) max(F (w0 ) − F (wu∗ ), 0)
                             +σλw et max(F (w0 ) − F (wu∗ ), 0)
                                       R
                             +(1 − σ) max(G(w0 |w) − G(we∗ |w), 0)dMt (w)
                                                                   R
                             +(1 − σ) max(F (w0 ) − F (wu∗ ), 0) G(we∗ |w)dMt (w).

       We calibrate this model in a similar fashion. In particular, we set β, λw , and σ as before.

We choose the parameters ρ and σ ε that describe the stochastic evolution of wages on the job

to be the same as those in our original calibration, and choose the cdf F (w) to correspond

to that of the stationary distribution of the stochastic process on wages. We then choose b

so that the steady state employment rate is equal to .632.12
  11
     The reservation wage for accepting a new oﬀer is strictly below b in this model, since it provides some
option value on the new draw for next period, and the worker can always quit if the draw is not good. If
we assumed that a worker who leaves a job voluntarily cannot search during the same period then the two
reservation wages would be the same. We did not assume this in order to avoid asymmetic treatment of
voluntary and involuntary separations. In any case, this is not important for the results.
  12
     Once again we solve the model using value function iteration. We use a grid with 300 values for w on
the interval [−2σw , 2σ w ] and applied Tauchen’s (1986) method for the discrete approximation of F (w) and
G(w0 |w). The computation of the steady-state e is more involved–we iterated over the descretized measures
Mt (w) and et using their transition equations until they converged.

5.3       Results


We now consider the eﬀects of changes in frictions on steady state employment. Table 7

contains results for changes in λw .

       The first column repeats the results for our model that also appeared in Table 3. The

next two columns reports results for the two extensions just described. The final column

shows results for the benchmark Pissarides model used in the previous section, except that

we have now calibrated λw in this model so as to give a steady state employment rate of

.632.13

       We begin by comparing the employment eﬀects associated with a small decrease in λw ,

from the benchmark value of .436 to the value of .4. In our model, the drop in steady state

employment is .2, while the corresponding numbers for extension 1, extension 1, and the

Pissarides model are .9, 1.5 and 2.2. Two simple conclusions follow. First, both extensions

serve to significantly dampen the steady state employment responses relative to the bench-

mark model. Extension 1, for example, has a response that is less than half as large. Second,

however, the extent of this dampening is still very much less than what occurs in our model.
  13
    As we move from row to row we adjust the value of λw for this specification proportionately. Moving from
the first row to the fourth row the values of λw for the Pissarides model are .086, .063, .058, and .029.



                                                    26
While Extension 1 yielded the smallest drop in steady state employment, but this drop is

still more than four times larger than the corresponding drop in our model.

   While we will not discuss the other values in Table 7 in any detail, we note that this factor

four diﬀerence seems to apply equally well for large decreases in λw , as well as for increases.

   Table 8 repeats this exercise for changes in the separation rate σ.

                                            Table 8

                σ = 0.02       63.7%        69.7%         69.4%          77.0%
                σ = 0.039      63.2%        63.2%         63.2%          63.2%
                σ = 0.04       63.2%        63.0%         62.8%          62.6%
                σ = 0.06       62.6%        59.2%         57.7%          52.7%

   The basic result is the same here as in Table 7. One again the two extensions do signifi-

cantly dampen the responses relative to the benchmark Pissarides model. But these responses

are still more than five times as large as the responses in our model.

   We conclude that our key result about the role of frictions in determining steady state

employment is robust to considering these extended versions of the benchmark Pissarides

model. That is, in an empirically reasonable model that includes both frictions and an oper-

ative labor supply margin consistent with the neoclassical theory of labor supply, labor supply

responses greatly attenuate the eﬀect of changes in frictions on steady state employment. Put

somewhat diﬀerently, the level of frictions does not seem to be a major determinant of steady

state employment.

6         Taxes and the Steady State

In this section we analyze what our model predicts regarding the labor market eﬀects of

increases in the size of the tax and transfer program.14 Prescott (2004) argued that diﬀerences

in the scale of tax and transfer programs could account for the bulk of the observed diﬀerences

in hours worked between the US and several European countries. His analysis assumed no

frictions and abstracted from the issue of how workers are distributed across labor market

states. In a steady state setting, these tax calculations are one of the sharpest examples of

how labor supply (i.e., choice) influences aggregate employment. It therefore is an interesting

calculation to revisit in our model that features both choice and chance.

         We assess the importance of frictions for this exercise by comparing the results in our

benchmark calibrated economy with the results that emerge from the case in which λw is

set equal to 1, and the model is calibrated without targeting the unemployment rate. In

the results that we report below we consider a change in τ holding all other parameters

constant, including the two frictional parameters σ and λw . Models of the sort considered

by Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) imply that the levels of these frictions will also respond

to changes in such things as tax rates. However, in view of the results from the previous

section, we know that from the perspective of the eﬀects on steady state employment, the

eﬀects associated with changes in frictions will be of second order.
    14
     Krusell et al (2008) carry out this analysis in a model without idiosyncratic shocks. Krusell et al (2009)
show that such a model does not do a good job of accounting for worker flows. Moreover, that paper did not
distinguish between unemployment and nonparticipation and so could not be used to assess the consequences
for these variables and statistics such as the duration of unemployment.



                                                      28
       Table 9 shows the results for the case of no frictions and our benchmark calibration. To

also show how the results are influenced by having even higher levels of frictions, we also

report results for the case of λw = .2.15

                                              Table 9
                             Taxes and the Employment/Population Ratio
                                      τ = 0.00   τ = 0.15    τ = 0.30    τ = 0.45
                         λw = 1.0       .880        .799        .632       .482
                         λw = .436      .854        .779        .632       .486
                          λw = .2       .829        .763        .632       .492

       The striking result from this table is that the presence of frictions has virtually no eﬀect

on the impact of tax increases on employment. For the case of tax decreases, the presence

of frictions does have some eﬀect, but even when λw = .2 the eﬀect of frictions is relatively

small compared to the overall change. For example, when taxes are reduced to zero, the

employment rate increases by roughly 25 percentage points when there are no frictions, and

by roughly 22 percentage points when λw = .2. It follows that for evaluating the steady state

eﬀects of tax changes, the presence of reasonable frictions has little impact on the aggregate

response of employment.

       Table 10 shows the implications of tax changes for the unemployment rate for the same

three cases considered in Table 9. Once again, we emphasize that we are holding the levels

of frictions constant in this experiment. If changes in taxes do lead to associated changes in

frictions, there would potentially be additional important eﬀects on unemployment.
  15
    Once again, in this case all parameters of the model are recalibrated to match the same targets, but we
are not requiring that the model match the level of unemployment.

                                 τ = 0.00     τ = 0.15   τ = 0.30     τ = 0.45

   An interesting result emerges. Given that the results with frictions are virtually identical

to results without frictions (especially for the case of tax increases), one might expect that

the changes in the employment rate will be reflected mostly in changes in the participation

rate rather than the unemployment rate. But the table shows that changes in taxes do aﬀect

the measured unemployment rate in the models with frictions. In particular, when taxes are

increased from .30 to .45, and the employment rate drops from .63 to .49, we see that the

unemployment rate increases from .08 to .10 and from .16 to .18 for the cases of λw = .436

and .20 respectively. Moreover, it is also the case the spell durations are also aﬀected, as

shown in Table 11.

            λw = 1.0    97.5/0.0/13.3   36.9/0.0/9.3     20.8/0.0/12.1    16.5/0.0/17.7
            λw = .436   34.4/2.2/12.7   26.8/2.2/11.7    18.7/2.1/13.0    15.3/2.1/17.8
            λw = 0.2    38.3/4.7/11.8   32.8/4.5/12.7    24.6/4.2/13.8    20.3/4.0/19.1

   Some interesting patterns emerge. Specifically, an increase in taxes leads to shorter

durations of employment and unemployment spells, and longer durations of nonparticipation.

The reason for the decrease in unemployment spell durations is that when taxes are high

individuals have a higher reservation productivity level for a given value of assets, and this

means that unemployed workers are more likely to experience a negative productivity shock



                                                30
and transition to out of the labor force.16

         To summarize, the main finding of this section is that for reasonably calibrated frictions,

the aggregate employment eﬀects of the model with frictions is essentially identical to that

of the model without frictions. However, in the model with frictions, changes in taxes do

impact on statistics such as the unemployment rate and the duration of employment and

unemployment spells. In this sense the model with frictions has a richer set of predictions for

the eﬀect of tax changes than the model without frictions. Some researchers argue against the

importance of the labor supply channel emphasized in the frictionless model in some contexts

by suggesting that it is inconsistent with responses in the unemployment rate. This analysis

shows that such a general critique is not compelling in the context of a model with both a

nondegenerate labor supply decision and frictions. More generally, if changes in taxes were

accompanied by changes in the level of frictions, as implied by standard matching models,

then our model implies that one could generate diﬀerent changes in the unemployment rate

without having any significant eﬀect on the employment eﬀects that we found.


7         A Contrasting View

The results of the last two sections suggest a very simple characterization of how our hybrid

model compares with the standard frictionless and frictional models used in the literature.

From the perspective of predicting changes in steady state employment, our hybrid model

behaves very closely to frictionless models. But from the perspective of making predictions
    16
    It is important to note that we have not included an unemployment insurance system in our model, and
that in reality a more generous system may well influence the distribution of individuals between U and N.


                                                   31
about changes in steady state unemployment, our model behaves very closely to the standard

frictional models. The striking and important finding is that the one-to-one inverse mapping

between employment and unemployment that is implicit in standard frictional models does

not at all hold in terms of steady state outcomes in our model.

       In this section we discuss one implicit assumption of our specification that is of particular

relevance in producing these findings. In particular, by assuming an AR(1) process for

the idiosyncratic shock process with normal innovations we have implicitly assumed that

the invariant distribution describing the idiosyncratic productivities is continuous. As an

extreme but simple alternative, we could have specified the idiosyncratic shock process so

that it has support on only two points, one of which corresponds to zero productivity and

the other which has some positive level of productivity. In this setting individuals will never

want to work if they have zero productivity. There is one further assumption of interest: the

probability of the high productivity state could be suﬃciently low that individuals always

want to work if they have high productivity, or it could be suﬃciently high that individuals

do not necessarily always want to work when productivity is high. If one were to adopt

the former specification, then the model ceases to have an operative labor supply margin.

And not surprisingly, this model will not have any of the labor supply eﬀects that we have

emphasized earlier. It would follow that taxes have very little eﬀect on employment and that

frictions have large eﬀects on employment.17 In contrast, if one adopts the latter specification
  17
    These results hold for changes that are not too large. If taxes increase suﬃciently, for example, then
individuals might not want to work all of the time even in the high productivity state.




                                                   32
then the model will behave very much like a model in which all workers are identical, and the

labor supply responses will be even somewhat more powerful than in our earlier analysis.18

       An important issue is whether our criterion of asking the model to match observed labor

market flows documented in Table 2 allows us to distinguish between these two diﬀerent

specifications. The answer is basically no, though there are some subtle issues. In particular,

one can specify the two-state Markov model so as to generate each of the above properties and

still have the resulting flows be similar to those that we found for our benchmark calibration.

In particular, it can do an equally good job in matching the E to E, N to N , U to E, E

to N and N to E flows as our benchmark calibration. The one subtle issue has to do with

matching the U to N flow. As was also the case for our benchmark specification, this two

state model cannot match the U to N flow from the data. However, the extent of mismatch

is in some sense worse in the two state specification. If individuals always want to work

when in the productive state, then the E to N flow is identical to the U to N flow. In our

benchmark model the U to N flow does not match its value in the data, but at the same

time the U to N flow is still roughly twice as large as the E to N flow. For the case in which

individuals do not always want to work in the high productivity state, then the flow from E

to N is necessarily larger than the flow from U to N , making the issue even more severe.

       We conclude from this that our results are not robust to very diﬀerent specifications of
  18
    In our benchmark model, an individual who suﬀers an involuntary spell of nonemployment during a high
productivity period can only make up for the lost income by working in the future in some less productive
states. The lower productivity of these states reduces somewhat the ability of the individual to substitute
between voluntary and involuntary nonemployment spells.




                                                    33
the innovations to the shock process, in the sense that there are specifications that could

match the flows reasonably well and give very diﬀerent implications for the eﬀects of changes

in frictions and changes in taxes. One reason for not considering the two state specification

in which individuals always work in the good state is that this specification has no operative

labor supply margin, and one of the motivations for the development of our hybrid model is

that one can easily see situations in which the labor supply decision is operative. What the

above result implies however, is that one cannot dismiss the model that does not feature an

operative labor supply margin purely on the basis of matching the labor market flows.

   However, we believe there is alternative evidence that one can bring to bear on the issue

which gives us reason to prefer the continuous distribution specification over the (two-state)

discrete distribution case in which individuals always want to work if the productivity is high.

If the distribution has all of its mass on two points and optimal behavior dictates wanting

to always work whenever the idiosyncratic productivity is high, there is no scope for any

aggregate changes to influence participation except via the idiosyncratic shock process. Such

a specification seems hard to square with the fact that participation rates vary significantly

across countries, and that participation rates have changed smoothly for various groups in

the US over time, and often in diﬀerent directions. These observations suggest to us that it is

preferable to adopt a specification in which at each point in time there are some individuals

for whom the participation decision has a continuous component that is aﬀected at the margin

by aggregate changes.



                                              34
    Perhaps a more interesting case would be one in which the idiosyncratic shocks allow for a

positive mass at the zero productivity state. This would reflect the possibility that for many

individuals their idiosyncratic shocks are such that working is not a possibility. This might

be relevant in thinking about certain types of health shocks, for example. An examination

of Figure 1 suggests that our results are likely to be quite robust to introducing this feature.

Figure 1 shows that in our benchmark specification there is no work done by those in roughly

the bottom decile of the productivity distribution. Even in the case of a dramatic increase in

frictions (from the benchmark value of .436 to the value of .2, resulting in an increase in the

unemployment rate of roughly 19 percentage points), there is still virtually no work being

done by those in the bottom decile of the distribution. It follows that adding even a sizeable

mass point at the bottom of the distribution would not have any impact on the extent to

which labor supply responses are able to compensate for increases in frictions.


8    Conclusion

We use an empirically reasonable three state model of the labor market to address two

questions regarding the determination of steady state employment and unemployment at the

aggregate level. The first concerns the eﬀect of changes in frictions on aggregate employment.

We find that changes in either the job loss rate of the job finding rate do not have large

eﬀects on aggregate employment, though they do have sizable eﬀects on unemployment. In

particular, the labor supply response present in our model greatly attenuates the employment

response relative to the simplest matching model as well as common extensions. We conclude

                                              35
that choice plays a much larger role than chance in the determination of aggregate steady state

employment. In contrast, chance plays a dominant role in the determination of aggregate

steady state unemployment. The second issue is the eﬀect of tax and transfer programs on

aggregate employment. We find that the presence of frictions has virtually no impact on

the response of aggregate employment, but the model also predicts that higher taxes lead to

higher unemployment and lower participation.

   A key message for quantitative analysis of steady state labor market outcomes is that

including an operative extensive labor supply margin consistent with neoclassical models of

labor supply is important. Although frictions by themselves can exert a large direct eﬀect

on steady state employment, these eﬀects are largely oﬀset by labor supply responses.

   While our analysis in this paper has focused solely on the determination of steady state

labor market outcomes, it is obviously of interest to examine how the forces of choice and

chance interact in contexts where transition dynamics are critical, such as when the economy

is subjected to shocks. In particular, what are the responses of employment and unemploy-

ment when there are shocks to the level of frictions, either to the oﬀer arrival rate or the

separation rate? How does the presence of a labor supply channel aﬀect the propagation

of these shocks? While the framework that we have used in this paper is well suited to

the analysis of this question, we think it is important to emphasize that there is no reason

to conjecture that our results about the dampening eﬀect of labor supply on the eﬀects of

frictions will continue to hold in the case of shocks to frictions.
