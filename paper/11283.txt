                                            ABSTRACT

Obtaining lower generalized system of preferences (GSP) tariffs requires meeting costly Rules of

Origin (ROOs). Growing coffee in the shade is more costly, but yields a price premium. This paper

analyzes the effects of such restrictions in a general equilibrium setting and shows that such policies

may have unanticipated effects. It is shown that in a world with capital mobility, the GSP could

result in capital outflows rather than inflows and consumer preferences for shade grown coffee end

up hurting labor in developing countries. Even small subsidies that are contingent on the use of

domestic intermediates can result in specialization in the targeted good. Value added contingent

policies can easily lead to multiple equilibria despite the absence of externalities or market

imperfections.

1     Introduction

Trade and domestic policies are often conditional in practice: only if certain

conditions are met is a set of benefits obtained. Content protection schemes in

developing countries often require firms in an industry to use at least some level

of domestic inputs. In a Free Trade Area (FTA) producers become eligible for

zero tariﬀs (when exporting to a partner in the FTA) if the product is deemed

to have domestic origin. Otherwise, they must pay the going tariﬀ. Under

the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) poor developing countries obtain

preferential tariﬀs only if the product is deemed to originate in the developing

country.1 In some countries, producers obtain preferential access to inputs only

if they export their products. Similarly, products produced in environmentally

friendly or socially acceptable ways, (like dolphin safe tuna (caught using nets

that allow dolphins to escape), or shade grown coﬀee (so that tree cover re-

mains), or carpets made by adults (not children) and certified as such,2 or food

certified as organic), command a higher price. Since the price obtained is con-

ditional on the technique used, this also falls under the banner of conditional

policies.

    The eﬀect of such conditional policies in a general equilibrium setting has

been neglected. This paper shows that the use of simple duality arguments al-

lows us to answer such questions in a simple and relatively general manner. A

particular policy, namely, the level of ROOs in the FTA, is used for illustrative

purposes. It will be evident that the approach applies to all the above exam-

ples though details may well diﬀer between applications. For example, some
   1 Most products, other than arms and numerous agricultural goods, are covered by the GSP.

The conditions under which origin is granted are defined by the Rules of Origin (ROOs).
   2 Senator Harkin introduced a “Child Labor Deterrence Act” in 1994 to allow imports

of such goods to be potentially prohibited. Such an act has not so far made it through
the committee process. However, Senator Harkin introduced another bill, “The Child Free
Consumer Information Act”, which would provide a voluntary labeling system, the accuracy
of which would be enforced by a commission.



                                             1
practices confer a direct benefit to the consumer: organic food is perceived as

better tasting and better for you, so that labeling would occur voluntarily. In

this case, there is no role for government other than that of checking that labels

are accurate. Other practices, like dolphin safe tuna, are costly to implement,3

and do not impact on the quality of the product per se. In such cases, certifica-

tion, combined with consumer disapproval, could make companies follow such

practices.4 On the other hand, rules of origin in an FTA have to be set and

enforced, at substantial cost to producers and to government.

    There is a literature on labeling in the trade and environmental economics

area. However, it is, by and large, cast in a partial equilibrium setting. Rolo

and Winters (2000) argue that taxes, in one form or the other, should be used to

deal with environmental externalities while labeling should be used to deal with

information asymmetries arising from individuals not knowing the attributes

of the product. Beaulieu and Gaisford (2002) look at policies to influence eco

dumping and make a case for the use of conditional policies. Matto and Singh

(1994), Freeman (1994) along with a host of other work suggests that when

asked, consumers say they are willing to pay significantly more for environmen-

tally friendly goods. However, marketing science research suggests that even

small price diﬀerences result in consumers purchasing the cheaper good when

quality is the same. If this is true, labeling so as to avert consumer displeasure
    3 The furor over dolphin safe tuna arose, to begin with, after March 8th 1988, when all the

major U.S. networks broadcast a tape of hundreds of dolphins being killed by the Panamanian
tuna fishing boat “Maria Luisa”. A boycott of tuna led to all the major canned tuna producers
committing to only selling dolphin safe tuna! Voluntary restraints on such harvesting in the
Eastern Pacific (mostly by the U.S. though also involving Mexico and Latin American coun-
tries) were replaced by binding agreements (the international dolphin conservation program
act) among the states concerned in 1998. (See Dyck and Zingales (2002).)
    4 An in between case, where there are some reasons to adopt the practice independent of

consumer willingness to pay, is shade grown coﬀee. Shade growing results in bigger beans and
greater fruit weight without compromising on flavor at low altitudes as shade protects from
temperature extremes. Shade grown coﬀee reduces deforestation as well as providing enhanced
pest control and enhancing bird diversity. Under optimal conditions, however, coﬀee can be
grown eﬃciently in the open with the use of high levels of agro chemical inputs which have
possible adverse runoﬀ eﬀects.

would be a fragile force.

    Previous work on Rules of Origin and content protection and preference

has also taken a partial equilibrium approach. Early work by McCulloch and

Johnson (1973), Grossman (1981) and Mussa (1984) considered competitive set-

tings while Krishna and Itoh (1988) look at a duopoly and strategic interaction

eﬀects. Krueger (1999) and Krishna and Krueger (1995) look at ROOs in a

partial equilibrium setting. The most closely related papers to this one are Ju

and Krishna (1998) and (2002). Using a partial equilibrium setting, they point

out an essential non monotonicity occurs when the link between final and in-

termediate goods markets is accounted for. If the requirement that has to be

met is easy to meet, all firms choose to do so. In this regime, one set of com-

parative statics results are obtained. At some point, however, firms will become

indiﬀerent between meeting and not meeting the restriction. Some firms meet

the requirement, while others do not. In this regime, the comparative statics

results are reversed.5

    However, a deep understanding of such situations is still lacking. The cur-

rent paper develops a way of looking at such situations in a general equilibrium

setting under perfect competition. The model is based on the dual approach

utilizing the factor price frontier. It will become clear that the approach devel-

oped here has a host of applications in a variety of areas. Using the techniques

developed, questions such as the eﬀects of encouraging stricter labor standards

internationally through trade policy or the eﬀects of consumer movements build-

ing a market base for environmentally friendly products can easily be dealt with

in a general equilibrium setting.

    Section 2 lays out the basic tools taking a physical content requirement to

be the requirement for origin in the FTA. Section 3 looks at the eﬀects of FTAs
   5 This points to the importance of allowing ex ante identical firms to behave diﬀerently ex

post. Even the classic papers in this area do not seem to appreciate this.

with ROOs (defined as a physical requirement) in general equilibrium in the

presence and absence of capital mobility. It is shown that when ROOs are set

at ex ante just binding levels, they need not be binding ex post, nor must they

result in an inflow of capital. However, they always result in an expansion of the

aﬀected sector, and increased trade deflection though the economy as a whole

may shrink.6 Section 4 considers a value added ROO. With such a ROO, it is

shown that the concavity of the cost function need not always obtain, and as

a result, duality cannot be exploited fully. In addition, when factors are not

good substitutes, there can be many equilibria despite the absence of market

imperfections. Section 5 concludes.


2     The Basic Tools

Although the tools are standard, there is a slight twist in their use that needs

some explaining. Using a mixed metaphor, conditional polices have a carrot and

hoop element to them. The carrot, preferential treatment in the case of ROOs

in the FTA, is obtained only by jumping through hoops, namely, meeting origin

requirements. We ask, what factor prices can a firm aﬀord to pay if it can choose

to avail itself of these conditional policies? The basic insight used in this paper

is that if, by taking advantage of the policy, the firm can raise the factor prices

it can aﬀord to pay, it will be willing to do so. Otherwise, it will not. In other

words, we look at the eﬀects of such restrictions on the factor price frontier.7

We then use the dual definition of the standard revenue function: namely, as

the value function for the problem of minimizing factor payments subject to the

factor price frontier. Given the availability of resources and technology, if the
   6 Less central results are relegated to appendices. The first extends the technique to ROOs

which require a particular intermediate input to be produced domestically. The second derives
the eﬀects of making ROOs more restrictive and argues that the kind of non monotonicity
seen in Ju and Krishna (1998) is likely to be prevalent in general equilibrium.
   7 In a way, such restrictions can be viewed as a combination of a tariﬀ and technological

regression.

opportunities created by the FTA increase the factor price that firms can pay,

then the restriction matters in equilibrium.

2.1       The Revenue Function

It is easiest to illustrate the approach with one good and two factors, capital

(K) and labor (L) with prices r and w respectively. Let factors be supplied
                          w
inelastically and let     r   = ω, the wage rental ratio. Consider a unit isoquant

with K on the vertical axis. Combinations of K and L that lie above the unit

isoquant are feasible ways of producing a unit of the good. Unit costs are

minimized where the slope of the unit isoquant equals − wr . Minimizing unit

cost involves using [aL (ω), aK (ω)] to make the good, that is, using a capital
                 aK (ω)
labor ratio of   aL (ω)   = k(ω). Denote the minimized unit cost by c(w, r).

   The curve p = c(w, r) defines the factor price frontier in this one good

economy and is depicted in Figure 1. As is well understood, the equilibrium

factor prices can be obtained as the solutions to minimizing factor payments

subject to p ≤ c(w, r), while the revenue function is the value function for this

problem.8 Equilibrium factor prices for a one good economy at price p, and

endowments V = (L, K), would be given by the tangency of the line wL + rK

to the curve p = c(w, r) which occurs at I.

   As long as constant returns to scale are preserved and the restrictions do

not make the cost function non concave, we can proceed in the same manner

when considering conditional policy schemes. We will first derive the factor

price frontier under the scheme and then minimize factor payments subject to

the factor price frontier to get equilibrium factor prices.

   Suppose we consider a physical content requirement as the origin rule: in

particular, that the capital labor ratio used in production be weakly below an
                  aK
upper limit or    aL   ≤ k̄. When we consider the unit isoquant as done earlier we

see that in order to meet the origin rule, inputs must lie below the ray from

the origin with slope k̄ as well as above the unit isoquant. Let the wage rental

ratio that induces a capital labor ratio of k be ω(k). Hence, only if the wage

rental ratio exceeds ω(k̄) is the requirement binding. In this event, it is easy

to see that cost minimization involves just meeting the origin rule. Let these
                                       £              ¤
distorted input choices be denoted by aL (k̄), aK (k̄) . Consequently, the unit

cost of production when meeting the requirement is


          c(w, r, k̄) = waL (k̄) + raK (k̄) > c(w, r), if ω > ω(k̄)

                       = c(w, r),                         if ω ≤ ω(k̄).


   The factor price frontier in the FTA with ROOs is, thus, given by combining

this with the option of ignoring the FTA. This is depicted in Figure 1. The

physical content requirement has to be met for the firm to obtain the higher

price, pT , from selling in the FTA. Since obtaining a higher price allows factors

to be paid more, the higher price alone results in the price equal to cost curve in

the absence of any policies being proportionally blown up to the level given by


                                          6
pT = c(w, r). However, in order to obtain the higher price pT = p(1+t), where t

is the ad-valorem default tariﬀ, a sub-optimal technique, namely, (aK (k̄), aL (k̄))

is used if ω > w(k̄), where w(k̄) is the slope of ray from the origin to B in Figure

1. Since it would be optimal to use this technique if the restriction were binding,

unit costs given the restriction is binding would be given by the line tangent to

the curve pT = c(w, r) at B with slope k̄. Note that if the wage rental ratio is

not too high, this line lies above the factor prices a firm can aﬀord to pay and

meet costs, if it ignores the conditional policy, so that it is in its interest to take

advantage of the policy. Once the wage rental ratio exceeds ω̃(k̄), as depicted

in Figure 1, it is best to ignore the conditional policy.9

    The highest factor prices that a firm can pay, if it has the option of availing

itself of a conditional policy of this form, is, therefore, given by GHBD in Figure

1. This is the augmented price equal to cost curve and the relevant factor price

frontier with a single good. The tangency of the line wL + rK to this frontier

gives the equilibrium factor prices. If there is only one good and the ROO is set

at exactly the pre-FTA level of k, then any wage rental ratio along the straight

line part of the factor price frontier would be equilibrium wage rental ratio. It

is easy to see that even a slightly binding ROO could cause large factor price

changes. For example, if the ROO is set at k̄, then the wage rental ratio would

rise to ω̃(k̄). Making the restriction weaker, that is raising k̄, will also raise the

corresponding ω̃(k̄) but that as long as pT > p, ω̃(k̄) > w(k).

    With many goods, the factor prices that each sector can aﬀord to pay in the

presence of such policies, can be derived in the same way. The factor price fron-

tier is then the set of factor prices that lie above all these (possibly augmented)

price equal cost curves. Factor prices which minimize factor payments subject

to this set are the factor prices in equilibrium. Goods (techniques) which have
   9 Note that making the restriction stricter, that is lowering k̄, will also lower the corre-

sponding ω̃(k̄).

cost exceeding price are not made (used), and output levels are determined so

that factor markets clear. The value function for this problem yields the revenue

or national income function.

2.2     Equilibrium Conditions in FTAs with ROOs

Suppose that there are two goods, 1 and 2, and two countries, A and B, which

form the FTA. Assume that there is no specialization prior to the FTA and

that both countries import good 1. Denote the world price by p∗ and label the

countries so that country A has a lower tariﬀ and, hence, a lower domestic price

of good 1 prior to the FTA. If one of the countries exports the good to the other

after the F T A, it must be A as its domestic price is lower than that in B. There

are no export subsidies and good 2 is assumed to be freely traded and is taken

as the numeraire.10

   Superscripts A and B refer to the countries while the superscripts 0 and 1

refer to pre and post F T A levels respectively. Let e(P, u) and r(P, V ) denote

the standard expenditure and revenue functions, where P denotes the vector

of prices. Subscripts on e(P, u) and r(P, V ) denote the partial derivative with

respect to the subscripted variable. As usual, by the envelope theorem, eP (.) =

ch (.), the vector of Hicksian compensated demands. Similarly, rP (.) = x(.), the

supply of goods, while rV (.) = w(.), the vector of factor prices.
                                                                   ¡          ¢
   In the equilibrium before the F T A the endogenous variables are uA0 , uB0

while pA0
       1  and pB0
               1  are given by the tariﬀs set by each country and the fixed

world price. Setting expenditure equal to income gives the equilibrium levels of
  1 0 Alternatively, A can be thought of as the developing country who obtains lower tariﬀs

when exporting to B if it meets origin requirements. For the most part the example will be
the FTA one but the analogy to the GSP example is obvious.

3       Physical ROOs

We proceed by examining the eﬀects of ROOs defined in physical terms requiring

a minimum use of labor relative to capital. We look at the eﬀects of the FTA

both with and without capital mobility assuming that the ROO is set at the pre

FTA level. Two cases are considered: when good 1 is relatively capital intensive

and when it is relatively labor intensive.

3.1     Restricting the Capital Intensive Good

Assume good 1 is relatively capital intensive. Then the FTA allows A to obtain

a higher price for good 1 by exporting to B on preferential terms if it meets the

ROO.

3.1.1    Price Eﬀects of Status Quo ROOs

The factor price frontier on the assumption that the ROO is set at the status quo,

namely, the pre FTA capital labor ratio in sector 1, is depicted in Figure 2(a) by

BCDAF. Before the FTA the prices faced by producers in A are (pA0
                                                               1 , p2 ), and

the factor price ratio is ω 0 , which occurs at the intersection of the price equal

to cost curves for the two goods. The capital labor ratios in the two sectors

are k1A0 and k2A0 and the economy wide capital labor ratio, kA0 , lies in between

them. Being forced to use the pre FTA capital labor ratio to meet origin makes

the factor price frontier depart from that associated with a higher price of good

1 alone only at wage rental ratios above ω 0 . If the ROO is set at the pre FTA

capital labor ratio in Sector 1 and pB1         A0
                                     1 exceeds p1 , the factor prices that firms

can just aﬀord to pay are given by BCDAE while the factor price frontier for

the economy is given by BCDAF in Figure 2(a). As is evident, such a ROO

is not binding in equilibrium.11 Access to higher prices for good 1 raises r and
  1 1 The factor price changes in A cause a ROO set to be just binding prior to the FTA to

be not binding after the FTA. It is easy to see that even an initially slightly restrictive ROO

lowers w for country A thereby reducing the capital labor ratio in both sectors.12

These are direct consequences of the Stolper Samuelson Theorem.

    Consider the supply of good 1 from A when the ROO is set at k1A0 . Recall

that k A0 is the aggregate capital labor ratio. At p1 = p̄1 , the slope of the curve

p̄1 = c1 (w, r) where it intersects the curve p2 = c2 (w, r) is given by kA0 as

depicted in Figure 2(a). A ROO set at k1A0 results in complete specialization in

good 1 for prices at or above p̄1 . When the price is p̄1 , the ROO does not bind in

equilibrium so that capital labor ratio in making good 1 in equilibrium equals the

aggregate capital labor ratio, specialization occurs and supply becomes vertical.

A ROO at k1A0 is not binding at any price above pA0
                                                 1 . Thus, A’s supply to B is

as depicted in Figure 2(b). It is zero at prices below pA0
                                                        1 as firms in A can do

better by selling domestically in this event. At pA0
                                                  1 firms are willing to supply

to B, and as price rises, the normal supply response occurs. When the price

reaches p̄1 , A specializes in good 1 and supply becomes inelastic.

    Similarly, B’s excess demand for good 1 from A is zero at all prices above

pB0                                                       B0
 1 as it can obtain good 1 from the rest of the world at p1 . It equals its total

excess demand for good 1 at prices below pB0                      B0
                                          1 and is horizontal at p1 as shown.

Whether the price in B after the FTA is pA0      B0
                                         1 , or p1 , or in between depends on

the size of A’s supply relative to B’s excess demand. If A is large and B is not,

then the price faced by consumers and producers in A and B will be pA0
                                                                    1 . All

of B’s imports of good 1 will be produced in A while A will import enough to

meet its own demand.

    If B is large and A is not, then the price faced by consumers and producers in

B will be pB0                            A0                           B0
           1 . Consumers in A will face p1 while producers will face p1 . Some

will not be binding in equilibrium. A ROO has to be stricter than k̂, the slope of the price
cost curve in 1 at A in Figure 2, in order to be restrictive in equilibrium. Of course, as the
price diﬀerential in the two countries falls, the corresponding k̂ rises so that this minimally
restrictive ROO is less strict.
  1 2 If the price in B falls, the opposite happens in B.




                                              12
of B’s imports of good 1 will be produced in A while all of A’s consumption will

be imported.

    If both A and B are large, the price faced by consumers and producers in B

post F T A lies in between these two extremes.13 Consumers in A will face pA0
                                                                           1

while producers will face pB1
                           1 .

    If A is large, it will supply all B’s imports and A must gain from the F T A

due to its appropriation of tariﬀ revenue from B. B’s prices fall but it is worse

oﬀ than if it merely reduced its tariﬀs to get its post F T A price level as it loses

tariﬀs to A. If B is large but A is not, B must lose as its prices are unaﬀected

and it loses tariﬀ revenue. In contrast, A must gain as it not only gains tariﬀ

revenue but it exports good 1 to B and this price rises while its consumer prices

are unchanged.

    Thus, to summarize, a ROO on the capital intensive good set to be initially

just binding is not binding after the FTA. The FTA raises the welfare of the

lower tariﬀ country in the FTA and can reduce the welfare of the higher tariﬀ

country: it must do so if this country is large.

3.1.2    Allowing Capital Mobility

Allowing capital mobility into country A has very standard eﬀects along the lines

of Mundell (1957). We assume that there is a function G(rA ), which defines the

rental rate in A such that there are no capital flows to A.14 Also, we assume

that G(rA0 ) = 0. We assume that G(r) is increasing in r. Since r is weakly

higher in A after the FTA (as p weakly rises in A), capital will flow into A. The

inflow shifts the production possibility frontier of country A out further in good

1 than good 2 as good 1 is capital intensive and (via the Rybczynski Theorem)
   1 3 Note that A can completely specialize in serving B after the FTA only if pB0 > p̄ , which
                                                                                 1      1
is how Figure 2(b) is drawn.
   1 4 Changes in the price faced by producers and consumers in B will also aﬀect rental rates

there and as rental rates will fall in B, we would expect capital outflows from B. If capital in
B is mobile, then analogous output changes would occur there.



                                              13
shifts out the supply curve for good 1 from country A. The process comes to an

end when one of two things occurs. Either enough capital flows in to make pB1

fall to pA0 so that pre FTA equilibrium factor prices are reinstated in A, or A

specializes in good 1. The former occurs if A has enough labor to meet all of B’s

demand at pA0 . If A has a small enough labor force, then a price diﬀerential

between A and B can be maintained but A will specialize in making good 1.

    To illustrate, consider ex ante just binding ROO so that the ROO is set at

the pre FTA capital labor ratio in good 1, namely, k1A0 . Now suppose enough

capital has flowed in to make the aggregate capital labor ratio in A equal to

k1A0 and that A’s labor force is small so that the producer and consumer price

in B, which equals the producer price in A, denoted by pB1                 A0
                                                        1 , still exceeds p1 as

depicted in Figure 3(a). At this aggregate capital labor ratio, A is specializing in

Good 1. This follows from the fact that the capital labor ratios in both sectors at

D, the incomplete specialization point, where price equals cost for both sectors,

lie below k1A0 . As depicted in Figure 3(a), the equilibrium factor prices are given

by the point C, which lies just above A, the pre FTA rental rate in A. Rental

rates are equalized, preventing further capital inflows, but wages in A are higher

than before the FTA.

3.2     Restricting the Labor Intensive Good

What if good 1 is relatively labor intensive? Figure 4 is the analogue of Figure

2 for this case. If the ROO is set at the pre FTA capital labor ratio in Sector

1 and pB1
       1  exceeds pA0
                   1 , the factor prices that firms can just aﬀord to pay are

given by the line BCADF while the factor price frontier for the economy is

given by GADF in Figure 4(a). As is evident, such a ROO is strictly binding

in equilibrium.15
  1 5 The factor price changes in A cause a ROO set to be just binding prior to the FTA to be

strictly binding after the FTA.

   Access to higher prices for good 1 raises w and lowers r for country A thereby

raising the unconstrained capital labor ratio in both sectors and making a pre-

viously just binding ROO strictly binding. If the price in B falls, the opposite

happens in B.

   Consider the supply of good 1 from A. If pB1   A0
                                             1 = p1 , then the ROO is just

binding. Firms in A are indiﬀerent between selling in A and selling to B. This

is responsible for the horizontal segment at pB1   A0                    B1
                                              1 = p1 in Figure 4(b). As p1

rises, it is easy to verify that factor prices move from E along GE. Supply of

good 1 in A rises with pB1
                        1 since R(.) is convex in prices and R1 (.) equals supply.

The equilibrium price in B after the F T A depends on the size of A relative to

B as before.

   Note, however, that there is one minor diﬀerence in the behavior of supply.

A will not specialize in good 1 at any price. As p1 rises from pA0
                                                                1 , factor prices

move from E towards G in Figure 4(a). All firms in Sector 1 choose to meet

the ROO so that the capital labor ratio in Sector 1 is fixed at k1A0 while that

in Sector 2 rises with pB1
                        1 . The economy wide capital labor ratio lies between

them,16 so that both goods are always made. Hence, w rises and r falls in A

due to the FTA, in line with Stolper Samuelson eﬀects, unless A is large and

can supply all that B demands at pA0
                                  1 . Note that whether the targeted good

is labor intensive or capital intensive, an FTA results in trade deflection: the

lower tariﬀ country’s production of the good is exported to the partner whose

price weakly falls due to the FTA, while it imports its own needs.

   Now consider capital mobility. Since r falls due to the F T A unless A is large

relative to B, capital will flow out of A rather than into it. This outflow shifts

the production possibility frontier of country A in and does so more for good 2

than good 1 as good 2 is capital intensive. Via the Rybczynski theorem, capital
 1 6 This   is ensured because there in no specialization in the initial equilibrium.




                                                 17
outflows shift the supply curve for good 1 from country A outward. Of course,

the supply for good 2 is shifting in with the shift in of the PPF. The shift out

in the supply curve of A, in turn, reduces the price of good 1 in B. The process

comes to an end when one of two things occurs. Either enough capital flows

out to make pB1         A0
             1 fall to p1 so that the pre FTA equilibrium factor prices are

reinstated in A. This occurs when A is very large: even after enough capital has

left for the aggregate capital labor ratio in A to equal the pre FTA capital labor

ratio in Sector 1 in A, A is still able to supply all that B demands at pA0
                                                                         1 . If it is

not able to do so, then a price diﬀerential between A and B can be maintained

but A will specialize in making good 1.

   This is illustrated in Figure 4(a). Suppose enough capital has flowed out of

A to make the aggregate capital labor ratio equal to k1A0 and that A0 s labor

force is small so that the price in B, denoted by pB1
                                                   1 , still exceeds that in

A, pA0
    1 . At this aggregate capital labor ratio A is specializing in good 1. This

follows from the fact that the capital labor ratios in both sectors at D, the

incomplete specialization point, lie weakly above k1A0 , so that there must be

specialization. As depicted in Figure 4(a), the equilibrium factor prices are

given by a point along AD, which lies vertically above E. Thus, rental rates

are equalized, preventing further capital inflows, but the wages in A are higher

than before the FTA. Thus, general equilibrium analysis suggests that the FTA

need not always result in capital flowing into the low tariﬀ country in order to

export to the high tariﬀ one! As shown, if Sector 1 is labor intensive, capital

may well flow into Sector 1, but flow out of the economy as a whole.

   An obvious implication of this result concerns the eﬀects of the GSP on de-

veloping countries. Developing countries, being relatively labor abundant, tend

to have a comparative advantage in labor intensive goods. Thus, oﬀering them

lower tariﬀs on their exports (if origin is met) will tend to raise w and reduce r


                                         18
thereby leading to capital flowing out of the developing country! Even though

the labor intensive sector expands, the capital intensive one would contract even

more!

    It is fairly straightforward to extend the above analysis to other applications.

Consider the example of shade grown coﬀee given earlier. Suppose there are two

ways to make coﬀee, one is shade grown and, as machinery is harder to use in

this setting, relatively labor intensive. The other is on plantations using more

mechanization and fertilizer. Then the price equal to cost curve of coﬀee will be

a composite of the two techniques in the usual manner: namely, use the shade

grown technique when the wage rental rate is low and the plantation one when

the wage rental ratio is high. A preference for shade grown coﬀee manifested

in a price premium oﬀered for shade grown coﬀee will shift the shade grown

part of the composite curve up. Now, if the shade grown technique is not being

used, this shift could, if it is large enough, ensure the use of the shade grown

technique. However, its eﬀect on factor prices in general equilibrium depends on

whether coﬀee is more or less intensive than the other good, call it food. If coﬀee

is more labor intensive than food under both techniques, then this premium,

at a given price for regular coﬀee, would raise the wage rental ratio, while if it

was always more capital intensive than food, it would lower it a la the Stolper

Samuelson theorem.17 Thus, whether workers in the developing country making

coﬀee gain or lose from such a price premium, and whether one should expect

capital inflows or outflows from the economy depends on the capital intensity of

what else is being made. Similarly, we can reinterpret the example calling the

two techniques the dolphin safe technique and the other. The main results for

conditional policies, where the requirement is a physical one, are summarized

in Proposition 1.
  1 7 Also, factor intensity reversals could occur even if they are none for the two techniques

separately.



                                              19
Proposition 1 Policies which provide an incentive to produce the capital in-

tensive good conditional on meeting a physical requirement on inputs, need not

involve distortions on the input side in the final equilibrium even if they are

binding at the initial equilibrium levels. However, if the good is relatively labor

intensive, distortions on the input side occur even if the physical requirement is

not strictly binding to begin with. In the presence of capital mobility, such poli-

cies always attract capital to the targeted sector and raise supply so that trade

deflection is greater when capital is mobile. However, they do so at the cost of

capital outflows from the economy as a whole when the targeted sector is labor

intensive.

3.3    Extensions

Two extensions are considered. Their details are in the Appendix. First the

eﬀects of more restrictive ROOs are analyzed. It is shown that the same kind of

non monotonicity that occured in Ju and Krishna (1998) also occurs here and

for similar reasons.

Proposition 2 There are two regimes: in one all firms in Sector 1 make the

same choices (homogeneous regime) and in the other, firms makes diﬀerent

choices (heterogeneous regime). Making ROOs stricter moves the economy from

the homogeneous to the heterogeneous regime and can first raise exports to B

and then reduce them.

   Second, the technique is extended to ROOs which require a particular in-

termediate input to be produced domestically. This extension is useful as such

ROOs are common. It also provides an example where even a very slight ROO

of this form in an FTA can result in drastic changes in production patterns.

Proposition 3 When policies provide a benefit conditional on the use of do-

mestic intermediates, their eﬀects can be extremely discontinuous. Even if the

                                        20
domestic intermediate is currently in use, the smallest benefit, conditional on

its use, can result in specialization in the targeted sector.


4     Value Added ROOs

The analysis is also relevant for value based restrictions. However, with value

based restrictions, the ROOs cause a form of an externality that can create

multiple equilibria and limit the use of the dual approach used so far. With

the value added restriction in eﬀect, how can restricted cost functions not be

concave? The set of inputs that both make a unit of output and meet the

ROO in this case depends on factor prices. As a result, one cannot make the

usual argument that choices available to a firm are unaﬀected by prices, and

as a result, the value function for a minimization problem has to be concave.

In fact, as we will see below, with fixed coeﬃcients costs cannot be concave in

factor prices in the presence of a value based ROO. Consequently, the factor

price frontier need not have the usual shape. Hence, the full use of duality, in

particular the interpretation of the revenue function as the value function of the

dual minimization problem, is not possible. However, the price equal to cost

conditions remain necessary for equilibrium and we can associate equilibrium

with the intersection of the curves as before. Multiple equilibria occur because

the non standard shapes of the price equal to cost curves allow for more than

one intersection of the price equal to cost curves in a way that permits multiple

equilibria to arise.
                                                      wL
    Suppose the restriction is that the value of     wL+rK     ≥ θ. This is equivalent

to k ≤   ω (1−θ)
             θ .   The feasible set is now defined by combinations of K and L
                                                                    ω(1−θ)
that lie above the unit isoquant and below the line k =                θ   .   Thus, the
                                                 ω(1−θ)
constraint is that k should lie below the line      θ     = k(ω, θ). Hence, the shaded

region in Figure 5 is the feasible set. There are two further complications in


                                         21
defining the input choice set. The first is that the feasible set of inputs depends

on ω. However, it is obvious from Figure 5 that if the constraint is binding,

the cost minimizing input coeﬃcients lie on the unit isoquant and just meet

the constraint. Let these input coeﬃcients be denoted by [aL (θ, ω), aK (θ, ω)] ,

which in the above example would be the point B in Figure 5. Note that if the

constraint is binding at a given ω, it must require a lower capital labor ratio

than the unconstrained cost minimizing capital labor ratio, i.e., k(ω, θ) < k(ω)

as depicted in Figure 5.

   Let the cost, assuming that these inputs are used, be denoted by

                        c(w, r, θ) = waL (θ, ω) + raK (θ, ω).

By definition, c(w, r, θ) must strictly exceed c(w, r) whenever the constraint is

strictly binding. Hence, in w, r space, the curve p = c(w, r, θ) must lie below

the curve p = c(w, r) when the constraint is binding and touch it when the

constraint is just binding.

4.1    The Role of Input Substitutability

Where does the constraint bind? This depends on the substitutability between
                                                               ω        θ
inputs. Recall that the constraint can be written as           k   ≥   1−θ .   Start from the

constraint being just binding. Assume the elasticity of substitution between

capital and labor falls short of unity. In this event, a fall in ω results in a
                                        ω
smaller percentage fall in k so that    k   falls, while a rise in ω results in a smaller
                                    ω
percentage increase in k so that    k   rises. Hence, the constraint does not bind

for increases in ω but does bind for decreases in ω. If, on the other hand, the

elasticity of substitution between capital and labor exceeds unity, a fall in ω
                                                    ω
results in a larger percentage fall in k so that    k   rises, while a rise in ω results in
                                              ω
a larger percentage increase in k so that     k   falls. Hence, the constraint binds for

increases in ω but does not bind for decreases in ω, exactly as in the physical

                                            22

ROOs case. If the elasticity of substitution is less than unity, the constraint

binds for low ω, not high!

   The above facts are enough to depict the price equal to cost curves. Instead

of drawing these we will use Figure 1 to illustrate the similarities and diﬀer-

ences. The curve pT = c(w, r, θ) must lie below the curve pT = c(w, r) when

the constraint is binding, touching it at the point when it is just binding. If

the elasticity of substitution exceeds unity, the constraint binds for high ω, as

was the case with the physical content definition of ROOs studied earlier. The

composite price equal to cost curve looks like GHBD in Figure 1, except that

the segment HB is not linear. It is easy to verify that the analysis of the eﬀects

of value based ROOs in this case is similar to that associated with a physical

definition of ROOs and we leave this to the reader.

   If the elasticity of substitution is less than unity, the constraint binds for low

ω. The composite price equal to cost curve looks like EBKF except for BK

not being linear.18 As a result, a ROO at the status quo level is binding in the

FTA, if good 1 is capital intensive, but not, if good 1 is labor intensive, rather

than the other way around. Once this is noted, the eﬀects on factor prices and

the direction of factor flows can be analyzed as usual. Thus the relevant change

in the results is given below.


Proposition 4 Policies which provide an incentive to produce the labor inten-

sive good conditional on meeting a value based requirement on inputs, need not

involve distortions on the input side in the final equilibrium even if they are

binding at the initial equilibrium levels. However, if the good is relatively capi-

tal intensive, distortions on the input side occur even if the requirement is not

strictly binding to begin with.

4.2      Multiple Equilibria

With value based ROOs, multiple equilibria may exist. Consider the case where

there are fixed coeﬃcients in both sectors, the targeted sector is relatively labor

intensive, and the ROO is set to be slightly binding in the initial equilibrium

as depicted in Figure 6. For ω > ω̃, the ROO is not binding and the firm

can obtain the higher price at no extra cost. The ROO is just binding, if ω
                                            ω            θ
equals ω̃. Lower values of ω force          k   below   1−θ   making the constraint binding.

The absence of substitutability makes producers use more L per unit of output

to meet ROO even though it has a zero marginal product. Recall that the
                 wL
constraint is   wL+rK     ≥ θ. When w falls, meeting the ROO exactly, which is the

least cost way of meeting it, involves raising L by the same percentage as the
                                                                                    wL
fall in w so that wL is constant. Consequently, so is the ratio,                   wL+rK .     This

explains the vertical segment CD in Figure 6.                 Once the wage falls below the
   1 8 If the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor equals unity, then ω is a constant
                                                                                      k
and equals the (constant) share of labor in costs relative to that of capital. If this share ratio
                     θ
is identical to 1−θ , the constraint is never binding and if it is not, it is always binding.

point given by C, it is best to ignore the ROO.

   Note that when the ROO is binding, i.e., for low w, a fall in w results in

an equi-proportional increase in L used per unit of output so that unit cost is

constant. When it is not binding, i.e., for high w, it is linear and increasing in

w. This gives a convex composite curve, not a concave one providing an example

of the non concavity of the cost function mentioned earlier.

   Note that the two price equal to cost curves in the presence of the ROO

intersect three times: once at A, then at E, and lastly at B. At A, the wage

rental ratio is high. Thus, the constraint is not binding and there is no cost

to meeting the ROO, only the benefit. All firms in Sector 1 meet the ROO.

Output is given by the factor market clearing conditions

                            aL1 X1 + aL2 X2    = L

                           aK1 X1 + aK2 X2     = K.

At B, the wage rental ratio is low. Thus, the constraint is binding and an

ineﬃcient level of labor needs to be used to meet the ROO. The cost to meeting

                                       25
the ROO exceeds its benefit as the low wage rental ratio requires a considerable

waste of labor to meet the ROO and no firms in Sector 1 meet it. Though,

output at B is the same as that at A as there are fixed input coeﬃcients, trade

patterns diﬀer as there is no deflection: A does not send its production to B

and import its own needs.

   At E, the wage rental ratio is at an in between level so that not much extra

labor needs to be used to meet the ROO. Hence, the cost of meeting the ROO

is less than the benefit and all firms meet the ROOs. However, as more labor

needs to be used in the production of good 1 to meet the ROO the factor market

clearing conditions are given by


                                aL1 (ω C )X1 + aL2 X2     = L

                                    aK1 X1 + aK2 X2       = K


where aL1 (ω C ) > aL1 . Hence the output of good 1 must fall and that of good 2

rise. However, trade deflection occurs and the output of 1 is sent to B.

   In the standard setting with concave costs, even if there were multiple intere-

sections of the price cost curves (as would occur with factor intensity reversals)

the factor price set over which factor payments are minimized would remain a

convex set. As a result, endowments using the dual definition of the revenue

function would pin down factor prices. Here this technique cannot be used as

this factor price set is not convex. All three intersections, A, B and E are pos-

sible equilibria. Factor prices are not pinned down in this setting, and hence,

multiple equilibria occur.19


Proposition 5 With value based ROOs, there can be multiple equilbria as fac-

tor endowments do not pin down factor prices and supplies even in the standard

two good model.
 1 9 Factor   availability does not completely pin down the equilibrium here.


                                               26
    Finally, note that in the above fixed coeﬃcient example, the ROO on the

labor intensive good can be interpreted as trying to raise the cost share of labor.

Note that in all three equilibria, wages weakly rise as does the share of labor in

costs.20 However, this is not the case when the ROO is on the capital intensive

good. Consider a ROO on the capital intensive good set so that it is just

binding at the pre FTA wage rental rate. It is straight-forward to verify that it

is strictly binding in the unique post FTA equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the

wage rental rate falls relative to that under free trade while the share of labor

in costs is unchanged: lower wages are compensated for by the wasteful use of

labor in producing the capital intensive good. However, in the labor intensive

good, labor share falls! Output of the capital intensive good falls and of the

labor intensive one rises. Thus, attempts to make the capital intensive good use

more labor would backfire and reduce wages, overall labor share in income, as

well as its output.


5     Conclusion

This paper provides a simple way of using well understood tools in trade to

better understand “conditional policies” of various kinds. The results suggest

that the form of the ROO, the intensity of the sector it is applied to, and the

extent of input substitutability have important roles to play in determining the

eﬀects of such restrictions. Moreover, that regime switches and non monotonic

behavior are endemic in such settings. For these reasons, such policies may

have unanticipated eﬀects and need to be carefully analyzed before being im-

plemented.

6.1        Making ROOs More Restrictive

The object of this section is to convince the reader that comparative statics in

such models is likely to involve regime switching and non monotonicity as found

in Ju and Krishna (1998) and (2002). To illustrate, we consider the case where

good 1 is capital intensive and country B is large while A is small. Also, we

assume that A is not specializing in either good prior to the FTA. We ask, what

is the eﬀect of more restrictive ROOs on the equilibrium?


Proposition 6 Making ROOs stricter can first raise exports to B and then

reduce them.


    Our apparatus makes this analysis quite simple. Since B is large and A is

small, the equilibrium price after the FTA is pB0   0
                                               1 . k in Figure 7 denotes the

slope of the curve pB0
                    1  = c1 (w, r) at its intersection with p2 = c2 (w, r) at A.

ROOs less restrictive than k0 are not binding in equilibrium. Let k 00 be the

slope of the line anchored at B and tangent to the curve pB0
                                                          1 = c1 (w, r) at L

as depicted in Figure 7. Note that with ROOs more restrictive than k00 , it is

optimal to ignore the possibility of meeting the ROOs and getting lower tariﬀs

since the factor price frontier will not include this possibility. Let the aggregate

capital labor ratio be k A0 and assume that k1A0 > k0 > kA0 > k 00 > k2A0 as

drawn in Figure 7.

    Start from a ROO at k 0 . At this level, or for levels less restrictive than

this, the ROO is clearly not binding in equilibrium.21 When the ROO is set

at k0 , the price equal to cost curve in Sector 1 with the FTA would be DHAJ.

The intersection of the price equal cost curves in the two sectors would occur

at A and the factor price frontier would be DHAI. Given our assumptions,
 2 1 In   fact, it would not be binding at any possible equilibrium values of pB
                                                                               1 .

equilibrium factor prices would lie at A, where factor payments are minimized

subject to the factor price frontier. Country A would not specialize in either

good.22

    With a ROO at k 0 , the FTA raises A’s output due to a normal supply

response to increasing prices. Neither consumer, nor producer surplus in B is

aﬀected by the FTA and as B loses tariﬀ revenues while A gains it, B is made

worse oﬀ. A is better oﬀ as producer prices as well as tariﬀ revenues are higher

while consumer prices are unchanged.

    When the ROO is between k0 and k 00 , the two price equal to cost curves will

intersect somewhere along AB in Figure 7. If the ROO were set at k000 > k A0 ,

the two curves would intersect at T . The factor price frontier would be DCT I.

Factor payments would be minimized along AB at T , both goods would be made

and all the firms in sector 1 would exactly comply with the ROO, i.e., all firms
  2 2 If kA0 > k0 , then equilibrium factor prices would lie at H. Country A would specialize

in good 1 but some firms would meet the ROO and some would not because the slope of the
price equals cost line at H when the ROO is not met is steeper than kA0 . The mix of firms
would be such as to ensure that factor markets cleared.

would be the same ex post as well as ex ante, so we are in the “homogeneous

regime”.

   If k 000 < k A0 , then only good 1 would be made and factor payments would

be minimized at C. When all firms in sector 1 do the same thing, we say the

regime is homogeneous. If k 000 < k A0 , then though country A would specialize

in making good 1, some firms would meet the ROO while others would not.
                                                                                00
This is termed the heterogeneous regime. When the ROO is stricter than k ,

equilibrium factor prices are at B and firms prefer not to invoke the FTA and

the FTA is undone.

   How can non monotonicity in exports to B come about in this setting? Con-

sider what happens when the ROOs are between k A0 and k 0 . In this case both

goods are made and all firms making good 1 meet the ROO. More restrictive

ROOs will raise w and reduce r as equilibrium factor prices move along BA.

However, the capital labor ratios in the two sectors will move in opposite direc-

tions. The capital labor ratio used in Sector 2 will rise due to labor becoming

relatively more expensive, while that in Sector 1 will fall due to the ROO be-

coming more restrictive. Thus, the unit labor requirement in Sector 1 will rise

and the unit capital requirement will fall while the unit labor requirement in

Sector 2 will fall and the unit capital requirement will rise.

   As Sector 2 is labor intensive, the labor market clearing constraint is flatter

than the capital market clearing one in output space.23 If, in addition, there

is relatively little substitutability in inputs in Sector 2, then the unit labor

and capital requirements in Sector 2 will not change much so that the lines

representing factor markets clearing will not shift much where they hit the

vertical axis. However, the labor market clearing line will shift in and the

capital market clearing line will shift out where they hit the horizontal axis. As
 2 3 We   put X2 on the vertical axis and X1 on the horizontal axis.




                                              30
a result, output of good 1 will rise (and with it exports to B as all firms meeting

the ROOs export) and of good 2 will fall when the ROO is made more strict!

   However, when the constraint becomes so strict that only good 1 is made, i.e.,

the ROO is between k A0 and k 00 , we move to another regime. There are two kinds

of firms making good 1, the ones who meet the ROO and use labor intensive

techniques, and the ones who do not and use capital intensive techniques. No

one makes good 2. Equilibrium is along HB. As the ROO gets stricter, we move

down HB, so w/r falls. Firms who meet the ROO use a lower capital labor

ratio because they have to, while firms who choose not to meet the ROO use a

higher capital labor ratio than the firms who meet the ROO. A stricter ROO

will reduce the capital labor ratio of those meeting the ROO as well as reduce

w/r and, hence, reduce the capital labor ratio of those not meeting the ROO.

Since both capital labor ratios are falling, the output of firms meeting the ROO,

the labor intensive ones, must fall and exports to B must fall. In other words,

since both use a lower capital labor ratio, the capital constraint is loosened (the

K constraint shifts out) and the labor constraint is tightened (the L constraint

shifts in) so that there is more output made by firms not meeting the ROO and

less by firms meeting it. Hence, there are fewer exports of good 1 to B from A!

   Once the ROO becomes stricter than k00 , it is ignored and there are no

exports from A to B of good 1. Thus, we can easily get non monotonic behavior

in the supply of good 1 from A to B at a given price as the ROO changes.

   Summarizing the above, when the ROO is weak, it does not bind in equi-

librium, both goods are made and all firms making good 1 choose to meet the

ROO and export to B. Initially, stricter ROOs have no eﬀect. Once the ROOs

become binding at k 0 , stricter ROOs raise w/r and in this regime, exports to B

from A rise. This regime prevails until the ROO hits kA0 . At this point, only

good 1 is made and all firms meet the ROO. Further restrictiveness of the ROO


                                        31
results in a lower ω, more firms not meeting the ROO, and exports to B falling,

though only good 1 is made. Once the ROO passes k 00 , there is another change

in regime: both goods are made and the FTA itself is undone as firms choose

to ignore its existence!

6.2    Domestic Intermediate Use

Consider policies that are conditional on the use of a domestic intermediate.

This application is useful both because the model is slightly diﬀerent technically

from the phyical requirement studied above and because it provides an addi-

tional message: unlike price based policies (like tariﬀs and subsidies), where the

eﬀects of polices are continuous, conditional policies that are very “small” can

have large eﬀects. Hence, special care should be taken when such polices are

used. An example is provided below.

   Consider a common form of ROO that requires the use of domestic interme-

diates to obtain origin. For example, under N AF T A, transformation from any

other chapter (2 digit classification level) of the harmonized system to tomato

catsup, chapter 21, confers origin except transformation from tomato paste,

though paste falls in chapter 20. In other words, to get origin, domestic tomato

paste has to be used to obtain origin and be eligible for zero tariﬀs for exports

to the U.S.

   Suppose that production requires the use of an intermediate input, which

is available from the rest of the world at a price of P ∗I . It can also be made

domestically at cost cI (w, r). Note that even if cI (w, r) exceeds P ∗I , firms

making good 1 in A may choose to use the domestic intermediate since it confers

origin and allows them to export duty free to B whose domestic price, pB1
                                                                       1 , may

be higher than that in A, denoted by pA0
                                      1 .

mestic intermediates, their eﬀects can be extremely discontinuous. Even if the

domestic intermediate is currently in use, the smallest benefit, conditional on

its use, can result in specialization in the targeted sector.


   Firms in A choose between meeting the ROO and not. If the firm does not

meet the ROO, it can aﬀord to pay factors along c1 (p∗I , w, r) = pA0
                                                                   1 . If they

choose to meet the ROO, they can aﬀord to pay factors along c1 (cI (w, r), w, r) =

pB1
 1  > pA0
       1 . We assume that the ROO is set at an initially just binding level

so that in the initial equilibrium firms are indiﬀerent between the domestic and

imported intermediate input, i.e., cI (w, r) = p∗I . Since all goods are made in

A to prior to the F T A, it must be that all three price equal to cost curves,

namely, c1 (p∗I , w, r) = pA0   2                   I
                           1 , c (w, r) = p2 , and c (w, r) = p
                                                                ∗I
                                                                   go through the

same point. For simplicity, cI (w, r) = p∗I is not drawn in Figure 8. Hence,

the curve c1 (cI (w, r), w, r) = pA0
                                  1 also goes through the same point. Standard

arguments show that c1 (cI (w, r), w, r) has all the usual properties of a cost

function including concavity.



                                          33
   At any given (w, r) , it is easy to verify that the slope of c1 (cI (w, r), w, r),

called k̂1 , is a convex combination of slopes of c1 (p∗I , w, r), called k1 , and

cI (w, r), called k I .24 As a result, the curve c1 (cI (w, r), w, r) = pA0
                                                                         1  lies be-

tween the curves c1 (p∗I , w, r) = pA0     I          ∗I
                                    1 and c (w, r) = p . Figure 8 is drawn so

k I > k̂1 > k2 > k1 .

   Since firms in A can obtain the higher price prevailing in B, if they meet the

ROO, the curve c1 (cI (w, r), w, r) = pA0               1 I                  B1
                                       1 shifts out to c (c (w, r), w, r) = p1 .

As a result, the composite price equal to cost curve for firms making good 1 is

given by c1 (p∗I , w, r) = pA0                    1 I                  B1
                            1 for low w/r and by c (c (w, r), w, r) = p1 for high

w/r, the dark curve in Figure 8.

   Next, add the price equal to cost curve for good 2. As drawn, good 2 is

more capital intensive than good 1 but less than k̂1 at the initial factor prices.

In this case, the composite price equal to cost curve for good 1 would lie above

that for good 2 everywhere no matter how small the diﬀerence between pA0
                                                                      1 and

pB1
 1 ! Hence, only good 1 would be made by all firms in A. Note that even a

ROO that is just binding prior to the FTA, and where the conditional subsidy

is small, can result in drastic changes in production patterns. Even if the ROO

is set to be non binding prior to the FTA, and no matter how small the tariﬀ

diﬀerences in A and B, the economy will end up specializing in good 1. Other

cases are left to the interested reader.
