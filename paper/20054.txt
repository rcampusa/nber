                                          ABSTRACT

This paper provides experimental evidence on the effect of increased competition on prices and
quality in the retail sector. We randomized the entry of 61 firms into 72 markets serving the
beneficiaries of a conditional cash transfer program in the Dominican Republic. Six months after
the intervention entry into the market led to reductions in prices ranging from 2 to 6 percent and
to a statistically significant improvement in self-reported service quality. Prices dropped more in
areas where the number of entrants was larger. Competition seems to have driven part of the
clientele away from incumbent retailers.

       The Causal Effect of Competition on Prices and Quality:
                      Evidence from a Field Experiment
                      By MATIAS BUSSO AND SEBASTIAN GALIANI

        This paper provides experimental evidence on the effect of increased
        competition on prices and quality in the retail sector. We randomized the entry
        of 61 firms into 72 markets serving the beneficiaries of a conditional cash
        transfer program in the Dominican Republic. Six months after the intervention
        entry into the market led to reductions in prices ranging from 2 to 6 percent
        and to a statistically significant improvement in self-reported service quality.
        Prices dropped more in areas where the number of entrants was larger.
        Competition seems to have driven part of the clientele away from incumbent
        retailers. (JEL I31, I38, D4)

The retail sector accounts for 20 percent of global GDP. In developing countries,
the sector is populated mostly by small independent stores and small wholesalers
that capture almost 60 percent of the sector’s revenue (Bronnenberg and Ellickson
2015). A large body of empirical literature analyzes the effect of competition on
prices and quality in the sector. This literature has focused primarily on market
responses to the entry of modern, large “big box” retailers (see, for instance,
Basker and Noel 2009 and Atkin, Faber, and Gonzalez-Navarro 2018). This paper

contributes to the existing literature by providing experimental evidence on the
effect of competition on prices and quality. We do this by assessing the effect of
the entry of small retail shops rather than large retailers.

The experiment was part of an attempt to improve the operation of a conditional
cash transfer (CCT) program in the Dominican Republic. This program provides
monetary transfers to poor families that can only be used, by means of a debit
card, in grocery stores affiliated with the program. Because entry into this market
was restricted by program design, these stores could potentially wield market
power. Our paper assesses the effect on product prices and quality of a relaxation
of those entry restrictions. At the outset of the CCT program, the Dominican
Republic’s government was grappling with the problem of how to deliver basic
consumption goods to the poor sectors of its population. It had potentially three
alternative strategies for controlling the prices and quality of those goods: directly
selling these goods to the program beneficiaries; outsourcing the provision of
such goods to the private sector and regulating their prices; or outsourcing to the
private sector and ensuring competition in the market. In the end, the last of these
three policy options was chosen by the government. The efficiency considerations
associated with these alternative strategies are often assessed on the basis of
poorly understood tradeoffs. These tradeoffs hinge on three factors: first, on how
effective the government is at providing incentives to public officials relative to
providing incentives to private contractors, which, in turn, depends critically on
whether quality is fully contractible (Hart, Shleifer, and Vishny 1997); second, on
the government’s capacity to directly regulate prices and quality (Laffont 2005);
and third, on how much competition there is when outsourcing contracts
(Banerjee et al. 2018). Our paper contributes to the literature by providing new
evidence that governments can contract out public services and achieve lower




                                           1
prices without sacrificing quality if they can ensure that there is enough
competition among potential providers.

We carried out a randomized control trial in 72 districts of the Dominican
Republic.1 Each district is considered to be a market. In these markets, program
beneficiaries represent a large share of the customers and sales. The intervention
consisted of an exogenous randomized increase in the number of retailers. The
actual implementation of the intervention was the responsibility of the CCT
executing agency and was based on our guidelines. The design allowed anywhere
from zero to three new stores to begin operating in each market. A total of 61 new
grocery stores entered these markets, for a 26 percent increase in the number of
stores in the treated areas. It is important to note that, in our setting, the stores
referred to as “incumbents” are the ones that were already operating in the
program network before the intervention took place; market entry is considered to
have occurred when a store is approved by the CCT executing agency to sell its
products to program beneficiaries. We refer to the retailers who are entering the
program network as “entrants”.

We collected data on both retail stores and households (i.e. consumers) before and
six months after the intervention took place. Our data includes information on
product attributes (units, price, variety, and brand) that allows us to assess
changes in the characteristics of the goods sold by retailers. As is also true of
other papers that have contributed to the literature on this subject (Basker, 2005a;
Hausman and Leibtag 2007; Basker and Noel 2009), we focus on the effect of
competition on a relatively small set of goods. For each of those goods, we used
the reported information on product, brand, variety, and measurement unit to

build barcode-equivalent observations. Based on the retailer and household data,
we built two independent measures of prices that proved to be very closely
correlated. In addition, the surveys included measures of consumers’ self-reported
shopping experiences, which we use to measure quality.

We estimate average treatment effects using the randomization assignment as an
instrument for the potentially endogenous entry of new stores induced by non-
compliance with randomization.

Theoretical models of imperfect competition make various predictions about the
competitive effects of market entry. Firms with market power may exploit their
position to reduce quality, just as they may raise prices (Tirole 1988). In most
models, the entry of new competitors leads to price reductions by putting more
competitive pressure on market incumbents. This is a prediction of standard
imperfect-competition    models,    such     as   differentiated-product   Bertrand
competition and spatial-competition models, as well as of many models with
equilibrium price dispersion (such as that of Reinganum 1979). By contrast, the
effect of competition on quality has been less clear-cut across the various models.
Ultimately, it appears that the effect that competition has on quality depends on
the extent to which consumers perceive and value quality.

We find that entry into the market led to reductions in prices ranging from 2 to 6
percent and to a statistically significant improvement in self-reported service
quality. Since, owing to the increased competition that they faced, stores did not
change the varieties or brands of the goods that they sold, our point estimates do
not change significantly when we restrict the estimation sample to the set of stores
and goods that sold products with the same barcodes before and after treatment.
We also find that prices dropped more in areas where the number of entrants was
larger. Competition seems to have driven part of the clientele away from




                                         3
incumbent retailers, since the entry of new stores increased the probability that
consumers would switch to an entrant retailer.

This paper is closely related to a well-established literature on industrial
organization, marketing, trade, and development that analyzes the effect of
increased competition in the retail sector on prices and quality. Several studies
have looked at the effect of the entry of Wal-Mart into local markets in the United
States on a variety of outcomes, including prices (Basker 2005a; Basker 2007;
Hausman and Leibtag 2007; Basker and Noel 2009), quality (Matsa 2011), sales
(Stone 1995; Singh, Hansen, and Blattberg 2006; Ailawadi et al. 2010),
employment (Basker 2005b; Neumark, Zhang, and Ciccarella 2008; Ellickson and
Grieco 2013), and the entry and exit decisions of competitors (Jia 2008). In the
case of developing countries, there is a smaller body of work on the effect that the
entry of modern retail chains has on prices, quality, productivity, employment,
and welfare in Chile (Lira , Rivero, and Vergara 2007), India (Minten, Reardon,
and    Sutradhar    2010;     Bennett     and    Yin    2014),    Madagascar       (Minten,
Randrianarison, and Swinnen 2009), Mexico (Iacovone et al. 2015; Atkin, Faber,
and Gonzalez-Navarro 2018), Romania (Javorcik and Li 2013), and Uruguay
(Borraz et al. 2014), among others. 2 The paper that comes the closest to our
research is the study by Atkin, Faber, and Gonzalez-Navarro (2018), which
provides a comprehensive analysis of the economic impact of the entry of foreign
chain stores in Mexico. They find that prices charged by incumbent domestic
retailers decreased by approximately 4 percentage points after the entry and that
the foreign stores seem to offer a product mix of higher quality.

2
  The literature also includes studies on the effect of the entry of other hypermarkets and
supermarkets (Courtemanche and Carden 2014; Zimmerman 2012) as well as other developed
countries (Zhu, Singh, and Dukes 2011; Abe and Kawaguchi 2010; Holmes 2011; Gómez-Lobo,
Jiménez, and Perdiguero 2015; Hosken, Olson, and Smith 2017). Other work related to the
economics effects of entry into non-retail markets include Trapani and Oslon (1982), Carlton
(1983), Bresnahan and Reiss (1987 and 1991), Reiss and Spiller (1989), Berry (1992), Goolsbee
and Syverson (2008), and Gaynor and Town (2011).




                                             4
Relative to the existing literature we show that entry of small retailers causes
price effects of similar magnitudes as those observed when entrants are large
retail chains. The existing literature found that objective measures of quality (e.g.,
reduced product shortfalls) improved after entry. Our paper shows that consumers
perceive that quality improves. As in Bresnahan and Reiss (1991) we show that
competition is effective even when there are as many as four to five incumbent
retailers already operating in the market. Methodologically, our paper is, to the
extent of our knowledge, the first one to randomize the entry of firms into the
market.

This paper also relates to a central issue in public finance: the desirability of
contracting public services out to the private sector (Megginson and Netter 2001;
Jensen and Stonecash 2004; Blochliger 2008). Two important factors influence
the effectiveness of contracting-out. First, the ability of governments to write
complete contracts that ensure that providers do not achieve cost reductions by
adjusting quality (Hart, Shleifer, and Vishny 1997). 3 Second, the degree of
competition measured, for instance, by the number of ex-ante bidders (Hong and
Shum 2002; Li and Zheng 2009). Governments around the world have outsourced
the provision of a wide array of services to the private sector including the
operation of prisons in the United States (Hart, Shleifer, and Vishny 1997), the
provision of medical care in the United States (Duggan 2004) and in Guatemala
(Cristia, Evans, and Kim 2015), the supply of local government services ranging
from solid waste collection and vehicle towing and storage to the operation of
daycare centers in the United States (Levin and Tadelis 2010), the maintenance of
public roads in Denmark (Blom-Hansen 2003) and the delivery of in-kind
targeted transfers to the poor in Indonesia (Banerjee et al. 2018). The paper in the

3
  Levin and Tadelis (2010) construct a measure of performance contracting difficulty and find that
local governments in the United States tend to contract out precisely those services for which it is
easier to write and administer performance contracts.

experimental literature on developing countries that comes the closest to our
paper is the study by Banerjee et al. (2018) on the impact of outsourcing service
delivery to the private sector for Indonesia’s largest targeted transfer program. As
in our study, they show that prices were lower only where there was more
competition; which in their setting was achieved by modifying the bidding rules
to encourage more bidders to participate.

Our paper contributes to the public finance literature by presenting experimental
evidence suggesting that governments that choose to outsource to the private
sector the delivery of services, can use competition to achieve lower prices
without scarifying quality. In our setting competition also matters for incidence.
The benefits of social programs that subsidize consumers (via monetary or in-kind
transfers) can potentially leak into the profits of the private providers that are
serving them if the supply side does not operate in a competitive environment.
Our findings indicate that introducing competition, when that is possible, provides
an effective means of avoiding rent capture by suppliers.




                                     I. Setting

Our study exploits the design and implementation of a conditional cash transfer
(CCT) program in the Dominican Republic. CCT programs have been extensively
used since the mid-1990s as one of the main tools for providing social protection
to people in low- and middle-income developing countries. The Dominican
Republic introduced the Solidaridad CCT program in 2005.

The program provides monetary transfers to families living in poverty. Eligibility
is determined on the basis of a quality-of-life score that is used to classify
households into different socioeconomic groups. All households identified as
extremely-to-moderately poor are eligible. In 2005 the program initially reached




                                         6
about 200,000 households. It then underwent two big expansions: one in 2007
(when it reached 460,000 households) and another in 2010 (when its coverage
expanded to 520,000 households). During 2011, the year of our study, the
program had reached a plateau.

This CCT program includes two components. First, a health component provides
households with a transfer of about US$ 19.5 per month. Transfers are contingent
on parents bringing their children who are under five years of age to the
community health center on a regular basis for developmental monitoring and
immunizations. In addition, they are expected to attend workshops that provide
instruction in nutrition and health. The program’s second component focuses on
education. Transfers depend on the composition of the family. Households with
one or two eligible children (aged 6-16) receive US$ 8.4 per month; those with
three children receive US$ 12.5; and those with four or more children receive
US$ 16.7 per month. Transfers are contingent on school enrollment and
attendance.4 The typical household (three children in school age) would receive a
total monthly transfer of US$ 36, which would cover approximately 20 percent of
the basic consumption.5

Households’ monetary transfers are deposited into individual bank accounts.
More importantly, in order to ensure that the transfer is spent on food, the money
cannot be withdrawn from the bank but, instead, can only be spent by using a
debit card6 that works only in a network of program-affiliated retailers most of
which are grocery stores. This network of retailers and its interaction with
program beneficiaries (the stores’ customers) play a central role in this study.
4
  Households can also receive other money transfers that are deposited in their bank accounts, such
as a subsidy for higher education, pensions for the elderly living in extreme poverty, a subsidy to
buy gas and/or a subsidy to pay the electricity bill. These transfers could be used in the same
retailers that are part of our study.
5
  The official value in the basic basket of goods is reflected in the extreme poverty line which at
the time was 43 dollars per capita.
6
  This debit card can be used only by the head of household.




                                                7
There is a standardized procedure for joining the network.7 First, the government
executing agency regularly opens calls for applications in certain districts and, via
a community liaison, distributes application forms and encourages local stores to
apply. Second, interested retailers fill in and submit the application. Third, the
application is reviewed and checked by the executing agency. Inspectors visit the
stores and record information on the applicants’ infrastructure and access to basic
services, including a phone line – a potentially costly item for the stores, but one
that is necessary in order for the debit card or magnetic stripe reader to operate.
Finally, scores are assigned to the applications and stores are allowed to join the
network or not, depending on their score and on the number of affiliated stores
already in the district in question.

Entering the network can be costly for many stores. First, many of these stores
operate informally. The application requires them to provide a tax identification
number and to have a bank account, which increases the (perceived) probability
of being audited. Second, some retailers may be asked to do some upgrading,
which could involve buying a card reader, connecting to a phone line, having a
power generator and satisfying some minimum sanitary conditions.

The retailer’s payoff for participating in the network may be a larger sales volume
and higher profits, if the retailer enjoys some market power. In fact, in 2005, at
the outset of the program, it was unclear to many retailers what the benefits of
participating in the network might be. It was not yet clear how many CCT
program beneficiaries (i.e. these stores’ customers) there would be or how many
nearby competitor retailers would be in the network. As a consequence, only a
few retailers applied for entry in 2005. As a way of making affiliation attractive to
retailers, the authorities decided to limit the number of stores that could join the

7
 The standard process of affiliation and the operation of the retail network are governed by a set
of administrative rules detailed in “Reglamento de Funcionamiento de la Red de Abasto Social”
set by the Social Subsidies Administration (ADESS), the program executing agency.




                                                8
network based on the number of beneficiaries in each district. In many places, this
effectively gave local market power to some retailers. In fact, the executing
agency discovered that some stores had increased their prices and were offering a
more limited variety of products than stores outside the network.8 This implies a
loss of consumer surplus and therefore a potential welfare loss.



                                II. Experimental Design

In response to this situation, the authorities designed a plan for the expansion of
the retail network so that to encourage competition and thus increase the
effectiveness of the subsidies awarded under the program. We collaborated with
the CCT executing agency to propose a way of expanding the network allowing to
experimentally evaluate the effects of an increase in market competition on goods
prices and service quality.

The intervention consists of an exogenous randomized increase in the number of
retailers associated with the network across districts. The actual implementation
of the experiment was the responsibility of the CCT executing agency based on
our guidelines. In our setting, incumbents are the stores already operating in the
program network before the intervention took place. Market entry means that a
store is approved by the CCT executing agency to sell to program beneficiaries.
These retailers entering the program network are the entrants.

The CCT executing agency identified the geographic areas in which to implement
the expansion with two considerations in mind. First, there needed to be, before
treatment, a relatively strong demand for consumption goods per retailer and,
second, it had to be feasible, at least a priori, to expand the number of stores in the


8

13).




                                             9
district. Relatively high-demand districts were defined as those expected to have
more than 100 program beneficiaries per retailer. In order to increase the
possibilities of expanding the product supply by recruiting new retailers, it was
decided that the districts should be located in municipalities with a population of
over 15,000 in which at least 30 percent of the population was urban. In addition,
they had to have at least one non-affiliated retailer that would be interested in
joining the network. Ultimately, 72 districts in 17 municipalities were included in
the experiment. These districts were used to provide the framework for
randomization.

The intervention was implemented in three stages. First, before randomization,
between December 2010 and May of 2011, the CCT executing agency collected
in the identified areas applications from retailers that wanted to become part of
the network. Each one of the 72 districts was built up starting from a targeted
neighborhood that was in an area in which the executing agency was particularly
interested in expanding the retail network. The initial goal was to have at least
three candidates for entry in each neighborhood. In those cases in which the
search for potential entrants yielded few candidates, the executing agency
expanded the search area to include nearby areas (which we will refer to as “non-
targeted neighborhoods”). The search for candidates was undertaken in all the
neighborhoods covered by the study. Non-targeted neighborhoods were adjacent
to targeted areas and were also places in which, according to administrative data,
program beneficiaries went to do their shopping. Given the way in which they
were defined, these districts are akin to local markets.

Each district was then assigned a random number in the set {0, 1, 2, 3}. This
defined the number of potential new entrant retailers that the executing agency
would try to recruit. Panel A of Table 1 describes the research sample. Before
treatment, there were some 341 retailers operating in the network within these 72




                                         10
districts. These 72 districts were formed by 72 targeted neighborhoods and 25
adjacent non-targeted neighborhoods. Under full compliance, the design was such
that a total of 99 new retailers would enter the network, which would represent an
intended increase of 29 percent in the number of stores. A total of 21 districts
were randomized to receive no entry of retailers (non-intention-to-treat districts),
while 51 districts were randomized {1, 2, or 3} for retailers to enter the network
(intention-to-treat districts).

                                        –Table 1 here–

The actual affiliation into the network was carried out in May-June 2011 by the
executing agency using a standardized procedure. Actual affiliation, however,
differed from the intended/randomized affiliation. Panel B of Table 1 describes
the distribution of districts by randomized and actual entry. A total of 61 retailers
entered the network in these districts, thereby increasing the number of retailers
operating in these markets by 26 percent in the treated areas. In 38 districts (53
percent) there was perfect compliance with randomization. 9 In 28 districts (39
percent) fewer retailers than intended by randomization actually entered the
network. This happened because, during visits to the stores and store audits done
by the executing agency, some of the applicants were determined to not satisfy the
eligibility criteria to be part of the network. 10 In 6 districts (8 percent), the
executing agency incorporated into the network more retailers than our
randomization allowed for. This was a failure on the part of the CCT executing
agency to follow the intervention protocol that was discovered when performing
an independent audit of compliance.


9
   In those cases in which the number of applicants was larger than the number assigned by
randomization, the entrants were selected randomly from among the eligible stores.
10
    In other words, it was not the case that firms defied randomization. Several firms applied and
wanted to become part of the network of retailers serving the CCT beneficiaries but were deemed
ineligible by the executing agency.




                                               11
                             III. Empirical Strategy

In a context of perfect compliance random assignment would guarantee no
selection into treatment status, making the identification of the average treatment
effects straightforward by simply comparing mean outcomes of treated and
control districts. In a context with some noncompliance random assignment can
be still be exploited using an instrumental variable approach.

In order to gain statistical power we base our analysis on a parsimonious model in
which we pool all the treatments into a single-treatment categorical dummy
variable that captures whether the district was randomized to receive one or more
new stores, 𝑍𝑆 . Although we had almost 50 percent noncompliance in the
intensive margin of entry, compliance improves when considering the extensive
margin (i.e., whether there is at least one entrant into the market). Table 1 shows
that in 51 districts (70 percent) we had entry in places randomized to entry and we
observed no-entry in places randomized to no-entry. On the other hand, 21 of the
districts (30 percent) were randomized to entry but actually observed no entry
(noncompliance). Ceteris paribus, compliance was in fact better in places where
we randomized fewer stores to entry. This is consistent with the idea that rents
largely dissipate quickly as the number of competitors in the market rises
(Bresnahan and Reis (1991)).

Thus, in our main specifications, we estimate the following equation:

(1)                             𝑌𝑖𝑠 = 𝛼 + 𝛾𝑍𝑆 + 𝛽𝑋𝑖𝑠 + 𝜀𝑖𝑠

where i could be a store or a consumer (depending on the outcome) located in
district s. 𝑌𝑖𝑠 represents any of the outcomes under study observed after treatment.
The parameter 𝛾 captures the intention-to-treat effect of increased levels of




                                        12
competition on the outcome under consideration.11 𝑋𝑖𝑠 is a vector of pre-treatment
characteristics. As is common practice in the literature, this vector includes the
pre-treatment value of 𝑌𝑖𝑠 . 12 𝜀𝑖𝑠 is the error term, which is assumed to be
independent across districts but is allowed to display flexible correlations within
districts.

Naturally, we are interested in the actual causal effect of increased competition on
prices and quality. 13 Thus, we also estimate the following equation using two-
stage least squares (2SLS):

(2)                                    𝑌𝑖𝑠 = 𝛼 + 𝛾𝑇𝑆 + 𝛽𝑋𝑖𝑠 + 𝜀𝑖𝑠

where 𝑇𝑆 is a dummy variable that captures actual observed entry into the market.
We instrument 𝑇𝑆 with 𝑍𝑆 . In all specifications, standard errors clustered at the
district level.



                                            IV. Data

We collected retailer and household data before treatment in April and May 2011
(baseline) and after treatment in December 2011, six months after the intervention
was completed (endline). We also obtained administrative information from the
executing agency with the list of establishments operating in the network of

11
   Some of the variables under study are limited dependent variables (LDVs). The problem of
causal inference with LDVs is not fundamentally different from the problem of causal inference
with continuous outcomes. If there are no covariates or the covariates are sparse and discrete,
linear models (and associated estimation techniques such as 2SLS) are no less appropriate for
LDVs than they are for other types of dependent variables.
12
   Control variables also include the following pre-treatment variables: number of incumbent
retailers and number of beneficiaries at baseline in the district, province fixed effects, percent of
beneficiaries over population, average household income in the district, percent of population with
primary complete and secondary complete, an indicator variable equal to one if the district is
urban.
13
   We do not expect general equilibrium effects to result from this experiment, given that the
intervention did not manipulate the transfers to poor households. Moreover, the number of markets
involved in the intervention was very small relative to the whole country.




                                                13
retailers. We consider three samples: the sample of retailers (both incumbents and
entrants in targeted and non-targeted neighborhoods) located in the entire
randomization sample of 72 districts; the sample of all retailers and consumers
located in targeted neighborhoods within these districts; and the sample of
incumbent retailers or consumers that patronize those retailers in targeted
neighborhoods.

The survey of retailers included the majority of incumbent retailers in the targeted
neighborhoods (95 percent) and a large share of incumbent retailers in the non-
targeted neighborhoods (65 percent). It also covered all entrant retailers and, for
budgetary restrictions, a very limited number of retailers operating outside the
network or outside the districts under analysis.14 The survey of beneficiaries was
designed based on a sampling frame that included all beneficiaries in the 72
targeted neighborhoods. The survey did not collect information on beneficiaries
located in non-targeted neighborhoods, however. Its sample included about 30
households per neighborhood; these households were drawn randomly from the
sampling frame.15

The retailer questionnaire was designed to collect very detailed information on
prices and on the products sold by the retailers–our main outcomes of interest. We
focused on products that are frequently sold and widely available. We collected
information on 15 product categories: bread, rice, pasta, cooking oil, sugar, flour,
powdered milk, onions, eggs, beans, cod, canned sardines, chicken, salami and
chocolate. According to Social Protection Expenditure Survey, a nationally
representative household expenditure survey collected in 2010, these 15 goods



14
   Appendix Table A1 describes the sample sizes associated with each of these three samples both
at baseline and at endline.
15
   The final sample has a mean and a median size of 30 households per district; the smallest
district has 24 households and the largest 60.




                                              14
represent 85 percent of all non-perishable food products and 60 percent of all food
products bought by an average household.16

For each one of these 15 products, we pre-specified the unit of measurement and
then asked for information on the price, variety, and brand of the cheapest
available option at the store.17 Surveyors were instructed to ask respondents about
the price usually paid by customers using the CCT debit card for the specific
product-variety-brand combination. These price quotes are likely to be a mixture
of posted prices and prices that arose after some bargaining between customers
and retailers took place.

The household questionnaire was to be answered by the person in possession of
the debit card and therefore the one who did the shopping for the household. The
questionnaire included questions on consumer behavior including a module on
expenditure in which we asked about total spending, brands, varieties and
quantities of the same 15 items included in the retailer questionnaire.

Price measurement. The main outcome of interest are the prices paid by
consumers as reported in the retailer survey. We will focus on the average price of
the basket of 15 products sold by the retailers. The retail price of the basket is
computed as the average price of items included in the survey. We study two
versions of this basket price. One price measure was computed by weighting each
product by the average proportion of total household expenditure spent on each of
the 15 items. These weights (one for each product and constant across
retailers/households) were computed using the Social Protection Expenditure

16
   Appendix Table A2 shows the share spent on each type of food. Notice that households spend
40 percent of food expenditure corresponds to expenditure on dairy products, fruits, vegetables
and meat products. These products are rarely sold by the retailers included in our study. (These
types of products are typically sold in specialized stores or in street markets.)
17
   We decided to focus on the cheapest alternative for two reasons. First, it was a simple way of
anchoring the survey responses provided by retailers. Second, many of the consumers located in
these areas are program beneficiaries, and the executing agency was interested in assessing the
availability of inexpensive options in these product groups.




                                               15
Survey from 2010.18 A second price measure was obtained by a simple average of
the prices.

In addition, we use the information in the household survey to build an alternative
and independent measure of the average price of the basket. For each item, we
derive the price paid by the consumer from the ratio of the total expenditure on
that item and the total number of units bought. Some households did not report
expenditure for all 15 items. Thus, to avoid a composition effect based on
possible non-random non-responses on prices, we standardize each household
product price by dividing it by the average price of that good as reported by all
households in our sample. In addition, the household survey includes questions
that allow us to match households to retailers. We use this information to measure
the prices in the retail stores that are in our sample more accurately.

Let 𝑃̅𝑗𝑠𝑅 be the average price in district s of product j computed using retailer
information R that considers the cheapest available option for each product.
Similarly, let 𝑃̅𝑗𝑠𝐶 be the average price in district s computed using consumer
information C that considers the goods actually bought by consumers. The
average relative price reported by retailers and consumers in the district (𝑃̅𝑗𝑠𝑅 /𝑃̅𝑗𝑠𝐶 )
is a useful statistic for assessing how close these two measures are. We find that
the average relative price for all products and districts is 0.99 and the correlation
between 𝑃̅𝑗𝑠𝑅 and 𝑃̅𝑗𝑠𝐶 is 0.96.19

Product identity (barcodes). We use the reported information on product, brand,
variety and measurement unit to build barcode-equivalent observations. For
instance, in the case of the product “cooking oil” one barcode corresponds to olive
oil (variety) produced by Mazola (brand) sold in one-liter bottles (unit). Table 2


18
     The last column of Appendix Table A2 shows the weights.
19
     Appendix Figure 1 plots the density of 𝑃̅𝑗𝑠𝑅 /𝑃̅𝑗𝑠𝐶 and provides some descriptive statistics.




                                                     16
reports some statistics that describe the products in our data. Three facts are worth
noting. First, because the survey asked about the cheapest available barcode for
each product, the number of barcodes in our data is relatively small (331 barcodes
for the 15 products).20 Nine of the 15 products have 15 barcodes or less, five have
less than 35 barcodes and only one product (rice) captures a third of all the
barcodes in the data. As a comparison, Broda and Weinstein (2010) report that the
average product category in the US has more than 14,076 barcodes. Second, the
different barcodes within each product seem to be close substitutes. The
coefficients of variation of the prices of 11 of these 15 products is smaller than
0.13. Third, stores could report prices for different barcodes for the same product
in the baseline and endline surveys. For eleven of the products, only a quarter of
the stores changed the reported barcode. We will report treatment effects of
competition on the probability of changing brands, varieties, or barcodes.

                                        –Table 2 here–

Quality and clients. We are also interested in the quality of the service provided
by the stores. 21 We asked consumers to rate –from 1 (very bad) to 10
(excellent)— their latest experience shopping in a retailer affiliated with the
network and to provide information on the amount of time they spent during their
visits to the retailer. In addition, we have measures of store cleanliness and
information as to whether or not the store offers home delivery service.

Increased competition can affect not only prices but also the quantities sold. In
order to truly capture this effect, we would have had to have retailers report on the
product quantities that they sold, but this proved to be infeasible in practice. As an
alternative measure, we analyze the number of clients per day, the share of

20
   Some products (onions, chicken, and bread) are typically sold without a brand or a variety.
These “generic” varieties were considered to share the same barcode within product.
21
   We do not focus on aspects of service quality that would require large investments, since these
kinds of changes would probably take longer than six months to complete.




                                               17
program beneficiaries who visit the participating stores and total retail sales. We
also study the probability that beneficiaries may switch to a new entrant retailer
within the network. We define an indicator variable “switch to an entrant retailer”
as the product of two indicator variables. The first is equal to 1 if the client
changed retailers between the time we conducted the baseline and endline surveys
(and zero otherwise). The second is equal to 1 if the retailer where the client
shopped at the time of the endline survey is an entrant retailer (and zero
otherwise).

Throughout this paper we also use a set of district-, consumer-, and retailer-level
measures as control variables. For instance, we use administrative information,
disaggregated by district, on the total number of beneficiaries and the number of
retailers operating in the CCT network at baseline.22



                                          V. Results

Market description. Table 3 presents some descriptive statistics on both customers
and retailers in the areas under study. Recall that the 72 districts are in 17
municipalities These districts are relatively far from one another by construction.
Many of them are in different municipalities while others, located in the same
municipality, are on average 2.8 miles apart from each other.23,24

In these districts retailers are small, owner-run “mom-and-pop” shops. In
incumbent stores, program beneficiaries can use the CCT transfer money to




22
   For a full description of all the outcome and control variables, see Appendix Table A3.
23
   In each district, we computed the centroid of all retailers as an approximation to the relevant
economic centroid of the district.
24
   Given that in our setting most people walk to the retailers, it would take more than 40 minutes
for a person in one district to shop in another district within the same city.




                                               18
purchase only food products (of any brand or variety).25 Typically, these are non-
perishable food products and only a very limited number of fresh products (fruits,
vegetables or dairy products). People who shop in the areas under study are poor,
with low levels of schooling, and earnings equivalent to slightly more than one
quarter of the country’s per capita GDP. As is common in many Latin American
countries, residential segregation is prevalent in the Dominican Republic, with
poor households clustered in different areas than middle- and high-income
households (Bouillon 2012). Thus, the markets under analysis are segmented by
income.

                                         –Table 3 here–

CCT beneficiaries represent a large share of the market for these retailers. Using
information on sales, on the number of beneficiaries in the areas under study and
on the program transfers, we estimate that about 56 percent of these retailers’
sales are financed directly by the CCT transfers. However, when program
beneficiaries shop in these stores, they buy products both with the CCT debit card
and with cash. Because they typically shop in only one store on any given day,
since the transaction costs of going to more than one shop are high, a store’s
membership in the CCT retail network provides it with some measure of market
power. Using information on food expenditure, and assuming that all spending on
groceries is done within the district where the members of the household live, we
estimate that as much as 96 percent of an incumbent’s sales could potentially
come from program beneficiaries.26 The importance of program beneficiaries for

25
   The CCT executing agency listed a set of products that cannot be sold to beneficiaries using the
debit card (e.g., alcohol). The CCT program regulations also explicitly prohibit fictitious
transactions in exchange for cash.
26
   From administrative data, we know that: the average household receives a monthly transfer of
36 dollars, there are on average 630 beneficiaries and 4.6 incumbent retailers in each district. From
the retailer survey, we know that the average sales is 8850 dollars. Thus, ((36 x
630)/4.6)/8850=0.56. On average, these households spend about 62 dollars on perishable foods.
Thus, ((62 x 630)/4.6)/8850=0.96




                                                19
these retailers is also confirmed by self-reported measures: 96 percent of retailers
located in the areas under study and currently in the network (incumbents) claim
that being affiliated with the CCT program has increased their sales.

The data suggests that there is room for local market power. On average there are
about 4.6 incumbent retailers operating in the 72 districts under study and serving
an average of about 630 beneficiaries. The average distance between pairs of
retailers in these districts is 1.3 miles in a context in which program beneficiaries’
mobility is limited: only 15 percent of them own a car or a motorcycle and 95
percent of them shop only in a retailer in the program network located within 10
blocks of their house (roughly half a mile). Beneficiaries usually shop in just one
store. Retailers can therefore potentially wield local market power.

In the smaller shops, items are placed on shelves located behind the counter
while, in the larger establishments, items are on shelves that can be browsed by
the customer. The prices of the different items are not always in plain view. Only
about 41 percent of retailers have prices posted where the customer can see them.
Although we do not have direct evidence of it, this setup seems to provide an
opportunity for third-degree price discrimination, since, because retailers know
that certain customers are CCT beneficiaries who will be paying with a debit card,
the retailers could charge them a different price. In fact, only 44 percent of
retailers stated that they never bargain over prices with their customers.27

Despite the beneficiary population’s low degree of mobility, the market could be
much more competitive if the government’s entry restrictions were not in place.
Almost 95 percent of customers could identify a non-affiliated store within a 10-
block radius from their house. These potential entrant stores are very similar to
the incumbent stores and have entered freely into the non-CCT market, which is a

27
   Unfortunately, we lack information to empirically test the existence of third-degree price
discrimination which would require price data for beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries




                                             20
more competitive environment. In fact, in our experiment entrants are similar to
incumbents they sell products of similar brands and varieties at similar prices. The
stores’ characteristics are also similar.28

Internal validity.      Figure 1 shows pre-treatment sample means of relevant
outcomes and covariates and plots the p-values of t-tests of the differences in
these means between non-intention-to-treat and intention-to-treat groups. Overall
these differences are small and not statistically significant. We find one
statistically significant difference at conventional levels out of 25 variables tested.
The statistically unbalanced variable is the number of employees, with retailers in
the intention-to-treat group having about 0.5 employees more than the average
retailer in the non-intention-to-treat group. Importantly, the share of districts with
non-targeted neighborhoods, the share of incumbent retailers, the number of
beneficiaries, the price of the basket of goods, and our measure of service quality
are all statistically similar in the intention-to-treat and non-intention-to-treat
groups.

                                       –Figure 1 here–

Effects on product availability. 29 Competition could in principle change the
characteristics of the goods sold by retailers (which in the data would translate
into changes in brands or varieties) by inducing them to switch to different
brand/varieties. Table 4 shows the treatment effects estimated using equations (1)
and (2). Column 1 shows the number of observations used in the estimation and
Column 2 shows the number of clusters (districts) where those observations were
located.30 Columns 3 and 4 show intention-to-treat estimates in which the main


28
   See Appendix Table A4.
29
   In Appendix Table A5 we provide means and standard deviations of all outcomes analyzed in
this and the next subsections.
30
   There is some variation in the number of districts/clusters across samples. Two districts only
have incumbent retailers located in non-targeted neighborhoods. Therefore, the sample of




                                               21
independent variable is a dummy for randomized entry (i.e., 1 (Randomized
entry>0)). Each model in those columns includes a different set of control
variables. 31 Columns 5 and 6 show instrumental variable results in which the
dummy for observed entry (i.e., 1 (Observed entry>0)) was instrumented using
the randomized entry dummy. In each model we report point estimates, clustered
standard errors at the district level in parenthesis and, for the case of IV.32

                                         –Table 4 here–

We computed the share of products that changed brand, variety, and barcodes for
each store. We find that in general the changes were not different in treated and
control areas. Moreover, we ranked the barcodes according to its average pre-
treatment price and find no evidence that stores switched to initially cheaper
barcodes as a result of the increased competition in their districts.

Effects on Prices. In Table 5, we present the effect of entry on log prices. Panel A
shows retail prices, while Panel B shows prices as measured using household
information. Across all samples and models, we find sizable, statistically
significant decreases in prices. Since there is noncompliance, the estimates of the
average causal effects are always larger than the estimates of the intention-to-treat
effects. The estimators are larger for the sample of the targeted neighborhoods
than they are for the sample as a whole. Considering the simplest IV it is
estimated that entry into the network decreases prices by 5.2 to 6.0 percent in the
case of the sample of incumbent stores in the targeted neighborhoods. Intention-

incumbent retailers in targeted neighborhoods has 70 clusters. Also, there is one district in which
there are no consumers who buy products in an incumbent retailer, so in that sample we have 71
clusters.
31
   There is very little missing data, as there is complete information for all variables used in all
columns for 97 percent of the sample of retailers.
32
   The correlation between randomized and observed entry is 0.48. In all first stage regressions the
coefficient on the instrument is positive and is statistically significant at 5 percent (or 1 percent
depending on the specification). In all cases the first stage F statistic ranges from 8 to 30
depending on the model. For reasons of space we do not show first stage estimates. They are
available from the authors upon request.




                                                22
to-treat yields smaller estimates: the decrease in prices is 1.9 to 2.5 percent, with
the estimates not varying much across specifications. This is consistent with
having better compliance in locations where larger price drops were observed (for
instance, because they were originally less competitive).33 The second panel of
Table 5 shows estimates of competition on prices using price measures derived
from the consumer data. The estimated effects are similar to those estimated using
retailer-level data. This is not surprising, since these two price measures are
similar and it is reassuring, because these measures are independent of one
another.

                                          –Table 5 here–

Table 6 reports some alternative specifications that show that results on prices are
robust. Column 1 shows the estimates reported in column 6 of Table 5. Column 2
shows that the estimates are similar when average prices are constructed using
simple (i.e., unweighted) averages. We do not have any a priori preference for
using one measure (weighted) over the other (unweighted). The point estimates
are similar across models and samples using both measures. The only difference
is that the results for the weighted average price are slightly more precise
estimates and are easier to be interpreted as the value of a basket of goods
consumed by this population.

                                          –Table 6 here–

Columns 3 and 4 in Table 6 shows results in which we estimate equations (1) and
(2) but the outcome 𝑌𝑗𝑖𝑠 is the log price of product j in retailer/household i in
district s. We include product and product-brand fixed effects in the model. In
other words, rather than estimating the effect on an average price, we pool all the
prices and estimate an average treatment effect over all prices. Point estimates in

33
  It is worth noting that we could not find statistically significant differences between districts that
complied and districts that did not complied with treatment. See Appendix Table A6




                                                  23
this pooled model are of similar magnitude to those presented in Table 5. We
have also estimated the treatment effects individually for each of the 15 products
under analysis. Overall, the point estimates are negative. Statistical significance
varies across products and, as expected, we have less power to reject the null of
no treatment effect in some equations.34 Columns 4 and 5 restrict the estimation to
those products that did not change barcodes between baseline and endline
surveys. The point estimates are negative and of similar magnitudes as those in
our benchmark specification but the standard errors are larger (since the sample
size is smaller).

In Table 7, we look at the intention-to-treat effect in districts where one store was
randomized for entry and in locations where more than one store was randomized
for entry. The effects are of the same order of magnitude as the ones presented in
Table 5. More importantly, they are larger in districts where the entry shock is
larger (i.e., where more than one store was randomized for entry), although the
results are not precise enough to rule out the possibility that the effects are equal.

                                         –Table 7 here–

Other effects of competition. Entry does appear to have some effect on the quality
of the service provided by retailers in our sample. Table 8 shows the effect on
targeted neighborhoods (results are very similar for the other samples). Panel A
shows some indirect measures of service quality. Most of the results are not
statistically significant although it is possible that we lack statistical power to
detect positive effects. The only robust effect of competition seems to be on how
customers rate their shopping experience, with that rating improving in treated
areas. Panel B shows the effects on clients. The negative effect of market entry on
prices seems to have been fueled by a reduction in the number of shoppers who
went to retail stores in treated areas. These results are very noisy, however. We
34
     The results are shown in Appendix Table A7.




                                                   24
find that entry increased the probability that shoppers would switch to an entrant
retailer and that the percentage of customers who are CCT beneficiaries declined.
It was not necessary for customers to switch stores in order for prices to drop due
to increased competition. In fact, the variable “switch to an entrant retailer” could
have been zero for a majority of consumers in treated districts if, after the entry of
new retailers, very few consumers changed the store in which they did their
shopping or switched to another incumbent store (if one was available). In that
situation, prices could still have declined if, for instance, entrant retailers lowered
their prices and incumbents copied them. The fact that we find that consumers
actually switched to an entrant retailer suggests that part of the price drop was
probably a response on the part of incumbent stores to the loss of part of their
clientele.

                                   –Table 8 here–

Finally, panel C presents treatment effects of entry on prices for two samples of
retailers: those that are not in the CCT market and those that are located in non-
experimental neighborhoods. We found no treatment effect for either of these two
samples. In the case of the non-CCT retailers, this was to be expected because
they operate in a different (competitive) market. However, we take these results
with a grain of salt: notice that the number of districts covered by these samples is
smaller than the ones involved in the experiment, and the size of the sample of
retailers is also small.



                                   VI. Conclusion

We conducted a randomized field experiment to evaluate the effect of increased
competition on prices and quality in the context of a CCT program in the
Dominican Republic. This program provides monetary transfers to poor families




                                          25
which can be spent only by using a debit card that is not accepted anywhere
except in a network of grocery stores that are affiliated with the program. The
CCT executing agency was concerned that the grocery stores in the network
might be capturing rents from these transfers. We proposed an expansion of the
network as a possible solution for this potential problem.

Randomization was conducted at the district level. In all, 72 districts were
randomized to {0, 1, 2, 3} new entrant retailers. Actual affiliation was subject to
noncompliance, which was greater in the districts that were randomized to a large
number of new entrant grocery stores. In order to gain statistical power, we based
our analysis on a parsimonious model in which we considered only the extensive
margin of entry. Thus, we studied the effect of market entry on prices and quality.
We found a significant and very robust reduction in prices that ranges from two to
six percent as a result of the increase in competition and some evidence that
quality of the service provided to consumers improved six months after the
intervention. We find these results to be economically large. They are in line with
those find in the literature in other developing countries. For instance, Atkin,
Faber, and Gonzalez-Navarro (2018) find that in the case of Mexico, prices of
incumbent domestic retailers decreased approximately 4 percent twelve quarters
after the entry of a global retail chain into the market.

Note: Each entry shows an estimate of the impact of an increase in competition on the weighted and unweighted price index and the log of individual product prices after
treatment. Columns [1] through [4] report the estimations over the whole sample of products, while columns [5] through [8] report the results over the sample of products that
did not change barcode. Baseline controls include the log(price) index, the baseline number of retailers, the baseline percentile rank of price of the product in control areas and
the baseline number of beneficiaries. District controls include: province fixed effects, the average education and income of households in the district and 1 (if neighborhood is
urban). Additional fixed effects in columns [3] and [7] include the interaction between product and brand, and columns [4] and [8] control for the triple interaction of product,
brand and variety. Standard errors clustered at the district level are reported in brackets.

                         Appendix I: Price Variable Construction

                                       A. Data Sources

Price data were obtained from the responses to three questions (sources). First, the retail
survey questionnaire included a question (Question Q1) about 15 products. Retailers were
asked about the brand and price of the cheapest brand that is normally available at their
stores. This question pre-specified the unit of measurement. Second, in Question Q2,
retailers were asked to identify the three products that they sell the most of to program
beneficiaries and to provide information about the price, brand, variety and unit of
measurement for three different versions of these three products. Finally, in Question Q3,
consumers were asked about their weekly expenditure and the physical amount that they
bought of each of the 15 products in the last 7 days.

                               B. Coding Varieties and Brands

In order to code all possible combinations of brand-variety (barcodes) for each product, we
pooled all three sources of information. A unique code was assigned to each combination of
brand-variety for each of the 15 products. Q1 and Q3 were intended to only deal with
brands. In some instances, however, survey respondents mixed brands with varieties. For
some products, information about the variety could be recovered from the question even
when the respondent did not identify the variety, since in some cases the brand is associated
with a particular variety. This imputation of missing information was based on data
obtained from the webpages for each product. Two issues warrant discussion. First, the
variety of the products is often not associated with a single characteristic. This is more
frequently the case for some products than for others. For instance, the variety of eggs

could differ because of their size, yolk quality, etc. So in those cases, varieties were
grouped together even though the relevant attributes differ. Second, neither retailers nor
consumers provided information about varieties of bread. The previous table showed the
complete list of brands and varieties for each product in our sample.

                                       C. Measures

Average Price (retailers). For each retailer i at time t (t=baseline, endline), we computed
the average over all 15 products (k):
                                             15

                                     𝑃𝑖𝑡 = ∑ 𝑊𝑘 ∗ 𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑘
                                            𝑘=1
In the case of the weighted average price, Wk is the share of expenditure on product k (see
below). In the case of the unweighted average price, Wk=1/15 for all k.

Average Price (consumer). For each consumer i at time t (t=baseline, endline), we
computed the average (relative) price over all 15 products (k):
                                            𝐾
                                                      𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑘
                                    𝑃𝑖𝑡 = ∑ 𝑊𝑘 ∗ [         ]
                                                      ̅̅̅̅
                                                      𝑃 𝑘𝑡
                                           𝑘=1

In the case of the weighted average price, Wk is the share of expenditure on product k (see
below). In the case of the unweighted average price, Wk=1/K for all k. Many consumers did
not report spending for all 15 products. To avoid differences in average prices due to
bundle composition, we standardized the price of each product using its average price in the
sample.

                                       D. Weights

The weights 𝑊𝑘 for the 15 products were created using the household survey. The weights
represent the share of monthly expenditure on product k made by all the surveyed
households at baseline. In all measures, the weights add up to 1.

The weights 𝑊𝑘 were compared with the results of a nationally representative survey of
program beneficiaries, the Evaluation Survey of Social Protection (EEPS), which was
conducted in 2010/2011. In this survey, households were queried about their expenditure on
a broader set of products. Appendix Table A1 indicates the results of this comparison. The
first column shows the product and the second column, the sample size. The third column
shows the percentage of households that reported having consumed a given product in the
previous week. The fourth column shows the average share of expenditure on each product.
Panel A gives the corresponding information for the 15 products that were covered in our
survey. Panel B summarizes the information about other non-perishable products that may
                                             ii
be sold by small-scale retailers. Panel C shows the measures for other fresh or perishable
products typically not sold by the retailers in question.

Several facts are worth mentioning here. First, the 15 products included in our survey
account for 60% of total food expenditure. Second, the other products that are sold by the
retailers under analysis represent 12% of total food expenditure. Third, most households
bought these 15 products. Fourth, the weights calculated in our sample are very close to
those observed in the EEPS.

                                                    E. Price Validation

In order to assess the validity of our price measures, we compare price measures obtained
using retailer data with those obtained using beneficiary data (an independent source of
information). For each product and brand in all the districts, we calculated an average price
based on the prices reported by the retailers and by the beneficiaries.

Let 𝑃̅𝑘𝑠
      𝑅
         be the average price in district s of product k computed using retailer information R,
which corresponds to the cheapest available option for each product. Similarly, let 𝑃̅𝑘𝑠   𝐶
                                                                                             be
the average price in district s computed using consumers’ information C which corresponds
to the products actually bought by consumers. The average district relative price (𝑃̅𝑘𝑠 𝑅 ̅𝐶
                                                                                          /𝑃𝑘𝑠 )
is a useful statistic for assessing how close these two measures are. Note that, without
measurement error in the measures of prices, this statistic is bounded from above at 1. The
next figure shows a kernel density estimation of that price ratio. We find that the average
relative price over all products and districts is 0.99.
