Banks, Insider Connections, and Industrialization in New England: Evidence from the Panic
of 1873

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper studies the role of bank affiliations in mitigating frictions related to asymmetric
information. The analysis focuses on Massachusetts, and tests whether firms with bank directors
on their boards fared better following the Panic of 1873, which did not directly impact the state’s
commercial banks, but produced a prolonged economic slump. Around 59 percent of all non-
financial corporations in the state had a bank director on their board in 1872. These firms
survived the recession of the 1870s at higher rates, grew faster and experienced less of a
deterioration in their credit ratings. Consistent with banker-directors helping to resolve problems
related to asymmetric information, these effects were strongest among young firms.
Counterfactual estimates suggest that in the absence of bank affiliations, the total assets of the
non-financial corporations in Massachusetts that existed in 1872 would have been 35 percent
lower in the wake of the recession. These results suggest an important role for the banking sector
in New England’s industrialization, namely that affiliations with commercial banks helped
nonfinancial corporations maintain access to external finance during economic downturns.

1. Introduction

        It is now well established theoretically and empirically that financial panics can cause

substantial declines in investment and employment. Due to the frictions resulting from asymmetric

information, a contraction in the supply of bank credit, or a deterioration in the financial condition of

borrowers—the bank lending and balance sheet channels—can disrupt firms’ access to finance for

extended periods of time. Less well understood, however, are the mechanisms by which firms may

be able to moderate the problems resulting from asymmetric information. Larger and older firms

have been shown to fare better following crises, but less is known about other firm characteristics or

policies that may enable them to maintain access to finance in the years following a panic.

        The financial history of the United States offers an opportunity to investigate this issue.

Economic historians have argued that the commercial banks of nineteenth-century New England,

which led American industrialization, functioned like investment clubs, lending to insiders and

channeling capital to the corporations founded by their directors (Lamoreaux 1986; 1994). The

personal connections thus established between the banks and nonfinancial corporations of the region

likely helped firms mitigate the frictions resulting from asymmetric information. In the context of a

financial panic, the firms that were affiliated with commercial banks should have had better access to

finance, so long as the panic did not originate among the region’s commercial banks.

        This paper analyzes the effects of the Panic of 1873 and the subsequent macroeconomic

slump on the nonfinancial corporations of Massachusetts. Unique among all American states,

Massachusetts imposed extremely strict disclosure requirements on its nonfinancial corporations in

the late nineteenth century, which make it possible to observe affiliations with commercial banks, as

well as annual accounting information. Using this data, I document the director interlocks between

the state’s corporations and commercial banks, and investigate whether the firms that were affiliated

with banks prior to the crisis fared better over subsequent years. The Panic of 1873 originated among

railroad financiers in New York and was initially concentrated among private banks and brokerage

houses (Wicker 2000). It did not directly impact New England’s commercial banks, which were in

                                                                                                            1
sound condition and were unconnected to the events that led to its outbreak.      If bank-firm affiliations

helped moderate the problems resulting from asymmetric information, then firms with a commercial

bank director on their board should have had better access to finance in the years following the panic.

        The results indicate that corporations with bank affiliations did indeed suffer less in the wake

of the crisis. Around 59% of all nonfinancial corporations in Massachusetts had a bank director on

their board in 1872. These firms survived the recession of the 1870s at higher rates, and among the

surviving firms, those with bank affiliations grew at faster rates and saw their credit ratings

deteriorate to a lesser extent. Consistent with banker-directors helping to resolve problems related to

asymmetric information, the estimated effects were strongest among younger firms, and those with

lower shares of fixed assets on their balance sheets. The effects were also quantitatively significant:

counterfactual estimates suggest that in the absence of bank affiliations, the total assets of all non-

financial corporations in Massachusetts that existed in 1872 would have been 35 percent lower in

1881.

        The presence of a bank director on a corporation’s board could potentially benefit the firm

through several different channels. Nineteenth century bank directors held discretion over the

allocation of credit from their institution, so a directorship with a nonfinancial corporation should

have facilitated greater access to credit by the corporation.1 But an affiliation with a bank may also

have functioned as a signal of the quality of the corporation, and a banker-director may also have

contributed financial expertise to its management. In order to investigate the importance of credit

relationships in the results, I study the effects of the presence of a bank cashier on firms’ boards.

Nineteenth century cashiers were the public faces of their banks, and oversaw their operations and

maintained their accounts. But as bank cashiers normally could not influence the flow of credit the

way bank directors could, their presence on a firm’s board likely added financial expertise and

  On the decision making procedures by which nineteenth century American banks approved or declined loan
requests, see Lamoreaux (1994), Bodenhorn (2003a), and Meissner (2005). Gibbons (1859) presents a first-
hand account.

                                                                                                           2
signaled quality without directly facilitating greater access to credit. Their presence on firms’ boards

produced no discernable effect.

        A source of concern regarding the empirical results is that they may reflect the selection of

particular types of firms into affiliations with banks. The empirical analysis controls for time-

invariant unobserved characteristics such as the quality of a firm’s management, but if firms that were

more resilient to a shock were more likely to be affiliated with banks, then this would imply that the

firms without bank affiliations may not constitute an appropriate control group for the firms with

bank affiliations.

        I use several approaches to address this issue. First, I control for a range of firm

characteristics that were likely related to resiliency, such as leverage and size, as well as the average

personal wealth of the directors. Second, I estimate specifications in which I include a direct measure

of the risk the firm would fail, the credit rating of the firm itself. And third, I use inverse propensity

scores to re-weight the treated and control firms so that observable characteristics of both resemble

those of the population. In each case the effect of a bank affiliation remains, although with a

diminished magnitude.

        The findings of this paper contribute to several areas of research. Following the work of

Bernanke (1983), a large and growing literature has estimated the firm-level effects of credit supply

shocks originating in domestic financial panics (Gan, 2007; Amiti and Weinstein, 2011; Chodorow-

Reich 2014; Siemer, forthcoming), crises transmitted internationally (Chava et al., 2011; Schnabl,

2012; Paravisini et al. 2015), the failure of particular institutions (Fernando et al., 2012; Lin and

Paravisini, 2013) or other events (Khwaja and Mian, 2008). Some of this work has focused on

historical financial crises (Graham et al., 2011; Frydman, Hilt and Zhou, 2015; Benmelech et al.,

2017). This paper complements those contributions by analyzing a mechanism that made some firms

better able to withstand the effects of a panic. Most closely related is Babina et al. (2018), which

documents an alternative mechanism by which firms were made more likely to survive the Great

Depression, the degree of connectedness of firms’ boards to other boards. In the analysis that follows

                                                                                                             3
I confirm that the effect they document is also present among 1870s Massachusetts firms. But the

effect of bank affiliations is generally robust to controlling for board connectedness.

        Another literature has investigated the operations of nineteenth-century American banks (for

example, Lamoreaux, 1994; Wright, 1999; Lockard, 2000; Meissner 2005; Bodenhorn 2003a, 2003b,

2007; and Wang 2008). This paper adds to those contributions by documenting the extent of bank-

firm affiliations in 1870s Massachusetts. A closely related strand of the literature has analyzed the

importance of commercial banks for the development of the American economy (Calomiris 1995;

Rousseau and Sylla, 2005). Most recently, Jaremski (2014) has documented that counties with

greater bank entry under the National Banking Acts experienced greater industrialization, and Fulford

(2015) has shown that rural counties just above the population level needed to sustain the presence of

a national bank experienced greater agricultural production (see also Carlson et al., 2018). This

paper advances the literature by analyzing value of relationships between commercial banks and

nonfinancial corporations. The results suggest that a possible mechanism behind the observed

correlations between the development of the banking sector and industrialization could be that

affiliations with banks helped nonfinancial corporations survive economic downturns.

        Another literature has evaluated the effects of bank-firm affiliations in a variety of countries

both historically (Edwards and Ogilvie, 1996; Guinnane, 2002; Maurer and Haber, 2007; Frydman

and Hilt, 2017), and in modern data (Agarwal and Elston, 2001; Gorton and Schmid, 2000; Weinstein

and Yafeh, 1998; and Morck and Nakamura, 1999). This paper complements those works in its

finding that bank affiliations were quite extensive in 1870s New England, and quite valuable during a

crisis. It also presents an interesting contrast with studies of modern American firms, which show

that affiliations with commercial banks are relatively rare (Güner, Malmendier, and Tate, 2008;

Kroszner and Strahan, 2001).

        Finally, the banking and financial crises of America’s financial history are the subject of a

large and growing body of work; overviews of this literature are presented in Calomiris and Gorton

(2000), Wicker (2000), Bordo and Haubrich (2010) and Hanes and Rhode (2013). The Panic of 1873

                                                                                                           4
itself is the focus of Rezneck (1950), Kindleberger (1990), Bordo (1990) , Mixon (2008) and

Benmelech and Bergman (2017). This paper advances the study of the Panic of 1873 by documenting

its effects at the firm level among a large number of nonfinancial corporations.




2. Historical Background

2.1 Banks and Industrialization in New England

         The rise of large-scale manufacturing enterprises in the United States began in New England

with the development of the integrated cotton textile mill in Massachusetts.2 The very first such

enterprise, Francis Lowell and Nathan Appleton’s Boston Manufacturing Company, incorporated

1813, was financed by merchants who had accumulated large fortunes in international trade, and who

drew on their connections with other prominent merchant families to raise capital for their venture.

These men and their associates have been called an “enterprising elite,” and went on to found a

number of other companies that followed the same model but on a much greater scale, channeling the

capital they accumulated in commerce into manufacturing.3

         Many of these entrepreneurs also held directorships with banks. The founders and principal

stockholders of the Boston Manufacturing Company included at least three bank directors, including

two from the Boston Bank, from which the company borrowed regularly.4 This pattern would

continue with the later companies that were founded to emulate the Boston Company in Lowell, often

by many of the same individuals.5 These firms maintained close ties to commercial banks, and

  An ‘integrated’ mill both spun thread from raw cotton and wove it into fabric, using machines driven by water
power (or later, steam power). For a history of the early years of this industry in America, see Ware (1931).
See also McGouldrick (1968) and Handlin and Handlin (1974).
3
  The term “enterprising elite” is due to Dalzell (1987), who tells this history well.
4
  Nathan Appleton and Israel Thorndike, Jr., founders of the Boston Company, were directors of the Boston
Bank. Rosenberg (2011) documents the company’s early borrowing from the bank. Section 1.6 of the
Appendix provides additional sources and evidence.
5
  All of the textile firms of Lowell incorporated prior to 1830 included at least three Boston bank directors on
their boards.

                                                                                                               5
benefitted from those ties. This pattern was followed among the region’s railroads as well, whose

founders and early board members included prominent capitalists who held directorships with banks.6

        Lamoreaux (1994) has argued that over the following decades, the proliferation of

manufacturing enterprises in New England was made possible by close ties between those firms and

the region’s banks. The directors of early New England banks often founded them specifically for the

benefit of the firms they controlled, and channeled capital from the banks to their other enterprises

through insider lending—that is, lending to the directors or to enterprises owned by the directors.

Such transactions were not hidden from the banks’ shareholders, who knew that investing in bank

stock was really investing in a portfolio of loans to the directors and their firms. Close relationships

between nonfinancial firms and banks helped resolve many of the information problems inherent in

financial markets in a relatively early stage of development (see also Livesay and Porter, 1972).

        Although manufacturing firms borrowed primarily from banks to finance their working

capital (Davis, 1966), much of their fixed capital was financed through equity. The shares of some of

these firms saw trading on the Boston Stock Exchange, although the market for industrial shares was

relatively illiquid (Martin, 1886; Atack and Rousseau, 1999). Commercial banks were generally

prohibited from purchasing equity directly, but often provided credit to entrepreneurs—so-called

accommodation loans—that were partly collateralized by shares of stock (Lamoreaux 1986). These

loans were short-term but renewable, and the liquidity they provided to entrepreneurs was likely quite

important.



2.2 The Panic of 1873 and Its Aftermath

        In September of 1873, a panic broke out on Wall Street, plunging financial markets into

turmoil. The New York Stock Exchange closed for 10 days. The subsequent economic contraction


6
  For example, the board of the Boston and Worcester railroad in 1842 included David Henshaw, a director of
the Merchant’s Bank of Boston, and Nathaniel H Emmons, a director of Boston’s Union Bank. (Report of the
Directors of the Boston and Worcester Rail-Road Corporation to the Stockholders… Boston: I.R. Butts, 1842;
Stimpson’s Boston Directory).

                                                                                                              6
produced substantially elevated unemployment, and a long slump (see Rezneck, 1950).7 As

illustrated in Panel (a) of Figure 1, the growth of industrial production fell substantially during the

years 1874-78, with a contraction of nearly -6% in 1875. Among the consequences of the disruption

of financial markets and fall in spending was a rise in bankruptcies. Panel (b) of Figure 1 shows that

the total liabilities of failing businesses in the United States nearly doubled in 1873 and remained

elevated through 1878.

        Following the outbreak of the panic, a number of Massachusetts manufacturing firms moved

to dismiss parts of their workforce and reduce output.8 Over subsequent years a significant slump

continued, and many firms either shut down or came close to shutting down.9 One contemporary

newspaper offered an assessment of the causes of the firms’ poor performance:

        “Most of our manufacturing cities and towns feel the effect of the dullness and
        financial stringency of the times. The Atlantic Mills, Lawrence, have reduced their
        product, and will run on short time for the present; the Blackstone is rumored to have
        decided on a temporary suspension…The Fall River owners are taking steps to
        ensure concert of action in the matter of running cotton mills on shorter time. This is
        considered necessary because of the falling off in the amount of sales and the high
        price of money” (Salem Register, 23 October 1873 [italics added]).

The fall in demand, and the contraction in the supply of available credit, were both seen as

contributing to the problems firms faced. The disruption of New York’s banking markets likely

contributed to the credit stringency, but there was another factor as well. Early in the panic, several

prominent “jobbers”—mercantile firms involved in the distribution of goods—failed suddenly

(Sprague, 1910: 77-80). These failures created significant losses for any manufacturers that had

extended credit to them, and likely disrupted mercantile credit networks. Panel (d) of Figure 1 plots

the rates of profit (measured as return on assets) for large Massachusetts textile manufacturers over

the 1870, and shows a precipitous decline between 1873 and 1876.



7
  The NBER dates the recession from October 1873 to March 1879.
8
  Boston Daily Advertiser, 30 September 1873.
9
  For example, in 1875 the Boston Daily Advertiser noted that “many large manufacturing companies during the
year past have had their profits so largely reduced, or wholly swept away, that they were confronted with the
option of suspension of business…” (7 September).

                                                                                                            7
         Similar problems were faced by railroad firms, then the largest business enterprises in the

United States. The panic followed a period of rapid growth in railway mileage, both nationally and in

Massachusetts, and in fact broke out when Jay Cooke & Co., railroad bankers, closed their doors. The

ensuing years witnessed a wave of railroad bankruptcies, and a rapid decline in railroad investments.10

Although the effects on Massachusetts railroads were not as extreme as those of other regions, the

state’s railroad commissioner noted in 1875 that the downturn “gave a decided check to the work of

railroad construction” in the state.11 As Panel (c) of Figure 1 shows, the profitability of

Massachusetts railroads was depressed throughout the mid-1870s.

         In a financial panic, firms affiliated with financial institutions facing runs can be severely

impacted. But the commercial banks of Massachusetts were conservatively managed and in sound

condition in 1873. They were not directly connected to the events leading up to the panic, and there

were no bank failures in Massachusetts during the crisis. In fact, 21 new banks opened in the state

between 1873 and 1880.12 Nonfinancial corporations with close ties to commercial banks were

unlikely to have been differentially exposed to the financial contraction.

         Instead, the wave of insolvencies created by the downturn likely aggravated adverse selection

problems in credit markets, making an affiliation with a commercial bank particularly valuable. As

Bernanke (1983) and Bernanke and Gertler (1995) note, the problem of distinguishing good

borrowers from bad borrowers becomes much more costly, as, for example, the value of collateral

held by firms becomes more uncertain. If a directorship enabled the bank to gain privileged access to

information about the corporation’s condition, the bank would likely have been more willing to lend

to the firm during a time of greater uncertainty.

12
   The state’s banks did however see a significant decline in their returns on equity and wrote off substantial
losses (Comptroller of the Currency, 1872-1880).

                                                                                                                  8
        Unfortunately, no systematic data on the identities of bank borrowers survives from this era,

making it impossible to obtain direct evidence of this mechanism.13 The narrative account of bank

lending procedures presented in Gibbons (1859) does suggest that in times of stringency, the

privileged position of bank directors in the allocation of credit were quite valuable. And the loan data

from a New York bank presented in Bodenhorn (2003b) suggest that during a credit crunch, banks did

indeed provide greater access to credit to their longstanding customers.


3. Data


        All of the data utilized in the analysis that follows were hand-collected from historical

sources. The Appendix presents comprehensive details on the sources and methods used in the

creation of the dataset, as well as supplemental information on other elements of the paper. Here, I

present a brief overview.

        Beginning in 1870, the state of Massachusetts required most nonfinancial business

corporations to submit an annual certificate of condition to the state. Microfilm copies of the original

certificates were found within the collection of the Massachusetts Archives. Unique among all

American states, the certificates of condition of Massachusetts corporations open a new window into

the financing and management of mid-nineteenth century corporations. The forms required

disclosure of the names of the officers and directors, all of the stockholders and the number of shares

held by each, and a rudimentary balance sheet. However, as the required disclosures were primarily

intended to protect the interests of the firms’ creditors and facilitate the collection of property taxes,

the form did not solicit any information about revenues, profits or dividends.

        All of this information was collected from all of the certificates filed for the year 1872. The

accounting data presented on the forms were published annually in the Report of the Tax


13
  Records of the bank loans of a handful of Massachusetts corporations survive from the early 1870s, and
confirm that corporations at least borrowed from the commercial banks represented on their boards—see the
Appendix. But this archival evidence is not nearly extensive enough to investigate whether bank-affiliated
borrowers actually enjoyed a differential advantage in access to credit during the downturn.

                                                                                                             9
Commissioner, and the accounting data for prior and subsequent years was collected from those

published volumes. Railroads and streetcar companies were regulated by different statutes, which

required much more detailed disclosures, including an annual income statement, although they did not

include a list of shareholders. Data for all independently operating railroads and streetcar companies

in Massachusetts were collected from the published reports in the Annual Report of the Board of

Railroad Commissioners.

        For 1872, accounting data and the names of all directors for 603 nonfinancial corporations

were collected, and those corporations’ accounting data were recorded for all subsequent years in

which they existed, up to 1881. In order to identify ties between banks and nonfinancial corporations,

the names of the directors of all of the state’s banks were recorded from the 1872 Massachusetts

Register and Directory. These names were then cross-referenced with the names of the directors of

the nonfinancial corporations, in order to identify interlocks.

        Among the 603 sample firms, 59 percent had a bank director on their board. The boards of

some banks were interlocked quite extensively with those of nonfinancial corporations. Consider the

example of the National Bank of Northampton, illustrated in Figure 2. The bank had nine directors,

of which six held directorships on at least one nonfinancial corporation. In total, the bank’s directors

held board seats with fourteen other corporations—twelve manufacturing firms, one utility and one

railroad—all of which were located in nearby towns. Several of the bank’s directors owned

substantial equity stakes in the non-financial corporations where they held board seats and were

probably among the founders of those enterprises; we will return to this observation later in the

analysis.

        The federal census of 1870 included information about the assessed wealth of the population,

including real estate and other assets. The census manuscripts were searched for the names of all

directors of Massachusetts nonfinancial corporations to obtain this information. There were 2,747

unique individuals who held directorships with nonfinancial corporations, and of those, 1,636 could

be uniquely identified in the census, a match rate of around 60%. For the corporations for which the

                                                                                                      10
wealth of at least half the directors was found, average director wealth (real plus personal) was

calculated.

          Finally, credit ratings were collected for the sample corporations. At the time, annual

volumes entitled Bradstreet’s Commercial Reports were published by J.M. Bradstreet & Son and

distributed to paying subscribers.14 The publication’s coverage focused on manufacturers, wholesalers

and retailers; it included some utilities but did not include any railroads or streetcar companies. The

ratings were intended primarily for commercial lenders, and offer an assessment of the level of risk of

the rated firms. Bradstreet’s ratings assigned firms into six categories: AA (‘Unquestioned’), A

(‘Very High’), B (‘Excellent’), C (‘Good’), D (‘Fair’), E (‘Very Moderate’). For 337 of the sample

firms, a rating for 1872 was found. An additional volume of Bradstreet’s was found for 1878, a year

when the economy was still in recession, and for 227 of those 337 firms, a rating was found, so that

the change in the firms’ ratings over that six-year interval could be calculated.

          Table 1 presents summary statistics for many of the corporations’ characteristics for 1872.

Column (2) of Panel A shows that the average log value of their total assets was 11.7; their average

age, measured as years since incorporation, was 12.9 years; and the average leverage ratio (debts/total

assets) for the firms was 0.35. The firms’ property accounts—buildings and machines, or in the case

of railroads, track and equipment—accounted for about 35 percent of their assets. The average value

of the firms’ credit ratings (where AA was coded as 1, and E was coded as 6) was about 2.2. The

average growth rate of firms’ assets in 1872 was about seven percent. And although average director

wealth was only available for about 63 percent of the sample corporations, its mean value was

$122,000—equivalent to $2.4 million in today’s dollars. Panel B shows how the corporations were

categorized into 13 different industries, the most important of which were textiles, and fabricated

metals.

  These published volumes have not seen much use among economic or business historians, presumably
because they are difficult to find today. Each subscriber’s copy was numbered and was officially ‘loaned,’
rather than sold, to the subscriber, and was to be returned to the publisher “at the end of the subscription.”

                                                                                                                 11
        Column (3) of Table 1 presents the differences in the values of these characteristics between

firms with and without a banker-director, as estimated from regressions with robust standard errors.

Turning first to Panel B, the industry variables in column (3) indicate that bank interlocks were more

common among textile manufacturers and railroads, and less common among paper producers and

makers of food and tobacco products. These differences in the distribution of industries between

firms with and without bank directors will be accounted for in the empirical analysis below through

the use of industry fixed effects.

        But more importantly, the data in Panel A show that corporations with a bank interlock had

less leverage, more assets, were older, and had better credit ratings and wealthier directors. This

presents a challenge for the empirical analysis, since the selection of stronger firms into bank

affiliations could easily be responsible for any observed differences in performance between the two

groups of firms during the 1870s. Although the growth rates of firms with and without bank directors

did not differ significantly in 1872, one might imagine that any change in performance observed over

subsequent years could be due the greater resiliency of the firms with bank directors on their boards.

In the empirical analysis that follows, this challenge will be addressed carefully.



4. Analysis of Firm Outcomes


        The analysis will focus on three outcomes. The first is firm failure. About 38 percent of the

1872 firms that filed a certificate in 1872 no longer existed by 1882. In many cases, this was likely

an outcome of firms being unable to roll over or pay maturing debts, or being unable to obtain

financing for the acquisition of working capital or other critical transactions. If affiliations with

banks enabled firms to overcome asymmetric information problems and gain access to credit during

the economic downturn, then they should have increased firms’ survival rates.

        Other firm outcomes will necessarily be observed conditional on survival. As the certificates

of condition available for most of the sample firms do not provide any information about profits or


                                                                                                        12
cash flows, the usual accounting measures of rates of return cannot be computed, nor can measures of

external financial dependence. However, the annual growth rates of firms can be computed based on

the change in total assets from year to year. In addition, the change in the credit ratings for surviving

firms during the shock can be used as a measure of the change in their financial condition. In a

reflection of the difficult economic conditions that prevailed, the average value of the change in

ratings among surviving firms was +0.93, indicating a worsening by nearly a full grade (effectively

going from a rating of A to B).

        Before proceeding with the analysis, some suggestive evidence of the effect of bank

affiliations on the outcomes for Massachusetts’ corporations is presented in Figure 3. Panel (a) of the

figure plots Kaplan-Meier survival curves for corporations with and without bank directors on their

boards. The survival functions for the two groups of firms are starkly different; those without bank

directors failed at much higher rates throughout the period. Panel (b) presents the annual growth rates

of the firms between 1872 and 1881. All of the sample firms’ growth rates fell in 1874 and remained

depressed through 1879. Clearly, these were difficult years. But the differences between the two

groups are quite significant, particularly in the years 1874-77. Corporations with ties to banks

enjoyed a substantial advantage during the downturn, and their growth rates did not fall to the same

extent as those of other firms. It is worth noting that the firms with bank affiliations did not enjoy

any advantage in growth rates in the years following or prior to the recession.



4.1 Regression specifications

        Given the varying structure of the data for the three outcomes, slightly different specifications

will be used to analyze each one. The effect of bank affiliations on firm failure rates will be estimated

with a linear probability model:

                                failicj = xꞌβ + θbankerdirectori + αc + δj + εicj.                       (1)

where failicj is a binary indicator for the disappearance of a firm prior to 1882; x includes 1872 firm

characteristics likely predictive of failure that differ between firms with and without bank affiliations,

                                                                                                          13
namely log assets, firm age, and leverage; bankerdirectori is an indicator for the presence of a director

interlock with a bank in 1872; and αc and δj are county and industry fixed effects.

        A somewhat different specification will be used for analyzing the variation in firm growth

rates. With the latter, we can observe the rates before and after the shock, and the panel dimension of

the data can be used to estimate the difference-in-differences in a model with firm fixed effects.

These will sweep out the effects of any unchanging firm characteristics, such as management quality,

which may influence the firms’ growth over time. The effect of bank affiliations on the growth rates

of corporations will be estimated in the following framework:

                            yit = xꞌβ + θbankerdirectori×post-1873t + i + ηt +εit,                     (2)

where yit is the growth rate of company i in year t; x includes the 1872 levels of log assets, age and

leverage, as well as industry and county indicators, all interacted with a post-1873 indicator; post-

1873t is an indicator for the years following 1873; and ηt and i are year and firm fixed effects.

        Finally, the change in firms’ credit ratings will be estimated using a framework similar to that

of (1), but with the addition of fixed effects for the firms’ 1872 rating levels:

                             ratingicj = xꞌβ + θbankerdirectori + λr + αc + δj + εicj,                  (3)

where ratingicj is the change in the firm’s credit rating from 1872 to 1878; the λr term is rating-level

fixed effects; and x includes most of the same firm characteristics as above but excludes log assets,

which are strongly correlated with credit ratings. The inclusion of the rating fixed effects ensures that

the impact of bank affiliations on subsequent changes in ratings is estimated from the variation among

firms in similar financial condition, as determined by Bradstreet. But more importantly, it helps

address a selection problem in the ratings changes, which results from the fact that they can only be

observed among surviving companies. Firms with poor ratings in 1872 either went out of business by

1878, in which case no ratings change is observed, or turned things around, in which case an

improved rating is observed. Poor initial ratings are therefore strongly associated with ratings

improvements in the data, and since affiliations with banks were more common among firms with



                                                                                                         14
relatively strong ratings, the inclusion of ratings-level fixed effects helps addresses this potentially

important source of bias.15



4.2 Baseline Estimation Results

         Table 2 reports estimates from different versions of equations (1)-(3). Column (1) presents

baseline specifications that exclude the firm characteristics (or firm characteristics interacted with a

post-1873 indicator, in Panel B), and in column (2), firm characteristics are added into the

regressions. The results in both columns provide clear evidence that firms with bank directors on

their boards survived at higher rates, and conditional on survival, they experienced less of a

deterioration in their growth rates and credit ratings in the years following 1873. (With credit ratings a

lower number corresponds to a better rating, so a negative estimate reported in the table indicates an

improved outcome.) The results in column (2) imply that the survival rate of firms with bank

affiliations was 11 percentage points higher, an effect equivalent to 29 percent of the mean survival

rate; that the growth rates of these firms, relative to the years 1873 and before, was 6 percentage

points higher, equivalent to 21 percent of the standard deviation in 1872 growth rates; and that the

change of the credit ratings of firms with bank affiliations was better by nearly a quarter of a ratings

grade, an effect equivalent to about a quarter of the average ratings change.

         A source of concern regarding these results, however, could be that the firms without bank

directors were so different from those with bank directors that they do not constitute an appropriate

control group. The firms with bank directors on their boards were much larger and less levered. If

these differences increased the resiliency or growth rates of firms with bank directors during the

downturn, they could be responsible for the effect ascribed to the presence of a bank director. In




15
  An alternative explanation for this phenomenon in the data is mean-reversion in ratings levels. If that were
the case, it would still be necessary to control for initial ratings levels to estimate the effect of bank affiliations
on ratings changes.

                                                                                                                      15
order to address this concern, I weight the observations by their inverse propensity scores.16 The

results of these regressions are presented in column (3) of Table 2. The estimated effects of an

affiliation with a bank are reduced in magnitude slightly, but remain generally similar, particularly for

firm failure rates and growth rates.

         Another approach to addressing this problem is to actually control for the resilience of firms

to a shock. The credit ratings of the firms, used above as an outcome, are an estimate of the

probability of a default, and therefore measure of financial resiliency. Table 3 presents regressions of

the same form as column (1) of Table 2, but with fixed effects for the firms’ 1872 rating levels

included. The predictive power of the ratings for failures is clearly evident in column (2) of Table 3;

firms with credit ratings better than the excluded category of E were substantially less likely to fail.

But even conditional on ratings, bank affiliations reduced the probability of failure, and increased

growth rates relative to pre-crisis levels. In contrast, the estimates in column (4) reveal that ratings

had little predictive power for growth rates, which is consistent with their function as a measure of

default probabilities for creditors, rather than growth opportunities.

         An additional concern regarding these results may be that they reflect the effects of other

director or board characteristics that may be correlated with bank affiliations. That is, the estimated

effects of bank interlocks may not result from bank affiliations per se, but from other characteristics

of banker-directors. For example, banker-directors were likely to have been wealthier than most

directors, and director wealth may have been an important determinant of firms’ survival and growth.

Wealthier men would certainly have been better able to guarantee their firms’ debts or sustain losses

for longer periods.



16
   The procedure is as follows. I first estimate the propensity scores using a firm-level probit regression of an
indicator for an affiliation with a bank with 1872 measures of log assets, leverage, and industry indicators. I
then use the estimated propensity scores to construct weights for each firm. These weights are applied to the
treated and control firms so that both groups resemble the population, and ensure that the regression will
produce consistent estimates of the Average Treatment Effect of bank affiliations (see Imbens 2004).
Restricting the sample to the common support in the propensity to have a bank affiliation results in no loss of
observations relative to column (2); effectively, the loss of observations due to missing data on their
characteristics achieves this result.

                                                                                                                    16
        Alternatively, firms with bank directors on their boards were almost certainly better

connected in a much broader sense, and were likely to have been interlocked with many other firms.

Recent research from Babina et al. (2017) on firms during the Great Depression has shown that

better-connected firms were more likely to survive that period. In order to explore this latter

possibility, the full network of interlocks among all Massachusetts corporations’ boards was used to

calculate the eigenvector centrality of each corporation’s board.17

        Table 4 presents the results of regressions that are the same as those reported in column (1) of

Table 2, but with average director wealth and the eigenvector centrality of the board included as

additional controls. With the exception of the change in rating, the estimated effects of bank

affiliations on firm outcomes are quite robust to the inclusion of these variables. Consistent with the

findings of Babina et al. (2017), the eigenvector centrality of the board was negatively correlated with

firm failures, and it was also positively related to post-1873 growth rates and was associated with

better ratings changes, although the latter effect is not statistically significant. Director wealth was

essentially uncorrelated with firm failure or with the change in firms’ growth rates following 1873,

but it led to a significantly better change in ratings. This latter result suggests that much of the effect

of bank directors on the change in ratings may have been due to the greater average wealth of boards

with bank directors.



4.3 Bank Directors and Asymmetric Information

        The main argument of this paper is that bank affiliations helped non-financial corporations

overcome problems of asymmetric information in financial markets. If this argument is correct, then

the firms that suffered most from problems related to asymmetric information should have benefitted

the most from having banker on their board. In order to test whether or not this was the case, some




17
  Eigenvector centrality captures the importance of a node in a network by measuring the importance of the
nodes to which it is connected (and is therefore recursive in nature.) See the Appendix.

                                                                                                             17
variables reflecting the degree of asymmetric information faced by each of the sample firms are

needed.

          One good candidate as a proxy for the degree of asymmetric information faced by firms is

their ages. The quality and business prospects of new firms may have been relatively difficult for

outsiders to assess, particularly in an economic downturn, compared to the older firms with well-

established histories as borrowers. This implies that newer firms should have benefitted to a greater

extent from an affiliation with a bank, as the affiliation would have enabled the bank to obtain better

information regarding the firm’s assets and prospects.

          Another possible proxy for the degree of asymmetric information is the percentage of firms’

assets represented by their buildings, equipment and land—their property account, or fixed assets.

Compared to many other types of assets, such as intangibles, the firms’ fixed assets were likely easier

to sell for the benefit of creditors in the event of a bankruptcy. The firms were in fact required to

report the value of their property account on their certificates of condition precisely because of its

importance to creditors. Firms with a lower share of fixed assets should have benefitted to a greater

extent from affiliation with a bank, if the affiliation enabled the bank to obtain better access to

information about the true quality of the firm’s assets.

          In order to test for this mechanism, the same specifications as column (2) of Table 2 are used,

with a series of interaction terms added. For example, for the outcome of firm failures, equation (1)

becomes:

               failicj = xꞌβ + θ1bankerdirectori + θ2bankerdirectori × agei + θ3agei + αc + δj + εicj.   (1a)

The parameter of interest becomes θ2, the interaction between a bank affiliation and firm age, and the

hypothesized sign is positive: the preventative effect of bank affiliations on firm failures (reflected in

a negative value of θ1) should be diminished for older firms. The validity of the test itself is reflected

in θ3—firm age should help avert failures (θ3 > 0) if it is a good proxy for firms with lower degrees of

asymmetric information. Similar modifications will be made to equations (2) and (3).



                                                                                                          18
         Tables 5 and 6 present the results. In all but one of the six regressions in the two tables, the

estimated coefficients have signs that are consistent with bank affiliations helping to address

problems of asymmetric information. The rows labeled implied effects near the bottom of the tables

report the effects of the main bank affiliation variable plus the effects of the interaction term

multiplied by different values of the firm characteristic. In the case of equation (1a) from Table 5, for

example, these rows report the value of 𝜃̂1 + 𝜃̂2 × 𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑝 , where the value of 𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑝 corresponds to

the pth-percentile of the firm age distribution. Reading down the columns, the changing values

reported reflect the variation in the effect of bank affiliations for corporations with greater values of

firm age (or the greater vales of the share of fixed assets on their balance sheet, in the case of Table

6). Consistent with the effect being smaller for firms less subject to problems arising from

asymmetric information, the absolute value of the coefficients falls, in some cases quite steeply, for

firms at higher percentiles of the age or fixed assets share distribution.

         The one exception is column (3) of Table 5, the effect of age interactions on the changes in

firms’ credit ratings. Here the interaction term θ2 is negative rather than positive, and the rows

reporting the implied effects show magnitudes that increase, rather than decrease, with firm age.

Evidently with ratings changes, older firms enjoyed a greater benefit from affiliations with banks than

younger firms. But it should be noted that the estimated effect of age itself, θ3, does not have the

hypothesized (negative) effect of improving firms’ credit rating changes. The ratings of firms may

have fully reflected the effect of age on investors knowledge of the firm.18




18
  In additional regressions (not shown), two other proxies for asymmetric information were explored: firm size,
and whether or not a firm had a credit rating. Firm size is commonly used in the literature as a proxy for
asymmetric information (eg, Chodorow-Reich, 2014), and whether or not a firm was rated is certainly a
reasonable measure of the prominence of a firm, and the extent of information about it. Both variables perform
as expected in firm failure regressions; larger firms and rated firms survived at higher rates, and the protective
effect of bank affiliations diminished with firm size and for rated firms. Yet neither has the hypothesized effects
on post-1873 growth: larger firms, and rated firms, grew differentially slower, relative to the pre-1873 period.

                                                                                                                19
4.4 Mechanisms Behind the Effects: Credit Access, Signaling or Expertise?

        The benefits of affiliations with commercial banks documented above could be the product of

several possible mechanisms. First, bank directors may have provided financial or managerial

expertise to a firm. Second, the affiliations with banks created by bank directors may have signaled to

creditors or suppliers that the firm was reliable. Or third, the affiliation may have actually facilitated

lending from the director’s bank to the business, consistent with Lamoreaux’s (1994) insider lending

hypothesis. Call these the management, the signaling, and the insider lending channels. Each of them

could have facilitated improved access to credit and enhanced the resiliency of firms in response to an

economic shock, and each of them would have had stronger effects among firms suffering

differentially from problems arising from asymmetric information.

        Although distinct, these three channels are not mutually exclusive. It is possible—perhaps

even likely—that the estimated effects reported above are the product of some combination of the

three. In order to identify the relative importance of the different channels, one would ideally want an

experiment in which individual channels were shut down among subsets of bank-firm affiliations, and

the outcomes compared. One possibility that comes close to this is to study the effects of the presence

of bank cashiers, rather than directors, on nonfinancial company boards. Bank cashiers were the day-

to-day managers of nineteenth century banks, overseeing their operations and maintaining their

accounts. The ranks of bank cashiers often included many talented men who would go on to

illustrious careers in finance and industry. They were certainly financial experts, and they were

prominently associated with their banks.

        But they generally could not allocate credit from their banks. They were present at the

meetings of banks’ discount committees, and interacted with banks’ borrowers, but as they were

expected to serve as an independent check on the directors and guard against any misuse of the banks’

funds, they were generally not permitted to be borrowers from banks, or to serve as guarantors of




                                                                                                        20
their banks’ loans.19 The presence of a bank cashier on a firm’s board could potentially benefit the

firm through the management channel or the signaling channel, but was much less likely to provide a

benefit through the insider lending channel.

         Twenty of the sample corporations had bank cashiers on their boards. Table 7 reports

estimates from regressions similar to those of column (1) in Table 2, but with the indicator for a bank

director replaced with one for a bank cashier on the board. If a bank cashier brought financial

expertise (the management channel) or a prestigious affiliation (the signaling channel), comparisons

between the estimated magnitudes from these regressions with those estimated above for bank

directors will reveal the relative importance of the insider lending channel.

         The estimates reported in Table 7 reveal that the management and signaling channels were

unlikely to have been important. For firm failures and growth, the point estimate for the presence of a

bank cashier is negative and quite small, and the effect on firm ratings changes was large but positive,

indicating a harmful effect. The validity of this test requires that bank cashiers actually did bring

financial expertise and a prestigious signal to the companies where they held directorships that was

similar to those created by the presence of a bank director. If that was indeed the case, then the

results of this test suggest that the insider lending channel was likely quite important.



4.5 Aggregate Magnitude of the Effects: Counterfactual Estimates

         In order to assess the aggregate effects of the presence of banker-directors on Massachusetts’

corporations boards during the years following the 1873 downturn, we can ask: how different would

the sample firms have looked in 1881 if the benefits of bank directors were removed in 1872? In



19
  Gibbons (1859) describes the role of mid-19th c. bank cashiers in great detail, from first-hand experience. See
also Bodenhorn (2003a). Lamoreaux (1994) does mention a case of a failed bank where a cashier was a
borrower (p. 43), indicating that the practice of prohibiting cashiers from being depositors or borrowers was not
universal. But given the significance of the cashier’s role, it would have been prudent and sensible to rule out
any loans to the cashier. It should also be noted that cashiers were normally required to post bonds to ensure
that they would perform their role in good faith. A large enough loan balance with the bank could completely
undermine the incentive mechanism created by the bond; the gain to a malfeasant cashier from defaulting on the
loans from the bank could compensate for the loss of the bond.

                                                                                                              21
order to address this question, I use estimates of the benefits of banker-directors on firm survival and

firm growth to construct counterfactual estimates of the number of surviving firms and their total

assets in 1881. Complete details regarding these calculations are provided in the Appendix.

           To estimate the aggregate effects of the survival advantage, I use the inverse propensity-

score-weighted estimates of (1) to obtain predicted failure probabilities for all sample firms—denote

them 𝜋̂𝑖 —and then eliminate the estimated benefit of a bank director to obtain a counterfactual failure

               𝑐𝑓
probability: 𝜋̂𝑖 = 𝜋̂𝑖 − 𝜃̂ × 𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑒𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖 , where 𝜃̂ is the estimated survival advantage from

banker-directors from (1). The change in the expected number of failures implied by these

probabilities was modest: an additional 27 firms, relative to a baseline of 214 failures.20 I then

estimate the growth-rate advantages of banker-directors by obtaining predictions of the value of each

firm’s 1881 assets (conditional on survival), using a similar inverse-propensity-score-weighted

regression of the determinants of the surviving firms’ asset levels, based on their 1872 characteristics.

                                                         𝑐𝑓
These values of 𝑦̂𝑖,81 are then used to construct 𝑦̂𝑖,81 by eliminating the estimated benefit of a banker-

director as above. The expected total value of the firms’ 1881 assets is then

                                                   ∑𝑖(1 − 𝜋̂𝑖 ) × 𝑦̂81 ,                                    (4)

and the counterfactual estimate of the total 1881 assets of all corporations with banker-directors in

1872 is:

                                                              𝑐𝑓
                                                  ∑𝑖(1 − 𝜋      ̂𝑐𝑓
                                                         ̂𝑖 ) × 𝑦𝑖,81 .                                     (5)

           Table 8 presents these calculations, for all sample firms with banker-directors in 1872. The

first row is the value of (4), the predicted value of their total assets.21 In the second row, the effect of

the survival advantages conferred by banker-directors is observed by substituting the counterfactual

percent. Finally, the bottom row present the value of (5), where both the survival and growth-rate

advantages are eliminated, which reduces total assets in 1881 by 40.4 percent for the firms with

banker-directors in 1872.

         The total value of all sample firms’ assets in 1881 was $277 million, which implies that the

change in expected total assets resulting from the removal of the advantages of banker-directors—the

difference between the values of (4) and (5), or $97 million—would have lowered the total assets of

all Massachusetts business corporations by 35.02 percent. Affiliations between commercial banks

and non-financial corporations appear to have had a substantial benefit during the downturn following

the Panic of 1873.



4.6 Discussion: Comparing the Results to Those of Modern Studies

         Research on the Great Recession has shown that its effects were concentrated among small

firms, particularly those in sectors with high levels of dependence on external finance (Chodorow-

Reich, 2014; Duygan-Bump et al., 2015). Most recently, Siemer (forthcoming) has shown that these

effects were particularly concentrated among young firms. The results of this paper are generally

consistent with those findings; during the downturn of the 1870s, the benefits of affiliations with

commercial banks, which likely helped firms gain access to external finance, were strongest among

young firms. Although those studies focus on decompositions of the aggregate employment effects of

the downturn, the magnitude of the effects associated with financial frictions are roughly comparable

to the estimates obtained in this paper of the benefits of a mechanism that helped address financial

frictions.

         Yet among modern American firms, board interlocks with commercial banks are relatively

uncommon (see Kroszner and Strahan, 2001). Most of the bankers on American firms’ boards today

are regarded as independent or “outside” directors and only rarely represent banks with lending

relationships with the firms where hold board seats. The extant evidence we have on the effects of

                                                                                                        23
bank-firm affiliations associated with lending relationships among modern firms suggests that they

are not actually helpful, and tend to enable managers to make inefficient investments (see Güner,

Malmendier, and Tate, 2008).

         The differences between that study’s results and those obtained here may be due in part to the

different macroeconomic environments under study; the modern effects of affiliations with a healthy

financial institution during a financial crisis or recession may be different. But there is another, more

important factor that may explain the difference. The bankers on modern boards are, above all,

bankers. In contrast, the bankers on the boards of nonfinancial corporations in the 1870s were not

primarily bankers, but instead are best thought of as entrepreneurs.

         It is possible to quantify the extent to which these banker-directors were entrepreneurs, rather

than bankers. For a subset of Massachusetts banks, those located in Boston, ownership lists are

available, so the ownership stakes banker-directors held in their banks can be systematically

compared to the stakes they held in the nonfinancial companies where they held directorships.22

These comparisons are presented in Table 9. For the 87 different individuals who held directorships

both with Boston banks and non-financial corporations, the average fraction of the total stock of the

banks they held was less than 1%, whereas their average stake in the nonfinancial companies where

they held directorships was more than 8%. Since they often held board seats with multiple

nonfinancial companies, the (par) value of their holdings in those firms was far greater than their

holdings in banks—nearly $37,000 more.

         The financial fortunes of these men were much more closely tied to their nonfinancial firms

than to their banks. This gave them a very strong financial incentive to use their connections to banks

to help their non-financial corporations grow, rather than the other way around. These were not

22
  These data are from Jackson et al. (1866). They were six years old in 1872, when the ownership of the other
corporations is measured. There is likely some measurement error in the ownership stakes in the banks
presented in the table, but there is no reason to believe that it systematically understates the bank ownership
shares. In addition, many of these men held directorships with railroads, for which no ownership lists are
available. The omission of railroad ownership stakes causes the comparisons in Table 7 to understate the
differences between the financial stakes held by these men in non-financial corporations relative to Boston
banks.

                                                                                                             24
bankers on non-financial company boards; they were entrepreneurs on bank boards, and this

distinction likely explains the contrast with modern firms’ experiences. It may also help explain the

prevalence of historical banker-directors; the large equity stakes they held likely minimized the

conflicts between the interests of creditors and equity holders that may make it undesirable to have a

banker on a corporate board.


5. Conclusion


        In the 1870s, bank-firm affiliations, cemented with board seats, were quite common among

nonfinancial corporations in New England. This paper has used newly collected data to document the

extent of these affiliations, and their value. Among all nonfinancial corporations in Massachusetts,

59 percent had a bank director on their board. Entrepreneurs who founded and invested in

manufacturing enterprises and other firms commonly held board seats with commercial banks, and

these relationships likely helped address problems related to asymmetric information and improved

the firms’ access to credit.

        The empirical analysis utilized the downturn associated with the Panic of 1873 to assess the

value of these relationships, and the mechanisms creating that value. In the wake of the financial

shock, there was a significant decline in industrial production and a wave of bankruptcies, and

adverse selection problems in credit markets likely became particularly acute. If bank-firm ties

helped address those problems, they would likely have become quite valuable. The results of the

empirical analysis indicated that whereas all firms suffered following the panic, those that had ties to

banks failed at lower rates, saw their growth rates fall by considerably less, and saw their credit

ratings deteriorate to a lesser extent. Consistent with these effects arising from bank-firms helping to

address asymmetric information problems, these effects were stronger for younger firms and those

with lower shares of fixed assets on their balance sheets.

        The results of this paper suggest a role for banks in the industrialization process that previous

studies have not emphasized. Economy-wide or sectoral shocks periodically buffet all economies,

                                                                                                       25
and when significant, they can wipe out large numbers of firms. The cumulative effect of these

shocks likely impedes development and industrialization. In nineteenth century New England,

affiliations with banks helped sustain nonfinancial corporations faced with macroeconomic shocks,

by mitigating the asymmetric information problems that become so acute. Whether or not banks

provided a substantial fraction of firms’ outside finance overall, relationships with banks were likely

critical during periods of economic volatility.

                                           Figure 1: Effects of the Panic of 1873
Panel (a) presents annual rates of growth of industrial production, as calculated from Davis (2004).
Panel (b) presents the annual value of liabilities of failed businesses, from the “Dun & Bradstreet
Reference Book and Failure Statistics,” as reported in Historical Statistics of the United States.
Panel (c) presents the profitability of Massachusetts railroads, measured as return on assets (net
income divided by total assets), as calculated from the reports submitted to the state’s railroad
commissioner. And Panel (d) presents the profitability of large textile manufacturers, mostly from
Massachusetts, measured as return on assets, from McGouldrick (1968, Appendix D). Each panel
presents data for 1870-1881, with the beginning and end of the period corresponding to the
recession as dated by the NBER (October 1873-March 1879) marked with vertical lines.
Additional information on the sources and data utilized in this figure are presented in the

        Figure 2: Board Interlocks with of the First National Bank of Northampton, 1872
This figure presents the additional directorships held by each of the board members of the First National Bank
of Northampton MA in 1872. The bank had three additional directors who held no additional directorships.
Dotted lines indicate directorships. The numbers indicate the percent of the equity of the nonfinancial
companies owned by the individual directors. As no shareholder lists were submitted by railroads, the
ownership stake held by Joel Hayden in the Massachusetts Central RR is not known.

This table reports estimates of equations (1), (2) and (3). Panel A reports the results for linear probability models of firm
failure; Panel B reports difference in difference estimates from panel regressions of annual firm growth rates; and Panel
C reports estimates of the determinants of the change in firms’ credit ratings. Credit ratings are coded from AA=1 (best)
to E=6 (worst), so that a negative estimate represents an improved outcome. Column (1) reports a baseline specification.
Column (2) reports a specification in which a series of firm-level controls (leverage and firm age in all cases; fewer
additional characteristics in Panel C) are included. Column (3) reports results for models in which the firms are
weighted by their inverse propensity scores. In Panels A and C, robust standard errors are reported. In Panel B,
standard errors clustered by firm are reported. **, *, and + denote significance at 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively.

This table presents estimates from the same regression as column (1) of Table 2, with the addition of the controls for
the firm’s credit rating. The excluded rating category is that of E, the worst rating level. In columns (1) and (3), the
sample is restricted to observations for which a credit rating is available. In columns (3) and (4), standard errors
clustered by firm are reported. **, *, and + denote significance at 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively.

This table reports estimates of (4) and (5), the expected value of 1881 total assets of firms with bankers on their
boards in 1872. Column (1) presents the expected value of 1881 total assets, the sum of the estimated probabilities of
survival multiplied by the predicted values of assets for 1881 (conditional on survival). In column (2), in the first row,
the probabilities of survival are changed by eliminating the effect of banker-directors. In the second row of column
(2), the predicted 1881 assets values are changed by eliminating the estimated benefits of banker-directors. In the
bottom row, the benefits of banker-directors for both survival probabilities and 1881 asset levels are eliminated.
Details regarding the estimation and calculations underlying these numbers are presented in the Appendix.

This table presents data for the ownership stakes in Boston national banks and in Massachusetts nonfinancial
corporations for individuals who held directorships in both. A total of 87 individuals held directorships with a Boston
national bank and at least one nonfinancial corporation. These individuals held directorships with an average of 1.83
nonfinancial companies. As the stockholder lists for railroads were not submitted to the state, railroads are excluded
from these tabulations. The omission of railroad ownership stakes implies that the differences reported in the table
understate the true differences. The first row compares the fraction of the shares these directors held in their bank with
the average fraction they held in their nonfinancial corporation(s). The second row compares the par value of the
shares, and the third row compares the total par value of their stakes in their banks and in their nonfinancial
corporations. Standard deviations are presented in brackets, standard errors in parentheses.

1. Sources

1.1 Manufacturing companies, utilities and other non-financial businesses

The names of officers and directors, their shareholdings, and the total number of shareholders was
collected from the certificates of condition filed by all Massachusetts business corporations other than
banks, insurance companies, railroads and streetcar companies, which were subject to separate
regulations and disclosure requirements. These certificates survive as microfilm in the Records of the
Secretary of the Commonwealth in the Massachusetts State Archives. The content of these
handwritten certificates was transcribed by hand.

An example is presented as Figure A1 on the following page. At the top of the form are spaces to fill
in the names of the president, treasurer and directors. Below that are questions about the size of the
capital stock, the amount the corporation has invested in real estate, the amount invested in personal
estate, the total assets of the company, and the total debts of the company. At the bottom of the form
is the complete list of stockholders and the amount held by each, which for many companies extended
onto dozens of additional pages.

These forms were created to protect creditors, and to facilitate the collection of taxes. They therefore
do not include any information about revenues, profits or dividends – these would be relevant mostly
to stockholders, who presumably had access to that information anyway at their company’s annual
meetings.

The accounting data presented on the forms were published annually in the Abstract of the
Certificates of Corporations by the Secretary of the Commonwealth. The date of incorporation of
each firm was obtained from the annual Report of the Tax Commissioner of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts.

1.2 Railroads and streetcar companies

The names of all directors, annual accounting information, location of operations, status of
operations, and number of shareholders was collected from the Annual Report of the Board of
Railroad Commissioners of Massachusetts. These reports present much more detailed accounting
information than those submitted by manufacturers and utilities. Profitability and revenues, for
example, can be calculated quite precisely from the information disclosed. This information is used
in Figure 1 of the paper, but the small number of railroads and streetcar companies (and the limited
variation within those industries in the presence of board interlocks with commercial banks) limits the
value of these data for the analysis of this paper.

The railroad and streetcar reports do not provide information on the stock holdings of directors, or on
director ownership.

1.3 Commercial bank directors

The names of all directors of the commercial banks located within Massachusetts in 1872, nearly all
of which were national banks, were obtained from The Massachusetts Register, 1872, Containing A
Record of State and County Officers, and a Directory of Merchants, Manufacturers, etc. (Boston:
Sampson & Davenport). This source also lists the names of the banks’ cashiers. It unfortunately does
not list the directors of savings banks; interlocks with the boards of those institutions may also have
been of value.


                                                                                                     A2

                                                     A3
1.4 Director wealth

The federal census of 1870 included information about the assessed real and personal wealth of
individuals. Using a web-based online search index, the manuscripts were searched for all of the
names of directors of Massachusetts corporations, so that this information could be obtained. There
were 2,747 unique individuals who held directorships with the sample corporations. Searches were
conducted for each individual using their name and the county of the corporation where they held a
directorship, although matches were not constrained to be to individuals residing within the same
county as the corporation. In cases where multiple potential matches were found with the same name,
ages and occupations were used to identify the most likely matches. In many cases, there were too
many individuals in the census with the same name, and no unique match could be found. The
procedure followed produced matches for 1,647 individuals, a match rate of about 60%. For these
individuals, the sum of their reported real and personal wealth was recorded. However, for 204 of the
1,647 individuals found, no wealth information was provided to the census enumerator.23 These
individuals were excluded from the analysis.

1.5 Credit ratings

Credit ratings for 1872 were obtained from Volume 32 of Bradstreet’s Commercial Reports,
Embracing the Bankers Merchants Manufacturers and Others in the United States and the Dominion
of Canada (New York: J.M. Bradstreet & Son) published January 6 1873. Ratings for 1878 were
obtained from volume 43 of the same publication, published October 1878. These volumes present
lists of firms organized by town, along with their ratings. Most of the businesses listed in these
volumes are not corporations, but merchant partnerships and sole proprietorships. However, large
numbers of non-financial corporations are present in the volumes. No railroads, streetcar companies,
or commercial banks or insurance companies were rated in these volumes.

1.6 Early Massachusetts manufacturing company directors

The names of the founders and principal subscribers of the Boston Manufacturing Company (1813),
along with the Merrrimack (1822), Hamilton (1825), Appleton (1828) and Lowell (1828) companies,
are listed in Ware (1931: 320-21). Comparing these lists to the names of the directors of the banks of
Boston, as reported in the Boston Directory (Boston: Frost and Stimpson, 1820), indicates that the
founders of the Boston Manufacturing company included two directors from the Boston Bank
(Nathan Appleton and Israel Thorndike Jr.), and one from the Suffolk Bank (Patrick T. Jackson). The
surviving records of the Boston Manufacturing Company indicate that Patrick T. Jackson was
authorized by the directors to borrow as much as $25,000 at a time from the Suffolk Bank (Resolution
of 28 November 1818, Box 3, Folder 14, Boston Manufacturing Company collection, Baker Library,
Harvard Business School.)

Similarly, the Merrimack Company’s principal subscribers include four bank directors, the
Hamilton’s include seven bank directors, the Appleton’s include six bank directors, and the Lowell’s
include four bank directors.

  The individuals with no wealth reported included noted figures such as Congressman Oakes Ames and his
son Oliver Ames, who were major investors in the Union Pacific Railroad, and owners of several manufacturing
enterprises in the sample. This suggests that some wealthy individuals, perhaps those with ties to politics, may
have refused to answer enumerators’ questions about their wealth, and that the data on director wealth obtained
from the census will be measured with error.

                                                                                                            A4
1.7 Data presented in Figure 4

Panels (a) and (b) in the figure report data for the United States as a whole, from Davis (2004) and
from Historical Statistics of the United States.

Panel (c) reports data for Massachusetts railroads. These data are calculated from the annual reports
submitted to the state’s railroad commissioner, used as part of the main dataset for this paper.
Railroads were the only category of sample corporations required to submit information on revenues
or profits.

Panel(d) reports the profits of New England textile manufacturing corporations, from McGouldrick
(1968). McGouldrick’s sample was obtained from the manuscript holdings of Baker Library at
Harvard University, and includes eleven of the largest and most prominent textile manufacturers from
Massachusetts and the surrounding states. These firms are therefore not representative, but the fact
that their results were so poor over this period suggests that smaller and less prominent firms likely
suffered to an even greater extent.


2. Variables: Definitions and construction

2.1 Accounting and related variables

Many of the accounting variables are extremely noisy. In order to eliminate the effect of outliers on
the analysis, all of the accounting variables defined below are winsorized at the top and bottom 2% of
their distributions.

Total Assets: For the corporations submitting certificates of condition (manufacturers and utilities
mainly), total assets is recorded as the amount reported for “The amount of property owned by, and
debts due to, the corporation” on the form. For the railroads and streetcar companies, which
submitted different annual reports, this is calculated from the liabilities disclosed: paid-in capital +
debts + surplus.

Growth of assets: Calculated as the change in total assets from the previous year to the current year,
divided by the level of total assets in the previous year.

Leverage: For all sample companies, this is calculated as total debts/total assets.

Property account/Total assets: For the manufacturers and utilities, this is calculated as real
estate/total assets. The “amount invested in real estate” reported on the certificate of condition should
include all fixed property such as machines; the other category of assets disclosed on the forms is
personal estate which should be working capital and intangible assets. For the railroads, this is
calculated as the sum of the amount invested in the roadbed and equipment / total assets.

Director wealth: This is calculated as the mean value of real plus personal wealth, as reported in the
1870 federal census. However, only companies for which the wealth of at least half of the directors
was found are included in the analysis.

Failure: The circumstances and exact dates of the closure of firms are not observed. A firm was
denoted as having failed if it ceases to submit certificates of condition to the state. (These forms were
required for tax purposes and the Secretary of the Commonwealth would seek to strip corporations of


                                                                                                       A5
their charters if they failed to submit the required certificates.) The date of failure is assumed to be
one year after the firms’ last annual meeting.

Firm age: Calculated as current year – year of incorporation.

County: This is the county of the corporation’s operations, as reported to the state.

Ratings: The 1878 Bradstreet’s volume rates the credit of companies on a letter-graded scale: AA
(“Unquestioned”), A (“Very High”), B (“Excellent”), C (“Good”), D (“Fair”), E (“Very Moderate”),
and F (“…”). These were converted to a numeric scale, with AA equal to 1, and F equal to 7.
However, no ratings of F were observed, so effectively the ratings are a numerical scale from 1 to 6,
with one being the best and 6 being the worst.

The 1872 volume utilizes a slightly more fine-grained scale; instead of simply AA, for example, the
highest ratings can be “AA AA AA,” or “AA AA,” or “AA.” These values are aggregated together to
form a 6-point scale compatible with the 1878 ratings.

No railroads or streetcar companies were rated by Bradstreet’s. The rating level and rating change
variables are therefore missing for all firms in those industries.

Change in ratings, 1872-78: This is calculated as the 1878 rating – 1872 rating. As shown in the
paper, the average value of this is positive, indicating that among the surviving firms that were rated
in 1878, their rating was on average worse (higher) than it had been in 1872.

Industry: The certificates of condition do not provide information on the products or industries of the
firms. To obtain information on industries, directories of Massachusetts such as The Massachusetts
Register, 1872, Containing A Record of State and County Officers, and a Directory of Merchants,
Manufacturers, etc. (Boston: Sampson & Davenport) were consulted. These directories generally
listed specific products or narrow industries, which were then grouped into 13 broad industry
categories. Table A1 below lists many of the original narrow industries listed in the directory, and, to
the left, the broad industry categories into which they were grouped.

2.2 Board variables

Bank director on board: This is an indicator variable equal to one if the corporation has a director in
common with a Massachusetts commercial bank in 1872. This variable is constructed by cross-
referencing a list of all directors of non-financial corporations with a list of all directors of
commercial banks. As names are sometimes abbreviated (eg, “Jno” for “John”) and sometimes only
initials are reported, all names are first converted to a string consisting only of first initial + middle
initial + surname + suffix. The full names are then hand-checked for all matches to verify that two
individuals with the same initials but different names are not incorrectly designated as the same
person.

Eigenvector centrality, firm board: This is a measure of the centrality of a company’s board within
the network of all company boards. Based on the notion that a node in a network is central if it is
connected to other central nodes, eigenvector centrality is a recursive concept based on the centrality
of the boards to which a board is connected. This was calculated for the entire network of
Massachusetts corporate boards, including those of some corporations not included in the analysis,
such as insurance companies. The graph of this network is presented below as Figure A2. In the
figure, commercial banks are colored red, and all other companies are colored blue.

Director ownership (Table 8): this is the fraction of the shares, or the total par value, held by
individual directors. As the railroads and streetcar companies did not disclose a list of their owners to
the state, this variable is missing for the directors of firms in those industries. Data on the ownership
of the directors of Boston national banks is obtained from Jackson et al. (1866).




                                                                                                        A8

3. Additional details: Sample companies and data

3.1 Inclusion in the sample

In order to be included in the sample, a company must have existed in 1872, and submitted a
certificate of condition with valid accounting data in that year. There were 24 manufacturers and
utilities that submitted certificates in 1872 that indicated that they were shutting down or were already
shut down, and those firms were excluded from the analysis.

Among the railroads, there were four that submitted annual reports that were actually chartered by
another state. These railroads’ operations extended into Massachusetts, but they mainly operated in
other states and were headquartered in those other states. These railroads were excluded from the
analysis, because their directors did not live in Massachusetts, and any interlocks between their
boards and financial institutions would therefore be unlikely to be observed. (If they had bank
interlocks, they would likely have been with out-of-state banks.)

In addition, there were 28 railroads and 13 streetcar companies that were leased to other railroads or
streetcar companies. Some of these firms reported very little accounting data, but even those that did
present full accounting statements were excluded from the dataset. They were not independent
businesses, but divisions of another business.

Finally, the certificates of condition of 24 cooperatives were excluded from the sample, as these
business may not have been operated in the same way that the other business corporations were.
Most of these were mercantile cooperatives, but there were a handful of manufacturers among them
as well.

3.2 Summary data by industry

One way to understand the characteristics of the sample firms more clearly is to observe them by
industry. These tabulations are presented as Tables A2-A4 below. Table A2 presents board data.

As Table A2 shows, the sample is dominated by textile manufacturers and manufacturers of metal
products. The rate at which the sample companies had a board interlock with a bank varied
substantially across industries, with 91 percent of railroads 85 percent of streetcar companies having
such an interlock, and only 37 of food and tobacco makers having one. The next column shows that
railroads and streetcar companies also had unusually large boards, although interestingly, the final
column shows that railroads’ boards were much more central in the network of directors (as measured
by eigenvector centrality) than those of streetcar companies. Finally, although stock ownership data
is not available for railroads and streetcar companies, since they did not disclose their lists of
stockholders, among the other firms managerial ownership is consistently quite high, ranging from 26
percent to 50 percent.

Table A3 presents accounting data by industry. Again, the railroads are the extreme outliers, with
total assets of $4.3 million on average. The industry with the second largest firms, textile producers,
had on average about $600,000 in total assets. Unsurprisingly, railroads and streetcars’ assets were
dominated to an unusual extent by their property accounts. But surprisingly, the railroads and
streetcars were among the least leveraged industries. Unlike their successors later in the 19th century
that were much more leveraged, early railroads were financed to a much greater extent with equity.

Finally, Table A4 presents outcome data by industry. The firms with the best (lowest) credit ratings
in 1872 were the textile manufacturers. The growth of the sample firms’ assets in 1872 varied
substantially by industry, but was extremely high among the railroads, which were in the midst of a
historic building boom in the early 1870s. The failure rates across industries varied substantially,
with 50 percent or more of the firms in several industries failing prior to 1880. Finally, for all the
industries in which credit ratings can be observed (railroads and streetcars were not rated), the
average change in their ratings from 1872 to 1878 was positive, indicating that their ratings worsened,
often substantially.

4. Additional details: Estimation

4.1 Inverse propensity score weights

Table 2 of the paper reports estimates obtained from inverse propensity score weighted regressions to
address concerns that our main estimated effects may reflect differences in observable characteristics
between firms with and without interlocks with banks. In this section, I provide the details of this
estimation.

I use what is commonly termed “inverse probability of treatment weighting” to create a sample in
which the distribution of baseline characteristics is independent of the treatment. In the standard
notation for the literature, define Z to be an indicator variable for having an interlock with a bank in
1872. The propensity score is the probability of being in that group conditional on baseline
covariates: ei = Pr(Zi = 1|Xi). With inverse probability of treatment weighting, railroads with the
same propensity score will have the same distribution of baseline characteristics.

The procedure is as follows. First, I estimate the propensity score itself. This is obtained from a probit
regression of Z on 1872 firm characteristics, including leverage, size, and indicators for industry. The
results of the probit regression for the specification used in Table 2 are reported in Table A5 below.

In the next step, I restrict the analysis to the observations in the region of common support
in the propensity score distribution. That is, I eliminate corporations in the treated group (those with
bank directors on their boards) with propensity score values outside the range of those of the control
group, and eliminate those in the control group with scores outside the range of the treated group.

Finally, I use the estimated propensity scores to construct weights for each corporation in the
regressions. These weights are applied to the treated and control corporations so that both groups
                                                                     𝑍    1−𝑍
resemble the population. The weights are defined as follows: 𝑤𝑖 = 𝑒𝑖 + 1−𝑒𝑖. With these weights, a
                                                                       𝑖    𝑖
least-squares regression will produce consistent estimates of the Average Treatment Effect (see the
discussion in Imbens, 2004)

4.3 Counterfactual estimates of Table 8

The counterfactual calculations are used to estimate the aggregate effects of the presence of banker-
directors on the sample corporations’ boards. The results in Table 2 imply that banker-directors both
lowered failure rates and increased growth rates, and the aggregate effects of each are estimated
separately.

The survival effects are estimated by first using the regression in column (3) of Panel A in Table 2—
the inverse propensity score weighted linear probability regression of firm failures on 1872 firm
characteristics—to obtain estimates of predicted failure rates for all sample corporations with banker-
directors (the 𝜋̂𝑖 ). These are then adjusted by subtracting the estimated benefit associated with the
                                   𝑐𝑓
presence of banker-directors: 𝜋̂𝑖 = 𝜋̂𝑖 − 𝜃̂ × 𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑒𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖 , where 𝜃̂ is the estimated survival
advantage from banker-directors. As shown in Table 2, the value of 𝜃̂ is -0.078.

The distributions of the estimated probabilities of failure with (in blue) and without (in red) the
benefits associated with banker-directors are plotted below.




The results in Panel B of Table 2 imply that in addition to survival benefits, banker-directors
improved firms’ growth rates, conditional on survival. Rather than utilizing the annual growth rate
effect estimated from the panel regressions in the table, here we simply calculate predicted values of
total assets for 1881, which reflect the cumulative benefits of those growth-rate advantages.

To estimate the predicted values of total assets, cross-sectional regressions very similar to those for
firm failures were estimated. The determinants of 1881 total asset levels for surviving firms was
estimated using inverse propensity score weighted specifications, with the same variables included.
The results are presented below in Table A8.

The estimated coefficients from that regression were then used to obtain predicted values of 1881
assets for all sample firms (including those that did not actually survive to 1881). These values of
                                                              𝑐𝑓
𝑦̂𝑖,81 are then used to construct the counterfactual values 𝑦̂𝑖,81 , by subtracting the estimated increase in
1881 assets associated with the presence of a banker-director in 1872. As shown in the first row of
Table 8 below, the estimated increase was 322,887.

Finally, the expected total value of 1881 assets is calculated as the sum of survival probabilities
multiplied by predicted 1881 asset values, or:

                                               ∑𝑖(1 − 𝜋̂𝑖 ) × 𝑦̂81 .

As reported in Table 8 in the paper, this expected value was $240 million, very close to the actual
value of 1881 assets of $255 million. The counterfactual estimate of the total 1881 assets of all
corporations with banker-directors in 1872 is simply:
                                                       𝑐𝑓
                                              ∑𝑖(1 − 𝜋       ̂𝑐𝑓
                                                      ̂𝑖 ) × 𝑦𝑖,81 .




5. Archival evidence of borrowing from affiliated banks

In order to investigate whether director interlocks with banks were actually associated with lending
relationships, a careful search of the business manuscript holdings of Baker Library of Harvard
Business School was conducted for the accounting records of sample companies. At least some
records of a relatively large number of sample companies are held in that library’s collection, but
comprehensive borrowing information for any period of time is available for only three of them: the
Lawrence Manufacturing Company, the Dwight Manufacturing Company, and the Fall River Iron
Works.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that their records survive, these were all very large and successful
companies. Their total assets in 1872 were all greater than $1.5 million (relative to the mean for the
entire sample of about $450,000); they were all well-established and at least 30 years old in 1872; and
their credit ratings were extremely good (the two companies for which a rating was found for 1872
received the highest rating). It is not obvious whether this would make the companies more or less


                                                                                                      A16
likely to rely on borrowing from affiliated banks, but it seems likely that these firms would have
benefitted less from affiliations with banks relative to younger or smaller companies.

For each of these companies, a full year of borrowing as recorded in their notes payable account was
collected.24 The year chosen was the closest to 1872 where comprehensive records were available.
Each of the three companies had a director interlock with at least one bank. Data on their borrowing
is presented in Table A9 below.

                                                                                              Fraction of
                                              Number                           Total        Borrowing from
                                             Of Loans       Total       Borrowing from         Affiliated

 Dwight Manufacturing Company       1873         95       $1,657,200       $240,000             0.145


 Fall River Iron Works              1876         59        $667,500        $304,000             0.455

Each of the companies did at least some borrowing from an affiliated bank, but the fraction of the
total value of their borrowing accounted for by affiliated banks varied widely, from 14.5 percent to
45.5 percent. Interlocked banks were very likely to be a source of credit for these firms, but they
were certainly not the only source of credit.

The other sources of credit included: other commercial banks, savings banks, private banks,
individuals and estates, and insurance companies.
