                    UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE DEMAND FOR UNIONS


                                   ABSTRACT


     Why do people join open-shop unions when they would receive union wage
rates even if they were not members? Why are unionization rates so low in the
south-east of England? To address these questions, which we treat as inter-
related, the paper considers the idea that unions offer insurance against
victimization and arbitrary dismissal. Consistent with our theoretical
approach, we find that union density is greatest, ceteris paribus, within
establishments in areas of high unemployment.
