                                              ABSTRACT

This paper examines data on financial sophistication among the U.S. older population, using a special-purpose
module implemented in the Health and Retirement Study. We show that financial sophistication is
deficient for older respondents (aged 55+). Specifically, many in this group lack a basic grasp of asset
pricing, risk diversification, portfolio choice, and investment fees. Subpopulations with particular deficits
include women, the least educated, persons over the age of 75, and non-Whites. In view of the fact
that people are increasingly being asked to take on responsibility for their own retirement security,
such lack of knowledge can have serious implications.

                   Financial Literacy and Financial Sophistication
                               in the Older Population
                     Annamaria Lusardi, Olivia S. Mitchell, and Vilsa Curto


       Americans are increasingly likely to hold individual retirement accounts such as IRAs or

401(k) plans, accumulate privately-held assets, and/or hold debt, meaning that most people will

need a certain amount of financial sophistication to be able to manage assets and debts sensibly

over their lifetimes. Yet financial literacy in the general public is disturbingly low. For instance,

only half of age 55+ respondents in the United States surveyed in a special module of the 2004

Health and Retirement Study (HRS) could correctly answer two simple questions regarding

inflation and compound interest. Only one-third correctly answered these two questions as well

as a third question about risk diversification (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2008, 2011b). Evidence of

low numeracy and low financial sophistication is also evident for younger respondents in surveys

including the Rand American Life Panel (ALP) and the Survey of Consumers (Hilgert, Hogarth

and Beverly, 2003; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2009; Lusardi, Mitchell and Curto, 2010). Moreover,

financial illiteracy is particularly acute among particular subgroups including women, minorities,

and those with low income and education (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007, 2008). And consumer

financial illiteracy can have important consequences: for instance, those who lack literacy are

much less likely to plan for retirement (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007, 2009, 2011a, 2011b); are

more likely to end up with little wealth close to retirement (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007); are less

likely to invest in stocks (Kimball and Shumway, 2006; van Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie, 2011;

Yoong, 2011); and tend to use high-cost borrowing channels (Lusardi and Tufano, 2009a).

Moreover, more literate individuals are more likely to choose mutual funds with lower fees

(Hastings and Tejeda-Ashton, 2008; Hastings and Mitchell, 2011).
                                                                                                 2


       Our paper analyzes new data from the HRS on financial sophistication among the older

American population, specifically persons over the age of 55.1 While prior studies have

examined measures of basic financial literacy, they have not considered financial sophistication.

Accordingly, the present research is informative in three important ways. First, our findings can

be used to help design financial education programs that are more effective in fostering saving

and informing investment choice. By examining knowledge about the behavior of the stock

market, basic asset pricing, and the importance of mutual fund fees on long-term investments,

explicit suggestions can be provided regarding topics that can usefully be covered in financial

education programs. Second, this paper identifies which older population subgroups are most

likely to be financially unsophisticated and thus potentially be most prone to poor financial

decision-making. Third, our paper makes a methodological contribution by examining alternative

ways to combine answers to financial literacy questions into an overall index, to help identify

which particular questions are most important in predicting financial literacy.



Building on previous research

       Older Americans are not particularly financially literate. Lusardi and Mitchell (2011b)

use the 2004 HRS to establish this pattern among older individuals, and Lusardi and Mitchell

(2007) replicate these findings for Early Baby Boomers, who display not only low numeracy but

also a lack of knowledge of fundamental economic concepts such as interest compounding.

Moreover, particular sub-groups of the population suffer even greater deficits in financial

literacy. For instance, women display much lower literacy than men and are much less likely to

plan for retirement (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2008, 2011d). Furthermore, minorities and those with

low education and low income are far less financially knowledgeable (Lusardi and Mitchell,

2007; Smith and Stewart, 2008).

       These results are troublesome, given the increasing complexity of financial instruments

and the many transactions households must undertake that require sound economic

understanding. For instance, Moore (2003) found that mortgage borrowers in Washington State

knew little about compound interest and were confused about the terms of their mortgages.

Campbell (2006) noted that many households failed to refinance their mortgages over the 2001–

2003 period when interest rates were falling. Furthermore, financial illiteracy can have

significant long-term financial consequences. For example, those who underestimate the power

of interest compounding are more likely to end up with excessive amounts of debt (Lusardi,

2009; Lusardi and Tufano, 2009a). Homeowners who fail to refinance or to correctly estimate

the amount by which interest rates could change will pay significantly more in mortgage interest

(Campbell, 2006).

       Most of the financial literacy studies mentioned above draw on evidence gathered in the

short 2004 HRS experimental module by Lusardi and Mitchell. Those questions have been used

very successfully to explore the links between financial literacy and retirement planning as well

as retirement wealth accumulation.2 Nevertheless, that module included only three questions

designed to assess basic numeracy and knowledge of basic economic concepts such as inflation

and risk diversification. For this reason, we have now expanded our investigation into financial

knowledge among the older population by asking additional questions which have been added to

other surveys. For instance, we developed questions on financial knowledge for the American

Life Panel, which we first piloted on the Dutch DNB Household Survey (Lusardi and Mitchell,
2
  These questions have also been fielded in related surveys in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,
Sweden, Russia, New Zealand, and Japan, and results reveal similar patterns of widespread
illiteracy (see Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011c for an overview).
                                                                                                   4


2009; van Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie, 2011). These new measures cover not only basic but also

sophisticated financial knowledge, eliciting knowledge on the difference between bonds and

stocks, the working of the stock market, and basic asset pricing. This expanded set of evidence

on financial knowledge in turn influenced the wording of the new 2008 HRS module, to be

described in more detail below. Using this extended information, we can now better classify

respondents in terms of financial sophistication and address specific knowledge lacunae.

       Measuring financial sophistication entails asking about concepts that respondents may

not find familiar. For this reason, we find it useful to present respondents with alternative

question wordings, so as to assess whether they understand the questions posed; in this case,

respondents are randomly assigned to one of two sets of alternative question wordings. As an

example, one set of respondents is asked whether the following statement is true or false: ‘If you

invest for the long run, the annual fees of mutual funds are important’; while the second group is

asked: ‘If you invest for the long run, the annual fees of mutual funds are unimportant.’ Such

wording reversals permit us to investigate the extent of measurement error in responses to the

financial sophistication questions, an important methodological innovation.3 In general, when

people are financially unsophisticated, it proves difficult to elicit accurate responses to

unfamiliar concepts. This procedure allows researchers to evaluate how much respondents

understand the questions that were posed to them and also the extent of guessing and lack of

knowledge.

       In what follows, we first describe our data and methodology, and then we summarize

findings of most interest. A final section offers conclusions and policy implications.

 Both the Dutch DNB Household Survey and the American Life Panel used a related approach
for a small subset of the questions, and there the wording of the questions did matter, particularly
for questions measuring financial sophistication (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2009; van Rooij, Lusardi
and Alessie, 2011).

Data and methodology

          In 2008, we subjected around 1,000 randomly-selected HRS respondents in the United

States to a special module of questions assessing knowledge of the stock market and asset prices,

investment strategies, risk diversification, the importance of fees, and related topics.

Respondents averaged age 67, with about half (55%) female. Some 15% had less than a high

school education, 32% had completed high school, 24% had some college, and 28% had college

or advanced degrees. Most (81%) of the respondents were White, with 9% African-American,

and 8% Hispanic (see the Appendix Table for descriptive statistics).4

          The 10 questions of key interest here are grouped into four categories, according to the

topic they cover: knowledge of capital markets, risk diversification, knowledge of fees, and

savvy/numeracy (see Table 1). Next we report the specific language used in the questions

employed for our analysis; in each case with the answer a sophisticated individual would indicate

as true provided in bold:

       of his or her retirement savings in the company’s stock.

Knowledge of capital markets:

Recalling that this module was fielded in the midst of the volatile capital market of 2008, it is

particularly interesting to see how much respondents knew about key financial concepts. The

evidence in Table 1 supports the conclusion that older Americans displayed a deep lack of

understanding about key concepts related to risk diversification, bond prices, and portfolio

choice. For instance, many respondents expressed a support for holding own employer company


5
    For all of these questions, it is also possible to answer with “do not know” or refuse to answer.
                                                                                                     7


stock, despite the fact that it is unlikely to be wise to hold much own employer stock from a risk

diversification viewpoint.6 We also find it of interest that answers are sensitive to how the

questions are phrased. Respondents given the first wording of this question (an employee of a

company with publicly traded stock should have a lot of his retirement saving in that company’s

stock) state that holding a lot of company stock is not a good idea. Yet when presented with the

reverse wording, most reject the proposal to hold little or no money in company stock. This

discrepancy suggests that the question was not fully understood, perhaps because of the use of

financial terminology (for example one has to know what a publicly traded stock is).

       A large majority of respondents (60%) also did not know about asset pricing, which we

explore by asking whether people knew about the inverse relationship between bond prices and

interest rates. This is a particularly good question to assess financial sophistication because it is

difficult (if not impossible) to know or infer the correct answer to this question without having

some knowledge of finance. When we piloted this question in both the ALP and the Dutch DNB,

we found that few (always under one-half) of those respondents knew about bond pricing; there

the wording order of the question influenced answers. Both conclusions are also true for the U.S.

population. When presented with the statement ‘If the interest rate falls, bond prices will fall’

(second wording), only about one-third (35.7%) of respondents answered correctly; when the

wording was reversed (first wording: ‘If the interest rate falls, bond prices will rise’), more

answer correctly (44.7%) and this difference is statistically significant. The low fraction of

financially sophisticated respondents is consistent with the U.S. 2009 Financial Capability Study

 This is because the typical US worker will have a large part of his total wealth in human
capital, so that labor earnings will be highly correlated with his employer’s financial stability.
For a discussion of the pros and cons of employer stock, see Benartzi, Thaler, Utkus, and
Sunstein (2004) and Ruffino (2011).
                                                                                                  8


where knowledge about asset pricing was shown to be low among older as well as younger

respondents (Lusardi, 2011).

       Many respondents were aware that ‘Even if one is smart, it is very difficult to pick

individual stocks that will have better than average returns.’ But here, too, responses varied

depending on how the question was asked: in one case 73.7% got the correct answer, but only

37.6% got it correct using the reverse ordering. In other words, this question, too, was poorly

understood by respondents.

Knowledge of risk diversification:

Knowledge of risk diversification is very important when contemplating investment options.

Table 1 indicates that almost two-thirds of respondents knew that ‘it is not a good idea to invest

in a few stocks rather than in many stocks or in mutual funds,’ which might be thought to imply

some sophistication about risk. Yet this question jointly tests knowledge of risk diversification

and awareness of mutual funds, as indicated by results when we reversed the question wording:

responses proved quite sensitive. The second risk question sought to avoid this by simplifying

the question and using less financial terminology; and now we find that most knew that

spreading money across 20 stocks rather than two decreased the risk of losing money (and here,

word order did not matter). We hypothesize that some of the sensitivity regarding question

wording may be due to the use of financial terminology. For instance, many respondents might

not have known what a mutual fund is, or the fact that mutual funds invest in a pool of stocks.

Knowledge of fees:

Two of the module questions sought to assess peoples’ knowledge of investment fees (see Table

1), an important topic since higher fees erode retirement wealth. And several prior studies have

found that investors often overlook fees when deciding how to invest (Mitchell, Todd and Bravo,
                                                                                                9


2008; Choi, Laibson and Madrian, 2010). In our sample of older Americans, around two-thirds

seemed to know that mutual fund fees are important when investing for the long run.

Nonetheless, responses were again sensitive to question wording, perhaps due to the fact that

respondents needed to know both about mutual funds and investing for the long run.

Additionally, a large majority of respondents said they would find it difficult to locate mutual

funds charging annual fees of less than one percent of assets, suggesting that many respondents

may not know about low-cost mutual funds. The fact that again there is some sensitivity to

question wording confirms that, here too, respondents have difficulty with financial terminology

(fees, mutual funds, etc.).

Savvy/numeracy:

While it is important to evaluate whether people understand fees, it is also important to know if

they can do something to reduce the fees they pay. Table 1 shows what our HRS respondents

knew regarding the question of whether ‘To make money in the market they should not buy and

sell stocks too often.’ Most respondents (over 60%) were savvy regarding stock churning, and

there is little sensitivity to wording order for this question. We also explore other financial

behaviors along with day-to-day financial management such as dealing with credit cards. Most of

the older respondents knew that using money in a bank account to pay off credit card debt is

usually a good idea, and responses were not particularly sensitive to question wording, probably

due to the simplicity of the question. By contrast, the query assessing whether people knew about

interest compounding and whether they could do complex calculations involving interest rates

were more difficult. More than 60% could figure out that an initial investment of $1,000 would

grow more than six-fold when invested at an interest rate of 10% for 30 years, but the alternative

wording generated different answers so at least some were guessing.
                                                                                                10


Financial Literacy Indexes:

While these questions all measure knowledge required for financial decision-making, one might

also be interested in a summary measure or index across all questions so as to categorize

respondents as relatively more or less sophisticated. One approach would simply compute the

fraction of all questions answered correctly. We compute this value and subtract it from the

variable mean and divide by ten, such that it is now centered on zero (with a standard deviation

of 0.2). Yet a disadvantage of this approach is that this score weights each question equally, even

though in Table 1, it is clear that some questions are much harder for people to answer correctly

than others.

       For this reason we also develop a second, more sophisticated, index which relies on a

weighting scheme which takes into consideration the relative difficulty of each question.

Specifically we employ a weighted scoring mechanism called PRIDIT designed to deal with

difficult-to-observe outcomes with indicator variables that proxy for the dependent variable that

are binary or categorical.7 Moreover, the PRIDIT approach is a scoring mechanism that allows

us to construct an index that weights questions according to how difficult and how informative

they are. The index is constructed in two steps. In the first step, each individual’s response to a

given question is rescaled according to how many people answered that question correctly. That

is, PRIDIT applies a negative penalty for a question that is answered incorrectly, and the penalty

is greater when a larger proportion of the sample answered the question correctly. Similarly, the

procedure gives more credit for a correct response to a question that few people answered

correctly. In the second step, principal components analysis is used to analyze the rescaled
7
 This approach was devised by Brockett et al. (2002) who use it to assess insurance fraud, where
investigators use several indicator variables (such as whether an individual had time gaps
between medical treatments or experienced many hospital visits) to assess whether a given claim
might be fraudulent. This approach has recently been used to measure financial literacy in Chile
(see Behrman et al., 2012).
                                                                                                 11


responses, which allows us to take into account the amount of correlation across questions.8

Weights are computed from the principal components analysis so that questions that are less

correlated with a linear combination of the other questions are given more weight because they

are more informative. The mean of this variable is also zero (and standard deviation of 0.03).

       For this dataset, we also find that the PRIDIT measure and the simple index prove to be

highly correlated, at 0.977. In other words, we anticipate that both measures will do a reasonably

good job in capturing the variation in financial literacy measured with our questions. Yet the

PRIDIT model tells us which questions are most informative about overall financial

sophistication levels. Interestingly, questions 4, 5, 8, and 10 are the most informative; these are

related to knowledge of risk diversification, financial savvy, and numeracy. We interpret these

results to mean that if one were to design a survey aimed at measuring financial literacy, it would

be most useful to ask questions assessing knowledge of these topics.

Analyzing financial sophistication: Who knows the least?

       In this section we look more deeply at how financial sophistication is distributed across

the older population. Table 2 reports results using as a dependent variable the simple index, and

Table 3 uses the PRIDIT index.

Tables 2 and 3 here

       Both sets of results confirm the importance of sex differences in financial sophistication.

That is, irrespective of which index is used, women consistently know less than men (column 1)

8
 More precisely, we calculate the principal components and use the principal component vector
with the largest corresponding eigenvalue. This principal component vector captures more
variance in the data than any of the other eigenvectors. We then use this vector to compute the
PRIDIT weights that are then used to construct the PRIDIT index.

been reported in prior surveys, regardless of whether one looks at just the basic versus

sophisticated knowledge (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2008; Lusardi and Tufano, 2009a,b).9

       Both Tables also confirm that more educated people are better informed, with those

having a college or higher degree having the greatest advantage compared to the reference case,

high school dropouts. The same phenomenon is clear from column 6 in both tables, where other

controls are included. This extends prior results on basic financial literacy measures provided by

Lusardi and Mitchell (2007; 2011b). Race/ethnicity factors also play a role. Specifically,

African-American and Hispanic respondents have lower measured levels of financial

sophistication than do their White counterparts, the reference group (column 3). Relatively

speaking, Hispanics suffer a larger disadvantage than do Blacks, extending our findings from

prior waves of the HRS that measure basic financial knowledge (Hilgert et al., 2003; Moore,

2005; Lusardi and Tufano, 2009a,b; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011b; ). Again, the results are robust

to other controls in column 5.

         The effect of aging on financial sophistication is most strongly negative for those aged

75+, with no measurable differences in column 4 for those aged 65–74 versus their younger

reference group (aged 55–65). A similar pattern emerges from column 5, when other factors are

controlled in the multivariate regression. While we cannot differentiate between age and cohort

effects using this single cross-section dataset, we did find similar results when examining earlier

HRS waves (in 2004) using simpler measures of financial literacy (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011b).

Evidently both basic and sophisticated knowledge falls with age.

 This is true not just in the United States, but also in many other nations as well; see Christelis,
Jappelli and Padula (2010) and Lusardi and Mitchell (2011c).
                                                                                               13


        As noted previously, it is also useful to examine whether and how responses varied

according to the order in which the question wording was provided. In Tables 2 and 3, we

examine these patterns in two different ways. Column 6 adds a simple dummy variable to the

model indicating which wording each respondent received. Evidently the patterns of financial

sophistication documented earlier are not attenuated; if anything, they become stronger. Columns

7 and 7’ in both tables interact the wording dummy with all other variables, to check for

differential sensitivity by group. Our results show that only one subgroup is strongly affected by

the order of the question wording: women. In particular, when women were shown the first

wording, they were more likely to score better on both simple and PRIDIT sophistication

indexes, holding constant other factors.

       Tables 4A and 4B permit us to explore in more detail exactly which wording induced the

HRS women to be more likely to answer questions correctly. Table 4A examines differences by

sex in the mean percentage of ‘do not know’ responses for each of the survey questions; we

report p-values for the statistical significance of the mean differences. Table 4B uses as the

dependent variable a tally of the number of ‘do not know’ responses for the outcome variable

(we have also subtracted the mean and divided by 10 as before). We then show three

specifications that are identical to the columns 6 and 7+7’ in tables 2 and 3. Two important

conclusions emerge from this analysis. First, women were far more likely to answer ‘do not

know’ across the board; in many cases they were approximately twice as likely to indicate ‘do

not know,’ compared to men. Second, the rate of ‘do not know’ responses among women

decreased substantially when the first set of wordings was used. This is evident both from the

lower significance levels of the chi-squared tests performed on the First Wording group in Table

4A, as well as from the strongly negative coefficient on the female and first wording interaction
                                                                                                14


term in Table 4B. From these two facts, we conclude that women are more susceptible to

framing effects and are also much more likely to respond ‘do not know’ when such confusion

arises. While this is somewhat puzzling, it appears to be consistent with international evidence.

For instance, Lusardi and Mitchell (2011c) show that in countries as different as Sweden, Italy,

Germany, New Zealand or Russia, women tended to respond in the same way, i.e., they were

disproportionately more likely to indicate they did not know the answers to financial literacy

questions. Because of such lack of confidence, or perhaps due to true lack of knowledge, women

may have become sensitive to how the question is framed; this might have prompted them to

respond in a manner that depended on the question wording.

Conclusion and Discussion

       This paper documents a rather striking lack of financial sophistication among the older

population. The extensive HRS module we have examined shows who knows what about capital

markets and risk diversification as well as fees; we also rate financial savvy and attitudes toward

investing. Further, we have exploited differences in question wording to gain insight into

whether respondents were guessing or actually knew the answers to the questions posed. In

addition, our paper makes a methodological contribution by examining alternative ways to

combine answers to financial literacy questions into an overall index, to help identify which

particular questions are most valuable in predicting financial literacy.

       To sum up results, we found that people do not have a good grasp of asset pricing, risk

diversification, portfolio choice, and investment fees in our HRS sample of respondents age 55

and over—despite having made many financial decisions over their lifetimes, including taking
                                                                                                 15


our    mortgages      and     loans,    made      investments,     and     undertaken    retirement

accumulation/decumulation decisions. Moreover, we showed that the PRIDIT index is very

similar to a measure which simply sums correct answers, so both approaches do a reasonably

good job in capturing observed variation in financial literacy. Yet the PRIDIT approach has the

advantage of telling us which questions are most informative about overall financial

sophistication levels. In our module, the questions related to knowledge of risk diversification,

financial savvy, and numeracy were most valuate. In other words, those seeking to measure

financial literacy will find it most useful to assess knowledge of these topics.

       We also conclude that some groups are consistently found to be significantly less

sophisticated about financial matters: women, the least educated, persons over the age of 75, and

African-Americans/Hispanics. Women are particularly sensitive to the framing of financial

questions when financial terminology is being used. This suggests that more research is needed

on the ways in which financial sophistication questions are framed, to evaluate whether and how

to help people develop a fuller understanding of how retirement saving and investment work.

Moreover, it is useful to develop questions that are gender neutral.

       Our findings will be of interest to those seeking to enhance retirement security in the

older population. As employees and retirees are increasingly being asked to take on tasks

requiring financial sophistication, including making saving, investment, and dissaving decisions

pre- and post-retirement, they are likely to do better if they are equipped with more and better

financial decision-making tools. One way to do so is to build human capital via educational and

retirement planning programs. Nevertheless, a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to address

saving shortfalls for all the elderly, in view of the very different patterns discerned by sex, age,
                                                                                                  16


educational levels, and race/ethnicity. Instead, to be effective, targeted programs will better serve

people who differ in terms of financial sophistication.
