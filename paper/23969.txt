                                         ABSTRACT

We develop a framework to study analytically and quantitatively relentless cross-border casino
competition with social-disorder and income-creation externalities. Two bordering casinos
compete with each other for the external source of demand of recreational and problem gamblers
from the neighboring city and the two city governments set their optimal casino revenue tax and
gambler tax surcharge to maximize social welfare. We show that cross-border casino gambling
makes aggregate casino demand more elastic despite the addictive nature of gambling. While a
lower commuting cost favors a cross-border casino in a city with a weaker taste for gambling, the
positive scale effect of its own population may be offset by a negative effect on cross-border
gambling. By calibrating the model to fit the Detroit-Windsor market, we find that cross-border
competition induces both cities to lower casino taxes to below their pre-existing rates, while the
optimal tax mix features a shift from the tax surcharge to the casino revenue tax. Our
counterfactual analysis suggests that lowering the commuting cost to the pre-911 level need not
have favored Windsor, whereas increasing Detroit's population to the 2000 level would have only
given Windsor a modest welfare gain.

1        Introduction

Over the past two decades, casino gaming in North America has grown sharply. While casino gaming
revenues in the U.S. increased by 233% from $11.2 billion in 1993 to $37.3 billion in 2012, such
revenues in Canada increased by 135% from $6.4 billion in 1995 to $15.1 billion in 2010-2011.1 Today
in the U.S., there are 508 commercial casinos in 15 states, while in Canada, there are 71 casinos in
8 of the 10 provinces. An interesting observation is that many casinos were built along various
borders across states (most noticeably along the California-Nevada border; also, the Atlantic City-
Philadelphia casino market along the New Jersey-Pennsylvania border and the riverboat gambling
in Quad Cities along the Illinois-Iowa border) as well as across countries (such as in Detroit, the
U.S. and Windsor, Canada; Bellingham, the U.S. and British Columbia, Canada; and Eilat, Israel
and Taba, Egypt). Despite this new development, a systematic study of such cross-border casino
competition and its welfare implications for casino regulatory policies remains completely unexplored.
        City or national boundaries are locations of economic opportunity, especially if the existence of
the border is itself the source of a monopoly situation that favors one side over the other (Krakover,
1997). Indeed, the border is a favorite site for the development of casinos, if an untapped, large
market exists on the other side – for example, casinos in Windsor, Canada, are directed at the
Detroit market (Deloitte-Touche, 1995).2 However, the monopoly situation can turn into a highly
competitive one, when casinos are positioned for new competition from the other side of the border
(Felsenstein and Freeman, 2002). For example, since May 1994 when Windsor won a bid to operate
a casino, Casino Windsor has attracted approximately 80% of its visitors to the casino from the U.S.
and has dramatically increased the revenues of stores, restaurants and hotels in Windsor. In the
1996 referendum, Michigan approved plans to build three casinos in downtown Detroit, which …nally
emerged in 2000 and have since then raised the stakes in the city’s cross-border competition with
Windsor’s casinos. Once the border turns into a relentlessly competitive battleground, not only is
the cake of the casino market redistributed, but each side of the border has to deal with the negative
externalities generated by gambling casinos on both sides.3 While bordering casinos generate demand
    1
        The booming casino industry generated $8.6 billion in tax revenues for U.S. states/local governments in 2012 and
around $13.5 billion in revenues for Canada where casinos are government-run.
   2
     There are many other cases: while the Nevada casinos (outside of Las Vegas) target the large population con-
centrations of Northern California (Eadington, 1995), the riverboats of Northest Indiana feed o¤ the Chicago market
(Przybylski and Littlepage, 1997). Similarly, the Macau casinos service the China and Hong Kong markets (Hobson,
1995).
   3
     Casino gambling generates various attendant externalities including compulsive addictions, productivity losses and
other social pathologies, increased drug and alcohol abuse, and the committing of crimes (see Goodman, 1995). Grinols
and Mustard (2001) …nd that about 0.77% of the U.S. sample could be classi…ed as compulsive gamblers. The comparable
…gure in Canada is about 0.4%. Goodman (1995) estimates that each problem gambler costs the government and the
private economy $13,200 a year. Similarly, Thompson, Gazel, and Rickman (1995) impute the associated social costs


                                                             1
from the other side of the border and create local jobs and other businesses, they also represent the
import of tax income and the re-exportation of negative externalities that accompany the gamblers
as they return to their home city (hereafter referred to as the export of external disorder costs). Such
undesirable consequences have led many governments to use various taxes and/or regulations as a
social guardian to control the social cost of gambling despite the revenue generating power of casinos.
    Just how would the relentless competition in this growing industry a¤ect recreational (regular)
and problem (addicted) gamblers both on the intensive margin and on the extensive margin via cross-
border gambling? What are the underlying driving forces in‡uencing the intensity of cross-border
gambling and the bordering casinos’ pricing, possibly preferences for gambling, casino pricing and
taxes, the population of gamblers of di¤erent types, and commuting cost, among others? How would
the bordering governments’casino tax policies depend on the extent of cross-border gambling and the
associated negative (social disorder) and positive (income creation) externalities? Would it be better
to impose a tax on casino revenue (i.e., a wagering tax) or to impose a tax surcharge on gamblers?
How would the …scal competition outcome in turn a¤ect cross-border casino competition?
    To address these questions, we develop a theoretical model of cross-border casino competition
highlighting the following salient features that are important but largely ignored in the existing lit-
erature. First, we model separately the behavior of recreational and problem gamblers and analyze
their di¤erential decisions on cross-border gambling. Second, we, on the one hand, allow the border-
ing casinos to compete with each other for the aggregate source of demand from both sides of the
border. On the other hand, we permit the two competing cities’governments to be active, where they
can set their optimal tax policy (the casino revenue tax on casino operators and the tax surcharge
on gamblers) to achieve the highest local welfare. In other words, we analyze cross-border casino
competition for both gambling revenues and tax revenues, as observed in the real world. Third, for
the normative analysis, we consider that “travel to use” casino services may generate local external-
ities, possibly negative (social disorders) or positive (income creation). Thus, by engaging in tax
competition, both governments take into account the “import” of tax revenues and income creation
and the “export”of external disorder costs. Finally, we provide the …rst attempt to conduct positive
and normative analyses quantitatively by calibrating the theoretical model to …t the Detroit-Windsor
data. It is an interesting case not only because of the relentless competition over one of the busiest
commercial borders between the U.S. and Canada with cross-border gambling, but also because of
some drastic counterfactuals of interest to test.4 These counterfactuals could have not been examined
empirically under limited data that lacked a good measure of casino pricing and a panel to account
for unobserved individual heterogeneities. Moreover, we are able to pin down city-speci…c optimal
as ranging between $12,000 and $50,000 per problem gambler.
   4
     For example, the value of trade between the U.S. and Canada is about $1.2 billion per day and 27 percent of all
merchandise trade crosses the Ambassador Bridge connecting Detroit and Windsor.




                                                         2
casino taxation that is valuable to policymakers.
   More speci…cally, we solve the equilibrium backward. We …rst solve the optimization problem of
individual gamblers of each type (recreational and problem), obtaining individual demand as well
as cross-border gambling decisions. We then determine the (Bertrand) price competition of the two
bordering casinos. We further pin down the optimal tax policy imposed by the two competing cities’
governments. The competition between the two bordering casinos is subsequently a¤ected by the tax
policy, in addition to the commuting cost of border crossing, the heterogeneous preferences for casino
gambling and the di¤erential population size of the two cities. That is, a full equilibrium of casino
gambling involves both cross-border casino competition and cross-border casino tax competition.
Upon characterizing the theoretical model, we calibrate the model to …t the border casino competition
between Detroit and Windsor. We perform two interesting counterfactual analyses, quantifying how
increased commuting costs due to 911 and decreased population size in Detroit a¤ect cross-border
casino competition. We further assess quantitatively the casino tax e¤ects and determine the optimal
casino tax policy for each city in the presence of cross-border casino competition.
   Among many theoretical results, we choose to highlight three sets of …ndings that are all related to
cross-border gambling. First, we show that under a reasonable assumption the demand elasticity for
casino gambling is greater than one for recreational gamblers but less than one for problem gamblers,
both rising with the preset payout ratio. While a higher commuting cost discourages cross-border
gambling, the overall cross-border gambling intensity (for both problem and recreational patrons) is
increasing in the own city’s casino price and tax surcharge. Second, the presence of cross-border casino
gambling provides an outside option to gamblers, thus leading to an elastic aggregate demand for
casino services despite the addictive nature of gambling. Interestingly, in a city whose residents have
stronger preferences for casino gambling, the net ‡ows of cross-border gambling are more pronounced.
As a consequence, a lower commuting cost that encourages agents to cross the border to gamble
would reduce this city’s casino monopoly power, thereby making its aggregate demand for casinos
more elastic. On the contrary, a lower commuting cost makes the price elasticity of casino demand
in a city inhabited by people with weaker preferences for casino gambling less elastic. In short, a
lower commuting cost favors cross-border casino business in a city with a weaker taste for gambling.
Third, a larger population size in the rival city makes the local city’s price elasticity of casino demand
less elastic. This may raise local casino prices and induces cross-border gambling. While an increase
in the local population may make the local city’s price elasticity of casino demand more elastic and
local casino prices lower, the resulting negative e¤ ect on cross-border gambling is o¤set by the positive
population scale e¤ ect, thereby leading to an ambiguous outcome.
   By calibrating the model to …t the casino competition between Detroit and Windsor, we ob-
tain additional …ndings from positive analysis. First, if a larger city whose residents have stronger
preferences for casino gambling (Detroit) raises its casino tax (either a casino revenue tax or a tax


                                                    3
surcharge on gamblers), the cross-border consumption of Detroit would exhibit an extensive mar-
gin response in the sense that the proportion of the cross-border gamblers would increase, although
the cross-border casino consumption per gambler would decrease. While the competition brought
about by Detroit’s casinos hurts neighboring gambling revenues, such a loss in Windsor is less than
Detroit’s gain. Second, a higher wagering tax is more e¤ective in reducing the casino disorder cost
than a casino tax surcharge. That is, it exhibits nonequivalence in the tax burden between the
casino revenue tax and the casino tax surcharge. Third, in contrast to the responses to tax shifts,
a higher commuting cost leads to an intensive margin response whereby the cross-border gamblers
from Detroit to Windsor would decrease, but each gambler would consume more. When a rising
commuting cost discourages cross-border gambling, the city with stronger preferences and a larger
population absorbs greater demand and tax revenue, which are accompanied by higher disorder costs
and income creation. Fourth, the drop in Detroit’s overall gambling population hurts its neighboring
casino, Windsor, more severely. By contrast, Detroit’s casino demand and revenue, tax revenue,
income creation, and disorder costs are more responsive to its proportion of problem gamblers. Fifth,
while individual demand for gambling is more responsive to the wagering tax than the casino tax
surcharge, the government’s tax competition tends to make the cross-border casino competition more
intense regardless of the instruments of the casino tax.
   Moreover, our quantitative welfare analysis leads to several interesting …ndings regarding the op-
timal casino tax policy. First, we establish the optimal policy based on a single casino tax instrument
of a city, given the alternative tax instrument and its rival’s tax policy at the benchmark values. We
…nd that cross-border competition induces both city governments to lower each tax compared to the
pre-existing rate. When the disorder costs in both cities rise by 50% from the benchmark values,
both cities should impose higher tax rates compared to the benchmark case. However, in Detroit
with stronger gambling preferences and higher disorder costs, each tax is raised above the pre-existing
level, whereas in Windsor it is still better to lower the respective taxes below the pre-existing rates.
Second, we conduct a tax incidence exercise, solving the optimal tax mix in a city given its rival’s tax
policy at the benchmark values. We …nd that both cities have favorable tax mixes toward the casino
revenue tax, which may serve to explain why the casino wagering tax is most commonly observed.
However, such an optimal shift from the tax surcharge to the casino revenue tax is more pronounced
in Windsor with weaker preferences toward gambling and lower social disorder costs. Third, we
perform welfare-based pairwise casino competition in one tax instrument, …xing the other tax policy
at the benchmark values. We …nd that in order to better compete with the neighboring casino, it
is optimal to lower casino revenue tax rates and tax surcharges compared to those where the rival’s
tax policy is given (i.e., the optimal policy of a single casino tax obtained above). When the disorder
costs of gambling are less severe, it is optimal for Detroit to aggressively set lower casino taxes in
order to pull in the cross-border visitors via attracting some problem gamblers from Windsor. When


                                                   4
the disorder costs of gambling become su¢ ciently severe, Detroit has to raise its casino taxes by
preventing Windsor’s problem gamblers from crossing the border.
   Furthermore, our model-based quantitative exercises allow us to conduct counterfactual analysis,
in particular, two drastic changes in the commuting cost and the Detroit potential gambling popu-
lation. First, we …nd that had the commuting cost been restored to the pre-911 level, it need not
have favored Windsor: while Windsor’s producer’s surplus and tax revenues would have increased, its
consumer’s surplus and welfare would have fallen as a result of more intense cross-border gambling.
Second, had Detroit maintained its population at the higher level as in 2000, Windsor would have
enjoyed a larger producer’s surplus and tax revenues, but its consumer’s surplus would have fallen
due to more intense cross-border gambling, thus leading to only a modest welfare gain.
   Generally speaking, we have developed a richer framework of …scal competition with “travel
to use” services generating local externalities that could be negative or positive, or, from a di¤erent
angle, a richer framework of spatial competition with competing governments that are active in setting
their optimal tax policy. The theoretical approach developed in this paper can be readily applied
to other broader issues inclusive of (i) tourism competition with negative congestion externalities
accompanied by positive income creation, (ii) spatial competition by sellers to attract customers from
di¤erent locations with tra¢ c and queuing externalities, and (iii) …scal competition for attracting
manufacturing …rms in the presence of negative pollution externalities and positive job creation, to
name but a few. Quantitatively, our welfare and counterfactual analyses provide policy implications
to the casino policymakers of the bordering cities and o¤er new insights into the sparse economic
literature on casino gambling. To date, e¤orts to consider optimal gaming taxation have been limited
primarily to lottery games. In viewing a casino tax as a Pigouvian tax to correct for externalities,
more research is needed to assess the size of the externalities involved and design optimal corrective
taxes as advocated by Anderson (2013). Regarding the counterfactual analysis, Walker (2013) has
stressed that when evaluating the social costs and bene…ts associated with gambling behavior, it is
important to consider a counterfactual scenario, although measuring such social costs and bene…ts
in the counterfactual is empirically di¢ cult. Our model-based quantitative approach o¤ers such
assessment in a systematic manner, which is valuable as well for other broader studies with limited
data.

Related Literature
   In the economics literature, there is a lack of a comprehensive theoretical analysis of casinos in
both positive and normative aspects. There are only rare exceptions. In Sauer (2001), a political
competition model is constructed to study how gambling restrictions lower the level of gambling. By
highlighting three external e¤ects of casino-style gambling (the casino income creation, social disorder
costs, and cross-border gambling), Chang, Lai and Wang (2010) study the entry and tax regulation
of oligopolistically competitive privately-run casinos and government-run casinos in a jurisdiction.


                                                   5
Their attention is exclusively directed at the optimal casino regulation and its welfare e¤ect. The
study of Felsenstein and Freeman (2002) is most closely related to the present study. By applying
the concept of the prisoner’s dilemma, they conduct an empirical analysis on the outcomes of casino
competition between two casinos (Taba and Eilat) located along the Egyptian-Israeli border. A
similar hypothesis is discussed in Thompson and Gazel (1997) and involves the case of casinos along
the border of greater Chicago and Northern Indiana. Nonetheless, none of these previous papers
theoretically examine cross-border casino competition, which is the primary focus of our paper.


2     The Model

Consider two cities, called City 1 and City 2 (i = 1; 2), with populations of potential gamblers denoted
by N1 and N2 , respectively. To focus on cross-border casino competition, we assume that each city
has a single casino …rm (j = 1; 2) which can serve customers from both cities. Such a structure may
capture, for example, Detroit (U.S.) vs. Windsor (Canada), Bellingham (U.S.) vs. British Columbia
(Canada), or Eilat (Israel) vs. Taba (Egypt). In each city, we distinguish two kinds of gamblers:
problem (addicted) and recreational (regular) gamblers, given the fact that problem and recreational
gamblers exhibit di¤erent demand for casino gambling. Recreational gamblers constitute n1 and n2
(normal) percent of the population in City 1 and City 2, respectively.
    In the face of the casino prices fp1 ; p2 g of the two bordering casinos, residents in City i decide
whether to gamble locally at casino j = i, or to gamble across the border at casino j 6= i. Cross-
border casino visitors incur a (symmetric) commuting cost %ij = %ji = T (j 6= i), with the intracity
commuting cost being normalized to zero (%ii = 0). Note that T may also capture the barriers to
cross-border gambling. We assume that residents in City 1 have higher preferences for casino gambling
than those in City 2, which is captured by the preference parameters     H   >   L.   In addition, residents
in the two cities have di¤erent levels of income, denoted by I1 and I2 , respectively.


2.1   Gamblers’Optimization

We focus on the behavior of the gambling population. In the welfare analysis below, we will account
for the negative and positive externalities of gambling on the entire society, inclusive of the non-
gambling population.
    Each resident in City i derives utility from casino gambling xi and from consuming a composite
good qi (which acts as a numéraire). Within a speci…c City i, residents only di¤er in their moral costs
"i (in forms of disutility) with respect to gambling in their own city. The moral cost "i is uniformly
distributed over [0; Ni ]. Let m stand for the type of gamblers, i.e., m = P (problem gamblers) or
m = R (recreational gamblers). It is natural to assume that problem gamblers are less sensitive
morally, i.e., "i;P < "i;R . In addition to this internal moral cost, there are attendant externalities


                                                   6
generated by casino gambling, which are referred to as negative disorder costs, denoted by DCi , and
positive income creations, denoted by ICi . The disorder costs capture any social costs caused by
compulsive addictions, productivity losses, the problems of alcohol/drug abuse and crimes, as well
as other social pathologies and disturbances. The casino income creations are perceived to generate
widespread economic bene…ts to local businesses and industries. Individuals are atomistic, taking
these externalities as given, when they make decisions. We will discuss the welfare e¤ects of the
negative externalities in the next section.
     By the nature of discrete choice, we can de…ne an indicator function                                     i   with   i   = 1 indicating
gambling in the own city’s casino and                    i   = 0 indicating cross-border gambling. Accordingly, each
agent’s utility function, taking the quasi-linear form, can be speci…ed as follows:

                            $i   ;m     =      ln(xi;m         m)    + qi;m        i "i;m      DCi + ICi ;                              (1)

where     = H if i = 1 and                  = L if i = 2 as well as                 m    =     P      > 0 for problem gamblers and
 m   =     R   < 0 for recreational gamblers. The Stone-Geary utility function re‡ects the necessity
nature of casino goods for heavily addicted problem gamblers, with                                      R   measuring the recreational
gamblers’ relative income elasticity of casino goods to the composite good. Each agent (for both
problem and recreational gamblers) has a two-stage decision process. In Stage 1, he makes a discrete
choice, deciding on which casino to visit; in Stage 2, he then chooses the amount of casino gambling,
together with the quantity of composite good consumption. We can thus de…ne:

                                            xi;m ( i ) =         i xii;m   + (1         i )xij;m ;

                                            qi;m ( i ) =         i qii;m   + (1         i )qij;m ;

                                            %i;m ( i ) =         i   %ii;m + (1          i )%ij;m :


     Solving backward, the Stage 2 optimization is given by,

                 $i   ;m ( i ; "i;m )   = max                ln(xi;m        m)    + qi;m         i "i;m     DCi + ICi ;
                                            xi;m; qi;m

subject to
                   (1 + t) qi;m ( i ) + [1 + (1 + sj ) t] pj xi;m ( i ) + %i ( i ) = Ii + xi;m ( i );                                   (2)

where t is the consumption tax rate imposed on the composite good and sj is a tax surcharge
imposed on the consumption of the casino service. Concerning casino pricing, pj is the price per
dollar gambled (including the gambling-related products and services) and                                         is the return to player
(RTP) percentage.
     We note that, in most forms of gambling, the price of the gamble is not easily observed by
consumers. Yet, casinos usually reveal the RTP percentage to their customers, serving as an indicator
of the long-term expected payback percentage from wagers. In the empirical literature on casino
demand, the price elasticities are estimated based on the percentage of each dollar wagered that is

                                                                      7
retained by casinos, or, in our notation, 1                        . However, most casinos have exercised other pricing
strategies beyond this. For example, casinos usually provide hotel and dining discounts and other
entertainment o¤ers as well as free money for gaming (i.e., the so-called “house money”). On the
contrary, some casinos may charge entry fees and/or impose withholds. While discounts, o¤ers and
free money lower the casino price, entry fees and withholds raise it. Thus, the win percentage in our
model is more general, captured by pj                       .
     Given that many games have …xed rules and the speci…c RTP or payout ratio cannot easily be
altered (at least not in a continuous way as typical prices), we assume that                                       is an institutional
constant not adjusting with prices and is set to be identical for both casinos. Moreover, to focus on
gambling-related taxes, we assume that the consumption tax rate t on the composite good is also
identical in both cities.
     In Stage 1 the optimization problem is simply:

                                vi   ;m ("i;m )     = maxf$i         ;m (0; "i;m ); $ i ;m (1; "i;m )g:


Thus, the discrete choice is to gamble in the agent’s own city if $i                           ;m (1; "i )   $i   ;m (0; "i );   otherwise,
cross-border gambling occurs. To an agent residing in City i, the discrete choice is captured by,

                                                i   = arg max $i            ;m ( i ; "i;m );
                                                                i 2f0;1g


where "i;P 2 [0; (1       ni )Ni ] and "i;R 2 [(1               ni )Ni ; Ni ] given that problem gamblers are less sensitive
morally.
     We now are ready to solve the gambler’s optimization problem, starting with Stage 2. Let                                             i

be the Lagrange multiplier associated with the agent’s budget constraint (2). Thus, the …rst-order
conditions with respect to the variables xi and qi in Stage 2 are:

                                                                fpj [1 + (1 + sj ) t]      g = 0;                                       (3)
                                     xi;m           m

                                                        1           (1 + t) = 0;                                                        (4)

which can be combined to yield (j 6= i),

                                                        i  (1 + t)                    (1     i)  (1 + t)
                        xi;m ( i )      m   =                                   +                        :
                                                pi [1 + (1 + si ) t]                pj [1 + (1 + sj ) t]

     To solve the Stage 1 optimization problem, we use (2) to write:

                                                    [Ii + xi;m ( i )-%i ( i )- [1+ (1+sj ) t] pj xi;m ( i )]
$i   ;m ( i ; "i;m )=   ln (xi;m ( i )-     m) +                                                             -DCi +ICi - i "i;m :
                                                                             1+t
An agent residing in City i compares the values (indirect utilities) obtained in Stage 2 to choose his
gambling location. Since all agents in a particular city are identical except for their moral costs,



                                                                       8
there must be a single cuto¤ "i;P ("i;R ) under which $i                                ;P (0; "i;P )   = $i       ;P (1; "i;P )   ($i   ;R (0; "i;R )   =
$i   ;R (1; "i;R ))
                for problem (recreational) gamblers. Thus, we have:

     To be more speci…c, we can write out City 1 residents’ demands for the casino and composite
goods, respectively, as follows:

                                                 H(1 + t)                                           (1 + t)

By analogy, City 2 residents’demands for the casino and composite goods are:

From (5) and (7), we can derive the demand elasticity of problem and recreational gamblers, respec-

   Accordingly, we have:

Proposition 1: (Demand Elasticity of Problem and Recreational Gamblers) The demand
elasticity for casino gambling is smaller for problem gamblers than for recreational gamblers, both
rising with the constant payout ratio . It is greater than one for recreational gamblers and less than

Proof : All proofs are relegated to the Appendix.

Anderson (2013) and Philander (2014) argued that the overall demand for casino gambling comprises
two quite di¤erent groups of gamblers, each with distinct demand characteristics. Problem gamblers,
not being very responsive to price given their addictions and compulsions, may have very inelastic
demand. Other gamblers without such addictions and compulsions may have much more elastic
demand. The …nding of Proposition 1 corroborates their argument.
   We now solve the second stage problem which determines the gambling location. By focusing
on City 1, substituting (5)-(8) into the resident’s utility function (1) yields the respective values
associated with gambling locations, v11;m ("i;m ) and v12;m ("i;m ) where m = P or m = R. Thus, "1;m

   From (11)-(14), we can characterize the schedules of the cross-border gambling intensities. To do
so, we de…ne the proportion of the overall cross-border patrons (                         CB = [(1 ni )Ni "i;P ]+[Ni "i;R ] ) as
                                                                                          i                  Ni
                                                                                CB        (1 ni )Ni "i;P
well as the proportion of the cross-border problem patrons (                    i;P   =     (1 ni )Ni    ) and the proportion
                                                     CB            Ni "i;R
of the cross-border recreational patrons (           i;R   =        ni Ni )     for City i. With these de…nitions, we
establish the following proposition:

Proposition 2: (Cross-border Gambling Intensity Schedules) Given                                               P   >     R (a su¢ cient
but not necessary condition), the overall cross-border gambling intensity schedule (                                   CB ) is upward-
                                                                                                                       i
sloping in its own price ( pi ) and shifts outward in response to a higher casino tax surcharge imposed
in its own city ( si ), a lower casino tax surcharge in its rival city ( sj ), or a lower commuting cost
( T ). The cross-border gambling intensities for both problem (                       CB )   and recreational patrons (           CB )
                                                                                      i;P                                         i;R
are decreasing in the commuting cost ( T ). While the cross-border gambling intensity for problem
gamblers always increases with its own casino price, that for recreational patrons may not.

Under a reasonable condition     P   >       R,   the cross-border gambling intensities are positively related
to their own casino prices. Overall, a higher casino price pi or tax surcharge si encourages city
i’s own gamblers to engage in cross-border gambling,                   CB .     Yet, due to substitution between casino
                                                                       i
goods and non-casino composite goods, recreational gamblers, in response to either form of consumer
casino price increase (pi or si ), may be better o¤ staying in their own casino rather than crossing the
border to gamble, thereby resulting in the ambiguity e¤ect of own prices on cross-border gambling.
Interestingly, because there is no such substitution e¤ect for problem gamblers, higher own prices
always induce more cross-border gambling and such e¤ects become the dominating forces driving
the overall cross-border gambling intensity as long as                 P    >    R.   With regard to commuting costs, a
higher T unambiguously discourages cross-border gambling regardless of the type of gamblers.


2.2   Firms’Optimization

To match the reality, the two bordering casinos are assumed to engage in Bertrand price-competition
against each other for cross-border gambling. Let                      H
                                                                            measure the extent of City 1’s preference
                                                                        L

bias toward casino gambling. Thus, the aggregate demand for casinos in City i, Xi , can be derived
from (5), (7), and (11)-(14):

                        (1 + t) L
           =                                    "2;P + "2;R                (1    n2 )N2 + [(2                n1 )N1       ("1;P + "1;R )]
                 p2 [1 + (1 + s2 ) t]
                 + "2;P + (1 n1 )N1              "1;P       P          "2;R + N1          (1           n2 )N2     "1;R      R:                     (16)

It is important to note that the aggregate demand schedule depends on both the intensive margin
                      (1+t) L
(via the term    pi [1+(1+si )t]   ) and the extensive margin associated with cross-border gambling (via
"1;m and "2;m ). Due to cross-border gambling, the aggregate casino demand of a particular city
                                                                                                              @Xi (p1 )
is unambiguously increasing in the population of its neighboring city,                                         @Nj        > 0. This result is
in accordance with empirical observations: the prevalence of state and national borders serving as
a casino location is invariably the result of the presence of a large market across the border. For
example, Windsor casinos have been targeted in the metropolitan market of Detroit (Deloitte-Touche,
1995; Eadington, 1999), Macau casinos in China and Hong Kong (Eadington, 1995; Hobson, 1995),
and Taba in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Beer Sheva (Felsenstein and Freeman, 2002).
   Assume that the casinos in either city have an identical constant marginal cost c, which allows
us to focus on casino taxation. In each City i, there is a casino revenue (variable) tax                                           i   and a …xed
licensing fee fi (or operating permit). In practice, the revenue tax (i.e., wagering tax) is the most
common form of taxation (see Suits, 1979). Faced with the casino taxation, the rival city’s casino
price pj (j 6= i) and its own demand schedule Xi given above ((15) and (16), respectively), each
casino …rm sets its own price pi to maximize its pro…t:

                            max     i (pi )   = (1          i ) (pi         )Xi (pi )         ci Xi (pi )       fi :                               (17)
                              pi

are the respective price elasticities of aggregate casino demand in the two cities (in absolute value).
                                                                            ci Ei
We can rewrite the …rst-order condition as pi                   =      (1   i )(Ei 1)
                                                                                      ,    indicating that Ei > 1 must hold
true. That is, the presence of cross-border casino gambling provides an outside option to gamblers,
thus leading to an elastic aggregate demand for casino services.
    The aggregate price elasticities of casino demand are crucial to the cross-border casino compe-
tition: any variables that a¤ect E1 and/or E2 will have direct consequences for casino-competition
outcomes. It is thereby useful to characterize these elasticity schedules which are rewritten as:

     E1 = A1 E1;R + (1               A1 ) E1;P                                                                                         (20)

We can easily see that each elasticity is a weighted average of problem (with weights B1P and B2P )
and recreational (with weights B1R and B2R ) gamblers’individual elasticities adjusted by their “travel
to use gambling services” C1R , C1P , C2R , and C2P (all positive). Using Propositions 1 and 2 and
noting the independence of "1;m and "2;m of the population (m 2 fP; Rg), we obtain:

Proposition 3: (Price Elasticity of Overall Casino Demand) In the presence of casino compe-
tition, travel to use gambling services results in a higher price elasticity of demand for casino gambling
in each city (in absolute value). Moreover, the price elasticity of aggregate casino demand ( Ei )

(i) is increasing in the own city’s casino price ( pi ) or tax surcharge ( si ) and decreasing in the rival
       city’s casino price and tax surcharge, but is independent of the …xed licensing fee ( fi );

(ii) decreases with the population of the rival city ( Nj , j 6= i), while ambiguously responding to the
       own city’s population ( Ni );

Furthermore, a lower commuting cost T raises the price elasticity of aggregate casino demand in the
city with a stronger taste for gambling (City 1), but reduces that in the rival city (City 2).

                                                              13
        The aggregate demand schedule in each city, given by (15) and (16), depends on both the intensive
and extensive margins. Both margins depend negatively on the own casino price and tax surcharge
and their interplay leads to a more elastic aggregate demand for casino gambling. By contrast, there
is an opposing response to an increase in either the price or the tax surcharge in the rival city. Under
Bertrand competition, the price elasticities of demand and hence the casino prices are una¤ected by
the …xed licensing fee.
        Due to cross-border gambling, a larger population size in one city (say, N1 ) increases the aggregate
demand for casino gambling in the neighboring city (say, X2 ); hence, the price elasticity of aggregate
demand for casino gambling in the rival city (say, E2 ) becomes lower in response. It is intriguing to
note that, as a result of cross-border gambling and di¤erential responses of recreational and problem
gamblers, the e¤ects of the own city’s population on the aggregate demand and aggregate price
elasticity are generally ambiguous. Of particular interest, the price elasticities of aggregate demand
in both cities have asymmetric responses to a lower commuting cost T . A lower commuting cost
encourages agents to cross the border to gamble. Since City 1 residents have a stronger preference
for casino gambling, the net ‡ows of cross-border gambling from City 1 are more pronounced, making
City 1’s aggregate demand for casinos more elastic. Consequently, E1 increases whereas E2 decreases.5


3        Equilibrium

We are now prepared to de…ne the casino competition equilibrium, followed by outlining the welfare
measures.


3.1        Equilibrium Casino Prices

The equilibrium concept adopted here is the Nash equilibrium. Speci…cally, a casino competition
equilibrium is a pair of casino prices (p1 ; p2 ) representing an individual casino …rm’s best responses
given its rival city’s casino pricing, i.e., (18) and (19). Under the condition that each city’s casino
…rm is more responsive to its own price changes, we are able to establish the existence and uniqueness
of the casino competition equilibrium.

Theorem 1: (Existence and Uniqueness of a Non-Degenerate Equilibrium) There exists a
non-degenerate unique casino competition equilibrium set of casino prices (p1 ; p2 ).

As shown in Figure 1, the pair of equilibrium casino prices (p1 ; p2 ) is determined at point A, which
is the intersection between the best response of Casino 1 (R1) and Casino 2 (R2).
    5
        Notably, by construction, our comparative statics are restricted to responses to small changes. Should there be a
large reduction in T causing an interior solution to become a corner solution with problem gamblers in City 1 no longer
engaging in cross-border gambling, lower commuting costs may generate ambiguous e¤ects on aggregate elasticities.

       Figure 1. Equilibrium Casino Prices
   With a unique equilibrium established, we can now examine the responses of the equilibrium
casino prices to changes in the tax policy (                     i   and si ), the commuting cost (T ), and the population
size (Ni ). These comparative statics results are summarized in the following proposition:

Proposition 4: (Equilibrium Casino Prices) In the presence of casino competition, increasing
the revenue tax rate in either city (              1   or   2)   increases the equilibrium casino prices p1 and p2 . These
equilibrium casino prices, however, have an ambiguous response to the casino tax surcharge si , the
population size Ni , and the commuting cost T .

It is clear from (18) and (19) that the revenue tax (i.e., the wagering tax which is the most common
form of tax applied to casino games) has a more direct e¤ect on the equilibrium casino prices and,
therefore, increasing either        1   or     2   unambiguously raises both city’s casino prices p1 and p2 . Intu-
itively, when Detroit raises the revenue tax rate                        1   imposed on its casino, the casino will pass the
tax burden through to its consumers, resulting in a higher p1 . In addition, a higher                            1   also leads the
demand for Windsor’s casino to become less elastic, allowing the Windsor casino to raise its price
p2 , too. Since a city’s casino …rm is more responsive to its own price change, the relative price of
the Windsor casino p (= p2 =p1 ) decreases in response. In a way di¤ering from the wagering tax,
the casino tax surcharge si , the population size Ni , and the commuting cost T indirectly a¤ect the
equilibrium casino prices through their in‡uence on the overall price elasticities of casino demand E1
and E2 . As such, their overall e¤ects are complicated, and will be studied numerically in Section 5
below.


3.2      Welfare Measures and Casino Externalities

A standard measure of welfare consists of the consumer’s surplus (CSi ), producer’s surplus (P Si ),
and tax revenues (T Ri ). Speci…cally in relation to our casino competition model, tax revenues stem
from gambling activities, whereas the consumer’s surplus must add the casino income creation (ICi )
and subtract the social disorder costs (DCi ). Thus, the consumer’s surpluses of City 1 and City 2
are given by, respectively:

CS1 = [      H   ln(x11;P -    P )-p1 (1+(1+s1 )t)x11;P -1]"1;P +[ H (ln x12;P - P )-p2 (1+(1+s2 )t)x12;P -T ][(1-n1 )N1 -"1;P ]

           +[    H   ln(x11;R +    R)        p1 (1 + (1 + s1 )t)x11;R            1]["1;R   (1       n1 )N1 ]                          (22)
           +[    H (ln x12;R   +   R)        p2 (1 + (1 + s2 )t)x12;R            T ](N1    "1;R )      DC1 + IC1 ;

CS2 = [      L ln(x22;P - P )-p2 (1+(1+s2 )t)x22;P -1]"2;P +[ H (ln x21;P - P )-p1 (1+(1+s1 )t)x21;P -T ][(1-n2 )N2 -"2;P ]

           +[    L ln(x22;R    +   R)    p2 (1 + (1 + s2 )t)x22;R                1]["2;R   (1       n2 )N2 ]                          (23)
           +[    L (ln x21;R   +   R)    p1 (1 + (1 + s1 )t)x21;R                T ](N2    "2;R )     DC2 + IC2 :

   Of the social costs that are attributed to gambling, problem/pathological gambling is one of
the most noticeable. While only a small percentage of gamblers may exhibit problem/pathological

                                                                       15
gambling behavior, such people cause signi…cant social costs (Walker, 2013, chapter 6). Thus, the
overall social disorder costs DCi caused by both problem gamblers DCi;P and recreational gamblers
DCi;R are given by:
                                        DCi = di (DCi;P + z DCi;R );                                                  (24)

where di > 0 is a scaling parameter of the casino disorder costs for City i and 0 < z < 1, indicating
that, relative to recreational gamblers, problem gamblers generate more disorder costs to the society.
To be more speci…c, the social costs caused by problem gamblers for Cities 1 and 2, respectively, are:

          1      2      3
 DC1;P =DC1;P +DC1;P +DC1;P =f"1;P x11;P + c [(1-n2 )N2 -"2;P ]x21;P +                 a [(1-n1 )N1 -"1;P ]x12;P g;
          1      2      3
 DC2;P =DC2;P +DC2;P +DC2;P =f"2;P x22;P + c [(1-n1 )N1 -"1;P ]x12;P +                 a [(1-n2 )N2 -"2;P ]x21;P g;   (25)

and the social costs caused by recreational gamblers for Cities 1 and 2, respectively, are:

          1      2      3
 DC1;R =DC1;R +DC1;R +DC1;R =f["1;R -(1-n1 )N1 ]x11;R + c (N2 -"2;R )x21;R +                 a (N1 -"1;R )x12;R g;
          1      2      3
 DC2;R =DC2;R +DC2;R +DC2;R =f["2;R -(1-n2 )N2 ]x22;R + c (N1 -"1;R )x12;R +                  a (N2 -"2;R )x21;R g;   (26)

where   c   and   a   are positive but less than one. To measure the social disorder costs caused by both
types of gamblers, we need to di¤erentiate between the local and the external gamblers –this leads
to three distinct measures of casino externalities. First, as stressed by Eadington (2007) and Chang,
Lai and Wang (2010), the disorder costs associated with local gamblers should be viewed as much
                                                    1
more severe. These disorder costs are captured by DC1;m                  1
                                                        for City 1 and DC2;m for City 2, where
m = P or m = R. Second, gamblers coming from the other city may also cause problems related to
                                                                                               2
crime and drugs, which bring costs to this city. We capture these casino costs by specifying DC1;m
                 2
for City 1 and DC2;m for City 2 with            < 1. Third, a speci…c city’s residents who cross the border
                                            c
to gamble could also generate disorder costs for their own city, including the problems of compulsive
                                                                                            3
addictions, productivity losses and other social pathologies. These costs are captured by DC1;m for
             3
City 1 and DC2;m for City 2 with again              < 1.
                                                a
   The casino income creation ICi for City i is assumed to be a proportion of the casino’s revenues:

                                         ICi = ai [(pi            )Xi (pi )];                                         (27)

which includes the job creation in the casino industry and in other casino-related industries. Walker
and Jackson (2008) and Walker (2013) …nd that U.S. gambling industries (lotteries and horse and
dog racing) cannibalize each other. Thus, the multiplier of income creation is assumed to be less
than one, i.e., 0      ai   1.
   The producer’s surplus is simply measured by the casino …rm’s pro…ts, reported in (17). In
addition, the tax revenues of City i stem from the casino tax surcharge, revenue tax, and …xed fees:

                                   T Ri = [(1 + si )tpi +       i (pi    )]Xi + fi :                                  (28)

                                                           16
Of particular interest, included in this tax revenue measure are export-based tax revenues (EBTi )
collected exclusively from external gamblers:

                     EBT1 = (1 + s1 )tp1 f[(1         n2 )N2    "2;P ]x21;P + (N2   "2;R )x21;R g;   (29)
                     EBT2 = (1 + s2 )tp2 f[(1         n1 )N1    "1;P ]x12;P + (N1   "1;R )x12;R g:

        We can then write City i’s welfare as:

                                              Wi = CSi + P Si + T Ri :                               (30)

Due to more severe social disorder costs associated with local gamblers, Eadington (1995) argues that
economic bene…ts are maximized when the city exports its gambling services to nonlocal gamblers. In
our model, to maximize the social welfare, an active government may attempt to export casino services
and to capture external sources of tax revenues, as well as to “roll over” negative net externalities
(casino disorder costs minus income creation). To elaborate on the government’s casino policy and
derive policy implications, we shall further quantify the welfare measure from the border casino
competition, to which we now turn.


4        Quantitative Analysis

In this section, we will quantitatively characterize the steady-state equilibrium, conduct welfare
exercises and perform counterfactual analyses, based on calibrated parametrization. Speci…cally, we
will calibrate the model to …t the cross-border casino competition between Detroit and Windsor –one
of the most relentless forms of casino competition whereby some interesting counterfactual analyses
may be conducted.


4.1        Calibration

We begin by obtaining relevant observations from Detroit and Windsor using data from various
sources. The benchmark parameter values are summarized in Table 1.
        The population size of potential gamblers is computed based on the average population over the
age of 20.6 Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau during the period 2000-2012, we calculate
Detroit’s average population over the age of 20 as P OP1 = 629:087 (in thousands); using data from
Statistics Canada, the comparable …gure (averaged over 2001-2011) for Windsor is P OP2 = 239:82
(in thousands). According to the reports of Gullickson and Hartmann (2006) and Dalton et al.
(2012), the gambling participation rate is 66% in Ontario (based on at least one gambling activity in
the past 12 months during 2007-2008), while it is around 71% in Michigan (based on the surveys on
    6
        The minimum casino gambling age is 21 in Detroit and is 19 in Windsor.

gambling behaviors in Michigan in 2001 and 2006). Thus, we can obtain the population sizes of the
potential gamblers in Detroit and Windsor as N1 = 629:087 0:71 = 446:652 and N2 = 239:82 0:66 =
158:283, respectively. There are two types of gamblers: problem and recreational gamblers. Williams,
Volberg and Stevens (2012) estimate the population of problem gamblers showing that 2:1% of
Michigan adults are estimated to manifest a gambling disorder (based on the 2012 U.S. Census
Bureau investigation for 7,234,755 persons age 18 and over as well as four Michigan problem gambling
prevalence studies in 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2006). This implies that in Detroit the population size of
problem gamblers is about (1 n1 )N1 = 2:1% 446:652 = 9:379 (in thousands). Moreover, Cox et al.
(2005) estimate that problem gamblers constitute around 2% of the population in Ontario, referring
the population of problem gamblers to (1              n2 )N2 = 2%      158:283 = 3:166 in Windsor. Over the
period 2006-2011, the median household income is on average about I1 = $29; 526 in Detroit and
I2 = $38; 047 in Windsor (all in US$).
       Next, we compute the casino revenue tax (wagering tax) and tax surcharge rates. The wagering
tax is levied based on the casino revenues, i.e., the Adjusted Gross Receipts (AGR, or casino win) of
the game. The AGR represent a casino’s gross revenue (the price of a $1 wagering handle pi times
the total amount wagered by gamblers Xi ) minus the payout (the amount of winnings paid out to
gamblers, i.e., the return to player (RTP) percentage            times the total amount wagered by gamblers
Xi ), that is, AGRi = (pi           )Xi .7 In practice, the RTP varies for di¤erent casino games. As for casino
slot machines, the RTP percentage              can vary from 82% to 98%.8;9 We take averages and choose
  = 0:9 for both casinos. In Detroit, casinos are required to pay a 19% tax on their gross gaming
                                                          f1
revenues (AGR) and a …xed fee, which is about            AGR1   = 1:25% of the gross gaming revenues (see the
2013 American Gaming Association (AGA) Survey of Casino Entertainment). In Windsor, casinos
are required to pay the government of Ontario a “win contribution” (i.e., gaming tax) of                    2   = 20%
                                                                                         f2
of the gaming revenue, along with a municipal hosting fee which is around               AGR2   = 1:3% of the gross
gaming revenues (see the report Potential Commercial Casino in Toronto, 2012).10 Since the sales
tax rates are 6% in Detroit and 5% in Windsor, we take averages to set t = 5:5%. Thus, in Detroit
the casino tax surcharge sj t could result in a 4:4% gaming excise tax, so the e¤ective tax surcharge
           1+(1+s1 )t        s1 t
is s~1 =     (1+t)      1=   1+t    = 0:0417. In Canada there is a 7:5% harmonized good and service tax
                                                                                                    0:075
imposed on gambling activities and the e¤ective tax surcharge of Windsor is s~2 =                  1+5:5%   = 0:071.
These imply that s1 = 0:8 and s2 = 1:361.

depending crucially on the average number of trips for cross-border gambling. According to the 2006
AGA Survey, more than one quarter of the U.S. adult population (52.8 million) visited a casino in
2005, making a total of 322 million trips, with 6.1 trips per gambler on average. In our model, the
                                                                 [(1 n1 )N1 "1;P ]+(N1 "1;R )+[(1 n2 )N2 "2;P ]+(N2 "2;R )
fraction of the cross-border gamblers is given by:                                       N1 +N2                            .
With the average number of casino trips per gambler being 6.1 per year, the average cross-border trips
                          [(1 n1 )N1 "1;P ]+(N1 "1;R )+[(1 n2 )N2 "2;P ]+(N2 "2;R )
are ACBT = 6:1                                    N1 +N2                            .   The Detroit-Windsor Tunnel
charges a toll (per round-trip) of $9:25. To calculate the time cost of commuting, we use an observed
average hourly wage for Detroit and Windsor of $23:5 over the period 2006-2012.11 Based on an
average commuting time per trip of 3 hours, the time costs per trip become $23:5                             3. Using an
average gasoline cost of $2:43 per hour of driving, we obtain the gasoline cost per trip of $2:43                      3.12
Thus, on average the cross-border commuting cost is given by:

                                          T = [3(23:5 + 2:43) + 9:25] ACBT:                                            (31)

       We now compute the fraction of cross-border gambling activities. Before the opening of the
Detroit casinos (before 2000), it is estimated that approximately four …fths of the gambling business
in the Windsor casino was accounted for by metropolitan Detroiters (Wacker, 2006). Similarly,
Canadian o¢ cials’ estimates show that 80% of Windsor’s gamblers were U.S. residents (Ankeny,
1998). However, nowadays there has been a signi…cant drop in such cross-border business, due both
to the opening of Detroit casinos and to the tighter restrictions on U.S. border controls. Prior to the
September 11, 2001 attacks, passage between Detroit and Windsor was quite easy, with only oral
con…rmation of identity generally providing enough to gain entry either to the United States or to
Canada. After 911, the U.S. government tightened entry regulations by requiring passport or birth
and identity documentation as well as extensive questioning and even random searches of vehicles
(Ryan, 2012). Security hassles and long lines at the border led many Americans to stay home rather
than travel abroad for gambling.13 As a result, between 60% and 70% of the business of the Windsor
casino currently comes from across the border (Duggan, 2009 and Hall, 2009), while U.S. customers
still represent a crucial portion of business for Caesars (Battagello, 2014).14 To capture the downward
trend, we set the fraction of the casino consumption of Windsor coming from Detroit (F CW D) as:
                                     [(1     n1 )N1   "1;P ]x12;P +(N1        "1;R )x12;R
  F CW D=                                                                                                         =0:613:

     The Detroit-Windsor tunnel tra¢ c decreased from 5.9 million vehicles in 2001 to 3.6 in 2010. Daily tra¢ c has
fallen from around 18,000 visitors before 9/11 to about 13,000 visitors now.

      Caesars Windsor is not exactly certain how much of the local casino’s business may have recently come from across
the border.

      In addition, further insight is needed in order to compute the relative gambling revenue. Notably,
there are three casinos (MotorCity Casino, MGM Grand Detroit, and Greektown Casino) in Detroit
city, while there is only one casino (Caesars Windsor) in Windsor. Based on the OLG (Ontario Lot-
tery and Gaming Corporation) Annual Reports, on average the casino in Windsor (Caesars Windsor)
generated around 556 million CAD in gross casino revenues per year during the period 2000-2012.
Computed from the data of the Michigan Gaming Control Board, the average gross revenue of casinos
per year in Detroit was around 1:209 billion USD during the period 2000-2012, implying around 403
million USD for each casino.15 Given the fact that the average CAD to USD exchange rate is about
                                                                                                    AGR2

1:338. By using (15) and (16), we can thus express the relative AGR of the Windsor casino to the
Detroit casino (RR) as follows:

                AGR2       (p      )X2
  RR =                  = 2                                                                                     (33)
                AGR1       (p1     )X1

           =                                                                                               =1:338:

      Moreover, we can rewrite the …rst-order conditions for the prices of both cities:
                                              (1     1 ) (p1        )   c1
                                         1=                                  E1 ;                               (34)
                                                    (1         1 ) p1

                                              (1     2 ) (p2        )   c2
                                         1=                                  E2 ;                               (35)
                                                    (1         2 ) p2

and accordingly obtain the equilibrium relative price ratio as follows:
                                                     1
                                    p    (1         E1 )(1         1 )[(1    2)     + c2 ]
                                 p = 2 =             1                                       ;                  (36)
                                    p1   (1         E2 )(1         2 )[(1    1)     + c1 ]

where E1 and E2 are the gross (pre-tax) price elasticities of (overall) demand for Casinos 1 and 2 in
equilibrium. In the calibration, the price of a unit bet pi is calculated by using the take-out withhold
which is the fraction of wagers placed by bettors that is withheld by the casino. A reasonable range
for the average take-out withholding rates is around 15:5%                    26:4%. We thus set the withholding
              1
rate (1      p1 )   at around 22% for the Detroit casino, implying that the price paid for a $1 wagering
handle is p1 = 1:284 and the overall house advantage is (p1                   ) = 0:384.
      Generally speaking, problem gamblers, not being very responsive to price given their addictions
and compulsions, have inelastic demand, while regular gamblers without such addictions and com-
pulsions may have much more elastic demand (Anderson, 2013). The problem gamblers’ demand
curve, however, is nested within the demand curve for all gamblers but cannot be observed because
problem gamblers do not declare themselves and the data cannot break down totals into money from

problem gamblers and money from recreational gamblers (Forrest, 2010). Given this di¢ culty, we
focus on the Detroit gamblers who visit their own casino and set the demand elasticity of problem
gamblers as
                                                       @x11;P p1
                                            e11;P =                = 0:83;                                              (37)
                                                         @p1 x11;P
and the demand elasticity of regular gamblers as
                                                       @x11;R p1
                                            e11;R =               = 1:75:                                               (38)
                                                        @p1 x11;R

These demand elasticities are within a reasonable range of the elasticity estimates on the wagering
handle from 0:75 to 1:9 (see Nichols and Tosun, 2013 and Frontier Economics, 2014 for comprehensive
surveys) and are also consistent with the estimates in Thalheimer and Ali (2003) and Landers (2008),
covering both elastic (greater than one) and inelastic (less than one) demands.
       With the derivatives of "1;P , "1;R , "2;P , and "2;R , (31)-(38) allow us to calibrate                H   = 1802,
 L     = 1766:6,    p   = 4061,   r   = 12, T = 191:67, c1 = 0:307, c2 = 0:282, and p = 0:981 (implying
p2 = 1:26). As a consequence,                H
                                                 = 1:02 and all other prices and quantities, namely, "1;P , "1;R ,
                                             L

"2;P , "2;R , x11;P , x11;R , x12;P , x12;R , x21;P , x21;R , x22;P , x22;R , X1 , and X2 , can be computed (see
Table 1). In the calibrated benchmark, all problem gamblers in both cities visit their own casino, i.e.,
"1;P = (1       n1 )N1 and "2;P = (1      n2 )N2 . The evidence indicates that problem gamblers are frequent
gamblers and often gamble in local casinos. People who live close to a casino are twice as likely to
become problem gamblers as people who live more than 10 miles away.16 In the next subsection, we
will examine under what conditions these problem gamblers who give rise to signi…cant social costs
will cross the border to gamble.
       The average ratio of the commuting costs to the income of the cross-border gamblers (i.e.,
       [((1 n1 )N1 "1;P )+(N1 "1;R )]I1 +[((1 n2 )N2 "2;P )+(N2 "2;R )]I2
T =f      [((1 n1 )N1 "1;P )+(N1 "1;R )]+[((1 n2 )N2 "2;P )+(N2 "2;R )] ])   is around 0:63%, which seems very rea-
sonable. Moreover, the equilibrium proportion of the cross-border gamblers for Detroit (                              CB      =
                                                                                                                      1
[(1 n1 )N1 "1;P ]+[N1 "1;R ]                                                        CB       [(1 n2 )N2 "2;P ]+[N2   "2;R ]
            N1                 = 49:6%) is larger than that for Windsor (           2    =               N2                   =
12:1%), which is consistent with common observations. The evidence also reveals that problem gam-
blers constitute a much larger share of the population of gamblers who enter a casino, contributing
to 40       60% of slot machine revenue (Narayanan and Manchanda, 2011). In our parametrization,
the casino consumption of problem gamblers is more than 2 times as high as that of regular gam-
blers. The house advantage refers to the mathematical edge maintained by gambling operators that
ensures the house ends up making money over the long term. In our parametrization, the overall
house advantage is (p1             ) = 0:384 for the Detroit casino and (p2                  ) = 0:36 for the Windsor
casino. Accordingly, the gross rate of pro…t is around 19:03% for the Detroit casino and 20:56% for
the Windsor casino, which are empirically reasonable.17

   Furthermore, we calculate the multiplier of casino income creation ai from (27). Tannenwald
(1995) shows a multiplier of 1:23 per casino job. With the median household income Ii , the multiplier
of casino income creation ai can be calculated by:
                                                    1:23(CEi Ii )
                                           ai =                     ;                                       (39)
                                                   (pi    )Xi (pi )
where CEi is the casino employment in City i. The average number of the employed workers in
Detroit’s casino is CE1 = 2:657 (in thousands) and in the counterpart in Windsor is CE2 = 2:833.
Accordingly, we can obtain a1 = 0:267 for Detroit and a1 = 0:281 for Windsor. The calculation
of the disorder costs is more complicated. The National Opinion Research Center has investigated
the relationship between problem and pathological gambling and general measures of social well-
being. In addition to high rates of mental health problems and poor general health, high rates of
job loss, divorce, bankruptcy, arrest, and incarceration were found to be associated with problem
and pathological gambling (see Casino and Gaming: Research Brief (2014, Sustainability Accounting
Standards Board, for the details). It has been shown that (i) the rates of arrest and incarceration,
respectively, were 32:3% and 21:4% for pathological gamblers, 36:3% and 10:4% for problem gamblers,
11:1% and 3:7% for low-risk gamblers, and 4:5% and 0:4% for non-gamblers; (ii) rates of past-year
job loss were higher for both pathological and problem gamblers (13:8% and 10:8%, respectively)
than for low-risk or non-gamblers (5:8% and 5:5%, respectively); and (iii) rates of divorce were 53:5%
and 39:5% for pathological and problem gamblers, respectively, as compared with 29:8% for low-
risk gamblers and 18:2% for non-gamblers. Given these …ndings, we set the relative damage of the
problem to regular gamblers as z = 1=3. Moreover, we set the cross-border intensity parameters as
being half of those facing local gamblers, i.e.,    c   =    a   = 0:5. In the absence of empirical observations,
we set the scaling parameters of the distortion costs from casino gambling in both cities as being
identical and normalize them at d1 = d2 = 1. Accordingly, the disorder costs in Detroit (484233:090)
are larger than in Windsor (330392:895), whereas the casino income creation in Detroit (96494:216)
is lower than in Windsor (132578:196).


4.2   Comparative Statics

With the calibrated parametrization above, we now quantitatively examine some interesting com-
parative statics, which are reported in Table 2 (a complete set of tables summarizing all comparative
static results is relegated to Appendix Table A1). We shall focus on the e¤ects of the casino revenue
tax ( i ), the casino tax surcharge (si ), the commuting cost (T ), the total population size (N1 ) and the
fraction of problem gamblers (1      n1 ) of Detroit on each city’s casino prices, cross-border gambling,
casino demand and revenue, total and export-based casino tax revenue, casino income creation, and
the social disorder costs.
   We begin by studying the responses to the two tax instruments.

Table 2-b. Effects of Commuting Costs, Detroit’s Total and Problem Gambling Populations
Result 1: (E¤ects of Casino Revenue Tax and Casino Tax Surcharge)

(i) An increase in the revenue tax rate (       i)   in either city raises the equilibrium prices of both casinos
       ( p1 and p2 ), while an increase in the casino tax surcharge ( si ) in City i lowers the equilibrium
       price in its own casino ( pi ) but raises the equilibrium price in the neighboring casino ( pj ).

(ii) In response to an increase in the revenue tax rate (             i)   or the casino tax surcharge ( si ),

       a. all individual casino demands ( xij;m ) fall,
       b. the proportion of City i’s cross-border gamblers commuting to the other city (                      CB )   rises,
                                                                                                              i

       c. the total casino demand ( Xi ), casino revenue ( AGRi ), total tax revenue ( T Ri ), export-
            based tax revenue ( EBTi ), casino income creation ( ICi ), and social disorder costs ( DCi )
            in City i all decrease.

(iii) The responses to the other city’s tax changes are exactly the opposite.


     When Detroit raises the revenue/wagering tax rate           1   on its casino, Detroit’s casino raises its price
p1 in order to pass the tax burden onto the gamblers. Meanwhile, a higher                   1   also makes the demand
for Windsor’s casino become less elastic, allowing the Windsor casino to raise its price p2 . Since the
casino prices are higher in both cities, the casino consumption per gambler (x11;m ; x12;m ; x21;m and
x22;m ) decreases regardless of the gambler types (m = P; R). Given that the direct (former) e¤ect
dominates, the relative price of the Windsor casino p (= p2 =p1 ) decreases in response. This, on
the one hand, encourages more of Detroit’s recreational gamblers (and hence overall gamblers) to
visit Windsor’s casino (    CB    and   CB   increase) and, on the other hand, leads Windsor’s recreational
                            1;R         1
gamblers (and hence overall gamblers) to stay at their own casino (                  CB    and    CB    decrease). Thus,
                                                                                     2;R          2
the cross-border gambling of Detroit exhibits an extensive margin response to a higher revenue tax
     in Detroit whereby the proportion of cross-border recreational gamblers (                   CB )   increases, but the
 1                                                                                               1;R
cross-border casino consumption per gambler ( x12;R ) decreases.
     Moreover, since more of Detroit’s (fewer of Windsor’s) residents cross the border to gamble, the
total demand for the Detroit casino (X1 ) and the casino revenue (AGR1 ) decrease, but both the
demand for the Windsor casino (X2 ) and its casino revenue (AGR2 ) increase. These subsequently
decrease the Detroit export-based and total tax revenues (EBT1 and T R1 ), but increase the Windsor
export-based and total tax revenues (EBT2 and T R2 ). In terms of the social disorder costs, since for
Detroit a higher   1   leads to a decrease in both the local recreational gamblers (["1;R (1 n1 )N1 ]x11;R )
and cross-border recreational gamblers ((N2                                                              1
                                                        "2;R )x21;R ) from Windsor, the disorder costs DC1;R
      2
and DC1;R decrease as well. Thus, the total social cost DC1;R becomes lower, even though the cost
                                                  3 ) could be higher. At the same time, the
caused by the compulsive addiction of gambling (DC1;R
positive externality of casino income creation in Detroit (IC1 ) also decreases because the Detroit

casino market shrinks. The results regarding an increase in Windsor’s revenue tax rate (                        2)   are
totally symmetric, and are thus not repeated here to save space.
       Walker and Nesbit (2014) estimate the impact of a casino in the Missouri riverboat gaming market
and …nd that a 1% increase in neighboring casinos’ AGR leads to a 0:116% decline in a casino’s
AGR, if slots and table games are kept constant. If neighboring casinos increase both slots and table
games, there is a slightly bigger impact after the market adjusts: A 1% increase in slots and tables
causes a 0:136% decline in the casino’s revenue. Thalheimer and Ali (2003) show that a new casino
(commercial or tribal) in the Missouri-Iowa-Illinois region decreases the slot handle of competing
casinos by approximately 3%. By focusing on the Philadelphia-Northern Delaware-Atlantic City
market, Condli¤e (2012) …nds that in the face of Pennsylvania’s competition the loss of neighboring
casinos was around 0:01% of their mean monthly revenues. Our numerical analysis shows that casino
competition via wagering taxation (say, a 1% reduction in                  1)   increases Detroit’s casino demand
(X1 by 2:119%) and revenue (AGR1 by 1:914%), while it decreases Windsor’s casino demand (X2
by 1:35%) and revenue (AGR2 by 1:381%). This implies that a 1% increase in the AGR of Detroit’s
casino leads to a 0:72% decline in that of Windsor’s casino. Compared to the empirical …ndings, our
numerical results show a relatively high …gure due to a more competitive Detroit-Windsor market.
In spite of the negative adjacent city e¤ect of casinos, there may be a positive agglomeration e¤ect
for the casino market as a whole. McGowan (2009) …nds that due to Pennsylvania’s entry, Atlantic
City lost over $110 million dollars, but the overall Atlantic City-Philadelphia market grew by over
$460 million. As for the Detroit-Windsor market, our analysis reveals that the competition from
Detroit’s casinos hurts neighboring gambling revenues, but the loss in the AGR of Windsor is less
than Detroit’s gain. As a result, in response to a 1% reduction in Detroit’s wagering tax                       1,   the
overall Detroit-Windsor casino market (X1 + X2 ) expands by 0:1%, which leads to a 0:05% increase
in the aggregate casino revenues (AGR1 + AGR2 ).18
       Next, we examine the e¤ects of the casino tax surcharge. As indicated in Proposition 3(i), raising
Detroit’s tax surcharge (s1 ) increases the price elasticity of demand for Detroit’s casino, but decreases
the demand elasticity for Windsor’s casino. As a result, the equilibrium price in Detroit p1 declines
and the equilibrium price in Windsor p2 goes up, resulting in a higher relative price of Windsor
                                                                     1+(1+s2 )t
p . Nevertheless, the after-tax relative consumer price p            1+(1+s1 )t   declines with a higher casino tax
surcharge s1 , and, accordingly, the casino tax surcharge generates e¤ects qualitatively similar to
those of the revenue tax rate. The quantitative e¤ects, however, are di¤erent. Detroit loses more
export-based and total tax revenues in response to the wagering tax, compared to the casino tax
  18
       Condli¤e (2012) examines the Philadelphia-Northern Delaware-Atlantic City market empirically, revealing that the
aggregate gambling revenue among the three states has not increased with the introduction of Pennsylvania gambling
venues. Due to the inability to control for other changes, this counterfactual estimate may be potentially biased. It
may thus be valuable to apply our approach to revisit the case.




                                                           24
surcharge ( 13:146% and         1:613% vs.       7:195% and     0:929% in response to a 1% increase in     1

and s1 ). There is a natural trade-o¤ between the casino export-based/total tax revenue and the
import-based/total disorder costs when levying higher taxation on either the casino          1   or gamblers
s1 . As a consequence, the numerical analysis suggests that for Detroit, a higher wagering tax can
reduce the casino disorder cost more signi…cantly than a casino tax surcharge. The tax incidence of
the wagering tax is also di¤erent from that of the casino tax surcharge. In response to an increase in
the wagering tax, the increase in Detroit’s casino price implies that the casino passes its tax burden
onto consumers. In response to an increase in the casino tax surcharge, the decrease in Detroit’s
casino price implies that the casino shares some of the tax burden with its patrons. Our numerical
analysis shows that in response to a rise in the wagering tax consumers share a relatively high tax
burden (a 5% increase in       1   results in about a 0:3% rise in p1 ), while in response to a rise in the
casino tax surcharge the casinos share a relatively low tax burden (a 5% increase in s1 results in
about a 0:02% fall in p1 ). The nonequivalence in the tax burden between the casino revenue tax and
the casino tax surcharge is particularly interesting because in simple demand analysis it does not
matter whether the consumer or the producer pays the tax given the pass through. As can be seen
in the welfare analysis below (Result 6), this will lead to rich optimal tax outcomes.
   When do problem gamblers cross the border to gamble? In the Appendix (Table A2), we show
that the problem gamblers in Windsor will cross the border to gamble when Windsor raises the
wagering tax rate    2   (the casino tax surcharge s2 ) by 16% (18%) or when Detroit lowers the wagering
tax rate   1   (the casino tax surcharge s1 ) by 18% (or 28%) from the benchmark level. Intuitively,
increasing Windsor’s casino taxation generates a push e¤ect, pushing Windsor’s problem gamblers
out to the Detroit casino. By contrast, decreasing Detroit’s casino taxation generates a pull e¤ect,
pulling Windsor’s problem gamblers into the Detroit casino. Since problem gamblers are less sensitive
morally with respect to gambling in their own city, problem gamblers will cross the border to gamble
only when the casino taxation changes signi…cantly. This is somehow consistent with evidence in
the sense that problem gamblers frequently visit local casinos that o¤er easy access for them to
gamble closer to home and more often. Our numerical study shows that, as an example, if Windsor
raises the wagering tax rate       2   by 18%, Detroit’s export-based tax revenue will increase sharply, by
around 270:55%, because problem patrons gamble more intensively (a higher x21;P ). Similarly, if
Windsor raises the casino tax surcharge s2 by 18%, Detroit’s export-based tax revenue will increase
by 232:26%. The corresponding import-based disorder costs, however, also become large. As for
                                  2
the e¤ects of the wagering tax, DC1;P                                 2
                                      increases from 0 to 12166 and DC1;R increases by 234:79%,
resulting in an increase of about 13:17% in the total disorder costs. As for the e¤ects of the casino
                 2 increases from 0 to 6122 and DC 2 increases by 214:1%, resulting in a 10:93%
tax surcharge, DC1;P                              1;R
increase in total disorder costs.
   We next turn to quantifying the e¤ects of an increase in the commuting cost. As noted previ-


                                                        25
ously, since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. government has tightened entry regulations
by requiring passport or birth and identity documentation as well as extensive questioning and even
random searches of vehicles. The number of agents at the Ambassador Bridge, Blue Water Bridge
and the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel has already doubled since 911. Based on our parametrization, the
e¤ects of an increase in the commuting cost T are summarized in the following result:

Result 2: (E¤ects of Commuting Costs) In response to a rise in the commuting cost T of
crossing the border between Detroit and Windsor,

(i) the equilibrium casino price increases in Detroit ( p1 ) but decreases in Windsor ( p2 );

(ii) the proportion of both cities’cross-border gamblers to the other city (   CB )   and the export-based
                                                                               i
     tax revenue ( EBTi ) decline;

(iii) in Detroit individual demand for casinos ( x11;m and x21;m ) falls, while total demand ( X1 ),
     casino revenue ( AGR1 ), tax revenue ( T R1 ), casino income creation ( IC1 ), and social disorder
     costs ( DC1 ) rise.

(iv) in Windsor individual demand for casinos ( x12;m and x22;m ) rises, while total demand ( X2 ),
     casino revenue ( AGR2 ), tax revenue ( T R2 ), casino income creation ( IC2 ), and social disorder
     costs ( DC2 ) fall.

   Intuitively, due to a higher commuting cost, the proportions of the cross-border gamblers for
both cities fall. As indicated in Proposition 3, since Detroit has a stronger preference for casino
gambling, in Detroit the price elasticity of demand E1 responds negatively to the commuting cost,
but in Windsor the price elasticity of demand E2 responds positively to it. As a result, the casino
price of Detroit (p1 ) increases, while the absolute (p2 ) and relative prices (p = p2 =p1 ) of Windsor
decrease. The price e¤ect refers to a decrease in the casino consumption per gambler in the Detroit
casino (x11;m and x21;m ), but to an increase in the casino consumption per gambler in the Windsor
casino (x12;m and x22;m ). In contrast to the responses to tax shifts, a higher commuting cost causes
the cross-border casino consumption of Detroit to exhibit an intensive margin response in the sense
that the proportion of the cross-border gamblers decreases, but the cross-border casino consumption
per gambler increases. In addition, because the cross-border gamblers of both cities are discouraged
by a higher commuting cost and the population size of Detroit is larger than that of Windsor, the
aggregate demand (X1 ), casino revenue (AGR1 ), and total tax revenue (T R1 ) for Detroit are higher,
but for Windsor are lower. In short, when a rising commuting cost discourages cross-border gambling,
the city with stronger preferences and a larger population absorbs greater demand and tax revenue,
which are accompanied by higher disorder costs and income creation.
   The tighter restrictions on the U.S. side of the border have led Windsor’s gambling revenues to fall
signi…cantly. To counter this drop-o¤, Caesars Casino Windsor has o¤ered passport photo sessions,

                                                   26
information on what documents are needed to cross the border and even keeps passport applications
in its customer relations o¢ ces (Hall, 2009 and McArthur, 2009). The new Caesars Windsor has also
o¤ered $3; 500 in tunnel fares to U.S. visitors on a …rst-come, …rst-served basis.19 Other promotions
include various hotel, dining and entertainment discounts and o¤ers, as well as free slot machine play
for the …rst $100. This evidence also supports our …nding that the relative casino price of Windsor
decreases in response to a higher commuting cost.
       The declining automobile industry, together with the …nancial tsunami, has seriously hit the
Detroit economy. According to U.S. Census data, there has been a large reduction in Detroit’s
population: over the past 10 years, Detroit has lost about a quarter of its residents. It is therefore
also interesting to examine the e¤ects of a reduction in Detroit’s population.

Result 3: (E¤ects of Detroit’s Population) In response to a reduction in Detroit’s potential
gambling population ( N1 ),

(i) the equilibrium casino prices in both Detroit ( p1 ) and Windsor ( p2 ) decrease;

(ii) all individual casino demands ( xij;m ) increase;

(iii) cross-border gambling (       CB ),   total casino demand ( Xi ), casino revenue ( AGRi ), total ( T Ri )
                                    i
         and export-based casino ( EBTi ) tax revenues, income creation ( ICi ), and social disorder costs
         ( DCi ) in both cities all decline.


       A reduction in Detroit’s population decreases the demand for gambling, which leads the equilib-
rium casino prices in both cities to fall. The dwindling population, as shown in Proposition 3(ii), is
more unfavorable to Windsor’s casino, making the overall demand for Windsor’s casino more elastic.
Thus, the relative price of the Windsor casino p decreases. A fall in the casino prices enhances the
casino consumption per gambler. Nonetheless, due to a reduction in the size of the gambling market,
the cross-border gambling, total casino demand, casino revenue, total and export-based casino tax
revenues, income creation, and social disorder costs in both cities are all lower. There is an intensive
margin response whereby the gambling market size decreases while the casino consumption per gam-
bler increases. Of particular interest, the drop in Detroit’s population hurts its neighboring casino,
Windsor, more severely. A 5% reduction in Detroit’s population can substantially reduce the cross-
border gambling from Detroit to Windsor, resulting in a remarkable loss in Windsor’s export-based
tax revenue (9:377%), total tax revenues (5:265%), and AGR (5:428%).
       In a meta-analysis of gambling disorders among adults in the U.S. and Canada, Sha¤er, Hall,
and Vander Bilt (1997) and Sha¤er and Hall (2001) concluded that the number of problem gamblers
among the adult general population had increased due to the increased exposure to gambling and
  19
       In 2008, the Windsor Casino was rebranded and rebuilt as “Caesars Windsor,” with an investment of over CAD
$400 million.


                                                         27
immense social acceptance of gambling. Although the percentage of problem gamblers is small, such
people give rise to signi…cant social costs. Thus, we examine the impacts of an increase in the
proportion of Detroit’s problem gamblers (1     n1 ) which are summarized as follows:

Result 4: (E¤ects of Detroit’s Problem Gambling Population) The e¤ ects of a rise in the
proportion of problem gamblers in Detroit ( 1   n1 ) are qualitatively identical to those of an increase
in Detroit’s gambling population ( N1 ). Quantitatively,

(i) the percentage increases in Detroit’s total casino demand ( X1 ), casino revenue ( AGR1 ), tax
     revenue ( T R1 ), casino income creation ( IC1 ), and social disorder costs ( DC1 ) are much
     larger in response to a rising proportion of Detroit’s problem gamblers compared to a rising
     population of Detroit’s gamblers;

(ii) the percentage increases in Windsor’s total casino demand ( X2 ), casino revenue ( AGR2 ), tax
     revenue ( T R2 ), casino income creation ( IC2 ), and social disorder costs ( DC2 ) are much
     smaller in response to a rising proportion of Detroit’s problem gamblers compared to a rising
     population of Detroit’s gamblers.


   Because the demand of the problem gamblers is stronger and less elastic, the price elasticity of
aggregate demand for gambling decreases and the price e¤ect is more pronounced in Detroit. The
proportion of Detroit’s cross-border gambling only rises marginally. As a result, Detroit gains from
much higher total casino demand ( Xi ), casino revenue ( AGRi ), tax revenues ( T Ri ) and income
creation ( ICi ), at the expense of much higher disorder costs ( DCi ). This is consistent with the
evidence that problem gamblers contribute 40    60% of slot machine revenue for a casino which o¤ers
easy access to and tempts citizens to gamble. Our numerical results suggest that a 5% increase in
Detroit’s problem gamblers increases the disorder costs sharply by about 30%. By contrast, such
percentage gains and costs in Windsor are much larger in response to an increase in the population
of Detroit’s gamblers.
   A primary factor driving the expansion of gambling is its ability to raise tax revenue, and under
cross-border casino competition, demand elasticities are crucial for revenue generation (Nichols and
Tosun, 2013). We thus further examine the elasticities of individual demand for gambling with
respect to various casino taxes and investigate how the price elasticities respond to these di¤erent
taxes.

Result 5: (Demand Elasticity and Casino Tax) For both cities,

(i) the demand for gambling is more responsive to the wagering tax (   i)   than the casino tax surcharge
     ( si );



                                                  28
(ii) …scal competition in either the wagering tax (lowering                           i)   or casino tax surcharge (lowering si )
        raises the price elasticities of demand for gambling for both problem and recreational gamblers
        ( eij;m ).


By focusing on the tax elasticity of the demand for gambling, we can see from Table 2-a that the
individual demand for gambling ( xij;m ) is more responsive to the wagering tax (                                  i)   than the casino
tax surcharge ( si ), because casinos can pass more of their tax burden onto consumers in response to
a higher wagering tax rate. Moreover, due to the addiction of problem gamblers, the tax elasticities
of the demand for gambling are lower for problem gamblers than recreational gamblers, regardless
of the wagering tax or the tax surcharge. In addition, Table 2-a shows that a decrease in either the
wagering tax ( i ) or casino tax surcharge (si ) raises the price elasticity of demand for gambling for
both problem and recreational gamblers (eij;m ) in both cities. This implies that the government’s
tax competition tends to make the cross-border casino competition more intense.


4.3      Welfare Analysis

Endowed with a fully calibrated model, we are able to determine the optimal casino tax policy. We
are particularly interested in three exercises. First, we compute the optimal policy of a single casino
tax instrument, either the casino revenue tax                       i   or tax surcharge rate si , of a reference City i,
given the alternative tax instrument and its rival’s tax policy (                            i; s i)   at their pre-existing values.
Second, we compute the optimal tax mix (                      i   ; si ) of City i, given (            i; s i)   at their pre-existing
values. This is basically a tax incidence exercise for each city. Finally, we compute the welfare-based
pairwise casino competition (          i   ;        i   ) and (si ; s        i   ), respectively, …xing the other tax policy at
the pre-existing rates. To shed light on the importance of the social disorder costs, in addition to
the benchmark d1 = d2 = 1, this welfare analysis also considers a parallel case with a higher disorder
cost parameter, d1 = d2 = 1:5. The results are summarized below.
      Consider the …rst exercise. Figure 2 shows that, given the rival’s tax policy and the alternative
tax instrument, if d1 = d2 = 1, the optimal casino revenue/wagering tax rate in Detroit involves
a decrease from its pre-existing value of 0:19 to                       1   = 0:158 (Figure 2-a), whereas that in Windsor
involves in a decrease from 0:20 to            2   = 0:184 (Figure 2-b).20 While the optimal casino tax surcharge
in Detroit declines from its pre-existing value of 0:8 to s1 = 0:343 (Figure 2-c), that in Windsor
decreases from 1:361 to s2 = 0:926 (Figure 2-d). If we consider a higher disorder cost parameter,
d1 = d2 = 1:5 (see Figures A1-a –A1-d in the Appendix), the optimal casino revenue/wagering tax
rate increases sharply to        1   = 0:229 in Detroit (compared with                       1   = 0:158 in the d1 = d2 = 1 case),
while it only slightly increases to            2   = 0:185 in Windsor. As for the casino tax surcharge, in Detroit
the optimal level dramatically increases to s1 = 1:062 (compared with s1 = 0:343 in the d1 = d2 = 1
 20
      We have ruled out the possibility of the negative demand for casinos in the welfare analysis.


                                                                   29

case) and in Windsor it slightly increases to s2 = 1:253 (compared with s2 = 0:926 in the d1 = d2 = 1
case).
       Generally speaking, the main trade-o¤ facing each of these tax instruments is that a higher tax
rate raises the consumer’s surplus by means of a reduction in the net casino externality (disorder costs
net of income creation), but suppresses the producer’s surplus as a result of a weakening competitive
advantage. Given that total tax revenue is hump-shaped (i.e., a La¤er curve), the optimal tax rate
is determined by balancing these components.21 When the disorder costs of gambling are not that
serious (d1 = d2 = 1), each city should lower its casino taxation in order to attract more cross-border
gamblers, thereby establishing a competitive advantage over its rival. This may explain the downward
trend of casino taxation in recent decades (see Smith, 2000). To better compete with neighboring
cities (jurisdictions), local governments have increased gambling revenues by expanding the tax base,
rather than by raising tax rates. By contrast, if the social disorder costs of gambling are considered
to be a more serious issue (d1 = d2 = 1:5), both cities should levy higher casino taxes to control the
social cost. In this case, both cities should raise taxes compared to the benchmark case (d1 = d2 = 1).
However, with stronger gambling preferences and higher disorder costs, Detroit should raise both the
wagering tax         1   and casino tax surcharge s1 above the pre-existing levels (the disorder costs of
Detroit are almost twice as large as those of Windsor in the benchmark). By contrast, Windsor
remains better o¤ by lowering the wagering tax rate               2   and casino tax surcharge s2 compared to the
pre-existing rates. This is because Windsor’s casinos are more dependent on cross-border visitors
from Detroit and the income creation is more important for Windsor than for Detroit (the casino
income creation of Windsor is about 40% larger than that of Detroit in the benchmark).
       Next turn to the second exercise with the optimal tax mixes depicted by Figure 3. Given Windsor’s
existing tax policy (        2 ; s2 )   = (0:2; 1:36), Detroit’s optimal tax mix is (          1   ; s1 ) = (0:264; 0) for
d1 = d2 = 1 (Figure 3-a) and is (              1   ; s1 ) = (0:355; 0:007) for d1 = d2 = 1:5 (Figure A2-a in the
Appendix). As is evident, Detroit’s optimal tax mix favors a shift from the tax surcharge to the casino
revenue/wagering tax. When the social distortion cost is severe (e.g., d1 = d2 = 1:5) the optimal
tax mixes may feature an interior solution under which all problem gamblers cross the border to
gamble (      CB    = 1). By contrast, given Detroit’s existing tax policy (
              1;P                                                                   1 ; s1 )   = (0:19; 0:8), Windsor’s
optimal tax mix is (        2   ; s2 ) = (0:331; 0) for d1 = d2 = 1 (Figure 3-b) and is (            2   ; s2 ) = (0:351; 0)
for d1 = d2 = 1:5 (Figure A2-b in the Appendix). Windsor’s optimal tax mix is in favor of taxing
only the casino revenue/wagering tax by fully exempting the consumers from a tax surcharge (i.e.,
a corner solution), which is su¢ cient for preventing Detroit’s problem gamblers from crossing the
  21
       Total tax revenues, as shown in (28), are collected from not only the tax surcharge imposed on gamblers but also
the revenue tax imposed on casinos. In the case of the optimal tax surcharge in Detroit reported in Figure 2-c, the
total tax revenue-maximizing s1 is zero, although the tax surcharge-maximizing s1 is 0:122 which is in line with the
prototypical La¤er curve property.

border (   CB    = 0) under the d1 = d2 = 1:5 case. In both cities, the favorable tax mix toward casino
           1;P
revenue/wagering tax may serve to explain why the casino wagering tax is the most common form
of taxation. Nonetheless, such an optimal tax shift is more pronounced in Windsor with weaker
preferences toward gambling and lower social disorder costs.
   It is interesting to note that if the population of Detroit’s problem gamblers (1                     n1 ) increases, it
is optimal for both cities to raise the wagering tax for controlling the potential social cost caused by
Detroit’s problem gamblers. One may also inquire into what happens to the optimal tax mix in both
cities if Detroit’s population N1 falls. In response to a population drop in Detroit, the aggregate
Detroit-Windsor casino market shrinks and, as a result, both cities should lower their casino-related
taxation, which will attract cross-border gamblers without needing to be seriously concerned about
the disorder costs.
   We …nally perform the third exercise concerning welfare-based pairwise casino competition. In the
d1 = d2 = 1 case, given the alternative tax instrument, the welfare-based casino competition in terms
of the casino revenue tax is (     1   ;   2   ) = (0:02; 0:05), whereas the welfare-based casino competition
in terms of the tax surcharge is (s1 ; s2 ) = (0:05; 0:31). In the d1 = d2 = 1:5 case, the welfare-
based casino competition in terms of the casino revenue tax is (                  1   ;   2   ) = (0:043; 0:033), whereas
the welfare-based casino competition in terms of the tax surcharge is (s1 ; s2 ) = (0:021; 0:012).
Compared with the pre-existing casino taxes, i.e., (            1;   2)   = (0:19; 0:2) and (s1 ; s2 ) = (0:8; 1:36), the
optimal taxes (wagering taxes and casino tax surcharges) are lower due to an intense cross-border
casino competition. Interestingly, in order to better compete with the neighboring casino, the welfare-
based casino competition always features lower casino revenue tax rates and tax surcharges than those
where the rival’s tax policy is given (i.e.,       i   <    i   and si      < si ).
   Our numerical analysis reveals that if the disorder cost parameter is relatively low (d1 = d2 = 1),
we have    1     <    2   and s1   < s2 , but if the disorder cost parameter is relatively high (d1 = d2 =
1:5), the opposite result is true, i.e.,       1   >   2   and s1     > s2 . In the model, Detroit has stronger
gambling preferences and su¤ers more serious social disorder costs, while Windsor’s casinos are more
dependent on cross-border visitors from Detroit and lead to more income creation. When the disorder
costs of gambling are less severe ( d1 = d2 = 1), it is optimal for Detroit to aggressively set lower
casino taxes in order to pull into the cross-border visitors via attracting some problem gamblers from
Windsor (      CB    > 0). When the disorder costs of gambling become more severe (d1 = d2 = 1:5),
               2;P
Detroit has to raise its casino taxes in order to control the social cost of gambling by pushing the
problem gamblers in Windsor back to their own casinos. In this case, Windsor will take advantage
of this to set relatively low casino taxes for enhancing casino and tax revenues and income creation.
Should the population of Detroit’s problem gamblers increase, the welfare-based pairwise casino
competition unambiguously features higher casino revenue tax and tax surcharge rates for Detroit
that has relatively large casino external distortions (disorder costs net of income creation).


                                                           31
        We are now ready to conclude with the following:

Result 6: (Optimal Casino Tax Policy)

(i) (Optimal Policy of a Single Casino Tax) Given the rival city’s tax policy and the alternative tax
          instrument, it is optimal for both cities to lower each of the tax rates from the pre-existing level
          when the social disorder costs are less severe. If the social disorder costs are su¢ ciently high,
          Detroit should raise both the wagering tax and casino tax surcharge from the pre-existing levels,
          while Windsor remains better o¤ by reducing both the wagering tax and casino tax surcharge
          from their pre-existing levels.

(ii) (Optimal Tax Mix) Given the rival city’s tax policy, the optimal tax mix favors a shift from the
          tax surcharge to the casino revenue tax in both cities, which is more pronounced for Windsor.

(iii) (Welfare-Based Pairwise Casino Competition) Given the alternative tax instrument, welfare-
          based casino competition features lower casino revenue tax rates and tax surcharges than those
          in the absence of casino competition. When the disorder costs of gambling are less severe, it
          is optimal for Detroit to aggressively set lower casino taxes to attract some problem gamblers
          from Windsor; when the disorder costs of gambling are more severe, it is optimal for Detroit
          to raise casino taxes by preventing Windsor’s problem gamblers from crossing the border.

Remark: As is conventional, our welfare analysis is conducted under a benevolent government. One
may inquire what would happen if the government is a Leviathan revenue-maximizer. We …nd that,
in all optimal casino tax policy exercises, the optimal tax rates on both casino revenue and gambler
tax surcharge are lower than those of their benevolent government counterparts. This is because a
Leviathan government fails to account for the Pigouvian tax correction of negative casino externalities
that would a¤ect the consumer’s surplus. For example, in the benchmark case with d1 = d2 = 1,
(   1   ; s1 ) = (0:161; 0) and (   2   ; s2 ) = (0:245; 0), which are both lower than the comparable …gures
of (0:264; 0) and (0:331; 0) under the benevolent government setting.


4.4       Counterfactual Analysis

We now perform two counterfactual exercises to assess how the welfare analysis conducted above may
change in response to changes in the underlying economies. The …rst counterfactual is to inquire
into what would have happened if there had been no 911 incident with the commuting cost being
restored to the pre-911 level. The second is to inquire into what would have happened if Detroit had
maintained its population at the 2000 level. In what follows, we focus on the benchmark case where
d1 = d2 = 1.
        Concerning the …rst counterfactual, we note that in the pre-911 era, the commuting time per trip
was about half (i.e., 1.5 hours). Accordingly, the commuting cost is lowered by about 45%.

                                                         32
Result 7: (Counterfactual with Respect to Commuting Costs) Restoring the commuting cost
to the pre-911 level reduces Detroit’s producer’s surplus (by 38:58%) and tax revenues (by 0:46%), but
raises its consumer’s surplus (by 0:40%) and welfare (by 0:36%). By contrast, Windsor’s producer’s
surplus (by 2:14%) and tax revenues (by 0:32%) rise, while its consumer’s surplus (by 0:89%) and
welfare (by 0:65%) fall.

If there had been no 911 incident, Detroit residents would have more easily crossed the border to
Windsor at a lower commuting cost. Since the proportion of cross-border gamblers is higher and the
proportion of local gamblers is lower, the social disorder costs are considered to be less pronounced in
Detroit. As a result, Detroit’s consumer’s surplus and welfare increase, while its producer’s surplus
and tax revenues decrease. An interesting …nding is that due to more intense cross-border gambling,
such a circumstance is not necessarily favorable to Windsor : while Windsor’s producer’s surplus and
tax revenues would have increased, its consumer’s surplus and welfare would have fallen.
    With regard to the second counterfactual, we are particularly interested in the consequence of
restoring Detroit’s population to the level in 2000 (amounting to an 8:5% increase).

Result 8: (Counterfactual with Respect to Detroit’s Population) Restoring Detroit’s popu-
lation to the level in 2000 raises Detroit’s producer’s surplus (by 135:14%), tax revenues (by 2:15%),
consumer’s surplus (by 8:57%), and welfare (by 8:26%), while it increases Windsor’s producer’s
surplus (by 62:27%), tax revenues (by 8:95%), and welfare (by 1:41%), but reduces its consumer’s
surplus (by 0:59%).

If Detroit had maintained its size in 2000, its consumer’s surplus, producer’s surplus, tax revenues,
and welfare would have all been higher. While Windsor would have enjoyed a greater producer’s
surplus and tax revenues, its consumer’s surplus would have fallen due to more intense cross-border
gambling. Since its producer’s surplus would have increased drastically (by more than 60%), this
outweighs the detrimental e¤ect on its consumer’s surplus, resulting in higher welfare. By examining
the data, compared with the 2000 level, the average gross casino revenues of Windsor (during 2000-
2012) have declined by nearly 50%. It follows from Results 6 and 7 that compared with the rise
in the cross-border commuting cost, the large reduction in Detroit’s population seems to a¤ect the
Detroit-Windsor casino market more markedly.


5    Further Discussions

In this section, we consider three extensions by investigating the role played by the winning tax, a
positive casino externality, and the exchange rate in the cross-border casino competition.




                                                  33
5.1     Winning Tax

Gambling winnings face distinct tax laws in the two countries. In Canada, gambling winnings are
considered to be windfalls. Canadian tax law does not treat income from gambling as taxable income
(except for professional gamblers) and does not allow for deductions from gambling losses either. By
contrast, in the U.S. gambling winnings are regarded as taxable income and the Internal Revenue
Service requires certain gambling winnings to be reported on Form W-2G. The winnings are subject
to (federal) income tax withholding at the rate of 25% regardless of where the gamblers come from,
while gambling losses are also tax deductible (Greenlees, 2008). That is, for Detroit citizens, the
winnings regardless of whether they are from Detroit or Windsor casinos have to be taxed, while, for
Windsor citizens, only the winnings from Detroit casinos are withheld as taxable income.
   To quantify the e¤ect of the winning tax, we need to calculate the probability of a gambler’s win,
and accordingly, the winning tax withholding rate of the U.S. By following Kilby, Fox, and Lucas
(2005), we assume a simple game: a gambler bets $1 in the game in which this gambler receives $1
when he wins and loses $1 when the house wins. Thus, the gambler’s expected value (EV ) is

                              EV =       1 + (1           ) ( 1) =        (1    ) < 0;

where       is the probability of the gambler’s win and (1              ) is the casino’s house advantage for a $1
bet. For example, in American Roulette, there are two zeroes and 36 non-zero numbers (18 red and
18 black). If a player bets $1 on red, his chance of winning $1 is therefore 18=38 and his chance of
losing $1 is 20=38. Thus, the player’s expected value EV = 18=38                       1 + 20=38   ( 1) =   5:26%.
Therefore, for this $1 bet the house edge is 5:26%. In our model, the wager is x, and we then have:

                             EV =      x + (1            ) ( x) =       (1     ) x < 0:

or equivalently,
                                         x[1 +            (1        )] = x:                                   (40)

Given that the return to player (RTP) percentage                   = 0:9, we can thus calculate the probability of
the gambler’s win as      = 0:45.
   In the model, EV =        (1     ) < 0 implies that gamblers on average will lose in the model. Thus,
by focusing on an income tax withholding rate of               !   = 25% for gambling winnings, we assume that
there exists a pseudo withholding rate ! and rewrite (40) as:

                                                 !
                                  x[1 + (1           )    (1        )] = (1    !) x:

Given   !   = 25%, we can calculate the pseudo withholding rate as ! = 12:5%. Maremony and Berzon
(2013) estimate that of the top 10% of bettors – those placing the largest number of total wagers
over a two-year period – about 90%           95% ended up losing money. As for regular gamblers, just


                                                          34
11% of players ended up in the black over the full period, and most of those pocketed less than
$150. Moreover, gambling winnings are subject to withholding tax only when the winnings exceed a
certain amount. For example, regular gambling withholding requires the payer to withhold 25% of
the gambling winnings for income tax only if the net prize value (the amount of winnings minus the
amount wagered) is greater than $5,000.22 Obviously, the “e¤ective winning withholding tax”should
not be as high as ! = 12:5%. In line with Maremony and Berzon (2013), we assume that only 5%
of gamblers win and are subject to the winning withholding, and thus compute the e¤ ective winning
withholding rate as ! 0 = 0:125          5% = 0:625%. For simplicity, we further assume that the winnings
of Windsor’s gamblers from the Detroit casino are also subject to the same withholding tax rate.
       In the Appendix, Table A3 shows the e¤ects of the winning tax. Similar to a rise in Detroit’s tax
surcharge s1 , imposing a winning tax ! 0 increases the price elasticity of demand for Detroit’s casino,
but decreases the demand elasticity for Windsor’s casino. Thus, the equilibrium price in Detroit p1
falls and the equilibrium price in Windsor p2 rises, resulting in a higher relative price of Windsor p .
A higher relative price of Windsor p , together with the winning taxation in the U.S., decreases all
individual gambling demand (x11;m ; x12;m ; x21;m , and x22;m ) in both casinos. As for Detroit’s citizens,
the winnings from either the Detroit or Windsor casino have to be reported as taxable income. Thus,
the higher relative price of Windsor p discourages Detroit’s citizens from cross-border gambling (a
lower      CB ).   As for Windsor’s citizens, since gambling winnings are tax exempt in Canada, Detroit’s
           1
withholding tax on winnings sharply reduces the cross-border gambling of Windsor                  CB .   Both lead to
                                                                                                  2
lower export-based tax revenues EBT1 and EBT2 . Nonetheless, because the cross-border gambling
of Windsor is more pronounced than that of Detroit, the aggregate demand for Detroit’s casino
X1 decreases, while the aggregate demand for Windsor’s casino X2 increases. As a result, casino
revenue AGR1 and tax revenue T R1 in Detroit fall, but in Windsor they rise. These outcomes are
accompanied by lower disorder costs and income creation in Detroit and higher casino externalities
in Windsor.
       With regard to welfare analysis, we only focus on the case where d1 = d2 = 1 in the extension,
which is shown in Figure A3 (in the Appendix). Intuitively, given the disadvantage of American
income tax law (the presence of the winning withholding tax), Detroit has to lower its optimal
wagering tax         1   (from 0:158 to 0:143) and casino tax surcharge s1 (from 0:343 to 0:268) in order to
better compete with the neighboring casino. By contrast, Windsor can take advantage of the winning
tax exemption by raising its optimal wagering tax               2   (from 0:184 to 0:191) and casino tax surcharge
s2 (from 0:296 to 0:983).
  22
       The winning withholding tax rate is complicated and di¤ers across casino games. See Charitable Gaming (website:
http://www.michigan.gov/cg/0,4547,7-111-34357-287539–,00.html) and Greenlees (2008) for more details.

5.2       Positive Net Casino Externality

In the benchmark, we have performed welfare analysis in the cases where d1 = d2 = 1 and d1 = d2 =
1:5. For both cases, the disorder costs of gambling are larger than the income creation, giving rise to
negative net casino externalities. Some cost-bene…t analyses, however, identify potentially positive
net casino externalities – particularly when casinos are established in deprived areas where they
create more jobs and incomes (see Anders, 2013). It is thereby worthwhile performing a robustness
check for the case of positive net casino externalities.
        Because the multiplier of casino income creation ai is calibrated to …t the data, we accomplish the
task by lowering the disorder-cost parameter to d1 = d2 = 0:2 under which the casino income creation
is larger than its gambling disorder cost in both cities (ICi > DCi ). The comparative statics results
in Table 2 (and Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix) remain the same due to the social externalities of
gambling being taken as given by all gamblers and casinos, while the welfare analysis provides some
interesting results. By solving the optimal tax policy (          i ; si )   one by one, given the rival’s tax policy
at the benchmark values, we …nd that the presence of a positive net casino externality makes the
casino competition between Detroit and Windsor more intense. As shown in the Appendix (Figure
A4), both cities dramatically lower their casino taxes in order to compete with neighboring cities.
Lower wagering taxes or casino tax surcharges allow the city government to enhance social welfare
by increasing gambling revenues and expanding its income creation. This is particularly true for a
city that originally had a serious gambling problem, i.e., Detroit. Figure A4-c shows that the optimal
casino tax surcharge in Detroit is to be fully eliminated, as compared to the benchmark of s1 = 0:343
(under d1 = d2 = 1).
        The intensity of casino competition is also re‡ected in the optimal tax mixes. Figure A5 indicates
that in the presence of a positive net casino externality (ICi > DCi ), the optimal tax mixes for
both cities refer to a zero casino tax surcharge associated with a relatively low wagering tax rate:
(   1   ; s1 ) = (0:193; 0) and (   2   ; s2 ) = (0:246; 0). Moreover, the welfare-based casino competition
yields optimal casino revenue taxes at (          1   ;   2   ) = (0:01; 0:049) and optimal tax surcharges at
(s1 ; s2 ) = (0:01; 0:31) –both are lower than the comparable …gures in the benchmark case (d1 =
d2 = 1).
        To sum up, while our main …ndings remain robust, a new insight is that the presence of a positive
net casino externality tends to lower optimal casino taxes due to more intense casino competition.


5.3       Exchange Rate

To examine the e¤ects of the exchange rate swings, we de…ne                     as the change in the exchange rate:
a positive (negative)       implies a depreciation (appreciation) in the CAD. Most notably, a change in
CAD a¤ects casino consumption only when people cross the border to gamble. Thus, we re-derive



                                                          36
the cross-border casino consumption per gambler as follows:

                           H (1 + t)                                             H (1 + t)
     x12;P   =                                   +    P;    x12;R =                                  R;
                 (1   )fp2 [1+ (1+s2 ) t]    g                        (1   )p2 f[1+ (1+s2 ) t]   g
                           L (1 + t)                                             L (1 + t)
     x21;P   =                                   +    P;    x21;R   =                                R:
                 (1 + )fp1 [1+ (1+s1 ) t]    g                        (1 + )fp1 [1+ (1+s1 ) t]   g
    The e¤ects of the exchange rate are shown in Table A4 in the Appendix. Intuitively, a depreciation
in the CAD (a positive ) increases the price elasticity of demand for Detroit’s casino, but decreases
the demand elasticity for Windsor’s casino. Thus, the equilibrium price in Detroit p1 decreases
and the equilibrium price in Windsor p2 increases, resulting in a higher relative price of Windsor
p . A lower p1 increases the casino consumption per gambler when Detroit’s gamblers visit their
own casino (a higher x11;m ), while a higher p2 decreases the casino consumption per gambler when
Windsor’s gamblers visit their own casino (a lower x22;m ) where m = P (problem gamblers) or
m = R (recreational gamblers). Moreover, the depreciation in the CAD attracts more of Detroit’s
people to cross the border to gamble (a larger       CB )   with more consumption per gambler (an increase
                                                     1
in x12;m ), but discourages Windsor’s people from crossing the border to gamble (a smaller                CB )
                                                                                                          2
with less consumption per gambler (a decrease in x21;m ). Of particular note, in response to a 5%
depreciation in the CAD, the problem gamblers in Detroit start to cross the border to gamble in
the Windsor casino. As a result, the aggregate demand for Detroit’s casino (X1 ) falls whereas the
aggregate demand for Windsor’s casino (X2 ) rises. While the higher purchasing power of the USD
favors Windsor, increasing Windsor’s casino revenues (AGR2 ), tax revenues (EBT2 and T R2 ), and
income creation (IC2 ), it harms Detroit, lowering its casino revenues (AGR1 ), tax revenues (EBT1
and T R1 ), and income creation (IC1 ). The disorder costs, however, become lower in Detroit but
higher in Windsor.
    The increase in the casino and tax revenues explains the latest turnaround of Windsor’s casinos.
According to the OLG record, between the years 2009 and 2014, revenues for the Windsor casino
struggled. In 2015, revenues, however, have started to climb and the average number of customers
per day has also been going up. This turnaround seems to coincide with the CAD’s depreciation
(Potvin, 2015). Jhoan Baluyot, spokeswoman for Caesars Windsor con…rmed that while competition
is still strong, currency exchange is in their favor; the depreciation of the CAD encourages U.S.
tourists to travel across the border for their holidays.


6    Concluding Remarks

This paper has developed a theoretical model of cross-border casino competition in which (i) problem
and recreational gamblers endogenously choose both the location and the amount of casino gambling,
(ii) two bordering casinos compete with each other for the aggregate source of demand from both



                                                      37
sides of the border (cross-border casino competition), and (iii) both governments exercise cross-
border casino tax competition to optimize their casino tax policy by accounting for the import of
tax revenues and the export of external disorder costs. Analytically, we have shown that under a
reasonable assumption the demand elasticity for casino gambling is greater than one for recreational
gamblers but less than one for problem gamblers. We have veri…ed that the presence of cross-border
casino gambling provides an outside option to gamblers, leading to an elastic aggregate demand
for casino services despite the addictive nature of gambling. We have further established that a
lower commuting cost favors cross-border casino business in a city with a weaker taste for gambling.
Moreover, the positive scale e¤ect of a rising local population may be o¤set by a negative e¤ect on
cross-border gambling, leading to ambiguous outcomes.
   In our calibrated two-city economy …tting the case of Detroit and Windsor, we have conducted
various quantitative analyses which provide valuable policy implications to the casino policymakers
of the bordering cities. By solving the optimal policy of a single casino tax instrument of a city,
we have obtained that cross-border competition induces both city governments to lower each tax to
below the pre-existing rate, although in Detroit with its stronger gambling preferences and higher
disorder costs, it is possible to raise each tax above the pre-existing rate when the disorder costs are
su¢ ciently high. By conducting a tax incidence exercise, we have established that the optimal tax
mix features a shift from the tax surcharge to the casino revenue tax. By performing welfare-based
pairwise casino competition, we have concluded that in order to better compete with the neighboring
casino, it is optimal to impose a lower casino tax rate than that obtained in the absence of casino
competition. Finally, by means of counterfactual analysis, we have shown that had the commuting
cost been restored to the pre-911 level, it need not have favored Windsor; moreover, had Detroit
maintained its population at the higher level as in 2000, Windsor would have enjoyed only a modest
welfare gain due to a loss in consumer’s surplus.
   Turning next to policy design, what would be the best casino tax instruments for each city to
choose? Given the rival city’s tax policy, the optimal tax mix favors a shift from the tax surcharge
to the casino revenue tax. Such an optimal tax shift is more pronounced in a city with weaker
preferences toward gambling and lower social disorder costs. As for tax competition, it is optimal
for both cities to lower their tax rates to secure the attractiveness for cross-border gambling. When
the disorder costs of gambling are less severe, it is optimal for the city with stronger preferences for
gambling and higher social disorder costs to aggressively set lower casino taxes to attract some cross-
border problem gamblers; when the disorder costs of gambling are more severe, it is then optimal to
raise casino taxes by preventing the neighboring city’s problem gamblers from crossing the border.

indicating that both loci R1 and R2 are upward sloping. We can further obtain that locus R1

provided that @E 1 @E2   @E1 @E2
               @p1 @p2 > @p2 @p1 , implying that each city’s casino …rm is more responsive to its own
price changes. This also implies that Casino 1’s reaction function (R1) should be ‡atter than that
of Casino 2 (R2) in the (p1 ; p2 ) space, as shown in Figure 1.
