                  The Ineffectiveness of Effective

                                ABSTRACT




      In   his F1sher-Schultz Lecture, Martin Feldstein examined the effects of

non—neutral tax rules on busIness   Investment   by estimating three econometric

models, and he concluded that 'the rising rate of inflation has, because of    the
structure of existing U.S. tax rules, substantially discouraged investment In

the past 15 years." In a detailed examination of Feldstein's Effective Tax

Rate model and a less extensive review of his other formulations (Neoclassical

and Return—Over-Cost models), a number of important and independent criticisms

are advanced. Our results from examining all three models suggest strongly

that taxes have not adversely affected capital formation during the recent

episode of inflation, a conclusion consistent with the relatively robust levels

of net Investment between 1965 and 1981 actually shown in the newly benchmarked

National Income data.

 THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF EFFECTIVE TAX RATES ON BUSINESS INVESTNT




                            I. INTRODUCTION



     An incorrectly perceived decline in the rate of capital formation

during the recent episode of inflation, coupled with the recognition of

non—neutralities in the tax system, has renewed interest by both policy—

makers and academic economists in the relationships between taxes and

investment. Chief among these non—neutralities are the depreciation of

fixed assets based on historical purchase costs, firstjn, first—out

accounting rules, the taxation of nominal capital gains and interest

receipts, and the tax deductibility of nominal interest payments. The

resulting impact on investment incentives has been investigated inten-

sively and a general conclusion from these theoretical studies is that

inflation, by increasing taxes on capital, can have significant adverse

effects on capital formation.

     Within the context of this broad research program, Martin Feldstein (1982)

devoted the Fisher—Schultz Lecture to examining non—neutral tax rules by

estimating two new investment models, Effective Tax Rate and Return—

Over—Cost, as well as the familiar Neoclassical model. Based on the

econometric results from three different models, Feldstein concluded

that "the rising rate of inflation has, because of the structure of

existing U.S. tax rules, substantially discouraged investment in the

past 15 years" (Feldstein, 1982, p. 860).
                                "-7—




     tn   this paper, we offer a detailed examination of the Effective Tax

Rate model, as well as a less extensive review of the remaining

specifications, and challenge the estimates on which Feldstein based his

conclusion. Section II presents the original specification of the

Effective Tax Rate model, whose key explanatory variable is the net—of--

tax real return accruing to those with financial claims on business

capital. The original model is reestimated with the newly benchmarked

National Incoms Account data, and continues to support Feldstein's basic

conclusion that the net—of--tax real return on capital has had a signif-

icant influence on net investment.

      In Section III, we argue that the rate of return variable is

inconsistent with Feldsteia's theory in not allowing for increases in

the value of the capital stock relative to the overall rate of inflation.

Introducing these net revaluations into the original specification

leads to a dramatic reversal: the rate of return variable becomes in-

significant and cyclical conditions, as measured by capacity utilization,

emerge as important.

     To quantify the magnitude of the effect of non—neutral tax rules,

Feldstein showed that,if the net—of—tax real return had remained at its

1965 value, then the net investment—output ratio would have been 64%

higher than its historical value in 1978. Section IV analyzes this

methodology in terms of the original specification and finds that, due

almost evenly to data revisions and a correction in the simulation

method, the net investment—output ratio would have risen only 16%, a 75%

reduction in the previously reported effect. We then examine movements

in pretax income, depreciation, and taxes, and discover that the net—of—

tax real return, far from being depressed by taxes, would have increased

by 27.4% in 1979 if the non—tax components had maintained their 1965

values.
                              —3—




     We conclude that the Effective Tax Rate model, when properly

specified and evaluated, does not imply that taxes have adversely

affected capital formation during the recent inflation episode and,

in Section V, we examine briefly the remaining two econometric

equations considered by Feldstein. Misspecifications relating to

the opportunity cost of funds and lag distributions may bias upward

the effect of tax parameters on investment in Feldstein's Neoclassical

specification. The Return—Over—Cost model depends crucially on the

existence of a standard investment project comprising capital assets

purchased in fixed proportions, and evidence is cited that the

proportions of equipment to structures or nonresidential capital to

the inventory stock will not be constant during an inflationary period.

Thus, for a number of independent reasons, we find that the estimates

developed in the Fisher—Schultz Lecture do not support Feldstein's

conclusion that taxes have exerted a significantly depressing effect

on net investment between the inid—1960s and the late 1970s (Section VI).

     Before investigating Feldstein's econometric specifications, it

is useful to pause and examine the time series for the ratio of net

nonresidential fixed investment to output (I"/Y). The presumed decline

in this ratio between 1966 and 1978 has contributed to the belief in a
                               —4-.




deficient rate of capital formation, possibly caused by the excessive

taxation of capital income (e.g., Feldstein, 1982, p. 827). However,

the time pattern of I'/Y, displayed in column 1 of Table 1 and based on

the newly benchmarked National Income and Product Account (NIPA) data,

contradicts the notion that net investment has been low by historical

standards. Data are presented for the years 1953 to 1981, and the

period has been divided in 1966, the year in which 1fl/y peaked and

inflation, as measured by the overall GNP deflator, began to

accelerate. The mean of fl/y for the period 1967—1981 is 3.138, 10.2%

higher than the mean for 1953—1966 and 4.7% higher than the mean of

2.997 calculated from 1953 to 1981.   A casual inspection of the data

indicates that net investment, while severely depressed by and

recovering slowiy from the OPEC shock of 1973—1974, has been very

healthy by historical standards.1

     The NIPA benchmark revisions, undertaken periodically and most

recently in December 1980, resulted in significant increases in both the

level and growth rate of business plant and equipment expenditures,2 and

consequently in net investment. Previous estimates of 1n1/y are

displayed in column 2 of Table 1, and are markedly lower than the most

recent figures, though the mean for 1967—1978 continues to exceed the

mean for the entire period. The magnitude and timing of the discrepancy

resulting from the new and old data are highlighted by the level and

percentage differences, displayed in columns 3 and 4, respectively.

Persistent discrepancies between the ft/y series emerge in 1970, and

become more pronounced from 1975 through 1978. Thus, the concern for a

"capital shortage", due to the presence of non—neutral tax rules in the

inflationary 1970s, may be largely displaced by the benchmark revisions in

the NIPA   data.

    II.    THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MODEL AND THE NEWLY BENCHNARKED DATA


    In this section, we introduce Feldstein's model relating net

investment to tax parameters, and reestimate it with the newly benchmarked

data. Following on previous empirical work,3 Feldstein quantifies the

effects of both non—neutral and neutral (e.g., the Federal corporate tax

rate) tax rules in the concept of the Effective Tax Rate on capital

income, T, defined as follows (definitionsand sources for

all variables used in this paper are contained in the Appendix),



                 T /    — Dr),                                        (1)




where:

          Tt =    "corporate    income taxes, the property tax, the personal

                  tax on dividends and capital gains, and the personal and

                  corporate taxes ott the interest income received by the

                  creditors of the nonfinancial corporations" (Feldstein,

                  Poterba, and Dicks—Mireaux, 1983, p. 137),



          Qt =    corporate    operating income, before interest payments,

                  capital consumption allowances, and taxes, adjusted for

                  the replacement cost of inventories used in current

                  production and losses on non—interest bearing financial

                  assets,



          Dt =    the value of depreciation of nonresidential fixed

                  private capital.
Thus,      provides a comprehensive measure of all taxes assessed on an

adjusted flow of capital income after it         is   eventually received by   bond-
holders and equityholders4

        In evaluating the effect of taxation on capital formation,

Feldstein posits that net investment is dependent on the net—of—tax real

return to capital, defined as the product of (l—T) and the net pretax

return on capital. The net pretax return, Rt, is calculated as the

return before taxes, net of depreciation expenses, accruing to those

with financial claims on the firm's capital stock,



                 =
          Rt             — Dt)   /   K,                                    (2)




          Kt
                 =
                     KPE,t
                             + KIN,t   + KL,t,                             (3)

where:

                         the replacement value of the firm's total

                         stock of capital at the beginning of period t,

          KPE,t =        the replacement cost of fixed plant and

                        equipment at the beginning of period t,

          KIN,t =       the    replacement cost of inventories at the

                        begining of period t,

          KL,t          the market value of land at the beginning of

                        period t.



The net—of—tax real return, RN, is computed by combining (1) and (2),
                                         —8—


                 =      (1 —   T)    * Rt
                                                                   (4)
                 =
                             D Tt         *    t_ D
                            Qt_Dt                  Kt
                                     —
                             —
                                 D       T)    I
                                                    K.

Thus,   RNt is the yield, adjusted for depreciation and taxes, on a

capital investment valued at Kt. It is, however, an average yield that

may   not   accurately reflect marginal returns.5

        The basic hypothesis examined by Feldstein is the degree to which

net investment is affected by RNt. Using what is now considered the

"old" NIPA data, Feldstein estimated the following econometric

specification, which we label the Effective Tax Rate (ETR) model,




             (IIY) =   b0   + b1 UCAPt         + b2      + et,        (5)




where e is an orthogonal error. The term UCAPt..l is the Federal

Reserve Board's Index of Capacity Utilization for Total Manufacturing, and

captures cyclical effects. Both explanatory variables are entered lagged one

period to reflect delays in decision making, production, and delivery of

capital goods, and to avoid simultaneity (Feldstein, 1982, p. 839).6 The

ETR model was estimated with annual data and a first—order Cochrane—

Orcutt correction to remove serial correlation from the residuals.

(Estimates without the autocorrelation correction, presented in

Chirinko, 1982a, Chapter V, Table III, are not qualitatively different

from the results to be discussed in this section.)
                               —9—




     Estimates of the ETR model with the old and newly benchmarked data

are displayed in columns 1 and 2 of Table 2, respectively.7 Despite

the significant revisions in (1n/Y) discussed in Section I, the re-

gression relationship is robust with respect to the new data (the compo—

nnts of        also incorporate the benchmark revisions). For both

equations, the coefficients for the constant and UCAP are insig—

nificant, while the coefficient on       is significant at the 1% level.

The 2 is slightly lower and the estimated autocorrelation coefficient,

p, is doubled when (5) is estimated with the newly benchmarked data.

The "price" elasticity for net investment, E,   relating     to

(I'/Y), is decreased slightly from .609 with the old data to .575 with

the new data. In sum, reestimating the ETR model with the newly bench--

marked data has little impact on Feldstein's conclusion of a significant

role for the net—of—tax rate of return on net investment. However, the

specification and interpretation of the original ETR model is subject

to a number of criticisms that are pursued in the following two sections.

               III. NET          REVALUATIONS OF THE CAPITAL STOCK




     The key variable in the Effective Tax Rate model,               is defined

as the income flow, net of taxes and depreciation, accruing to

bondholders and equityholders relative to their capital investment at

the beginning of the period (see (4)). In general, however, this
          inconsistent with Feldstein's
measure is /    model in not allowing for capital gains on the initial
                                                      8
investment relative to the overall rate of inflation.   Consideration of

these net revaluations of capital leads to a modified definition of the

net—of—tax real return,



              =
                  RN +                                                    (6)

where: RRt         = net—of—tax real return with          net
                         revaluations of capital,

                   =     net revaluations of capital,
        NRt
                         the percentage change in the value of the

                         jth type of capital,

                         the overall rate of inflation,

        J          =     plant   and equipment (PE), Inventories

                         (IN), or land (L).



Under the assumption that changes in the value of capital have been

matched by inflation, the original and modified definitions of the rate

of return will be equal.
                                —12—




     Changes in the value of existing (tangible) capital —   plant,
equipment, Inventories, land     can be measured by changes in the

value of new capital, calculated from published price deflators.9

While price series for plant and equipment can be readily obtained, no

suitable sources exist for the prices of land and inventories.10 These

latter deficiencies arise because transactions in land occur infrequently

and the NIPA inventory price index applies to the end of the period and

is heavily influenced by changes in the composition of Inventory stocks.

Rather than utilizing poor proxies, we have decided to omit changes in

the prices of inventories and land from NRt,




             = .65 *              — 'pt,

where .65 is the share of plant and equipment in the firm's total tangible

capital stock (Feldstein, et. al., 1983, p. 134, fn. 13). The overall

rate of inflation is calculated from the implicit price deflator for GNP.

     The net—of—tax real returns with and without the addition of net

revaluations of the stock of plant and equipment, and the level and

percentage differences between these two series are displayed in Table

3, columns 1 through 4, respectively. The introduction of net

revaluations reduces the dispersion of the means of the rate of return

series in the sub—sample periods and only slightly affects the

coefficients of variation. The largest positive percentage increases in

NR relative to         occur in 1956—1957 and 1974—1975, which are also the

years that witnessed the largest inflation rates in the first and second

parts of the sample. Given the non—neutral tax rules that are reflected

in Tt. displayed in column 5, it is not surprising that the effective

tax rate was also very high in these years. Thus, net revaluations will

tend to mitigate the impact of effective tax rates in the ETR model.

      In order to test the importance of net revaluations, the original

ETR model is modified by replacing       with RNNRt1. Estimates based

on the original and modified models are presented in columns 2 and 3 of

Table 2, respectively, and offer a striking reversal of the influence

of the capacity and rate of return variables on net investment. The

coefficient (and the implied elasticity) on the adjusted rate of return

falls by 70%, and is no longer statistically different from zero, even

at the 10% level.11 However, cyclical factors, represented by UCAPt1,

become statistically significant at the 5% level.

      As a further test of the modified ETR model, we measure changes

in the value of existing capital by changes in financial capital, calcu-

lated from Standard & Poor's composite stock price index (SF).12 The

resulting parameter estimates allow for an assessment of the robustness

of our econometric evidence, and are presented in column 4 of Table 2.

The     of .607 is bracketed by the 12 statistics from the previous re-

gressions and, unlike these results, both UCAP and RNNRt 1 prove

statistically significant. However, the elasticity for RNNR        is only
                                                               1

.038, indicating a quantitatively unimportant role for the rate of

return variable.

      Additional support for including net revaluations is obtained

when the original and both modified ETR models are tested for structural

stability. Following Feldstein, we split the sample between 1966 and

1967 and, at the 10% level, the appropriate F statistic (shown in Table

2) indicates that the original ETR model is unstableJ3However, the
null hypothesis of structural stability can not be rejected with the
                                                                             14
modified ETR model using either measure of the value of existing capital.

     in sum, the econometric results discussed in this section indicate

a significant niisspecification in the original ETR model, and a dramatic

reversal in the roles of price and output variables on net investment.

While the modified ETR model may   be   just another "false model" (to use

Feldsteints terminology), it is the model consistent with the theoretical

ideas presented in the Fisher—Schultz Lecture.

  IV. THE IMPACT OF    AXE, THE GROSS PRETAX RETURN AND DEPRECIATION

                ON THE RATE OF RETURN AND NET INVESTMENT



    The analyses   of the ETR model developed in Sections II and III have

focused on the statistical significance of coefficients. While

appropriately large t—statistlcs are necessary in order to ascribe

explanatory power to independent variables, further information can be

obtained by calculating the magnitude of the effects implied by the

estimated coefficients. Feldstein assesses the implications of the ETR

model by using the estimated equation, including the residual e to

compute the net investment—output ratio under an alternative path of

      From 1965 onward, the net—of—tax real return is set equal to its

value in 1965, the year in which RNt reaches a peak for the sample

period)5Given the one—period lag in the model, this alternative path

will lead to differences between the simulated and actual paths of the

dependent variable beginning in 1967, and the scenario attempts to

quantify the impact of the effective tax rate, boosted by the

interaction of inflation and non—neutral tax rules, on capital

formation. Feldstein concluded that, if RN had been maintained at its

1965 level, (In/Y) would have been 64% higher than actually realized in

1978. Parallel calculations, based on the newly benchmarked data and the

corresponding, parameter estimates (column 2 of Table 2), reveal that

the magnitude is lowered to 46% in 1978 but rises to a substantial 68%

in 1980.
                                    -17-


      While the simulation procedure can be criticized for the

 instability of parameters and endogeneity of the explanatory

 variables,16 the fundamental problem is that Feldstein's results mirror

 the influence of both higher effective tax rates and lower net pretax

 returns. For 1965 onward, Feldstein has defined the alternative net—of—

 tax real return as RN              —                     If we are concerned
                                        11965) * R1965.
with the effect of taxes on net investment over this period, then the

alternative rate of return should be defined by holding only             at its

1965 value (RN' = (1 —                           Simulations based on the newly
                       11965) * Re).
benchmarked data for RN and RN are displayed in the first two rows of

Table 4, and generate vastly different results. When both

and      are held constant, the original ETR model implies that (Inh/Y)t

would have been 43% higher on average than actual values for the period

 1967—1980, compared to a 17% average difference when only Tt is held
         17
fixed.        Thus, an appropriate simulation of Feldstein's original ETR

model with the newly revised data lowers substantially the estimated

impact of effective tax rates on net investment during the recent

episode of inflation.

      The interpretation of the above simulations is unclear because

the rise in T can be due to increased taxes (Tn) in the numerator or

lower pretax operating income              or higher depreciation (Dr) in the

denominator. These considerations indicate that it will be useful to

decompose RNt into the following three components,



              = (Q/K)   —   (D/K)   —   (T/K),                                  (9)

where (9) is equivalent to (4).18Calculations based on (9) for 1965 and

1979 are presented in Table 5, and provide a striking challenge to the

popular notion that the fall in RNt has been caused by higher taxes.

From 1965 to 1979, RNt declined from 7.08 to 2.74 a —61.3% change

relative to its 1965 value. However, as indicated in the third row, the

change in the gross pretax return of —723%, holding (D/K) and (T/K)t

at their 1965 values, was greater than the overall decrease in RNt.

Depreciation alone contributed to a further decline of 16.4% and taxes,

far from contributing to a decline in the rate of return, would have

lead to a 27.4% increase in RN. if the other components had maintained

their 1965 values.

     This latter calculation may be misleading because of the positive

relationship between pretax income and tax payments. In order to adjust

for the lower level of economic activity in 1979, we assume that each

one point drop in (QIK)t lowers (T/K)t by the effective tax rates on

dividends and real retained earnings and on corporate income assessed by

Federal, State, and Local governments (the average for 1965—1979 of

these tax rates is .4431). If we use the above assumptions to adjust

(T/K)1979 upward for falling pretax income and if (QIK) and (D/K) had

remained at their 1965 levels, then the net—of—tax real return would

have been 6.75 in 1979, a 4.65% decline that is much smaller than the

actual 61.3% drop. Thus neither appropriate simulations with

Feldstein's original ETR model nor a careful examination of his data

reveal that taxes have exerted a significantly depressing effect on net

investment.

                   V.   ADDITIONAL ECONOMETRIC EVIDENCE

    Apart from the ETR model, Feldsteia presented econometric evidence

from two other models reaffirming a significant relationship between taxes

and Investment and, in the following two subsections, we show that these

estimates are also subject to a number of reservations

          A. Neoclassical Model

    The neoclassical theory of investment, as developed by Jorgenson

(1963) arid Hall and Jorgenson (1971), relates the desired capital stock to

the level of output and the user cost of capital, the latter combtnng in

a nonlinear fashion the opportunity cost of funds, the depreciation rate,

and various tax parameters. Unlike in the ETR model, the impact of taxes

on Investment is assessed at the margin (cf., fns. 1,     5),   Movements in

output or the user cost are translated into net investment through the

same distributed lag coefficients, reflecting adjustment costs brought

about by delays in planning and delivery. Using estimates from this

model, Feldstein concluded that higher taxes and financing costs,

resulting from inflation and raising the user cost, have weakened the

incentive to Invest since the mId4196Os.19

     The relationship between net investment and the user cost is

overstated in this model for three reasons. First, since Feldstein used a

single lag distribution, the lag coefficients represent an amalgam of

output and u.ser cost effect8. If output has the stronger influence On

investment, then the single lag distribution will overstate the potency of

the user cost, hence taxes. Second, the opportunity cost of funds is

taken as a weighted average of the costs of debt and equity, the latter

equal to an earnings—stock price ratio adjusted for the difference between

book and economic profits. The presence of an earnings"prIce ratio in the
                              —22—



user cost variable may involve a misspecification, for a decline in this

ratio may well reflect an increase in expected future earnings relative to

current earnings rather than a decline in the cost of funds. Insofar as

buoyant equity markets and surging Investment are both positively

associated with the state of the business cycle, a significant but

spurious inverse relationship between investment and the user cost will

exist. Econometric verification of the Importance of these two biases has

been presented in Chirinko and Eisner (1982, 1983): when an equation for

equipment expenditures (taken from the Data Resources Inc. model) based

essentially on the neoclassical model was reestimated with separate lag

distributions and the earnlngshprloe ratio removed from the opportunity

cost of funds, the estimated response of equipment investment to changes

in tax credits and depreciation allowances fell, relative to previous

estimates, by approximately 80%!20

     Third, the nominal cost of equity is defined as the sum of an

adjusted earnings-price ratio and capital gains. The latter term is

equated to the overall rate of Inflation which, however, may overstate

capital gains on equity. From 1965 to 1981, the compound annual growth

rate in Standard & Poor's composite stock price index was only 2.33%,

compared to 5.98% in the GM? deflator. The languid increase in capital

gains relative to the overall inflation rate may have counterbalanced the

rise In the adjusted earnings'prIce ratio, resulting in a moderately

increasing or stable real cost of equity and a stable or possibly

declining real cost of funds. By assuming that capital gains have matched

the Inflation rate, Feldstein overestimated the rise In the cost of

capital services since the mld—1960s, and hence the adverse effects on

investment in the Neoclassical model.
                              —23—




          B.   ReturnOver—Cost Model

     The third model analyzed by Feldsteln quantifies investment

incentives by contrasting the internal rate of return a firm can afford to

pay on a standard investment project with the cost of funds (i.e., the

returnsover'cost). In an inflationary environment, the internal return is

decreased by historical cost depreciation and increased by the tax

deductability of nomInal interest payments, and Feldstein's calculations

indicate that the return firms can afford to pay has not been greatly

affected by inflation. However, the cost of funds has risen

substantially, thus reducing the spread between the return on and cost of

an investment project. (The criticism advanced above concerning the

calculation of the real cost of equity applies with equal force to the

cost of funds used in the Return'OverCost model.) Positive and

significant regression coefficients on the return—overcost variable, with

the components entered either as one term or separately, led Feldsteiri to

conclude that nonneutral tax rules have had an adverse effect on

investment.

     However, the Return-Over-sCost model is suspect as a useful tool for

analyzing non'neutral tax rules. A key maintained assumption of the model

is that there exists a standard investment project comprising capital

assets purchased In fixed proportions. At a theoretical level, such an

assumption is unwarranted in the presence of non-ineutral tax rules that

may favor a particular type of capital.21 Empirically, the ratio of the

constant dollar stocks of equipment to structures has risen from .77 In

1950 to 1.33 in 1980.

     Even If the equIpment-structures mix is neutral with respect to

inflation, the standard investment project assumption is Inappropriate in
                              —24—



the presence of an inventory stock of materials used in the production

process. The user cost of the inventory stock depends on the inventory

accounting rule and turnover rate and, with first41n, first-'out

accounting, increases In the rate of Inflation, ceteris paribus, raise the

effective price of inventories and Induce a substitution toward more plant

and equipment (Chirinko, 1982b).22 In a world with more than one capital

asset owned by firms, the Return'Wver-COst model would not appear to be

useful in assessing the relationship between taxes and investment in new

plant and equipments

     Lastly, the Return'OvertCo8t model is no longer stable over time when

estimated with the newly benchmarked data. Following Feldstein, we split

the sample between 1966 and 1967, and the F statistic for stability of' the

coefficients over the two sub3samples Is 8.76, significant at the 1%

level.
                           VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS



      This   paper has examined the evidence from three econometric models

presented    by Martin Feldstein In his Fisherr$Schultz Lecture, and

particular attention has been given to the Effective Tax Rate model. In

Section II, the original specification proved very robust to reestimation

with the newly benchmarked data, and Feldstein's basic conclusion

concerning the importance of the netofMtax real return remained

essentially unchanged. It has been argued In Section III that the rate of

return has been mlsspecif led by not incorporating the net revaluations of

the capital stock. Including net revaluations in the rate of return led

to a dramatic reversal of the roles of flpricesvt and output in the

estimated model, as the netof-tax real return lost its statistical

significance to the capacity utilization variable. In Section IV, the

magnitude of the effect of taxes on net investment in the original model

was   examined. Due almost evenly to data revisions and a correction in        the

simulation   method, we found that, if the effective tax rate had been held
at its 1965 value, the net investment—output ratio would have risen only
16% in   1978 relative   to Its historical value, a 75%   reduction   in the
previously   reported effect. An examination of the components of RNt led

to the surprising conclusion that, ceteris paribus, changes in taxes have

significantly raised the netof'tax real return to capital. The results

generated in this paper suggest strongly that the Effective Tax Rate

model, when properly specified and evaluated, does not imply that taxes

have adversely affected business capital formation during the recent

episode of inflation,23 a conclusion consistent with the relatively robust

levels of net investment between 1965 and 1981 actually shown in the
                              —26—




benchrnarked National Income data.

     As Feldstein states in is Lecture, evidence from any one model is

unlikely to be definitive because it may be subject to a number of biases

affecting the results in unknown ways. Thus Feldstein also analyzed the

Return$OverCost and Neoclassical models; our review of these two

specifications generated supporting evidence for the conclusion of a

limited role for tax incentives (Section V). We have clearly not

exhausted all plausible models of the investment process nor all possible

variatIons of the specifications under reviews In particular, lIttle

attention has been given to the explicit modeling of expectations and

additional dynamic elements influencing the capital formation process.

Models have been developed that are well'4suited for examining these

factors, and their implications for tax policy have been summarized

elsewhere (Chirlnko, 1983). Based on the current study, we conclude that

fiscal policies aimed at stimulating capital formation are likely to

succeed only insofar as they have a salutary effect on the level of

capacity utilization. The direct impact of tax policy on net investment

appears to be negligible.

First, it has been argued that the reported net investment and GNP figures

should be reduced by the amount of direct pollution abatement

expenditures, which do not affect output as recorded in the National

Income Accounts (Summers, 1981, pp. 71'73). When this adjustment Is made

to the 1fl/y series, capital formation in recent years continues to be

strong by historical standards: the mean for the period 1953197g of 2.8

is exceeded or equaled by the mean for 1967-'1979 of 2.9 and by the values

for 1978 and 1979 of 2.8 and 3.0, respectively. Second, alternative

breakpoints in the sample may lead to different assessments of the

strength of net investment. The 196&fl967 split was chosen because it was

the one used by Feldsteth in his empirical work and, as mentioned in the

text, In/Y peaked and inflation began to accelerate in the mid1960s.

     2. During the postwar period, benchmark revisions have been

undertaken in 19L7, 1951, 195k, 1965, 1976, and 1980. The purpose of

these benchmarks is to allow for the "incorporation of newly available and

revised source data" (e.g., input-output tables), "the reconsideration and

improvement of definitions, classifications, and estimating procedures,

the Introduction of new series" (e.g., the economic measure of capital

consumption in the 1976 benchmark), "and the redesign of tables to make

them more convenient and informative" (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1980,

p. 1). In the 1980 benchmark, significant revisions occurred in

expenditures on producers durable equipment, now based solely on commodity

flows but previously calculated as an average of commodity flows and

responses from the Bureau of Economic Analysis' Plant and Equipment
                                —33—




Survey. An increasing amount of equipment leasing by non—producing firms

and a decrease in the number of respondents to the Survey partly explain

the growing discrepency between the commodity flow and survey methods.

Expanded coverage and the use of recently released input4output tables

also contributed to the higher estimates of producers durable equipment.

The level of nonresidential structures was increased by the inclusion of

hotels and motels from the residential structure category, although this

transfer did not appreciably alter the growth rate.

     j.    me concept or tne rrective Tax nate on capitai. income was

initially presented in Feldsteln and Summers (1979), extended to include

state and local taxes In FeldsteIn and Poterba (1980), and recalculated

with the newly benehinarked data In Feldsteln, Poterba, and Dicks'MIreaux

(1983). Cf., fn. 4•

     14•   In contrast to the marginal effective tax rates that have been

calculated by some researchers (e.g., King and Fullerton, 1981!),      is an

average effective tax rate. While no definitive definition of "the"

marginal or average effective tax rate exists (Fullerton, 1981!), it is

interesting to note that the correlation coefficient between the marginal

and average effective corporate tax rates of Hulten and Robertson (19814)

is .89 for the period 1952i980 or i9521982. Cf., fn. 5 for a further

discussion of average and marginal concepts.

     5. See Gravelle (1980), Feldsteln and Summers (1980), Sullivan

(1981, Chapter Iv), and   Feldstein,   Poterba, and DIcks-Mireaux (1983, p.

1143, fn. 38). Fullerton (1981!) provides an excellent discussion of

various definitions of and differences in average and marginal effective

tax rates and, by extension, average and marginal net returns. Neither

concept would appear to be dominant In the analysis of capital formation.

Average returns are a deficient measure because they are not directly

related to the marginal decisions at the core of economic theory.

However, quantifying the marginal return on capital can be achieved Only

by considering selected features of the tax code and by relying on a

number of maintained assumptions ?   competitive   market structure, uniformly

positive cash flows, and the maximization of a particular objective

function. Studies using average returns are best viewed as complementary

to work on marginal returns where, in the former, potentially restrictive

assumptions are relaxed at the expense of a direct link to the

neoclassical model of capita]. accumulation.


     6.   It should be noted that (5) is not an investment schedule,

but rather a supply curve for funds allocated to nonresidential fixed

investment, conditional on the aggregate amount of saving (Feldstein,

1982, p. 836).

     7.   The results presented in column 1 are comparable to those

reported in equation (3.2) (Feldstein, 1982, p. 840), and differ

slightly due to scaling of the variables, less precision in the data,

and possibly the convergence criterion for the estimate of the auto—

correlation coefficient..

     8.   As with the net—of—tax real return, it is the expected rates

of capital gains and inflation that are the relevant variables, which,

following the reasoning implicit in Feldstein's study, we proxy by

lagged realizations. While superior proxies maybe available, their

implementation would require significant departures from Feldstein's

framework, and hence have not been utilized.

     9.   With a rise in the price of investment goods, equityholders

enjoy a capital gain on existing capital but, due to higher priced

inputs, suffer an increase in operating costs. Insofar as the price of

output fails to rise pan passu, the latter effect may lead to lower

operating income, Qt and is captured by Feldstein's

     10. It has been argued that the published price index for plant

and equipment, which is calculated based on production costs, may suffer

from a systematic upward bias, leading to a similar bias in          In the

presence of quality changes in new capital goods not proportional to the

added cost of production, the published series may overstate price

increases (or understate decreases) relative to an index based on the

value to capital goods users (Gordon, 1979). While the methodology

underlying the construction of price series may be open to debate,

systematic bias in the aggregate investment deflator is not apparent

over a long time horizon. For the period 1953—1981, the ratio (q/p).

scaled to unity in 1953, reaches a peak in 1957 (1.050), generally falls

for the ensuing 17 years, and bottoms—out in 1973 (.942). The ratio

rises sharply between 1973 and 1975. From 1975—1981, the series

exhibits a dained oscillatory pattern and, in 1981, equals its 1953

value. While the time series of (q/p) may exhibit some serial

correlation, casual inspection of the data do not reveal a systematic

bias that will affect the results presented in this paper. Further

evidence in support of our measure of NRt is that, when summed over the

sample period, net revaluations are zero (Table 3).

     11.   Since the elasticity is the product of an estimated

coefficient and the inverse of the mean of (I'/Y)t, both of which are

stochastic and non—independent, we do not know the distribution of c.

Logarithmic regressions of the original and modified ETR models

generated estimated 's that are slightly smaller than, but not

significantly different from,those reported in Table 2,   The confidence

intervals for these estimated C's are similar to those of the estimated

b2s discussed in the text.

     12.   in this case, NR    (SPfSP) —

     13.   The discussion in Feldstein (1982) suggests that the 1966—197

breakpoint was chosen simply to halve the sample. In addition, 1966 is

the year in which (Inh/Y)t peaked and inflation, as measured by the

overall GNP deflator, began to accelerate.


     14.   As noted by Toyoda (1974), the Chow test's significance levels

are increased when the regression standard errors from the sub—samples

are unequal. The percentage differences between the regression standard

errors from the sub—samples are only 6.97%, 10.94%, and 12.22% for the

original and modified models, respectively, and thus have a trivial

effect on the critical region (Toyoda, 1974, Table I; Schmidt and Sickle,

(1977).

     15. Rather than a decline in profitability, the observed fall in RNt

could be due to a change in the mix of tangible to riontangible capital.

For example, proportionate declines in the stock of research and

development and the flow of capital income, leaving "true" profitability

unaffected, would   nonetheless   result in a decline in RNt as measured in

this study. However, the correlation coefficient between RNt and     a   rate

of return Including the stocks of research and development and goodwill Is

.97 (this statistic is based on series whose cyclical components have been

removed).

     16. The Issue of unstable parameters, due to changes in policy or

nonrpolicy factors, has been discussed In Eisner (1969), Lucas (1976), and

Sargent (1981). Of' further concern Is the feedback from the

counterfactual path of RNt to greater investment, a larger capital stock,

and ultimately a lower RNt. This scenario suggests that the reported

results from any of these simulations are biased upward, though the

magnitude of the bias is likely to be small because of net Investment's

negligible impact on the capital stock.

     17. The coefficient on capacity utilization Is significant only in

the modified ETR model, and holding UCAPt to its 1965 value would have

resulted in 13% more Investment on average between 1967198O. Simulation

results with the insignificant variables are presented in Table , rows

3r5, and the response of net Investment is small.

     18. This decomposition suggests that we may wish to relax the

constraint implicit In (5) that forces each component of the rate of

return to affect net investment through the same coefficient. The

theoretical justification for such a decomposition follows from

Interpreting the estimated coefficient as an amalgam of expectation and
                              —38—




delivery lag parameters, which may vary systematically among components of'

RNt (Eisner, 1969; Nerlove, 1972). Estimates of this more general model

reveal that the constraint is barely rejected for the original ETR model

and easily rejected for the modified ETR model (all tests are based on a

5% significance level). In addition, only the coefficients of (Q/K)ti

and (T/K)t,4i are statistically different from zero.

     19. Chirinko and King (198J4) show that, in an inflationary

environment, the presumed rise in the user cost and the bias in favor of

shorteri'lived assets occur only under a limited set of circumstances.

     20. A comment has been offered by Sinai and Eckstein (1983).

     21. See Auerbach (1979), Abel (1981), and fn. 19.

     22. This conclusion rests on the substitutability of materials for

capital in production. See Humphrey and Moroney (1975) and Morrison and

Berndt (1981) for supporting evidence.

     23. Fair (1981) also fails to discover a significant rate of return

effect on net investment in an alternative investment equation.
