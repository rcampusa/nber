                                             ABSTRACT

One of the central predictions of the life cycle hypothesis is that individuals smooth consumption over
their economic life cycle; thus, they save when income is high, in order to provide for when income
is likely to be low, such as after retirement. We test this prediction in a group of people—players in
the National Football League (NFL)—whose income profile does not just gradually rise then fall, as
it does for most workers, but rather has a very large spike lasting only a few years. We collected data
on all players drafted by NFL teams from 1996 to 2003. Given the difficulty of directly measuring
consumption of NFL players, we test whether they have adequate savings by counting how many
retiredNFL players file for bankruptcy. Contrary to the life-cycle model predictions, we find that
initial bankruptcyfilings begin very soon after retirement and continue at a substantial rate through
at least the first 12years of retirement. Moreover, bankruptcy rates are not affected by a player’s total
earnings or careerlength. Having played for a long time and been well-paid does not provide much
protection againstthe risk of going bankrupt.

1    Introduction
One of the central predictions of the life-cycle hypothesis is that individuals
smooth consumption over their economic life cycle; thus, they save when
income is high to provide for when income is likely to be low, such as after
retirement.
    We test for consumption smoothing in a group of people whose income
profile does not just gradually rise then fall, as it does for most workers,
but rather has a very large spike lasting only a few years. These people
are players in the National Football League (NFL). A career lasting 6 years
(the median length) will provide an NFL player with more earnings than an
average college graduate will get in an entire lifetime, plus a modest pension
(Figure 1). However, earnings are risky because an injury can cut a player’s
career short. Even healthy players’ careers usually end by their mid-30s.
Players’ typical post-retirement income is much lower than the income they
earn while playing, and NFL retirement benefits are modest (Weir, Jackson
and Sonnega, 2009). These features of income level and uncertainty are
presumably known to players. To maintain a smooth level of consumption
after the predictable post-NFL income drop, a rational, patient player should
therefore save a large portion of his NFL earnings and enter retirement with
a high net worth.
    It is difficult to measure the ups and downs of the consumption and
wealth of NFL players. Therefore, to test whether NFL players have ade-
quate savings we measure how many retired NFL players file for bankruptcy.
    In simulations not reported here, benchmark forecasts of optimally-
saving individuals with income spikes, calibrated to what the NFL players
actually earn, yield essentially no simulated bankruptcies (based on Livshits,
MacGee and Tertilt, 2007). However, NFL players may not save enough be-
cause of optimism about career length, poor financial decisions, or social
pressures to spend (factors we will consider in ongoing work).
    Indeed, we find that initial bankruptcy filings begin to occur very soon
after retirement and continue at a substantial rate through at least the first
12 years of retirement.

    2                      Data sources
    We collected data on all players drafted by NFL teams from 1996 to 2003
    (N =2,016).1 NFL players are public figures so information about them is
    available from many sources. We used pro-football-reference.com and
    NFL.com to obtain basic information, including full name, career length,
    date of birth, hometown, and college. Annual NFL salary information was
    sourced from USAToday.com and Spotrac.com. Salary data is only available
    starting in the year 2000, so career earnings could only be calculated for
              1
        In the annual draft, teams sequentially pick rookie players. However, a total of 134 of
    the draftees did not play in the NFL. They are omitted from most analyses but including
    them as retired players makes little difference. Another 79 players played to the 2013
    season or later; their retirement periods did not overlap with our bankruptcy data. They
    are still included in our analyses whenever possible.

     players whose entire careers began and ended between 2000 and 2013. There
     were 928 such players and 892 of them had earnings data available. To check
     the quality of the salary data we regressed log career earnings on career
     length interacted with draft round dummy variables. The regression has an
     R2 of 0.83 and the expected coefficients on all variables. Bankruptcy court
     documents are public information, so we used a commercial background
     check service to search for filings by the players. Individuals were matched
     to bankruptcy records by full name and address. Matches were carefully
     inspected to rule out false positives.
                                            The performance of the matching process is good; for example, we find
     very few filings by individuals while they are still playing, but many filings
     among the retired.


     3                                          Bankruptcies
     We describe bankruptcies in terms of the annual hazard rate of the time
     to the first bankruptcy filing. Very few players file for bankruptcy before


                                                                                           4
retirement, which makes a survival analysis focusing on retirement appro-
priate.2 This approach also deals well with the varying lengths of different
players’ retirement periods. The sample is censored after 2013 due to data
availability.
    In Figure 2, bankruptcy hazard rates and median career earnings are
shown for each career length bin. Each player’s total career earnings are
plotted with jitter. The median level of earnings across all players is about
$3.2 million (in year 2000 dollars). The figure shows that players with longer
careers have much greater earnings and opportunity to save for retirement,
yet their bankruptcy hazard during retirement is no lower than those with
shorter careers and lower earnings (the hazard rate is roughly constant).
Among individuals who played at least one season, the average annual haz-
ard rate during retirement (with standard error) is 0.0119 ± 0.0009. These
rates are remarkably flat across career lengths, except for a pronounced spike
for players who played exactly 5 years (one year beyond the typical 4-year
rookie contract). This spike will be investigated in future research.
    Table 1 shows estimates of bankruptcy hazard functions. Each row of
the table corresponds to a separate regression, including a different “career
variable” measure and a common “being retired” 0-1 dummy in each re-
gression. The last column shows that the estimated effect of being retired
is to increase the annual hazard rate by about 0.01123 in model (1), and is
similarly close to 0.01 in all specifications. Essentially, retirement raises the
risk of bankruptcy from nearly zero to a substantial level. These estimates
are robust to the inclusion of additional variables that are expected to af-
fect bankruptcy risk. The “career variable” column in Table 1 shows the
estimated effects of the variables listed in the second column of the table.
These variables are interacted with a retirement dummy variable in order
to isolate the retirement period, where almost all bankruptcies occur.
    2
      We estimate discrete-time hazard functions using linear probability models. These
regressions use data where each player contributes one observation for each month from
the time he starts playing until he files for bankruptcy or reaches the end of the time
period when we have data available. The outcome is 1 in the last month if bankruptcy
is filed and 0 otherwise. A player’s retirement period is defined as starting in January of
year y + 1 if his final NFL season was in year y.

                                     There are no significant effects of career earnings or career length on
    the bankruptcy hazard rate. An additional $1 million in career earnings is
    estimated to reduce the hazard rate by only 0.000034 ± 0.000183. Small,
    insignificant effects are also found for all other career variables listed in
    column 2.
                                     These earnings models include only half the sample because of limits
    on salary data availability. However, the full sample is used in a regression
    where career length serves as a proxy for career earnings (row 2). Each ad-
    ditional year in the NFL is estimated to decrease bankruptcy hazard during
    retirement by a minuscule 0.00017 ± 0.00027.
                                     We note that increased career earnings do reduce bankruptcy very early
    in retirement, but the effect is quite small. (In all post-retirement spans
    longer than two years, there is no significant effect of higher earnings on
    bankruptcy hazard.) In the two-years-only model an extra $1 million in
    earnings decreases the bankruptcy hazard rate by 0.000305 ± 0.000125. To
    put this effect in context, note that in the same two-years-only model retire-

ment increases the hazard rate by 0.00867. Therefore, reducing the effect of
retirement by one-half would require about $14 million in additional career
earnings, which is roughly 12 times the average lifetime earnings of a high
school graduate (Day and Newburger, 2002).
   Figure 3 shows the portion of players that have filed for bankruptcy by
each year of retirement. The plot is nearly flat at zero during the 3 years
before retirement, which confirms the previous finding that the hazard rate
while playing is very small. (Active players don’t go bankrupt.) At the
beginning of retirement, the plot indicates an increasing hazard rate.
   Using regression results not displayed here, we confirmed that the hazard
rate increases over the course of the first two years of retirement. This


                                       7
gradual increase is likely due to a combination of players rapidly drawing
down limited savings and having leveraged investments. In addition, some
players continue to play professionally in another league. Football salaries
are much lower outside the NFL, but these additional earnings might help
players to avoid bankruptcy immediately after retirement. The hazard rate
picks up as players move into retirement, and the bankruptcy proportion
increases steadily up to 15.7 percent at 12 years of retirement. Beyond 12
years the estimates lose precision rapidly due to censoring because of the
span of our sample.
    The result of our comprehensive research on bankruptcy risk among
NFL players is quite different from a widely-cited Sports Illustrated article,
which reported that 78 percent of former NFL players are bankrupt or under
“financial stress” within two years of retirement (Torre, 2009). After 2 years
of retirement, only about 1.9 percent of players in our sample have filed for
bankruptcy.
    The regression analyses can be used to extrapolate the possible evolution
of the bankruptcy rate later in retirement. Two prediction bounds result
from estimating individual hazard rates for each year of retirement (e.g., a
9th-year rate, an 11th-year rate, and so on). The minimum predicted hazard
rate λmin is the lowest of these estimated annual rates minus 2 standard
errors. The rate λmax is the largest estimate plus 2 standard errors. The
prediction λt is based on a regression that fits the annual hazard rate to a
quadratic trend (allowing cumulative bankruptcy to level off). These results
show that a very pessimistic prediction gives a bankruptcy rate of around 40
percent. However, even in the most conservative scenario nearly 15 percent
of players will have declared bankruptcy by 25 years after retirement.


4    Bankruptcy in the NFL and the general popu-
     lation
Bankruptcy in the NFL sample can be compared to the general population in
two ways. First, Sullivan, Thorne and Warren (2001) use court records from



                                      8
2001 to estimate simple bankruptcy filing rates. Their rates in the under
25 and 25-34 age groups are 0.0035 and 0.0117 respectively; the latter rate
is close to the overall hazard rate of 0.0119 in the NFL sample even though
their population’s income is undoubtedly much lower. Second, the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY) covers much the same time
period as our sample. Among NLSY men in the same age cohorts as the NFL
sample, the hazard rate (from self-reported bankruptcy) is 0.0038 ± 0.0005,
which is much lower than the NFL players’ rate. More analysis will done in
future work to provide sharper comparisons.


5    Conclusion
The traditional life-cycle model of savings is put to an extreme test when
workers earn a large amount of their lifetime income in a short burst which
ends randomly. Players drafted by NFL teams from 1996 to 2003 are in
exactly this situation. Players with median-length careers earn about $3.2
million in a few years. If they are forward-looking and patient, they should
save a large fraction of their income to provide for when they retire from
the NFL.
    Our findings are different from what the life-cycle model predicts. First,
players declare bankruptcy relatively soon after retirement. After only two
years post-retirement many players have gone into bankruptcy. Second, an-
nual bankruptcy (“hazard”) rates are not affected by a player’s total earnings
or career length. Having played for a long time and having been a successful
and well-paid player does not provide much protection against the risk of
going bankrupt.
    Future work will focus on what types of players have higher bankruptcy
risk, perhaps indicating behavioral biases, correlates of predictably poor
financial decision making, and social variables. This evidence should also
inform helpful interventions, both for these athletes and for other workers
with unusual income profiles.
