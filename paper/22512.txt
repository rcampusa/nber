Augmenting the Human Capital Earnings Equation with Measures of Where People Work

                                         ABSTRACT

We augment standard ln earnings equations with variables reflecting unmeasured attributes of
workers and measured and unmeasured attributes of their employer. Using panel employee-
establishment data for US manufacturing we find that the observable employer characteristics
that most impact earnings are: number of workers, education of co-workers, capital equipment
per worker, industry in which the establishment produces, and R&D intensity of the firm.
Employer fixed effects also contribute to the variance of ln earnings, though substantially less
than individual fixed effects. In addition to accounting for some of the variance in earnings, the
observed and unobserved measures of employers mediate the estimated effects of individual
characteristics on earnings and increasing earnings inequality through the sorting of workers
among establishments.

        Standard earnings equations relate ln earnings to the human capital/demographic
attributes 1 of individuals. While the standard equation accounts for a sizable proportion of the
distribution of individual earnings, there is a sufficiently wide and increasing dispersion of
earnings among workers with the same measured characteristics to challenge “the law of one
price” in the US labor market. Exemplifying the wide dispersion of earnings in the US for
workers with similar skills, Devroye and Freeman (2001) found that variance of ln earnings
among US workers within narrow bands of adult literacy test scores exceeded the variance of
earnings among all workers in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

        To what extent do the measured and unmeasured characteristics of employers contribute
to the variation in earnings among similarly skilled workers? Does taking account of the
characteristics of employers alter estimates of how individual characteristics affect earnings? To
what extent do employees with similar attributes work together? To what extent do high/low
wage firms hire workers with similar attributes?

        This paper seeks to answer these questions about wage determination and the allocation
of labor among high and low paying employers by augmenting the standard log earnings
equation with attributes of employers in US manufacturing 2. It combines earnings data for
individuals from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) with data on worker
attributes from the Decennial Census and the CPS, data on establishments from the Census of
Manufacturing, and data on firms from the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and the
Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD) 3 It uses the observed and unobserved
components of the augmented earnings regression to assess the extent to which the labor market
sorts workers into establishments with similar workers or between high and low paying
establishments. 4

    We use “attributes” and “characteristics” interchangeably in this paper.

2    Previous studies of the importance of the employer for wage determination include Davis and Haltiwanger
    (1991), Groschen (1991), Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999), Lane, Salmon, and Spletzer (2007), Gruetter
    and LaLive (2009), Nordström Skans, Edin, and Holmlund (2009), Card, Devicienti and Maida (2010), Barth et
    al. (2016), and Song et al. (2015). The literature on rent sharing relates individual earnings to the productivity or
    profitability of the establishment, see eg. Hellerstein, Neumark and Troske (1999), Margolis and Salvanes
    (2001), Dunne, Foster, Haltiwanger and Troske (2004), Faggio, Salvanes and van Reenen (2007), Dobbelaere
    and Mairesse (2010), Mortensen, Christensen, and Bagger (2010), and Card, Heining, and Kline (2013).

3        These data measure: firm employment, establishment employment, capital per worker, the percentage of
output exported overseas, and R&D per employee and to estimate the average characteristics of the establishment
work force: years of schooling, age, gender and race.
4        Following Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999), several analysts have examined these questions,
including Andrews, Schank, and Upward (2008), Mendes, van den Berg, and Lindeboom (2010), Lise, Meghir, and
Robin (2013), Card et al. (2013), and Abowd et al. (2014) Our measures of years of schooling and of time varying
establishment characteristics provides a different take on sorting along both dimensions.

                                                                                                                        2
Methodology
        The traditional cross section human capital wage equation (Mincer 1974) relates earnings
wit of individual i in period t to observable measures/indicators of personal skill and other
individual characteristics that ideally reflect productivity but that also reflect employer attitudes
or perceptions resulting from prejudicial or statistical discrimination:

(1) ln wit = β0 + γt + xit β + uit

where γt is a vector of time dummies, xit is a vector that includes years of schooling and
individual attributes such as age, gender and race. The equation does not include attributes of the
establishment or firm, though they can be added to reflect compensating differential or other
factors related to the full compensation of workers that are not captured by the earnings measure.

       Our augmented earnings equation adds to equation (1) the measured and unmeasured
characteristics of an individual's establishment/firm:

(2) lnwijt = β0 + γt + xit β + zjt d + ψij + eijt

where j(i) is an index of the workplace which employs individual i at time t, and where ψij is a
unique job/workplace fixed effect for every individual and workplace pair. The t subscript on zjt
allows observed employer characteristics to vary over time also within each job. If workplace j
has a capital stock K, it is assumed that K affects the wages of all workers similarly. With a
panel of workers and employers, the d coefficients for the establishment characteristics are
estimable using within job variation in the z. For example, if z relates to employment (larger
establishments pay more), the effect of employment on wages can be estimated for the same
worker/job when the establishment changes employment.

        Multiple observations on a single person, including employer identifiers in longitudinal
data, allow us to decompose the job/employer effect into an individual fixed effect measured by
the coefficient on a dummy variable for an individual, an establishment fixed effect, and a match
component orthogonal to the individual and establishment fixed effects, ψij = αi + ϕj + ξij, per the
“AKM decomposition” (Abowd, et al. 1999). We further define: αi = Xi B + ai, and ϕj = Zj D +
φj where X and Z are covariates fixed for each individual and establishment. We identify the B
and D vectors of parameters by assuming that the residual of the individual fixed effect is
orthogonal to individual fixed characteristics, and that the residual of the establishment fixed
effect is orthogonal to establishment fixed characteristics. But our analysis allows the
components of both fixed effects to be correlated with the time varying characteristics as well as
to co-vary with each other. Our final augmented equation is:

(3) lnwijt = β0 + γt + xit β + Xi B + ai + zjt d + Zj D + φj + ξij + eijt
= β0 + γt + ωit + Ωjt + ξij + eijt

where ωit is the individual component of the wage, and Ωjt is the establishment component, both
of which contain observable and unobservable parts.


                                                                                                    3
         Because the LEHD has no measures of education for workers 5, we matched workers on
the LEHD to their attributes on the Census/CPS to measure their years of education, with a
match rate of about 20 percent of all observations. To make maximum use of the full data set,
however, we use the full sample to differentiate the establishment effects from the individual
effects and use age and age square to measure experience. Appendix table A gives summary
statistics for the matched and full sample. The matching process produces a matched sample that
is higher in earnings and worker attributes that are positively associated with earnings such as
age and being white and that is also higher in firm and establishment attributes positively
associated with earnings such as number of employees and capital per employee. But the
variation in characteristics is still large enough for our empirical analysis to yield meaningful
statistical relations.

        Comparing equations 1 and 3, if personal skills and attributes are the sole factor behind
differences in earnings, the coefficients of equation (1) estimate the gross return to those
skills/attributes inclusive of possible gains from access to different employers, while equation (3)
measures the net return exclusive of the earnings characteristics of employers. Alternatively, to
the extent that the covariates in equation (1) are correlated with the equation (2) variables, the
estimated coefficients of (1) can be viewed as biased estimates of the net effects of
skills/attributes in equation (2).

Census-LEHD & BRB Matched Data

        To estimate augmented ln earnings equation (3) we combined data files for workers,
establishments, and firms in manufacturing. We focus on manufacturing because the Annual
Survey of Manufacturers provides information on manufacturing establishments annually that is
unavailable for other sectors. Our methodology can, however, be applied to other sectors using
data from the quinquennial Economic Censuses and other sources.

        The dependent variable is earnings for individual workers, obtained from the
Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Employment History Files for the nine
states with LEHD data from 1992 through 2007. 6 The LEHD data are linked to the quinquennial
Census of Manufacturers (CoM) for the four economic census years, 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007,
and to the Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) in the intermediate years, using the LEHD
Business Register Bridge (BRB) that links data at the firm level. LEHD establishments are
linked by firm, detailed industry and county to CoM/ASM establishments. For single-unit firms
and for plants of a firm not located in the same county as other plants of the firm in the same
industry, the mapping from LEHD to CoM/ASM establishments is unique within detailed

5   Education data have been recently now added to the LEHD.

6 The LEHD data provides annualized quarterly earnings from the unemployment insurance (UI) benefit
    programs, linked to the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages Program. We use only observations that
    include positive earnings in the second quarter of the year. Abowd et al. (2002) describe the construction of the
    LEHD data. The nine states are: California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, North Carolina, Oregon,
    Washington, and Wisconsin. They cover approximately half of US employment. Comparisons with data for
    states that cover different time periods show that the nine state sample are reasonably representative (Barth et al.
    2016).
                                                                                                                       4
industry and county. This is the vast majority of observations. But for plants of a firm in the
same industry and county, the link is not one-to-one. For these establishments, we aggregate
plant characteristics to the firm-industry-county level and link these measures to their workers.

        We obtain measures of the years of schooling, occupation, age, race and gender of
workers in the LEHD by linking workers to their characteristics in the 1990 and 2000 Decennial
Census long form and March CPS files for 1986-1997. The Census Center for Administrative
Records staff matched these data using the internal person identifier called a Protected
Identification Key (PIK), which is the person identifier in the Census and CPS and in the LEHD.
Beginning with 2000 decennial files have very high PIK match rates of 90-93% (Mulrow et al.
2011, Rastogi and O’Hara 2012). However the 1990 PIK is more limited due to the vintage of
address files, 7 so that matching the Census/CPS data to the LEHD Employee History Files
(EHF) provided us with data on years of schooling and other worker attributes for 20.5% of
employees in the LEHD data. 8

       The quinquennial Census of Manufacturing and Annual Survey of Manufacturers
provides production-related data on manufacturing establishments, which we add to the files on
employees: the number of workers at establishments, and establishment-level capital equipment
and building stock (as constructed by Foster, Grim, and Haltiwanger (2016) with perpetual
inventory methods). We measure firm employment from the LBD, and whether a firm reports
R&D expenditures and the amount from the Survey of Industrial R&D. Appendix table A gives
summary statistics for our key variables.

Basic Variance Decomposition

        As the first step in unpacking the impact of employers on earnings, we decomposed the
variance of the ln earnings of individuals in the full LEHD data into the variance within
establishments and the variance between establishments for the whole US economy and for the
eight large sectors of the US economy listed in table 1. We regressed the ln earnings of
individuals on establishment dummies separately for each year and take the variance among the
establishment dummies as our estimated establishment effect. The remaining variance reflects
earnings differences within an establishment.

        Table 1 displays the variance and the share of variance associated between
establishments, and the growth of the variance and its share between establishments. In the
economy as a whole 48 percent of the variance of ln earnings among workers comes from
variation between establishments, while 66 percent of the .091 growth in variance arose from a
widening of the earnings distribution between establishments. 9 In manufacturing 57 percent of

7 Individual name and address files are highly sensitive and not generally distributed in the Census Bureau with
  the data files. Our versions of 1990 decennial files did not have original name and address data, and had to be
  reconstructed with other data sets. As a result, the PIK matches favor less mobile adult heads of household.
8 We first matched to the 2000 Census, then matched missing cases to the 1990 Census, and finally matched
  missing cases to the CPS data.
9 Though our sample differs from Barth et al. (2016) because we include all jobs observed in the 2nd quarter of
  each year, not only full year -, main jobs as in that paper, the results are consistent. We included all jobs to keep
                                                                                                                          5
the 0.092 growth in variance come from growth between establishments.

         Table 2 turns to the subset of manufacturing workers for whom we match observations in
the LEHD and Census of Manufacturers to Decennial Census or CPS files which have the
following characteristics: 1) the CPS/Census has years of schooling; (2) the CoM reports
establishment capital and firm and establishment employment 10; and (3) where the workers are
in our data at least four times. The variance of ln earnings in the matched table 2 panel is
noticeably smaller than the variance of ln earnings for manufacturing in the full LEHD in table 1.
We attribute this to the fact that the matched data has fewer small firms than the full sample (see
Appendix table A) and to our requirement that a person be observed at least four times to be in
the file, which drops transitory workers. In addition, the increase in variance falls short of the
increase in the full LEHD; and the 43% contribution of increased earnings between
establishments to the increase in inequality is smaller than the 57% in the full LEHD. The
matched sample thus is likely to understate the contribution of establishments to the variation in
earnings.

        As establishments belong to firms that include other establishments, it is important to
differentiate establishment effects from firm effects in analysis. To assess the importance of
firms in the variance of earnings among establishments, we regressed the estimated
establishment fixed effects on dummy variables for firms. The proportion of the variance
attributed to firms reflects the overall pay practices of firms while the remaining proportion
reflects pay differences among establishments in the same firm. These calculations show that
90.4% (= 0.113/0.125) of the variance in earnings between establishments in 1992 was due to
firm fixed effects and 93.3%, (=0.140/0.150) of the establishment variance in 2007 was due to
the firm fixed effects. Over time the variance in establishment earnings among establishments
within firms fell, so that 47 percent of the increased earnings dispersion in the sample comes
from increased earnings variance between firms.

        Because many small firms have only a single establishment, however, our calculation that
assigns all of the variance of single establishment firms to the firm could arguably overstate the
dominance of firms in establishment effects. To see how much single-unit firms affect our
finding that firm effects capture most of the employer impact on earnings we decomposed the
variances of earnings among establishments for the multi-unit establishments in manufacturing
over the 1992-2007 period and compare that decomposition to the decomposition for all
establishments. Appendix table B gives the results of this exercise. It shows that among multi-
establishment firms 83% (= 0.094/0.113) of the variation in establishment fixed effects is
associated with the firm fixed effect compared to 89% (= 0.106/0.119) of the establishment
variation associated with the firm fixed effect in a full sample. The bias is modest. Thus, our
results are consistent with the emphasis of Song et al. (2015) on the importance of the firm in
accounting for the increased dispersion in worker wages over time.

   as many observations as possible from each individual for the panel data analysis where we identify both person
   effects and establishment effect, as the weakness of such identification is having few observations per individual.

10 This is a match to the so-called tfp-files (see Foster et al. 2016) as well as the LBD-files.

                                                                                                                    6
Cross Section Earnings Equations

        Table 3 records estimated coefficients and standard errors for OLS regressions of the
standard cross section earnings equation and of variants of our augmented earnings equation.
Column (1) gives the coefficients and standard errors for the estimated effects on ln earnings of
years of schooling, age, gender, and some interactions to allow for differences in effects among
those attributes. In addition, the regression includes 171 geographic area dummies and 16 year
dummies so that the coefficients are estimated within year and area. The estimated coefficients
are similar to those typically found in the human capital earnings literature: an estimated average
returns to years of schooling of about 9.4 percent per year and a concave age profile captured by
the negative squared term and estimate gender and race wage gaps at 30% and 17%, respectively.
The R2 of the equation of 0.45 is larger than the R2 in earnings functions fit on CPS data, 11
presumably because variation in earnings in the entire economy exceeds that in manufacturing
and/or because the administrative LEHD earnings has less measurement error than self-reported
earnings in the CPS.

        Column 2 adds a set of workplace variables to reflect place of employment: 4-digit
NAICS industry dummies, the ln number of employees of the firm and the ln number of
employees in the establishment and establishment age and its square 12. The estimates show
significant firm- and establishment effects, and a concave wage-establishment age profile.
Adding the firm and establishment characteristics raises the R2 to 0.505 and thus explains 10% of
the residual variance of earnings for demographically similar persons. The firm and
establishment variables shrink the positive coefficients on years of schooling and age and the
negative coefficients on gender and nonwhite, indicating that some of the impact of those factors
comes through sorting of workers among establishments and industries within manufacturing.

         Column 3 adds variables relating to the attributes of the establishment's work force:
mean years of schooling, mean age, share female and share non-white; capital structures per
worker and capital equipment per worker; the export share of establishment revenues; and the
R&D investment of the firm to which the establishment belongs. The striking result is the high
estimated coefficient on the years of schooling of all workers. The estimated nearly 7% increase
in an individual's earnings for every year of average schooling of co-workers, above and beyond
the 7.4 percent higher earnings boost from an extra year of the workers' own education suggests
that it is almost as good to work in an establishment with more educated workers as it is to have
more education. The estimates also show that workers earn more in establishments with older
workers and less in establishments with a larger proportion of female or nonwhite workers; and
that greater capital equipment per worker raises earnings more than greater capital structures per
worker (a coefficient difference of 0.046 vs 0.007) and that earnings are higher in establishments
with a high export share. Finally, earnings rise with R&D intensity of a firm: workers in firms
with one standard deviation higher R&D intensity average 2% more earnings.


11 Estimating a similar regression with CPS data for the whole work force gave an R2 of 0.35.
12 Dickens and Katz (1986) estimate industry wage differentials. Brown and Medoff (1989) study employer size-
   wage effect.
                                                                                                                7
         Column 4 gives the regression results with dummy variables for firms added to the
equation while Column 5 gives results with dummy variables for establishments replacing those
for firms. Addition of the firm fixed effects substantially reduces the estimated impact of the
number of employees at the firm, indicating that short run changes in firm employment have
little effect on wages, but only reduce the coefficient on number of employees at the
establishment modestly. The Column 5 estimates with dummy variables for establishment also
markedly reduce the coefficient for firm employment but leave a substantial effect of
establishment employment on wages. With establishment fixed effects in the equation, the
positive effect of establishment employment suggests that an establishment operates along a
rising supply curve of labor for short term increases in employment.

        Addition of the firm and establishment dummies naturally shrinks the estimated effect of
firm and establishment variables on earnings. The Column 4 firm fixed effects regression
eliminates the negative relationship between the share of non-white employees. Working in an
establishment with a large non-white share is associated with low wages, but short run changes
in the non-white share do not affect establishment earnings much. The Column 4 fixed effects
regression also greatly weakens the relationship between R&D and earnings, reducing the
estimated coefficient by over 80 percent. While R&D firms pay more than firms that do less
R&D, changes in R&D activity within a firm has little impact on earnings.

        The Column 5 regressions which include establishment fixed effects further shrink the
coefficients of most of the establishment workforce characteristics compared to those in column
3. The column 3 estimated 0.0690 effect of the mean years of schooling on earnings drops to
0.0249 in column 5 while the estimated -0.3176 for being female in column 3 drops to -0.1084 in
column 5. While measurement error usually accounts for some of the lower coefficient on
variables in longitudinal analysis compared to cross section analysis (Freeman 1984), the pooling
of observations to create average characteristics is likely to diminish measurement error so that
huge drops in the effects of these characteristics are more likely to reflect economic behavior, as
firms adjust earnings to changing characteristics gradually over time.

Panel Earnings Equations

        The longitudinal structure of the LEHD allows us to estimate the effects of employer
characteristics on earnings for the same individual in two ways: by comparing workers who
remain in the same job over time while management changes characteristics of the establishment
or accepts changes from other sources; 13 or by comparing workers who quit an employer with
one set of characteristics to join an employer with other characteristics. Outside of recession
years, the bulk of the labor mobility comes from worker decisions to move to a new employer
willing to hire them. In recessions, mobility depends more on the decisions of firms, with the




13        Changes that management accepts refers to changes in attributes due to worker decisions, such as
voluntary retirement where management did not seek to hire experienced workers as replacements or mobility where
the management did not replace a worker who left with someone having the same skill or characteristic, and the like.
                                                                                                                  8
number of layoffs increasing to approach or exceed the number of quits 14. While our data lack
information on whether a worker left a job by quitting or by layoff, the fact that recession years
are less frequent than non-recession years suggests that the bulk of the worker changes reflect
quits rather than layoffs. 15

        Table 4 presents estimates of the effect of employer attributes on the earnings of the same
worker when those attributes change. The first column shows the results of adding individual
fixed effects to the basic ln earnings regression from column 3 in table 3. The coefficients on
some employer level variables declines with the addition of the worker fixed effects: the
estimated coefficient for average years of schooling of workers in an establishment falls by 59%
(from 0.0737 to 0.0299), suggesting that much of the large co-worker schooling impact is due to
positive sorting of workers by unmeasured individual characteristics into establishments with
more educated workers. The coefficient on the equipment stock of capital per employee also
drops massively by 70% (from 0.0462 to 0.0140), suggesting positive sorting of unmeasured
individual characteristics into establishments with more equipment capital. And the coefficient
on R&D drops by 83% (from 0.762 to 0.1290) , suggesting that most of the cross section R&D
effect is due to a positive matching between R&D firms and unmeasured individual
characteristics.

        The next two columns unpack the fixed effects model into its two parts. Column 2
estimates the effect of employer characteristics on the wages of workers who stay in the same
establishment. This controls for establishment fixed effects and match-specific fixed effects as
well as for unobserved individual fixed effects. Column 3 estimates the impact of employer
factors on the wages of workers who changed employers, which identifies the effects of
establishment characteristics through changes in the employer, and thus does not control for
establishment fixed effects or match-specific effects. 16

        For most establishment characteristics, the estimated effects of worker initiated changes
in column 3 have a much greater impact on earnings than the estimated effects of employer-
initiated changes in column 2. Moving to an establishment in a larger firm gives a wage increase
of 0.0162 while a change in number of workers at a given establishment gives a 0.0056 boost to
earnings -- about one-third as large. Moving from a less education intensive establishment to a
more education intensive establishment increases wages by 0.0322 compared to an increase of
0.0048 in earnings for an increase in average education in a workers' current establishment.
Moving to an establishment with older workers raises the wage of the mover while staying in an
establishment with a rising age of the work force reduces the workers' wage. The effect of R&D

7.

15         We did not probe possible differences between job changes from establishments having large drops in
employment, where layoffs are potentially important, and job changes from establishments with stable or growing
employment, where the locus would likely be voluntary shifts to better outside opportunities.
16         For this analysis we examine every job-to-job move in the data, retaining only the observations before and
after the move, and estimate the regression including individual fixed effects.

                                                                                                                       9
on wages is more than twice as large for movers than for stayers (0.2075 vs 0.0860). But not all
characteristics have a larger effect for movers than stayers. An increase in establishment
employment has a modestly larger effect for persons who stay with an establishment than for
those who move, and similarly for the share of non-whites.

        Mechanically, the differences between the column 2 stayers-based estimates and the
column 3 movers-based estimates reflect the fact that the stayers analysis controls for
unobserved establishment fixed effects and thus removes correlations between those effects and
the wages while the movers model does not do this. But the differences also reflect economic
behavior. A worker who chooses to change employers will likely require a larger increase in pay
than one who stays at a job as the work changes due to a changing workplace. An establishment
that changes characteristics will likely adjust operations slowly and thus alter pay less in the
short run than the pay difference between employers that have had different characteristics over
longer periods. 17

        Earnings equations with individual fixed effects cannot identify the effect of fixed
individual characteristics on earnings. But it is possible to learn something about how those
characteristics affect earnings by regressing the estimated fixed effect for individuals on
measures of individual characteristics. With say ten workers with two defining characteristics,
say years of schooling and gender, the earnings equation would produce ten fixed effects to
regress on schooling and gender.

        Columns 1-3 of table 5 give the results of our analysis of the effect of fixed worker
characteristics on the estimated fixed effects of workers in three fixed effect models with
different structures. Model 1 estimated individual fixed effects without employer
characteristics. 18 Model 2 estimated individual fixed effects from a regression with observable
employer characteristics. Model 3 estimated individual fixed effects from a stayers’ regression
that includes establishment and match-specific fixed effects (eq. 3).

       For individual effects positively related to the characteristics of employers, the estimates
should decline across the columns, as they do. The returns to years of schooling drops from
0.1076 to 0.0841 from the model 1 specification to the model 3 specification with controls for
observed and unobserved establishment effects. The coefficient on female falls by more than
10% and the coefficient on age falls by 18%.

        The bottom line in Table 5 labeled “variance of the unobserved individual fixed effect”,
shows how the addition of establishment characteristics reduces the contribution of the fixed
effects for individuals to the variation of earnings among workers. In model 1, the individual

17        Measurement error will also bias downward the estimates based on changes, for the basic reason that a
given error will have proportionately larger impact on the small variation in year to year changes at the same
workplace than on the larger differences between the employer the worker joins and the employer the worker leaves.

18        The difference is that in the fixed effects specification, the unobserved individual fixed effects are allowed
to be correlated with all the included time-varying covariates.

                                                                                                                     10
fixed effect variance is 0.149, or 51% of the total variance. In model 2, which includes measured
establishment characteristics, the individual fixed effect variance falls to 0.127 or 43% of the
total variance. In model 3 with observed and unobserved establishment characteristics, the
variance of the individual effect is 0.112, or about 38% of the total variance in earnings. Put
differently, establishment factors account for 25% ((= 0.149- 0.112)/0.149) of the variance of
estimated individual effects.

A full decomposition

        Table 6 summarizes our findings with a full decomposition of ln earnings along the
various dimensions in the augmented earnings equation. Standard individual characteristics
(years of schooling, age, gender, and race) comprise 26% of the total variation in earnings;
unobserved individual effects comprise 37% of the variation; observed establishment
characteristics comprise 8%; unobserved establishment effects comprise 7%, and the match
component 3%. The covariance between the individual and establishment components of the
earnings equation adds 13% of the variance. The remaining variation arises from the transitory
within-match residual comprising 7% of the total variation, in addition to the two small negative
covariance terms between the observed an unobserved parts of the individual and establishment
components respectively 19.

       Given that the sorting of workers between establishments affects the returns to individual
characteristics and earnings differentials by gender and race, we next analyze the ways in which
workers and firms match up.

The sorting of workers between establishments

        Table 7 gives the correlation coefficients that reflect sorting by key earnings
determinants. The largest correlations show considerable homophily sorting of workers with
similar characteristics: correlations of educated workers with educated workers (0.477), of older
workers with older workers (0.333), females with females (0.349) and non-whites with non-
whites (0.471). But other characteristics of employers are sufficiently correlated with worker
characteristics to suggest sorting of workers among establishments beyond homophily. Educated
workers work in large firms and in R&D intensive firms, in establishments with high capital per
worker and with high export shares. These patterns make it likely that some of the education
earnings premium comes through the greater likelihood that educated workers find jobs in
employers with other wage enhancing characteristics. Older workers are also associated with
establishments with high wage characteristics, though the correlations are much smaller. By


19 Our model is estimated under the assumptions that the fixed individual and establishment/firm effects remain
   constant throughout the sample period. Experiments with estimation on sub-periods show that this assumption is
   too restrictive, and that the variance of both the individual and establishment fixed effects rise over time during
   the sample period. The period over which to treat individual and establishment/firm fixed effects as fixed raises
   statistical and modeling issues that require analysis beyond the scope of the current study, on which we will
   report in a separate paper.

                                                                                                                    11
contrast, women work in establishments with lower capital intensity and non-white workers are
largely employed in establishments with low wage characteristics.

        The bottom two lines of the table shows the correlation between a measure of the
establishment contribution to earnings through observed variables plus industry and region taken
as a group, weighted by their estimated effect on earnings, and through establishment fixed
effects with the individual characteristics. Both the establishment observables and fixed effects
are most highly correlated with years of schooling, making schooling potentially the most
important dimension of worker sorting among establishments.

        Figure 1 summarizes the relations between the characteristics of workers and those of the
establishments where they work in a different way. It displays the correlations between indices
of the observed characteristics as a group, weighted by their respective coefficients in the
earnings equation, and the fixed effects associated for workers as well as for establishments. The
largest correlation is between the individual observables (weighted by their contribution to
earnings) and establishment observables (0.253) (weighted by their contribution to earnings),
followed by the correlation between the individual observables and the establishment unobserved
fixed effect. By contrast, the fixed effect of individuals is weakly positively correlated with the
establishment observables while the individual unobservables and unobserved establishment
fixed effects are negatively correlated – a result consistent with Abowd et al. (2014). As
Andrews et al. (2008) note, a negative correlation between two unobserved components of
earnings could result from sampling and measurement errors, 20 so the safest conclusion from
these correlations is that sorting of workers occurs largely on observable characteristics.

Mobility Among employers

       The impact of employer characteristics on the earnings of workers with similar measured
characteristics and fixed effects and the correlations in table 7 and figure 1 direct attention at the
potential role of worker mobility among employers in determining pay. To what extent does
mobility from job to job raise pay? Do workers who start their careers in establishments with
low wage characteristics move to firms with better observable and unobservable characteristics
over time? Conversely, how much downward firm mobility is there among workers who initially
begin their careers at firms with high wage characteristics?

        To examine the transitions of workers among establishments that differ in the
establishment component of earnings, we formed a transition matrix for workers observed in our
data both in 1992 and 2007. We attached to every worker in the sample the total establishment
contribution of their employer to earnings, defined as the sum of the contribution to earnings of
the time varying establishment characteristics, such as firm size and R&D spending, the fixed
observables, such as industry and region, and the unobserved establishment effects. With an
establishment contribution for each worker in 1992 and 2007, the natural measure of each
workers' mobility is the change in the establishment component of earnings of their employer in
those years.

20 Lise, Meghir and Robin (2013) give further discussion of these issues.

                                                                                                   12
        Table 8 summarizes the transition pattern by quintiles of the distributions, ordered from
low-paying firms in quintile 1 to high-paying firms in quintile 5. The rows in the table show the
distribution of workers by the quintiles of their establishment in the 1992 distribution of
establishments into the quintiles of their 2007 employer in the distribution of establishments in
that year. While the largest transition probabilities are for workers to remain in the same quintile
over time, there is evidence of upward movement among establishments. Workers in the low
quintiles have larger shares going up in the distribution than workers in the top quintiles have
shares falling in the distribution. Among workers in the median group (3rd quintile) 38 percent
move to a higher quintile, whereas only 21 percent move down while 40 percent remain in the
same quintile. New workers come into the distribution of firms at the lower end and change jobs
over time to produce a lifetime move up the distribution.

        Finally, we characterize the sorting of workers with workers between establishments by
Kremer and Maskin’s (1996) index of segregation, ρ = cov (ω ω)/V(ω) , where ω is the average
individual component of the establishment and V(ω) is the variance of the individual components
of the standard earnings equation. If workers completely segregate between establishments
according to their individual earnings components, ρ = 1. If they are randomly allocated
between establishments ρ = 0. We calculated the index for both observable individual earnings
components and for the unobserved fixed effect and obtained an index of 0.24 for observable
characteristics, and 0.17 for unobservable characteristics. This supports the implication of the
correlations that sorting of workers according to observed individual characteristics such as years
of schooling, age, gender, and race is considerably stronger than segregation according to
unobserved skills or other earnings attributes.

        Characterizing the sorting of workers with establishments by the equivalent Kremer-
Maskin (1996) index ρΩ=cov(ω,Ω)/V(ω), where Ω refers to the earnings components of
establishment, we divide the decomposition into its within (Vw) establishment and between (Vb)
establishment parts by the identities:

(4a) Vw(lnw) = V(ω)(1-ρ) + V(ξ) + V(e)

(4b) Vb(lnw) = V(ω)(ρ +2*ρΩ) + V(Ω)

        In our data, ρ=0.247 and ρΩ=0.100. The within establishment component is 59% of the
variance in wages, of which 82% arises from the individual component (observed and
unobserved), 6% from the match component, and 12% from the residual. The between
component contributes 41% of the variance in wages, of which 36% is due to worker-worker
sorting, 30% to worker-establishment sorting, and 34% to variance of the establishment effect.

Conclusion

       This study has matched individual, establishment, and firm data-bases to estimate an
earnings equation that augments standard regressions of ln earnings on the measured


                                                                                                 13
characteristics of individual workers with measures of the characteristics of employers and with
fixed effects estimates of unobserved characteristics of workers and employers. We find that:

        1) Workers are paid more in establishments with more employees, in older establishments
(up to a point), with greater equipment capital per worker and greater exports, with a workforce
that has more educated workers, older workers, male and white workers; and in firms with
greater R&D spending. Co-workers years of schooling has almost as large an impact on a
workers earnings as the workers own years of schooling.

        2) The estimated coefficients for employer characteristics diminish in longitudinal data
when models include firm and establishment fixed effects, presumably because those models
identify the effects from short term, possibly transitory, changes in characteristics while cross
section differences reflect long term responses of earnings to characteristics.

        3) Individual fixed effects models that identify coefficients based on the employer
changing workplace characteristics for the same worker/job give markedly smaller though still
generally significant estimates of the effect of characteristics on wages than fixed effect models
that estimate coefficients from workers who change jobs.

        4) There is considerable sorting of workers with similar workers, based on observable
earnings characteristics and to a lesser degree on unobserved earnings characteristics and sorting
of workers with establishments having similar high or low earnings attributes. The dynamics of
worker mobility among employers has workers moving to enterprises with higher observable and
fixed effects earnings components over time.

        All told, bringing employers more into analysis of earnings illuminates the variance
unexplained by the link between ln earnings and individual characteristics and illuminates the
role of sorting in the relation between earnings and individual attributes. It also raises new
questions for analysis: Why does having more educated co-workers have almost as large an
effect on earnings as having additional education yourself? What mechanisms sort workers
among firms in ways that increase education, gender, and race wage gaps? How much does the
impetus for mobility – layoffs vs quits – affect worker outcomes? How much of firm effects on
earnings can be linked to explicit wage policies? And given manufacturing's modest and
declining share of employment, would augmented earnings functions in other industries tell us
the same or different stories about the role of employers in determining earnings and in the
sorting of workers among employers?

Note: Firms in the “All” establishment sample include the establishment effects for single-unit firms whereas the
“MU’s” sample only include multi establishment firms (defined as multi-unit firms within manufacturing only).
Numbers calculated from a regression of log earnings on time dummies and establishment dummies. The total
variance is calculated after subtracting variance due to the time dummies. Firm effects estimated from regression of
establishment fixed effects on firm dummies. Multi-unit firms are defined as multi-unit firms within manufacturing
only.
