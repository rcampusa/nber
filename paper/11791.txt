                                            ABSTRACT

Central banks typically raise short-term interest rates to defend currency pegs. Higher interest rates,
however, often lead to a credit crunch and an output contraction. We model this trade-off in an
optimizing, first-generation model in which the crisis may be delayed but is ultimately inevitable.
We show that higher interest rates may delay the crisis, but raising interest rates beyond a certain
point may actually bring forward the crisis due to the large negative output effect. The optimal
interest rate defense involves setting high interest rates (relative to the no defense case) both before
and at the moment of the crisis. Furthermore, while the crisis could be delayed even further, it is not
optimal to do so.

1         Introduction

The last …fteen years have witnessed a succession of currency crises, ranging from the EMS

crises in 1992 to similar episodes in Mexico (1994), Asia (1997), Russia (1998), Brazil (1999),

and Argentina (2001). Given the economic dislocations that inevitably accompany a bal-

ance of payments (BOP) crisis, the design of appropriate policies to …ght and prevent such

occurrences is an issue of critical importance to policymakers and academics alike. As ca-

sual evidence makes abundantly clear, the standard …rst line of defense against mounting

pressure on an exchange rate peg is to raise short-term interest rates. In fact, higher interest

rates to defend a peg (or, more generally, strengthen the domestic currency) are a standard

component of IMF programs, as implemented in Russia, Brazil, and most Asian countries

(Fischer, 1998). The desirability of such policies, however, has become a matter of intense

debate in the policy arena.1

        The standard rationale among policymakers for raising short-term interest rates is to

make domestic-currency denominated assets more attractive (hereafter referred to as the

“money demand e¤ect”). This should slow down (or, hopefully, stop altogether) the loss of

reserves under a pegged exchange rate. On the cost side, both proponents and detractors

essentially agree that a high interest rate policy entails mainly three type of costs: (i) a

…scal cost in the form of a higher operational de…cit, which results from higher interest

rates on public debt; (ii) an output cost, as high interest rates lead to a credit crunch and

an output contraction; and (iii) a further deterioration of an already weak banking system

(when applicable).          The policy debate centers on the implicit assessment of the bene…ts

versus the costs of higher interest rates, with proponents emphasizing the short-run bene…ts

of currency stability and detractors focusing on the magnitude of the costs.
    1
        IMF critics like Je¤ Sachs and Joe Stiglitz, for instance, have vehemently argued against high interest

rate policies in numerous pieces in the …nancial press.


                                                        1
          For all the practical importance of this issue, there was until recently little, if any, aca-

demic work focusing explicitly on this debate.               The seminal work on currency crises by

Krugman (1979) and Flood and Garber (1984) –and most of the ensuing literature –gives

no role to the monetary authority in …ghting a potential crisis, as it implicitly assumes that

policymakers sit passively as they watch international reserves dwindle down until the …nal

speculative attack wipes them out completely. Only recently has an incipient theoretical

literature begun to explicitly address this topic.2 In particular, in Lahiri and Végh (2003),

we analyze the e¤ectiveness and optimality of raising short-term interest rates to defend a

peg by focusing on the trade-o¤ between the money demand e¤ect and the …scal cost. We

show that higher interest rates may indeed delay a BOP crisis –which in practice may buy

precious time for policymakers to address the fundamental imbalances.                     Raising interest

rates beyond a certain point, however, may actually bring the crisis forward as the …scal

e¤ect begins to dominate the money demand e¤ect. There is thus some increase in interest

rates that will maximize the delay. We also show, however, that it is not optimal to delay

the crisis as much as possible. Our analysis thus validates some of the critics’concerns about

the perils of higher interest rates, while still o¤ering a formal rationale for the monetary au-

thority to play an active role in defending a currency peg.3 However, our analysis in that

paper abstracts completely from output e¤ects of higher interest rates.
      2
          See Drazen (2003), Flood and Jeanne (2005), and Lahiri and Végh (2003). Empirically, the evidence

on the e¤ectiveness of higher interest rates in defending/strengthening the domestic currency is mixed (see,

for example, Dekle, Hsiao, and Wang (2001) and Kraay (2001)).
   3
     Flood and Jeanne (2005) also focus on the …scal costs of higher interest rates. Drazen (2003), on the

other hand, looks at the signalling e¤ects of higher interest rates. Our analysis is also related to Burnside,

Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2001a), where the government can delay the time of the crisis by further borrowing

(which implies higher interest rates in the future) but, unlike in our model, there are no bene…ts from doing

so.




                                                       2
       In this paper, we focus our attention on the output costs of higher interest rates, which

is arguably the most important channel. As Figure 1 illustrates for four emerging economies

that have actively defended their currencies by raising short-term interest rates, higher in-

terest rates are typically associated with an output contraction (with vertical lines in the

…gures denoting periods of active interest rate defense).4 Figure 2 illustrates, in turn, the

link between credit contractions and higher interest rates. The …gure suggests that higher

interest rates depress the economy through a credit channel.

       We address the trade-o¤ between the money demand e¤ect and the output e¤ect in

the context of an otherwise standard, optimizing, small open economy that is prone to

Krugman-type crises.5          To this e¤ect, we incorporate a credit channel by assuming that

…rms are dependent on bank credit for their productive activities, while banks need deposits

to make loans. Following Calvo and Végh (1995), we model interest rate policy as the

monetary authority’s ability to set the interest rate on an interest-bearing liability (a non-

traded domestic bond).           We assume that this domestic bond is held only by domestic

commercial banks. Raising the interest rate on this domestic bond increases both the lending

rate to …rms as well as the deposit rate paid to depositors. The latter e¤ect increases money

demand (de…ned as the demand for demand deposits) and may postpone the time of the

attack. The higher lending rate, however, reduces bank credit to …rms and, hence, extracts

an output cost by reducing employment and output.6
   4
       The data for Figures 1 and 2 comes from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics. For detailed

evidence on the contractionary e¤ects of currency crises, see Calvo and Reinhart (1999) and Gupta, Mishra,

and Sahay (2002).
   5
     By a Krugman-type crisis, we mean an environment in which the central bank …xes the exchange rate

but follows an expansionary domestic credit policy.
   6
     We should note that the mechanism through which an interest rate defense works in our set-up is di¤erent

from another, more common, channel. Under our mechanism, the interest rate defense works by raising the

demand for the domestic money base. This reduces the size of the attack at the time of the crisis and thereby


                                                     3
    Within this model, our main question is: given the Krugman distortion (i.e., an unsus-

tainable …xed exchange rate), can policymakers delay the crisis by raising interest rates?

And, if so, what is the optimal interest rate defense? To answer these questions, we …rst

distinguish between two types of interest rate defense (both of which are announced as of

time zero): (i) a contemporaneous interest rate defense of the peg whereby the monetary

authority announces that it will raise the domestic interest rate only when the market inter-

est rate rises; and (ii) a preemptive interest rate defense of the peg whereby the monetary

authority raises the domestic interest rate before the crisis actually occurs.

    We show that both the preemptive and the contemporaneous interest rate defense succeed

in delaying the crisis (at the cost of a fall in output) but only up to a certain point. Beyond

some critical level, raising interest rates further may actually bring the crisis forward. We

then show that – relative to the no-defense case – it is always optimal to announce high

interest rates both before and at the time of the crisis. Hence, it is not optimal for the central

bank to remain passive as its reserves dwindle, as implicitly assumed by …rst-generation

models of BOP crises. Furthermore, at an optimum, higher interest rates at the time of the

crisis would succeed in further delaying the crisis but such a policy would obviously not be

optimal.

    In sum, our model provides a simple framework to think about the trade-o¤s involved in

an active interest rate defense of a peg. It suggests that there is indeed a role for an active
postpones the attack. In the alternative view, interest rate defenses work by raising the cost of speculation

to the point where the additional cost of speculation o¤sets the expected devaluation of the currency. In

our perfect foresight environment, there is no discrete devaluation and thus this channel does not apply. In

any event, this alternative mechanism has been critiqued on the grounds that, to be e¤ective in deterring

speculators, interest rates must be raised to unreasonable levels. Thus, Drazen (1993) argues that “... even

if foreign currency assets bore no interest, an expected overnight devaluation of 0.5 percent would require

an annual interest rate over 500 percent ((1.005)365 -1) x 100 = 517) to make speculation unpro…table.”



                                                     4
interest rate defense, thus calling into question the policy relevance of models that assume

away this policy option. The presence of output costs, however, imposes clear limits to the

use of higher interest rates, which are captured in the model by the fact that the time of

the crisis is a non-monotonic function (inverted U) of the level of interest rates. While, by

necessity, the model abstracts from many other relevant channels in practice, we believe that

it captures an essential trade-o¤ between the costs and bene…ts of delaying a crisis.

   Before proceeding further, some remarks about our modelling strategy are in order. In

any open economy set-up, allowing for an independent interest rate policy channel to co-exist

with an independent exchange rate policy involves deviating from the assumption of perfect

substitutability between domestic and foreign assets. In our model this is accomplished

by introducing a non-traded domestic bond that is held only by domestic banks, which in

turn cannot hold foreign bonds. Within this structure, if we allowed any subset of agents

to simultaneously hold both domestic and foreign bonds, the no-arbitrage condition would

immediately equalize domestic and foreign returns and hence eliminate the central bank’s

ability to independently set the interest rate on domestic bonds.     While this assumption

seems stark, it is not as restrictive as might seem at …rst glance. There are alternative ways

of breaking the no-arbitrage relationship without changing the key underlying mechanism

through which an interest rate defense works in the model.      Thus, as in Calvo and Végh

(1995), we could allow households to hold these domestic bonds along with the foreign bonds

but assume that these domestic bonds provide liquidity services, i.e., one can write checks

on these holdings.     Alternatively, one could allow banks to also hold foreign bonds but

introduce a costly banking technology as in Edwards and Végh (1997) wherein banks face

a cost of managing domestic assets.     Under either of these scenarios, this paper’s results

would carry through.

   The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops the model, while Section 3 works out


                                              5
the mechanics of a BOP crisis under a passive interest rate policy. Section 4 analyzes the

e¤ects of an active interest rate defense on output and the timing of the crisis. Section 5

derives the optimal interest rate defense of the peg. Section 6 concludes.



2     The model

Consider a small open economy that is perfectly integrated with the rest of the world in

goods markets. The economy is inhabited by an in…nitely-lived representative household

that receives utility from consuming a perishable good and disutility from supplying labor.

The world price of the good in terms of foreign currency is …xed and normalized to unity.

Free goods mobility across borders implies that the law of one price holds. The consumer

can also trade freely in perfectly competitive world capital markets by buying and selling an

international bond. These international bonds are denominated in terms of the good and

pay a constant r units of the good as interest at every point in time.


2.1       Households

The household maximizes lifetime welfare, which is given by
                 Z     1
                             1

                   0       1 1=

where c denotes consumption, x is labor supply,                is the intertemporal elasticity of substi-

tution,        1 is the inverse of the elasticity of labor supply with respect to the real wage

(as will become evident below), and             (> 0) is the exogenous and constant rate of time

preference. These preferences are well-known from the work of Greenwood, Hercowitz and

Hu¤man (1988) and have been widely used in the real business cycle literature, as they

provide a better description of consumption and the trade balance for small open economies


                                                     6
than alternative speci…cations (see, for instance, Correia, Neves, and Rebelo (1995)). In our

case, we adopt these preferences for analytical tractability since it will enable us to derive

our key results analytically.7

       Households use interest-bearing demand deposits to reduce transactions costs. For sim-

plicity, we will assume that transactions costs depend only on real demand deposits (but not

on consumption). Speci…cally, the transactions costs technology takes the standard form

                                                         st = (ht );                                 (2)

where s denotes the non-negative transactions costs incurred by the consumer and h denotes

real interest-bearing demand deposits. Additional real demand deposits reduce transactions

costs, but at a decreasing rate. Formally:


                                         0                   00               0
                        (h)        0;        (h)   0;             (h) > 0;        (h ) = (h ) = 0:

                              0
The assumption that               (h ) = 0 for some …nite value of h (= h ) ensures that the consumer

can be satiated with real money balances (i.e., the Friedman rule can be implemented). At

that point, transactions costs are assumed to be zero.

       In addition to demand deposits, households can hold an internationally-traded bond (b).

Real …nancial wealth at time t is thus given by at = bt + ht . We denote the deposit rate by

id . No arbitrage on the internationally-traded bond implies that the nominal interest rate is

given by i = r + ", where " denotes the rate of devaluation. Hence, the opportunity cost of

holding demand deposits is I d                 i   id (the deposit spread).8 The ‡ow budget constraint

facing the representative household is thus given by

                                                                                        f
                           a_ t = rat + wt xt +          t         ct   st   Itd ht +   t   +   b

for this problem are given by (assuming, as usual, that                                 = r):

                                                                1=

                                                                yt = xt :                                    (10)

Firms are assumed to face a “credit-in-advance” constraint, in the sense that they need to

borrow from banks to pay the wage bill.10 Formally:

                                                  nt = wt xt ;              > 0;                             (11)

where n denotes bank loans.11 The assumption that …rms must use bank credit to pay the

wage bill is needed to generate a demand for bank loans.

       Firms may also hold foreign bonds, bf . Thus, the real …nancial wealth of the represen-

tative …rm at time t is given by aft = bft                        nt . Using i` to denote the lending rate charged

by banks and letting I `            i`   i denote the lending spread, we can write the ‡ow constraint

faced by the …rm as

                                     a_ ft = raft + yt            wt xt (1 + It` )      f
                                                                                        t:                   (12)

It is easy to see from equation (12) that wt xt It` (= It` nt ) is the additional …nancial cost

incurred by …rms due to the fact that they need to borrow from banks to pay the wage bill.

Integrating forward equation (12), imposing the standard transversality condition, and using

equation (10) yields
                   Z           1                            Z    1
                                   f
                                   te
                                      rt
                                         dt   =   af0   +            xt     wt xt (1 + It` ) e   rt
                                                                                                      dt:    (13)
                           0                                0
   9
       We adopt a linear production technology purely for analytical simplicity and without loss of generality.
  10
       Alternatively, we could assume that bank credit is an input in the production function, in which case

the derived demand for credit would be interest-rate elastic. This would considerably complicate the model

without adding any additional insights.
  11
     Note that the credit-in-advance constraint (equation (11)) will hold as an equality only along paths

where the lending spread I ` is strictly positive. We will assume (with no loss of generality) that if I ` = 0,

this constraint holds with equality as well.


                                                                     9
       The …rm chooses a path of x to maximize the present discounted value of dividends,

which is given by the right hand side of equation (13), taking as given af0 , r, and the paths

for wt and It` . The …rst-order condition for this problem is given by


                                              1 = wt (1 + It` ):                                          (14)


Intuitively, at an optimum, the …rm equates the marginal productivity of labor (unity) to the

marginal cost of an additional unit of labor, given by the real wage, wt , plus the associated

…nancial cost, wt It` .


2.3        Banks

The economy is assumed to have a perfectly competitive banking sector. The representative

bank accepts deposits from consumers and lends to both …rms (n) and the government (z) in

the form of domestic government bonds.12 The bank charges an interest rate of i` to …rms

and earns ig on government bonds. It also holds required cash reserves, m (high powered

money).        The bank pays depositors an interest rate of id . Assuming, for simplicity, that

banks’net worth is zero, the balance sheet identity implies that mt + nt + zt = ht . As noted

in the introduction, the assumption that domestic banks do not hold foreign assets is key to

the ability of the central bank to independently set the domestic interest rate.13
  12
       Commercial bank lending to governments is particular common in developing countries (see, for instance,

Calvo and Végh (1995) and the references therein). Government debt is held not only as compulsory (and

remunerated) reserve requirements but also voluntarily due to the lack of pro…table investment opportunities

in crisis-prone countries.
  13
     Similar results would go through if we allowed banks to hold foreign bonds as long as they faced a cost of

managing domestic assets (along the lines of Edwards and Végh (1997), Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo

(2001b), or Agenor and Aizenman (1999)). We chose the speci…cation with no foreign borrowing because it

is analytically simpler.



                                                       10
     The ‡ow constraint faced by the bank is then given by

                         b
                         t   = (i`t   "t )nt + (igt      "t )zt    (idt   "t )ht   "t m t :      (15)

It is assumed that the central bank imposes a reserve-requirement ratio > 0. Since required

reserves do not earn interest, at an optimum the bank will not hold any excess reserves.

Hence, we must have

                                                 mt = ht :                                       (16)

Equation (16) implies that the representative commercial bank’s balance sheet identity can

be written as

                                           (1         )ht = nt + zt :                            (17)

The representative bank maximizes pro…ts given by equation (15) by choosing sequences of

nt ; zt ; ht and mt subject to equations (16) and (17), taking as given the paths of i`t , igt , idt ;

and "t . The …rst-order conditions for the banks’optimization problem are

                                            (1         ) i`t = idt ;                             (18)

                                            (1         ) igt = idt :                             (19)

Since the banks do not control any of the interest rates, conditions (18) and (19) should be

interpreted as competitive equilibrium conditions. In this light, conditions (18) and (19) say

that, in equilibrium, the deposit rate(id ) –which captures the marginal cost of deposits for

the banks –will be equal to the marginal revenue from an extra unit of deposits. Since the

banks can only lend a fraction 1            of deposits, the marginal revenue is either (1     ) i`t or

(1     ) igt . Clearly, from (18) and (19), it follows that

                                                      i` = i g :                                 (20)

Intuitively, loans and government bonds are perfect substitutes in the bank’s asset portfolio.

Since the bank can get ig by lending to the government, it must receive at least as much from

                                                         11
…rms in order to extend loans to them. Hence, in equilibrium, any change in the domestic

interest rate ig will automatically translate into a rise in the lending rate, i` . Further, from

(19), it follows that a rise in ig will also lead to a higher deposit rate for consumers and,

hence, an increase in demand deposits.


2.4       Government

The government comprises the monetary and the …scal authority.               For simplicity, it will

be assumed that the monetary authority issues both high powered money, m; and domestic

bonds, z. The monetary authority also pays interest on these bonds, ig , holds interest-

bearing foreign exchange reserves, f , and sets the reserve requirement ratio, . The …scal

authority makes lump-sum transfers, ; to the public. We assume that these …scal transfers

are …xed and invariant over time. Hence,       t   =    for all t. The consolidated government’s

‡ow budget constraint is thus given by



                         f_t = rft + m
                                     _ t + z_t + "t mt + ("t   igt )zt   :                     (21)

Note that the in‡ation tax is given by "t mt in the case of high powered money (which is only

held by banks in this economy) and ("t       igt )zt in the case of domestic bonds.

   Let d denote the stock of real domestic credit. Since the monetary authority issues

interest-bearing debt, its net domestic credit, dn , is given by d       z. We assume that the

government’s domestic credit policy consists of setting a rate of growth for net domestic

credit:
                                            D_ tn
                                                  =    t;                                      (22)
                                            Dtn
where Dn denotes net nominal domestic credit. Let E denote the nominal exchange rate,

that is, the price of foreign currency in terms of domestic currency. From the central bank’s


                                                12
balance sheet, f_t = m
                     _t             d_nt , where dn = Dn =E. Further, note that d_nt = (                          t    "t )dnt : Using

these two facts, equation (21) can be rewritten as:

                                = rft + (        t   "t )dnt + "t mt + ("t           igt )zt + z_t :                            (23)

       Finally, integrating forward (21) and imposing the no-Ponzi games condition yields:

                                Z   1
                       = f0 +           [m
                                         _ t + z_t + "t mt + ("t       igt )zt ] e   rt
                                                                                             dt + e   rT
                                                                                                           4 mT ;               (24)
                   r            0

where the last term on the RHS allows for the possibility of a discrete change in real liabilities

at some time t = T .14              We also assume that the initial stock of net domestic credit and

initial real money demand are such that f0 > 0.


2.5        Equilibrium relations

The …rm’s optimality condition (equation (14)) implies that, in equilibrium, the real wage

is given by
                                                                 1
                                                     wt =             .                                                         (25)
                                                              1 + It`
Intuitively, a higher I ` makes bank credit more expensive for …rms, which increases produc-

tion costs and, hence, reduces …rms’demand for labor, thus lowering the real wage. We can

combine equations (6) and (25) to get

                                                          1          1
                                                     xt       =           ,                                                     (26)
                                                                  1 + It`
which shows that, at an optimum, a higher lending spread must reduce employment, x.

Equation (26) implies that equilibrium employment is given by
                                                          1                      1
                                                     1        1       1              1
                                          xt =                                           .                                      (27)
                                                                   1 + It`
  14
       Throughout the paper, we denote a discrete change in, say, variable x as                       xT     xT       xT . Note that

since the central bank controls net domestic credit, any discrete change in z is exactly o¤set by a change in

gross domestic credit. Hence, only discrete changes in m enter the last term on the RHS of equation (24).


                                                              13
The equilibrium amount of loans in this economy is given by (as follows from (25) and (26)

and the fact that n = wx)
                                                       1
                                               1           1       1               1
                               nt =                                                    .             (28)
                                                                1 + It`

The crucial feature to note from equations (26) and (28) is that a rise in the lending spread

induces a fall in output and in bank credit. Hence, a recession in this economy is character-

ized by a rise in the lending spread which, in turn, is linked one-for-one with the domestic

interest rate, ig . Since equation (20) implies that I g = I l for all t, one can use equation (28)

to express the demand for loans as

                                                         ~ (Itg ):
                                                    nt = n                                           (29)

   Lastly, by combining the ‡ow constraints for the consumer, the …rm, the bank, and the

government (equations (3), (12), (15) and (21)) and using equations (10), (11), and (16), we

get the economy’s ‡ow resource constraint:

                                     k_ t = rkt + xt            ct        (ht );                     (30)

where k = b + bf + f . Note that the RHS of equation (30) is simply the current account.

Integrating forward subject to the No-Ponzi game condition yields
                                     Z    1
                                                                           rt
                              k0 +            [xt     ct        (ht )]e         dt = 0:              (31)
                                      0



2.6    Exchange rate and interest rate policy

As in standard …rst-generation currency crisis models, we assume that at t = 0 the exchange

rate is …xed at the level E. In addition, it is assumed that there is a critical lower bound

for international reserves (say, ft = 0).              It is known by all agents at t = 0 that, if and

when that critical level of reserves is reached, the central bank will cease to intervene in the

foreign exchange market and will allow the exchange rate to ‡oat freely.                   As a matter of

                                                           14
terminology, we will refer to the switch from the …xed exchange rate to the ‡oating rate as

a “crisis”.

   The key feature of our model is that, in addition to …xing the exchange rate, the central

bank can also set the path for the interest rate on the domestic bond, ig (referred to as

the “domestic” interest rate). Importantly, setting ig implies that the central bank allows

the composition of its liabilities (non-interest bearing monetary base and interest bearing

domestic bonds) to be market determined. Alternatively, of course, the central bank could

set the composition of its liabilities and let ig be market determined. In what follows below,

we shall assume that ig is the central bank’s policy instrument while the composition of its

liabilities is determined endogenously. Moreover, we shall restrict attention to piecewise ‡at

paths for ig .

   As noted above, the ability of the central bank to independently set a path for the

domestic interest rate stems from our assumption that domestic bonds are held only by

domestic banks which, in turn, cannot hold any foreign bonds. Hence, di¤erences in returns

on these two assets cannot be arbitraged away through asset trade.            However, the non-
                                                                                                     i
negativity restriction on the deposit spread, I d > 0, still imposes the restriction that ig <   1
                                                                                                         .

Hence, the central bank cannot choose any arbitrarily-high level of the domestic interest

rate. It bears repeating, however, that there are alternative ways of introducing imperfect

asset substitutability which preserve the monetary authority’s ability to in‡uence domestic

interest rates. Thus, introducing a liquidity service from domestic bonds (as in Calvo and

Végh (1995) and Lahiri and Végh (2003)) or a costly banking technology for managing

domestic assets (as in Edwards and Végh (1997)) would also introduce an endogenous wedge

between the foreign and domestic interest rates. The e¤ectiveness of interest rate policy then

resides in the ability of the central bank to in‡uence the wedge by an appropriate choice of

policy. Of course, the interpretation of the wedge as well as the precise extent to which the


                                                15
policymaker can manipulate the domestic interest rate would depend on how imperfect asset

substitutability is introduced. In the case of liquid bonds, the wedge would be the liquidity

services o¤ered by the domestic bonds while in the case of a costly banking technology the

wedge would be interpreted as the marginal cost of managing domestic assets.

         Even in the context of the model presented here, it is possible to derive an interest

parity condition between the domestic interest rate (ig ) and the market interest rate (i).

This condition says that, in equilibrium, the domestic interest rate must equal the mar-

ket interest rate (adjusted by reserve requirements) minus a liquidity premium (given by

                 > 0). As expected, the liquidity premium is a decreasing function of the stock of
                                        00
demand deposits (recall that                 > 0).          In other words, what enables the government to

set a domestic interest rate that di¤ers from the (adjusted) market interest rate is that set-

ting the domestic interest rate e¤ectively amounts to setting the interest rate on demand

deposits (i.e., paying interest on money). Since demand deposits provide liquidity, the re-

turn required by households to hold them will be below the market interest rate. Hence, a

higher domestic rate will be associated with a lower liquidity premium (i.e., a higher level of
                                                                                                    0
demand deposits). If demand deposits o¤ered no liquidity services (i.e.,                                = 0), then the

domestic interest rate could not di¤er from the adjusted market interest rate. Importantly,

this would be true despite the non-tradability of the domestic asset.

         As will become clear below, a higher rate on domestic bonds paid by the central bank

will have three e¤ects. First, since government bonds and bank credit to …rms are perfect

substitutes in the banks’ portfolio, a higher interest rate on government bonds will lead

to a pari passu increase in the lending rate.                            This will curtail bank credit and, all else

                                                                16
equal, provoke an output contraction. This e¤ect will be referred to as the output e¤ect of

interest rate policy.15 Second, a higher interest rate on domestic bonds will increase the debt

servicing burden of the consolidated government which we shall refer to as the …scal e¤ect.16

Third, the higher interest rate on government bonds will induce banks to also pay a higher

rate on bank deposits (recall (19)). This higher rate on deposits reduces the opportunity

cost of holding bank deposits and thus increases demand for bank deposits. We will refer to

this as the money demand e¤ect.



3        Balance of payments crises

This section …rst characterizes the perfect foresight equilibrium path for this economy and

then studies the case in which there is no attempt on the part of the monetary authority

to engage in an active interest rate defense. We refer to this case as “passive interest rate

policy”. It provides the natural benchmark for analyzing the e¤ects of active interest rate

policy in later sections.


3.1        Solving the model

In what follows, we shall focus on stationary environments in which the policy-controlled

interest rate, ig , is piecewise constant before and after T (at levels given by ig0 and igT ,
  15
       As discussed below, it is important to note that the output e¤ect will also be associated with an indirect

…scal e¤ect as commercial banks substitute out of bank lending and into government bonds, which increases

the stock of government debt and hence debt service.
  16
     It should be noted that we could abstract from the …scal e¤ect (by assuming that lump-sum government

transfers are endogenous) and that our main results regarding the government’s ability to delay a crisis and

optimality of an active interest rate defense would still go through (as we show in a previous version of this

paper). The …scal e¤ect is needed to obtain the non-monotonicities derived below (for which both the output

and the …scal e¤ects must be present).


                                                        17
respectively) but may jump at that date. As is well known from Krugman (1979) and Flood

and Garber (1984), the combination of a …xed exchange rate and an initial …scal de…cit

makes a BOP crisis inevitable in this economy. To see this, note that a …xed exchange rate

implies that the nominal interest rate is constant and given by it = r. From (18) and (20), it

follows that i` and id will also be constant. Hence, I d (= i                  id ) will be constant and, in light

of (7), so will demand deposits, h. Further, since I ` is constant, by (25), (26), and (28), so

will wt , xt , and nt . From (17), it then follows that zt will be constant. Given (16) and the

constancy of ht , mt will also be constant. Finally, since xt is constant over time, …rst-order

condition (5) implies that ct will be constant as well.

   We now turn to the path of international reserves. Since mt and ht are constant over

time, equation (21) implies that under a …xed exchange rate (" = 0):

                                      f_t = rft   ig0 zt         < 0.                                           (33)

The assumption (which will be maintained throughout the paper) that                              > rf0 is a su¢ cient

condition for f_t < 0. In other words, international reserves at the central bank will be falling

over time. Furthermore –and as equation (33) makes clear –international reserves will be

falling at an increasing rate. Since the lower bound for international reserves will be reached

in …nite time, the …xed exchange rate regime is unsustainable. The central bank will thus

be forced to abandon the peg at some point in time T and let the exchange rate ‡oat. Fiscal

spending remains unchanged at .

   In order to derive the perfect foresight path for t                    T , notice that since reserves fall to

zero at t = T , f_t = ft = 0 for t    T , which enables us to rewrite equation (21) as

                            =m
                             _ t + z_t + "t mt + ("t          igt )zt ,            t   T:                       (34)

Taking into account (16), (17), and (19), this last equation becomes

                        = h_ t + "t    idt ht + (igT       "t ) n t       n_ t ,       t    T:                  (35)

                                                  18
Intuitively, notice that, for a given h –and as follows from the banks’balance sheet (17) –n

and z move in opposite direction. Hence, a ‡ow expansion of loans to …rms (n_ > 0) decreases

revenues as it implies a reduction in the ‡ow expansion of government bonds. Similarly, for

given h, a higher n implies a smaller stock of bonds which reduces the real debt service.

       Time-di¤erentiating equations (7) and (28), using (8) and (29), and substituting the

results into (35) yields an equilibrium di¤erential equation in " for t                                  T:

       To understand this stability condition, note that in the steady state equation (35) reduces

to

                                                    = Id       r h + (I g + r) n:                                               (37)

                             Id r                          I g +r
The expression 1              Id  h           h      1       Ig   n   n is the e¤ect of a change in " on net govern-

ment revenues.         If both elasticities are less than unity, then a rise in " increases in‡ation

tax revenues from deposits (…rst term) and, for given h, increases the real debt service (sec-

ond term) since an increase in " reduces I g .                          If this overall expression is positive, then

equation (36) is unstable around the steady state.                           Hence, to ensure a unique convergent
  17
       To simplify the derivation of some results below, we will assume that              h     is a strictly increasing function

of the opportunity cost of holding deposits I d . This property is satis…ed by, among others, Cagan money

demands, which provide the best …t for developing countries (see Easterly, Mauro, Schmidt-Hebbel (1995)).


                                                                  19

       It follows then that for t          T – and along any perfect foresight equilibrium path with

constant          and ig –"t = "T . A constant " and ig imply that i, I d and I g must all be constant

over time. As above, this implies, by (5), (16), (17), (25), (26), and (28), that c, x, h, n, m;

and z all remain constant as well. Lastly, the constancy of h implies that money demand

is constant over time. Since dn = h for all t                         T , this implies that d_nt = 0 and    t     = "T for

all t       T.

       Before proceeding further, it is useful to note that the term 1                         Id  h   h re‡ects the

well-known possibility of a La¤er curve relationship between revenues from money printing

and the opportunity cost of holding money. As is standard, and to ensure that the economy

is always operating on the “correct”side of the La¤er curve, we will assume throughout that

       In order to tie down the equilibrium post-collapse values of all the endogenous variables,

   To tie down the time of the crisis it is useful to note that the path for the nominal

before the run, the discrete change in central bank liabilities at the moment of the crisis T

is given by   mT        (hT        h0 ), which corresponds to the loss in international reserves since

3.2        Passive interest rate policy: The Krugman case

We have purposely set up our model so that it reduces to a standard Krugman model (with

an endogenous labor supply) for the case in which policymakers set the domestic interest

rate (ig ) equal to the market interest rate (i), which implies that I0g = ITg = 0. In this case,

the banking sector plays no role and the model delivers the standard results that would arise

in a model with no banks and a standard labor-leisure choice. We refer to this case as the

“passive interest rate policy”case since policymakers choose not to use their ability to engage

in an active interest rate defense (which would require setting the domestic interest rate, ig ,

above the market rate, i). Notice that I0g = ITg = 0 implies, by (20), that I0` = IT` = 0 so

that …rms do not face a premium for having to resort to bank credit.

  The following proposition summarizes the results for this Krugman case:
                                                        h                  i
                    g     g
Proposition 1 Let I0 = IT = 0 and assume that > r n       ~ (0) (1    ~
                                                                     )h( r) : Then, at

the time of the crisis (T ), the deposit spread I d rises, but consumption and output remain

unchanged.

Proof. From (20), it follows that I0` = IT` = 0. Hence, from equations (26) and (28), neither

n nor x change at T . The fact that I d must rise at T follows directly from equation (43) and
                            h                     i
the assumption that > r n     ~ (0) (1     ~ r) . This assumption, when combined with
                                          )h(
  19
       Note that at time T real net domestic credit dn remains unchanged since both Dn and E are predeter-

mined. Hence, any change in the money base m(= h) is accompanied by an exactly o¤setting change in

reserves (f ).


                                                     22
equation (37), implies that ~"(0; ) > 0. Since I d rises, equation (8) implies that h falls at T .

To see that consumption must remain unchanged at T , note that equation (5) implies that
                 1=                  1=
(c0       x0 )        = (cT   xT )        (recall that, along a perfect foresight path, the multiplier

remains unchanged). Hence, c0               cT = (x0         xT ). Since x0 = xT , it follows immediately

that c0 = cT .

       Proposition 1 shows that at the time of the crisis there is a run out of deposits (and,

hence, out of the monetary base, as banks hold cash reserves against deposits). The rise in

the deposit spread, I d , at the time of the crisis reduces the demand for deposits. The fall in

deposits reduces the loanable funds available to the banks. Since the lending spread, I ` , is

unchanged, the demand for loans by …rms remains unchanged as well. Given that domestic

bonds and loans to …rms are perfect substitutes in the commercial banks’asset portfolio, the

banks adjust to the lower supply of loanable funds by reducing their holdings of domestic

bonds while keeping private lending unchanged. Naturally, these are the same results that

would obtain if there were no banking system in the model and households directly held the

monetary base.20



4        Active interest rate defense

We now turn to the central focus of the paper; namely, the e¤ects of an active interest rate

defense of the peg. By “active”, we mean deviating from a passive interest rate policy by

setting the domestic interest rate (ig ) above the market interest rate (i), which implies setting
  20
       Notice that the result that output and consumption remain unchanged at T follows from our assumption

that the transactions technology is independent of consumption. If this were not the case, it is easy to show

that the rise in I d at T would lead to lower consumption and lower output. By abstracting from this e¤ect

(which we do not need for our results to go through), we ensure that all output e¤ects studied below are the

result of an active interest rate defense of the peg.

a positive I g . (Recall that a passive interest rate policy corresponds to setting Itg = 0:) We

allow the monetary authority to set a piece-wise ‡at path for igt (i.e., it can set both ig0 and

igT , but not necessarily at the same level). Denoting a passive domestic interest rate by ig (p),

we de…ne the passive interest rate policy path as

       We consider two types of interest rate defense policies. The …rst policy –referred to as

a contemporaneous interest rate defense –entails raising igT above the passive level of igT (p)

(for a given ig0 ). Note that this amounts to setting a positive ITg . In this case, the domestic

interest rate is raised at the time of the crisis (although the policy is announced at time 0).

The second policy – referred to as a preemptive interest rate defense – involves raising ig0

above ig0 (p) (for a given igT ). In this case, the domestic interest rate is raised before the crisis

takes place.21


4.1        Contemporaneous interest rate defense

We start by investigating the e¤ects of raising igT above the passive level igT (p). The following

proposition summarizes the two key e¤ects:

Proposition 2 The time of the crisis (T ) is a non-monotonic function of the post-collapse

domestic interest rate igT . In particular, for small increases in igT above igT (p) the crisis is

delayed relative to the Krugman case.            However, further interest rate increases beyond a

threshold level ^{gT bring the crisis forward. Furthermore, the higher is igT , the lower is the

post-collapse level of output.

  21
       Note that equations (40) and (42) imply that   @ig
                                                            > 0 and   @ig
                                                                             = 1 > 0. Hence, raising igt above igt (p)
                                                        T               0

implies setting Itg > 0.



                                                       24
Proof. From (20), we know that I ` = I g . Hence, from (26), (28) and (40), it follows that

both xT (and thus output) and nT are decreasing functions of igT . This establishes the last

part of the proposition. To prove the non-monotonicity of T in igT , di¤erentiate equation

for all I g > ( (1       r)       1) =          I^g . Now de…ne ^{g such that I^g = I~g (^{g ; ). The proof of

the non-monotonicity of T in igT then follows directly from the fact that @ I~g =@igT > 0.

      We have thus shown that by merely announcing at time 0 that domestic interest rates will

be raised by more than any increase in the market interest rate, the monetary authority can

potentially delay the crisis relative to the Krugman case (i.e., passive interest rate policy).

In practice, this ability to postpone the crisis may make all the di¤erence since it gives time

to the …scal authority to put its house in order and therefore prevent the crisis altogether.

But this works only up to a point. Beyond a threshold level of the domestic interest rate,

any further interest rate hike only succeeds in bringing the crisis forward instead of delaying

it.

      To understand the non-monotonicity of T note that

                                         @T                                         @hT
                                              =                                          ;
                                         @igT            +   ig0 z0    rST          @igT

where we have used the fact that m = h. Hence, any increase in the post-collapse demand

for money (or hT ) will, ceteris paribus, postpone the crisis while any decrease in hT has

the opposite e¤ect.       Intuitively, for a given path of reserves pre-collapse, an increase in

                                                               25
the post-collapse money demand reduces the size of the attack and, thereby, postpones the

time of the attack.    The opposite occurs in the event of a decrease in hT .           Recall that

the opportunity cost of demand deposits is I d        r+"      id . A rise in ig , in and of itself,

increases the deposit rate, id –recall that id = (1      )ig –and therefore tends to reduce I d

and increase the demand for hT (the money demand e¤ect).             A rising ig , however, tends

to increase the post-collapse in‡ation rate (and hence I d ) for two reasons. First – and as

discussed earlier –there is a direct …scal e¤ect since the rise in ig increases the debt service.

Second, there is an indirect …scal e¤ect (associated with the output e¤ect) as a rising ig also

raises I g , which in turn induces a fall in bank credit to …rms, n. This e¤ect tends to reduce

…scal revenues because the counterpart of a falling n is an increase in z (i.e., an increase in

liabilities of the central bank held by commercial banks), which increases the government’s

debt service. In order to …nance this fall in revenues, the post-collapse in‡ation rate (i.e.,

the rate of depreciation) must increase.      These two e¤ects tend to increase I d .       For all

ig > ^{g , these two e¤ects dominate and further increases in ig actually raise I d .

   The negative output e¤ect of a higher igT results from the higher lending spread induced

by a higher domestic interest rate.     The higher lending spread increases the e¤ective real

wage, which lowers demand for labor (and hence output) and leads to a lower demand for

bank credit. This induces banks to substitute out of loans and into bonds.


4.2    Preemptive interest rate defense

We now turn to the e¤ects of a preemptive interest rate defense whereby the pre-crisis

interest rate is set at a high level (relative to the passive case). Speci…cally, we investigate

the potential trade-o¤s of setting ig0 > ig0 (p). Note that this corresponds to a temporary

increase in interest rates at date t = 0 which is expected to last till date T . Interest rates

are expected to revert back to the passive level igT (p) at time t    T . Hence, we continue to

                                                26
maintain ITg (p) = 0. The following proposition summarizes the main results:

Proposition 3 The time of the crisis is potentially a non-monotonic function of the pre-

collapse interest rate ig0 .             Thus, for all ig0                ^{g the time of the crisis is unambiguously

decreasing in ig0 . However, for small increases in ig0 above ig0 (p), the crisis may be postponed.

The pre-crisis demand for real demand deposits is monotonically increasing while the pre-

crisis output is monotonically decreasing in ig0 .

Proof. From (20), we know that I0` = I0g = ig0                            r. Hence, from (26), it follows that x0 (and

thus output) is decreasing in ig0 . From (43), it is easy to see that I0d is lower than in the

Krugman case (since I0g is higher), and therefore real demand for deposits is higher. This

establishes the last part of the proposition.

       Using the commercial bank balance sheet relation z = (1                                  )h       n, we can di¤erentiate

equation (44) with respect to ig0 to get

before the attack by T , note that ST                              f0 = fT          f0 < 0 since reserves are secularly
                                                      @h0                                                                  @T
declining over time.22 Moreover,                      @I0d
                                                             < 0. Hence,           0 is a su¢ cient condition for          @ig0
                                                                                                                                  < 0,

i.e., for the crisis to be brought forward in time due to an increase in ig0 .                                    Recalling that

1T      I g +r

               n (I )   as I g S I^g      ( (1               r)   1) = , it follows that         > 0 for all ig0     ^{g     I^g + r
                    I0d r     d                                                      @T
since 1 > 0 >         I0d h (I0 ).     For       < 0 however, the sign of            @ig0
                                                                                            is ambiguous. Figure 3 provides

a numerical example to show the existence of the case in which there is a range of ig0 in which
@T
@ig0
       > 0 for small ig0 but      @T
                                  @ig0
                                         < 0 for all ig0 beyond a threshold point.23
  22
       Since international reserves go to zero at T , the size of the run at T is ST = fT .
  23
       The key parameter values for the numerical example in Figure 3 are as follows: igT = 0:25,                          = 0:009,

r = 0:1, and      = 0:99. The vertical axis meaures percentage deviations from the passive interest rate case.



                                                                    27
     As before, the negative output e¤ects of a higher ig0 is due to the higher lending spread

induced by higher domestic interest rates. At the same time, since the opportunity cost of

holding demand deposits falls as ig0 increases, demand for real demand deposits goes up.

     To understand the e¤ect of ig0 on the time of the attack, note that from equation (44)

the initial domestic interest rate a¤ects T through two channels. First, it a¤ects T through

the e¤ect on the size of the attack ST = m0             mT . Since m0 = h0 is monotonically rising

in ig0 , the size of the attack is increasing in ig0 . Given a path for reserves, a bigger attack at

T implies that the attack must happen sooner since the cuto¤ level for reserves at which the

run wipes out remaining reserves is reached sooner. This negative e¤ect on T is captured

by the term (1          ) @h 0
                          @I d
                               .
                            0

     However, there is a second e¤ect of ig0 on T which comes through the e¤ect on ig0 z0 . It
                           @ig0 z0
is easy to check that       @ig0
                                         . Note that during the …xed exchange rate period, the …scal

de…cit is …nanced through the loss of international reserves. Since the initial …scal de…cit

is   + ig0 z0   rf0 ,    > 0 implies that the initial de…cit rises with ig0 which, in turn, implies

that reserves decline at a faster rate. Hence, for a given ST the cuto¤ level of reserves is

reached faster and the crisis happens earlier. Thus, when                > 0 both e¤ects tend to bring
                             @T
the crisis forward and       @ig0
                                     is unambiguously negative. For     < 0 however, the initial de…cit

declines as ig0 rises. Hence, reserves decline at a slower rate which implies that, for a given

ST , the attack must happen later. In this case the …scal e¤ect and the size of the run e¤ect

go in opposite directions. Whether the crisis is postponed or brought forward through an

increase in ig0 depends on the net e¤ect. Figure 3 shows the existence of cases where the

…scal e¤ect can dominate and the attack can be postponed for small increases in ig0 .
(As should be obvious, this is just a numerical example and there is no attempt at replicating any particular

economy.)

5      Optimal interest rate defense

The previous analysis makes clear that while raising interest rates can successfully delay a

crisis (up to a point), this bene…cial e¤ect comes at the cost of a fall in output. The obvious

question then arises: given the preexisting distortion of an initial budget de…cit which is

inconsistent with a …xed exchange rate, what is the optimal interest rate defense of the peg?

     To answer this question, notice that since the paths of consumption and labor may change

only at T , household’s welfare, given by equation (1), can be expressed as

                     1
     W =                            [(c0     x0 )1   1=

                                                                                 + [(cT            xT )1   1=
                                                                                                                   1]e       rT
                                                                                                                                   :   (47)
            r (1         1= )

Given that the multiplier                  is constant along any perfect foresight path, …rst-order condition

(5) implies that c0                 x 0 = cT         xT .   Combining this with (31), equation (47) can be

rewritten as:



                 1             n                                                                                            1 1=
                                                                                                                                        o
                                                                       rT                                          rT
 W =                               [x0      x0       (h0 )] 1   e           + [xT         xT             (hT )]e                       1 :
         r (1        1= )
                                                                                                                                       (48)

     Since all endogenous variables in (48) are functions of ig0 and igT , welfare is maximized by

the solution to the following problem:


                                                                       rT                                          rT
                 Max L = [x0                x0       (h0 )] 1      e         + [xT        xT             (hT )]e        ;              (49)

where x0 = x~(I0g ); xT = x~(ITg ); T = T~(ig0 ; igT ); h0 = h(I         ~ d ); I d = r                                           (1    )I0g ;
                                                                0           T    0

and ITd = iT              (1        )ITg ; as follows from (8), (26), (43), and (44). The non-negativity

restrictions on I0d and ITd require imposing the constraint ig0                                1
                                                                                                   r
                                                                                                        and the restriction that

    > I^d         ~ I^d ) + (I^g + r)~
                r h(                 n(I^g ) where I^d = I~d (I^g ; ) which implies that ITd = 0 is not
                                                                                          @ I~d
feasible in this economy.                  Recall that from equation (38)                 @ITg
                                                                                                       S 0 as igT S ^{g and that

                                                                29
I^g = I~g (^{g ; )     ( (1        r)       1) = .    Hence, this last condition implies that level of …scal

transfers are so high that the lowest possible value for ITd is positive.

       Di¤erentiating (49) with respect to ig0 and igT gives:

where             x0   x0         (h0 )       [xT      xT       (hT )] and where we have used the …rst-order

conditions for money demand and labor.

       To focus on the intuition, consider for a moment interior solutions (i.e., think of (50) and

(51) as holding with equality). At an optimum, the government equates the marginal costs

and bene…ts of a higher ig0 and igT . What are the marginal costs and bene…ts of increasing

ig0 (i.e., preemptive interest rate defense)? The two terms on the RHS of (50) capture the

marginal cost and marginal bene…t of raising ig0 . Consider the …rst term within the square

brackets. A higher ig0 leads to a higher lending spread (a higher I0` ). This, in turn, increases

the e¤ective real wage and thus reduces labor. Lower labor implies less output (a negative

e¤ect) but less disutility from labor (a positive e¤ect).                     The second (non-negative) term

in the square brackets in (50) captures one bene…t of raising ig0 .                       A higher ig0 reduces the

opportunity cost of holding demand deposits (I0d ), thus increasing real demand for deposits

and reducing transactions costs.                    The last term on the RHS re‡ects a second potential
                                                                                                         @ T~(ig0 ;igT )

then the good times are prolonged which is welfare improving. The trade-o¤s induced by a

contemporaneous interest rate defense as captured by equation (51) are exactly analogous.24
  24
       Notice that the bene…t from delaying a crisis that is derived through an extension of the good times


                                                               30

the key features of the optimal interest rate policy.

ing, i.e.,           t   =         and an initial …scal de…cit, i.e.,                                     rf0 > 0. Given such a path and the

announced exchange rate policy, it is always optimal, starting from the passive interest rate
                                                                                                            @ T~(ig0 ;igT )

necessary) for ig0 > ig0 (p).

Proof. First note that ig0 = ig0 (p) and igT = igT (p) correspond to setting I0g = ITg = 0. It is

easy to see that evaluating equation (51) around ITg = 0 gives                                                           @L

        Proposition 4 says that the optimal pre and post-crisis domestic interest rates are higher

than the passive interest rate policy implied by the Krugman case. Hence, it is optimal to

engage in some active interest rate defense. Furthermore, at an optimum for the contem-

poraneous interest rate policy, it is feasible to delay the crisis further but not optimal to do

so.25
applies only if                > 0. Otherwise, it re‡ects a welfare cost. The sign of                                           is, in general, ambiguous and

depends on parameters and the optimal policy.
  25
     It should be noted that in these Krugman-type …rst-generation currency crisis models where BOP crises

occur due to an unsustainable …scal stance, the globally optimal policy is to let the exchange rate collapse

at time 0 itself, i.e., go to a ‡exible exchange rate right away. This is true in our model as well. Hence, in

Proposition 4 we describe the “constrained”optimal interest rate policy which is contingent on the announced

exchange rate policy and …scal path. In a related paper, Rebelo and Végh (2002) provide a rationale for

delaying the collapse of an exchange rate peg in these …rst-generation models by introducing various costs



                                                                                            31
   Intuitively, around the point ITg = 0, there is a …rst-order welfare gain in terms of reducing

transaction costs and postponing the crisis but no …rst-order output loss.       The trade-o¤s

involved for the optimal preemptive interest rate defense are similar.         The presence of

the su¢ ciency condition for the preemptive case but not for the contemporaneous case

simply re‡ects the fact that under our parameter assumptions the time of the crisis is always

increasing in igT around the passive interest rate policy igT = igT (p). However, the absence of

a corresponding parameter restriction for the preemptive interest rate policy implies that it

is feasible for T to be decreasing in ig0 around ig0 (p) –the passive interest rate point. Since

 jig =ig (p) > 0, a falling T implies that a preemptive interest rate defense shortens the good
   0   0


times and therefore reduces welfare. We should, however, stress that this condition is only

su¢ cient and not necessary for the optimality of engaging in some preemptive interest rate

defense.

   The last part of the proposition also shows that the contemporaneous interest rate policy

that maximizes the delay of the balance of payments crisis is not optimal. In particular,

the proposition shows that at the point of maximum delay, the policymaker would do better

by reducing igT a little and thereby allowing the crisis to happen sooner. Intuitively, at the

point of maximum delay, a marginal reduction in igT has only second order e¤ects on the

post-collapse demand for deposits (and hence transactions costs and the time of the attack).

On the other hand, the reduction in the interest rate reduces the domestic lending spread

which has …rst-order e¤ects on loans and output. Hence, it is not optimal to raise igT all the

way to ^{g , which is the point where the delay is maximized.

6     Conclusions

The increasing frequency of BOP crises in disparate parts of the world raises the issue of

what is the appropriate policy response to such episodes. In this paper we have looked at

an often-used tool to …ght o¤ speculative attacks – higher interest rates.   Higher interest

rates typically work by increasing the demand for domestic currency assets – the money

demand e¤ect. They carry, however, some adverse side-e¤ects. In particular, policymakers

are often concerned about the output consequences of an aggressive interest rate defense of

an exchange rate peg.

    In this paper we have studied a model in which, by increasing the demand for interest-

bearing deposits, higher interest rates have a positive money demand e¤ect, but also extract

an output cost by making bank credit more expensive.       We have shown that the time of

the crisis may be a non-monotonic function of interest rates, which implies that there is

some rise in interest rates (both before and at the time of crisis) that maximizes the delay.

Furthermore, an optimal interest rate defense involves announcing high interest rates both

before and at the time of the crisis. Hence, it is always optimal to engage in some active

interest rate defense, contrary to the implicit assumption in most of the literature based on

Krugman (1979). In conjunction with our previous work (Lahiri and Végh (2003)), where

we abstracted from output costs and focused solely on …scal costs, the results of this paper

suggest cause for extreme caution and restraint in the use of higher interest rates as an

instrument for defending exchange rate pegs.

    As is true with any model, ours simpli…es a much more complex reality, in which other

mechanisms surely come into play. But it is precisely the complex nature of the real world

which, in our view, makes it even more valuable to go back to basics and develop simple

models that will hopefully capture some essential trade-o¤s and provide some guidance to



                                             33
our thinking.     As we view the world, there are three key aspects of reality which are not

directly captured in our model. First, policymakers use higher interest rates mainly to buy

time to put the …scal house in order.       This feature could be captured by assuming that

the …scal fundamentals follow some stochastic process whereby, at each point time, there is

some exogenous probability that the …scal situation will be resolved. This would increase

the bene…ts of postponing the crisis without altering the essential mechanisms.        Second,

currency crises can lead to a banking crisis, which in turn can worsen the output contrac-

tion.     This feature could be incorporated along the lines of Burnside, Eichenbaum, and

Rebelo (2001b). Finally, we should mention that our framework abstracts from “signalling”

considerations (i.e., higher interest rates may convey information about policymakers’ability

and/or commitment to defend a peg), which are the focus of Drazen (2003). Since address-

ing these signalling considerations naturally requires a di¤erent theoretical framework, we

view Drazen’s analysis as complementing ours.
