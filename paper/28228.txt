                                           ABSTRACT

The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of environmental and
economic consequences including important effects on the pace and intensity of global climate
change. Based on several decades of satellite data, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea
ice extent during the rest of this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall
sea ice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average projections from the
CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of Arctic sea ice loss even in scenarios
with high carbon emissions. Our long-range statistical projections also deliver probability
assessments of the timing of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance
of an effectively ice-free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s--much earlier than the
average projection from the global climate models.

1     Introduction
The Arctic is warming at least twice as fast as the global average (Osborne et al., 2018).
This phenomenon of Arctic amplification in surface air temperature is closely connected
to a dramatic multi-decade reduction in Northern sea ice. Indeed, since accurate satellite
measurements began in 1978, the extent of Arctic summer sea ice has shrunk by about 40
percent, a loss in area comparable to the western continental United States. This drop in sea
ice is one of the most conspicuous warning signs of ongoing climate change, but the reduction
of sea ice will also play an important role in determining the pace of future global climate
change and has wide-ranging implications for the polar region and the rest of the world.
    At a regional level, diminishing sea ice alters polar ecosystems and habitats and intro-
duces major economic opportunities and risks. For example, new deposits of natural gas,
petroleum, and other natural resources will become accessible for extraction, emission, and
possible spillage (Petrick et al., 2017). Also, reduced ice coverage facilitates tourism and
the use of Arctic shipping lanes, which are shorter than traditional passages via the Suez or
Panama Canals. These new routes reduce sailing times but increase Arctic environmental
risks from, for example, discharges, spills, and soot deposits (Bekkers et al., 2016). Finally,
melting sea ice will have geopolitical consequences for Arctic sea-lane control (Ebinger and
Zambetakis, 2009).
    Although these proximal Arctic effects are important, the far-reaching implications of
diminished Arctic sea ice for regulating global climate and weather are even more conse-
quential. Less sea ice and more open water diminishes the reflectivity (or albedo) of the
Arctic region, so that, over time, a greater share of solar heat is absorbed by the earth,
which leads to further Arctic amplification and increased temperatures worldwide (Hudson,
2011). These higher Arctic temperatures promote thawing and erosion of the polar per-
mafrost, which can result in the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane
and provide a significant impetus to further global warming (Tanski et al., 2019). Increasing
Arctic temperatures also hasten the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, further pushing up
sea levels (Trusel et al., 2018). Finally, a warming Arctic and loss of sea ice cover can alter
the global dynamics of ocean and air streams, and this effect already appears to be chang-
ing weather patterns at sub-polar latitudes (Petoukhov and Semenov, 2010) and weakening
thermohaline ocean circulation including the current that warms Europe (Liu and Fedorov,
2019).
    In brief, the loss of Arctic sea ice is not only a stark signal of a changing climate, but it
also plays an integral role in the timing and intensity of further global climate change. Not

                                               2
surprisingly then, the downward trend in Arctic sea ice has been the subject of hundreds
of research studies. The forecasting literature alone is voluminous and impressive in both
methodology and substance.1 Although the importance of accurate polar prediction is hard
to overstate, substantial uncertainty still remains about the future evolution of sea ice.
Indeed, obtaining a deeper understanding of Arctic sea ice loss has been called a "grand
challenge of climate science" (Kattsov et al., 2010).
    Much forward-looking sea ice analysis has been based on large-scale climate models,
which represent of the fundamental physical, chemical, and biological drivers of the earth's
climate. These models attempt to capture the dynamics of the oceans, atmosphere, and
cryosphere at a high frequency and a granular level of geographic and spatial detail. Such
structural physical models are invaluable for understanding climate variation, determining
event and trend attribution, and assessing alternative scenarios. However, from a forecasting
perspective, climate models have generally underestimated the amount of lost sea ice in recent
decades (Stroeve et al., 2007; Stroeve et al., 2012b; Jahn et al., 2016; and Rosenblum and
Eisenman, 2017). In addition, long-range sea ice projections can differ widely across climate
models (Stroeve and Notz, 2015).
    Given the global significance of Arctic conditions and the progress yet to be made on
specifying structural global climate models, purely statistical projections of sea ice are an
obvious complementary approach. As a practical matter ­ across many disciplines ­ parsi-
monious statistical representations often produce forecasts that are at least as accurate as
detailed structural models. Specifically for forecasting Arctic sea ice, there is already some
evidence that small-scale statistical models with no explicitly embedded physical science can
have some success (Guemas et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). Therefore, we provide a statis-
tical analysis of the long-run future evolution of Arctic sea ice. Our work is distinguished by
its use of intrinsically stochastic "unobserved components" models, with detailed attention
to trend, seasonality, and serial correlation. Based on several decades of satellite data, we
provide statistical forecasts of the future loss of Arctic sea ice.2 Importantly, these forecasts
provide probability assessments for a range of long-run outcomes and quantify both model
parameter uncertainty and intrinsic uncertainty. Of particular interest are probability as-
sessments of the timing of an ice-free Arctic, an outcome with vital economic and climate

     Our analysis does not examine prediction skill in real-time repeated forecasting, as in Ionita et al. (2019),
but considers very long-range projections at a point in time, as in Guemas et al. (2016) .

consequences (Massonnet et al., 2012; Snape and Forster, 2014; and Jahn et al., 2016). For
this analysis, we also introduce a novel statistical modeling mechanism ­ a shadow ice in-
terpretation ­ that allows us to readily account for the zero lower bound on the extent of
Arctic sea ice in our model.
    Our resulting distributional forecasts suggest an ice-free Arctic summer is more likely
than not within two decades ­ much sooner than the projections from many large-scale
climate models. In particular, we contrast our statistical forecasts with projections from
the ensemble of model simulations conducted for the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project (CMIP5) ­ a highly-regarded central source for international global climate model
projections. On average, these climate models envisage ice-free Arctic conditions close to the
end of the century (assuming a range of business-as-usual carbon emissions paths). Thus,
besides their relevance for environmental and economic planning, our probability assessments
may also provide a useful benchmark for assessing or calibrating global climate models going
forward.
    We proceed as follows. In section 2, we introduce a linear statistical trend model and use
it to produce long-range sea ice point forecasts. In section 3, we introduce the "shadow ice"
concept to account for the zero-ice lower bound. In section 4, we generalize to a nonlinear
(quadratic) statistical model and to interval forecasts that incorporate several forms of un-
certainty. In section 5, we compare our statistical model forecasts to global climate model
forecasts with particular attention to hard versus soft landings at zero ice. In section 6, we
make probabilistic assessments of several sea ice scenarios. We conclude in section 7.


2     A Linear Statistical Model and Point Forecasts
Arctic sea ice has been continuously monitored since 1978 using satellite-based passive mi-
crowave sensing, which is unaffected by cloud cover or a lack of sunlight. For a polar region
divided into a grid of individual cells, the satellite data provide cell-by-cell brightness read-
ings, which can be converted into fractional ice surface coverage estimates for each cell. Sea
ice extent, SIE ­ a very commonly-used measure of total ice area ­ is the total area of all
cells with at least 15 percent ice surface coverage. That is, SIE rounds down cells with mea-
sured coverage of less than 15 percent to zero and rounds up cells that pass the 15 percent
threshold to full coverage. The up-rounding in SIE is effectively a useful bias correction,
as melting pools on summer ice surfaces can be mistaken for ice-free open water. For this
reason, we follow common practice and use monthly average SIE data from November 1978

through October 2019 from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).3 The NSIDC
data use the NASA team algorithm to convert the satellite microwave brightness readings
into measured ice coverage (Fetterer et al., 2017).4 , 5
    Figure 1 plots the time series of Arctic SIE ­ each monthly average observation is a
dot ­ with an overall estimated linear trend superimposed. The clear downward trend is
accompanied by obvious seasonality. A more subtle feature is the possible time variation in
the seasonal effects, which may be trending at different rates and possibly nonlinearly. These
effects turn out to be of interest in a complete statistical representation of sea-ice dynamics.
    A simple initial representation to capture this variation is a linear statistical model with
    3
      Another measure of Arctic ice is sea ice area (SIA), which adds together the measured fractions of
ice-covered areas of all cells that pass the 15 percent threshold. For brevity, we report results only for SIE ,
but results for SIA are qualitatively identical.

      We interpolate the missing December 1987 and January 1988 observations with fitted values from a
regression on trend and monthly dummies estimated using the full data sample.

where the Di 's are monthly dummy variables (Dit =1 in month i and 0 otherwise, i=1, ..., 12)
and T IM E is a time dummy (T IM Et =t).6 , 7 We estimate model (1) ­ and other versions
below ­ by maximizing the Gaussian likelihood. Detailed regression results for model (1)
are in column (6) of Table A1 in Appendix A.
   6
    Earlier work in this tradition includes Peng et al. (2018).
   7
    Note that although we allow for seasonal and trending intercepts, we assume a constant disturbance
variance across months and time. There are so many interesting directions that we have reserved volatility
modeling for future work. For example, high-frequency (daily) SIE data are available, from which one could
accurately estimate, and then model, lower-frequency (monthly) realized SIE volatility.


                                                      6
    Figure 2 shows the resulting linear trends for all twelve months, highlighting March in blue
and September in red. All of the monthly trends slope downward ­ an indication of a warming
climate ­ and are highly significant. The slopes of the linear trends also differ across months
(Serreze and Meier, 2019; Cavalieri and Parkinson, 2012). In particular, the seasonally low-
ice months of July through October have notably steeper downward sloping trends than
the seasonally high-ice months of December through May. The estimated September trend,
for example, is twice as steep as the March trend, and the difference is highly statistically
significant. These linear trends are also extrapolated out of sample (shaded gray) through
the end of the century. For example, September sea ice extent is projected to reach zero just
after 2072.
    Such linear point forecasts are a useful first step, but they can be improved by allowing for
nonlinearity in the trends and by quantifying forecast uncertainty ­ as described in section
4. First, however, we elucidate a "shadow ice" modeling approach that takes into account
the fact that the measured amount of sea ice is bounded below by zero.


3       A Shadow Ice Interpretation
One consideration for downward trending statistical models for Arctic sea ice is that the
measured amount of sea ice will always be non-negative. By contrast, extrapolations of
simple trend models will eventually push into negative territory. There are various functional
forms that can be used to model such bounded time series, and the appropriate representation
depends very much on the details of the real-world phenomenon under examination.8 Some
bounds act like reflecting barriers, so the variable of interest spends very little time at the
constraint. Other bounds are absorbing states, and once reached, they may be sustained for
some time.
    With positive amounts of sea ice, fluctuations in SIE can serve as a rough approximation
for changes in the amount of thermal energy in the Arctic; that is, hotter and colder ocean
surface temperatures are reflected in less or more ice, respectively.9 However, this connection
    8
     One modeling approach is to rescale the bounded time series data to the real line using, say, a log-ratio
transformation (Wallis, 1987). Alternatively, a time series can be modeled in the original bounded sample
space using, for example, the beta autoregressive model of Rocha and Cribari-Neto (2008). By contrast,
some physical science analyses simply terminate model simulations when zero ice conditions are reached, as
in Obryk et al. (2019).
   9
     The amount of sea ice depends on a variety of factors including ocean and air temperature, ocean salinity,
cloud cover, and wind, current, and wave action. However, several studies have identified ocean heat content
as a major driver of sea ice coverage, notably, Arthun et al. (2012), Schlichtholz (2011), and Selyuzhenok
et al. (2020).


                                                      7
breaks down when the ice disappears: While SIE is fixed at zero, the surface temperature
of the Arctic ocean can continue to warm. Furthermore, the warmer the ocean becomes, the
less likely there will be a quick return of sea ice, which is indicative of a partially-absorbing
state.10
     To account for this effect, the negative values of sea ice produced by a statistical model
can be viewed as a rough expression of ocean temperature. Thus, we redefine the left-hand
side variable of the unconstrained model as a shadow surface ice extent, SIE  . We view
SIE  as a notional variable that equals measured surface ice when positive, but that may also
go negative to represent further increases in ocean thermal energy more broadly. Formally,
to translate negative model-based sea ice values into nonnegative sea ice observations, our
shadow ice model modifies the unconstrained model (1) to respect the zero lower bound for
ice:

                                        12              12
                             SIEt   =         i Dit +          j Djt ·T IM Et + t                       (2)
                                        i=1             j =1

                                               t = t-1 + vt

                                               vt  iid(0,  2 )

                                        SIEt = max(SIEt , 0).

That is, we now interpret our earlier unconstrained linear model of surface ice as a model of
shadow ice, SIE  , so that the observed extent of sea ice, SIE, is the maximum of SIE  and
zero.11
    The shadow ice model respects the nonlinearity of observed ice at the zero lower bound
but retains tractability. It also allows us to translate the long-range forecasts from downward
trending models like model (1) ­ including distributional projections ­ into observed data
that are always non-negative. As a matter of physical interpretation, very negative values of
shadow ice extent, SIE  , represent environments in which the thermal content of the Arctic
ocean is high enough that an immediate return to a positive SIE is unlikely. This shadow
ice structure provides an intuitive and simple approximation of the thermodynamics of the
Arctic ocean transition between sea ice and open water and serves as a useful modeling tool
  10
     See Stroeve and Notz (2018) for a description of the phenomenon by which the ocean must release heat
back into the atmosphere before sea ice can form again in winter.
  11
     A similar framework has been successfully applied in finance to model nominal interest rates near their
zero lower bound (Christensen and Rudebusch, 2014; Bauer and Rudebusch, 2016).

for observed SIE dynamics.12


4      A Quadratic Statistical Model and Interval Forecasts
A downward linear trend is a common representation of the secular decline in Arctic sea ice,
but linearity is not assured by the physical science. There are a variety of climate feedback
mechanisms that could hasten or retard the pace of sea ice loss. The well-known ice albedo
effect occurs as sea ice cover is reduced, and the resulting darker ocean surface absorbs more
energy, which in turn further reduces sea ice (Stroeve et al., 2012b). This feedback effect
amplifies sea ice seasonality and may progressively steepen the downward trend in SIE over
time (Schroeder et al., 2014). The geography of the perimeter of the Arctic Ocean, which is
partially constrained by land that blocks expanding winter ice, becomes less relevant as sea
ice shrinks, and relaxing this constraint may allow greater seasonal variation and a steeper
downward sea ice trend (Serreze and Meier, 2019).13 However, there are offsetting negative
feedback mechanisms ­ associated, for example, with increased cloud cover ­ that could
slow the rate of sea ice loss over time (Portner et al., 2019). Indeed, Stroeve and Notz
(2015) argue against trend amplification in favor of trend constancy (linearity) or trend
attenuation. Moreover, as described in the next section, long-range SIE projections from
large-scale global climate models appear dominated by feedback mechanisms that slow the
rate of September sea ice loss over time.14
    The lack of a complete understanding of the drivers of Arctic sea ice recommends con-
sideration of a flexible empirical SIE specification, so we generalize from linear to quadratic
trends:
                            12              12                        12
                 SIEt =           i Dit +          j Djt ·T IM Et +         k Dkt ·T IM Et2 + t             (3)
                            i=1             j =1                      k=1

                                                   t = t-1 + vt
  12
      Wang et al. (2016) take a different approach by simply constraining the model by the lower bound (for
sea ice concentration in their case), so negative predicted values are set to zero. In a dynamic model with
lagged sea ice, this procedure will result in a representation of a physical bound that is much closer to a
reflecting barrier.
   13
      Currently, the southern limit of winter ice is bounded by land except in the Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk,
East Greenland Sea, Barents Sea, and Baffin Bay.
   14
      More extreme forms of nonlinearity ­ such as discontinuous breaks, tipping points, and thresholds ­ are
possible but viewed as less likely (Stroeve and Notz, 2015). Goldstein et al. (2018) argue that Arctic sea ice
is best modeled by step-like shifting means at fitted breakpoints. However, modified statistical information
criteria that properly account for the implicit flexibility of such breakpoints ­ following Hall et al. (2013) ­
do not favor such a shifting mean models relative to a linear trend.

Notes: The curves are the twelve in-sample fitted trends and out-of-sample forecasts for Arctic SIE in each
month from the general quadratic model (3). The months with maximal and minimal sea ice extent are

We label model (3) as the "general" quadratic model as no constraints are imposed on
the twelve quadratic (k ) parameters. The linear model (2) of course emerges under the
constraint 1 =...=12 =0.
   Figure 3 shows the SIE estimation fits and forecasts from the general quadratic model,
by month, with March and September again highlighted in blue and red, respectively. The
trend curvatures for all months are strikingly similar: the trends for all months decrease at an
increasing rate. That is, the estimated k coefficients are negative for every month, indicating
that SIE is diminishing at an increasing rate. (Detailed estimation results of model (3)
appear in column (1) of Table A1 in Appendix A.) The size of the estimated negative
coefficients on the quadratic trend terms and their statistical significance vary by month.
The most negative and significant k coefficients are in the seasonally low-ice "summer"
months of August, September, and October, and these months show the greatest trend rates

0.00.16 Relative to a linear trend model, the nonlinear trend model forecasts lower sea ice
at long horizons. February-April SIE point forecasts nevertheless remain well above zero
through the century, but August-October point forecasts approach zero much more quickly.
Indeed the quadratic September point forecast hits zero in 2045.
    Table 1 summarizes the results from investigation of the summer and non-summer differ-
ences in quadratic trend curvature using two standard model selection criteria: the Akaike
information criterion (AIC ) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC ). The AIC and

by penalizing estimates of in-sample forecasting performance for degrees of freedom used in
model fitting and differing only in the precise penalty applied (Diebold, 2007). The table
reports these model selection criteria for six versions of the quadratic trend model (3) with
various equality constraints imposed on the quadratic coefficients 1 , ..., 12 . Corresponding
estimation results appear in Table A1 in Appendix A.
    The models favored by AIC and BIC ­ that is, those with smaller values ­ are very
similar and involve summer and non-summer restrictions. The AIC selects a model with
equal k 's for the nine non-summer months (November-July) and unconstrained k 's for
the three summer months (August-October). The BIC, which penalizes degrees of freedom
more harshly, selects a slightly more constrained model, with the non-summer k 's again con-
strained to be equal and the three summer k 's also constrained to be equal. Compared to
the unconstrained version of equation (3) ­ the general model ­ both the AIC and BIC pre-
fer specifications with some summer and non-summer equality constraints imposed, because
their imposition saves degrees of freedom without substantially degrading fit. All told, the
results of Table 1 suggest a "simplified" quadratic model, namely model (3) with both sum-
mer and non-summer quadratic coefficients constrained separately to equality: 8 =9 =10
and 11 =12 =1 =...=7 . The regression diagnostics reported in Appendix A suggest good
performance of the simplified quadratic model: R2 is almost perfect; the residual graph and
Durbin-Watson statistic (DW) are consistent with random noise; and residual skewness, kur-
tosis, and density estimates are consistent with normality. All told, the model appears to
do a fine job of capturing SIE signal, reducing its complicated dynamics to Gaussian white

     Minimum ice coverage occurs at the end of summer in September because sea ice coverage continues
to shrink for any above-freezing temperatures. For convenience, we refer to the low-ice months of August,
September, October as "summer" even though they span late summer through early autumn.

     Because T IM E 2 and T IM E are correlated, an insignificant k coefficient would not necessarily imply
that nonlinearity is unimportant.

    Figure 4 shows the simplified quadratic model fits and forecasts. The simplified model
point forecasts are very similar to those of the general quadratic model in Figure 3, with a
zero-ice September also reached in 2045, but the rank ordering of the months in terms of
SIE is better preserved going forward. Going beyond these point forecasts, an important
advantage of a formal statistical approach is that it can quantify the amount of future
uncertainty. Figure 4 supplements the simplified quadratic trend point forecasts with interval
or probability density forecasts. When making long-horizon interval forecasts, it is crucial to
account for parameter estimation error, because its deleterious effects grow with the forecast
horizon. For example, although parameter estimation error may have small effects on 6-
month-ahead intervals, it will be greatly compounded for 600-month-ahead intervals. An
estimate of the time-t standard deviation of the forecast error, which accounts for parameter
estimation error, is t =s 1 + xt (X X )-1 xt , where s is the standard error of the regression,
xt is a 36×1 column vector of time-t right-hand-side variables, X is a T ×36 matrix whose
columns contain the regression's right-hand-side variables over time, and T is sample size.17
We use t to produce the ± 2 t pointwise prediction intervals of Figure 4. Under normality
of the shocks underlying the simplified quadratic model, the ± 2 t intervals are approximate
95 percent confidence intervals.18 The intervals widen rapidly; indeed the September interval

    Normality of the v shocks does not appear unreasonable, as the simplified quadratic model residuals
have skewness and kurtosis of -0.17 and 3.73, respectively. We also obtained similar results without assuming
normality via bootstrap simulation, which we discuss in section 6.

    Finally, in Figure 5 we zoom in on the 2060-2062 (36-month) segment of the simplified
quadratic model shadow ice forecast. The point forecast trends down and is seasonally
below zero by then. (Indeed, as already discussed, the point forecast is seasonally below zero
well before then.) Moreover, the ± 2 s.e. intervals widen over time, and entire intervals are
seasonally below zero by then. Hence it appears that, with near certainty, summer SIE will
vanish by 2060. This result is also clear from our earlier Figure 4, but Figure 5 highlights it
in a different and complementary way.

5     Statistical versus Climate Model Projections
Of the many analyses of the long-term future evolution of Arctic ice, most have focused
on projections from large-scale climate models. Such models are based on the underlying
physical, chemical, and biological processes that govern the dynamics of weather and cli-
mate across ocean, air, ice, and land. The models fit an immense number of variables at
a high temporal frequency and a granular spatial scale (e.g., a 30-minute time interval. a
100km worldwide horizontal resolution, and 40 vertical levels in the oceans and atmosphere).
Dozens of scientific groups around the world have constructed and currently maintain such
models. Occasionally, these groups conduct concurrent simulations as part of the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) that involve common sets of inputs including carbon
emissions scenarios. The most recently completed iteration or phase of this project is the
fifth one, denoted CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2012). The CMIP5 model comparison study was the
main source of climate projections included by the International Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) in its landmark Fifth Assessment Report.
    Arctic SIE is a key variable projected by climate models, and the models included in
CMIP5 are generally judged to provide a better fit to Arctic sea ice than earlier CMIP itera-

tions.20 Figure 6 shows three projections for September SIE constructed as averages across
sets of CMIP5 global climate models. These multi-model mean projections are constructed
under three different scenarios, or Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), for fu-
ture greenhouse gas concentrations. The brown, yellow, and blue lines are averages of the
climate models, respectively, under a high level of carbon emissions (RCP8.5), a medium
level (RCP6.0, yellow), and a low level (RCP4.5, blue).21 The first two higher emissions
scenarios are viewed as more likely business-as-usual outcomes and are the most relevant to
compare to statistical projections that extend the historical sample of past data and assume
a continuation of the world economy's current population and development trajectories.22
    The solid red line in Figure 6 shows the September trend from the simplified quadratic
model estimated on the full sample from November 1978 to October 2019. The dotted lines
bracketing this forecast provide an approximate 95 percent confidence interval. However, the
CMIP5 climate model projections are only based on data through 2005 and do not include
the past dozen or so years of sea ice observations. For comparability to these climate model
projections, we re-estimated the simplified quadratic model using data from 1978 through
2005, and the September trend from this pre-2006 model is shown as the dashed red line.
An interesting first result is that from the close conjunction of the two simplified model
statistical projections (the solid and dashed red lines), the addition of data from 2006 to
2019 does not lead to a significant revision in the statistical trend model. The very modest
differences between the pre-2006 estimated quadratic trend and the full-sample version is an
indication of the stability and suitability of the simplified statistical model.
    Comparing the statistical and climate model projections in Figure 6 reveals two salient
features. First, throughout the forecast period, the full-sample statistical model projection is
significantly lower than any of the climate multi-model mean projections. Indeed, the climate
model mean projections are well outside the 95 percent confidence intervals. Relative to the
statistical model estimated on data before 2006 or the full-sample version, the climate model
means are overestimating the 2019 SIE trend by about 1.0 million km2 . This wedge is
  20
      Stroeve et al. (2007) describes the poor sea ice fit of the CMIP3 models, while the somewhat improved
fit of the CMIP5 models is noted by in Stroeve et al. (2012b).
   21
      The climate model data are described in Serreze and Meier (2019) and Stroeve et al. (2012b) and were
kindly provided by Andrew Barrett at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The model sets averaged
for each scenario are not identical, with the RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 scenarios based on 26, 8, and 25
climate models, respectively.
   22
      In the RCP8.5 scenario, continuing increases in greenhouse gas emissions through the end of the century
raise the 2100 global average temperature by about 4.0-6.0 C above pre-industrial levels (Reidmiller et al.,
2018). In the RCP4.5 scenario, greenhouse gas emissions level off before mid-century, and the 2100 global
average temperature is approximately 2.0-3.0 C above pre-industrial levels.

Figure 6: September SIE : Statistical and Climate Model Fits, Point Forecasts, and Interval
Forecasts




Notes: We show fitted values and forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent, SIE . The solid black line is the historical
data for September Arctic sea ice extent from 1979 to 2019. Mean projections from CMIP5 climate models
are shown assuming underlying pathways of a high level of emissions (RCP8.5, brown), medium emissions
(RCP6.0, yellow), and lower emissions (RCP4.5, blue). The climate model projections start in 2006. The
red dashed line is the fitted and projected simplified quadratic model estimated using data from 1979 to
2005. The red solid line is the fitted and projected simplified quadratic trend model estimated using the
full sample from 1979 to 2019, and the red dotted lines are ± 2 s.e. intervals (approximate 95% confidence
intervals) around that projection accounting for parameter estimation uncertainty and intrinsic uncertainty.

projected to increase dramatically over the next two decades. Indeed, the pre-2006 and full-
sample statistical trend models project zero ice in 2042 and 2044, respectively, but none of the
climate model mean projections reach a completely ice-free Arctic in this century. Notably,
even assuming a high level of emissions (RCP8.5) ­ which is a scenario with continuing
increases in average global surface temperatures throughout this century ­ the multi-model
mean projection never reaches zero Arctic summer sea ice.
    Second, in contrast to the statistical projection, the climate model mean projections
show a decreasing rate of ice loss over time ­ that is, a concave rather than convex structure.
Specifically, the climate model projections all display a roughly linear decline for the first
couple of forecast decades (through around 2040) and then start to level out. For the lower
emissions RCP4.5 scenario, the leveling out and deceleration of sea ice partly reflects a

slowdown in the pace of global temperature increases. This effect is not at work in the
RCP8.5 scenario, which has global temperatures steadily climbing through 2100. However,
very close to zero sea ice extent, the leveling out of SIE in RCP8.5 appears to reflect the
hypothesized difficulty of melting the thick sea ice clinging near northern coastlines ­ notably
in Greenland and Canada. Climate models generally assume that these coastal regions will
retain landfast sea ice for a time even after the open Arctic Sea is free of ice. Therefore,
a common definition of "ice-free" or "nearly ice-free" in the literature is a threshold of 1.0
million km2 rather than zero SIE (Wang and Overland, 2009). Still, even with this higher
threshold, the three climate model mean projections only reach a nearly ice-free Arctic in
2068, 2089, and >2100 for successively lower emissions scenarios, respectively. By contrast,
the pre-2006 statistical projection reaches the higher 1.0 million km2 threshold in 2037, and
the full-sample statistical model reaches that level in 2039.
    Some have argued that climate models generally do well in representing the large-scale
evolution of Arctic sea ice (Stroeve and Notz, 2015), but a number of studies have noted that
the CMIP5 global climate models overpredicted the amount of Arctic sea ice (Massonnet
et al., 2012; Stroeve et al., 2012a; Serreze and Meier, 2019). That overprediction continues,
and its source is not well understood. One proposed correction to this overprediction has
been to focus on the models that fit the historical SIE data better according to certain
metrics (Wang and Overland, 2012). However, there is no agreed upon model selection
criterion. Also, Rosenblum and Eisenman (2017) discount such model selection because
models with more accurate sea ice readings also tend to overpredict global temperatures, so
the selected climate models may be getting sea ice loss right for the wrong reason. Finally,
it should be noted that from a statistical viewpoint, focusing on a simple average forecast
from many models has been shown to be a robust prediction strategy (Diebold and Shin,
2019).
    In some respects, the wide differences between the statistical and climate model projec-
tions are not too surprising. In climate models, the monthly observations on total Arctic
SIE are a high-level output from complex, nonlinear, granular representations of the relevant
underlying science. Obtaining good SIE predictions from these models requires correctly
specifying a host of detailed subsidiary processes. Such a bottom-up modeling procedure
has important advantages in structural interpretation and counterfactual scenario analysis.
However, in a variety of disciplines, a bottom-up procedure, which carries the possibility
that small misspecifications can accumulate and affect high-level aggregates, has not been
found to improve prediction relative to a top-line procedure that directly models the object


                                              17
of interest (Diebold, 2007). Thus, based on broad previous experience, we believe that direct
statistical projections of Arctic SIE are likely to be relatively accurate.


6      Probability Assessments of an Ice-Free Arctic
An advantage of a formal statistical model is its ability to make probability density forecasts
for a range of possible reduced Arctic sea ice scenarios. Of particular interest are probability
assessments of an ice-free or nearly ice-free Arctic, that is, the probability that SIEt equals
zero or is less than or equal to some threshold  , respectively. Formally, such event proba-
bilities can be denoted as P (SIEt  ), which represents the probability that sea ice extent
is less than or equal to  in month t. We estimate these scenario probability distributions
using the simplified quadratic model and a stochastic simulation procedure that accounts for
parameter estimation uncertainty and allows for potentially non-Gaussian serially correlated
stochastic shocks. From a given set of simulated paths, we estimate the event probabilities
of interest as the proportion of simulated paths in which the event occurs out of the total
number of paths.23
    An event that has attracted much attention in the literature is the initial occurrence of an
ice-free or nearly ice-free September. We calculate the probability for each September with
date t0 so that SIEt0  and SIEt > for all t<t0 . Specifically, for a given  and simulation
i, we determine the year in which September SIEt first reaches  , and then we cumulate
across all simulations to build a distributional estimate. The red lines in Figure 7 provide the
resulting probability distributions for an initial "ice-free" Arctic September for  =0,  =1,
and  =2, that is, for progressively more lenient definitions of "ice-free." As noted above, the
middle value of  , which represents Arctic sea ice of less than 1 million km2 , is a popular
benchmark in the literature (Wang and Overland, 2012). For that particular threshold,
the statistical model produces a distribution centered at 2039.24 Of particular interest is
the probability distribution of dates taking into account model parameter uncertainty and
stochastic shock uncertainty, and this distribution shows about a 60 percent probability of
an effectively ice-free September Arctic occurring in the 2030s.
    The distribution with  =1 is bracketed on either side by distributions that use the higher
and lower thresholds. The  =0 distribution has a median date of 2044 and a 95 percent range
from 2039 to 2053. The  =2 distribution has a median date of 2033 and an earlier and slightly

Notes: We display probability distributions from the simplified quadratic trend model for the date of the
first effectively ice-free September (in red) and first ice-free summer (in black). The "ice-free" threshold is

narrower 95 percent range from 20230 to 2039. The climate modeling literature has pointed
to several factors that underpin the uncertainty in the timing of an initial September ice-free
Arctic including natural climate variability, emissions path uncertainty, and uncertain sea
ice dynamics (Serreze and Meier, 2019). These factors are at least partially accounted for in
our analysis.
    The multi-model mean CMIP5 climate projections described above are well outside the
above-described distributional ranges. For a threshold of 1 million km2 , the mean projections
reach a nearly ice-free Arctic in 2068 and 2089 under the RCP8.5 and RCP6.0 scenarios,
respectively. The former date is denoted by a vertical brown bar in Figure 7. The range of
dates across individual models is also extremely wide, stretching well over a century (Jahn
et al., 2016). To narrow this range, researchers have omitted models with poor performance
using a variety of sea ice metrics. With such model selection procedures, the range of dates
for a first nearly ice-free September is narrowed greatly to a 20-year span that runs from


                                                      19
the 2040s to 2060s (Massonnet et al., 2012; Thackeray and Hall, 2019).25 Even such a
carefully circumscribed span is roughly a decade later than the simplified quadratic trend
model produces. Moreover, the climate model simulation exercises are not designed to yield
formal error estimates or measures of uncertainty as the spread of climate model forecasts
in an ensemble is insufficient to completely characterize forecast uncertainty.
    Finally, we note the availability of density forecasts for a variety of richer joint scenarios
of interest. As one example, Jahn et al. (2016) describe other definitions of "ice-free" that
involve, for example, 5-year running means. Alternatively, "ice-free" may require no ice
for several consecutive months, for example, to accommodate meaningful freight shipping,
tourism, mining, and commercial fishing (Yevgeny et al., 2017). For example, the strong
Autumn demand for international freight shipping to satisfy year-end Western holiday con-
sumer demand could make a multi-month ice-free Arctic shipping lane of interest. In this
case, the probability distribution of the initial occurrence of an "ice-free" summer ­ a joint
ice-free August, September, and October ­ could be relevant. Figure 7 shows this distribu-
tion in black assuming an ice-free threshold of  =1. This density is notably shifted right ­
and more right-skewed ­ compared to the September scenarios.


7      Concluding Remarks
A rapidly warming Arctic is an ominous sign of the broader climate change caused by hu-
man activity, but declining Arctic sea ice also has an important influence on the pace and
intensity of future climate change. Using statistical models, we have provided probabilistic
projections of 21st-century Arctic sea ice that account for both intrinsic uncertainty and
parameter estimation uncertainty. These projections indicate that summertime Arctic sea
ice will quickly diminish and disappear ­ with about a 60 percent probability of an effectively
ice-free September Arctic occurring within two decades.
    By contrast, the average projection from leading climate models implies an initial seasonal
ice-free Arctic several decades later ­ even assuming a business-as-usual emissions path. The
slow and decreasing pace at which large-scale climate models reach an ice-free Arctic may be
a serious shortcoming, and such conservative projections of sea ice loss could be a misleading
guide for global climate policy.26
  25
    Again, the caveats of Rosenblum and Eisenman (2017) regarding such model selection are relevant.
  26
    Our statistical results are in line with the concerns of Stroeve et al. (2007) regarding the possibility that
the slow projected decline in Arctic sea ice by climate models suggests they are underestimating the effects of
greenhouse gases. More recently, Guarino et al. (2020) also emphasize deficiencies in climate models' Arctic


                                                       20
    There are numerous examples, across many disciplines, showing that parsimonious sta-
tistical representations can provide forecasts that are at least as accurate as the ones from
detailed structural models.27 However, rather than treat statistical models as just forecast
competitors to structural climate models, there is likely to be scope to use them as com-
plementary representations going forward. The mechanisms governing Arctic sea ice loss
and connecting that loss to atmospheric, oceanic, and permafrost responses are not fully
captured in climate models. Statistical models may be able to help assist in bridging such
gaps until a more complete understanding is available (Parkinson, 2010).
    In addition, statistical models may also be able to provide a benchmark for model perfor-
mance that can be used for climate model evaluation, estimation/calibration, and selection.
In particular, our statistical approach summarizes a key aspect of the data, namely its histor-
ical dynamics and the associated forecast path (call it P AT HD , where D stands for "Data").
A climate model with calibrated parameters  produces a corresponding summary for the
model (call it P AT HM (), where M stands for "Model"). So, at least conceptually, we can
consider

   1. evaluating a climate model by examining a measure of divergence, ||P AT HD -P AT HM ()||

   2. estimating a climate model by finding   ^ = argmin ||P AT HD -P AT HM ()|| (this is
      precisely indirect inference (Gourieroux et al., 1993), using P AT H as the estimation
      window)

   3. selecting a climate model by finding the model with smallest ||P AT HD -P AT HM (^)||,
      adjusted for d.f.

In practice such formal procedures are infeasible for massive global climate models, which
attempt to address all aspects of the high-dimensional climate state, of which sea ice is
but one small part. Hence, for example, the "right" window for complete climate model
estimation by indirect inference is much more complicated than just a sea ice path. Less
formal procedures directly motivated by the above considerations can nevertheless be highly
revealing, as in our key Figure 6.




representations.

     A classic example from economics is Nelson (1972), who showed that simple statistical models forecast
the economy as well as large-scale structural models based on economic theory.

              Estimation Results, Quadratic Model with Restrictions (Continued)


Notes to table: We show maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters of the general
quadratic model (3), with various equality constraints imposed on the quadratic coefficients
1 , ..., 12 . "NONE" denotes no constraints, which corresponds to the general quadratic
model (3). "Seq" ("Summer equal") denotes August-October equal (8 =9 =10 ). "NSeq"
("Non-Summer equal") denotes November-July equal (11 =12 =1 =...=7 ). "Seq+NSeq"
denotes summer months equal and non-summer months (separately) equal, which corre-
sponds to the simplified quadratic model. "ALLeq" denotes all months equal (1 =...=12 ).
"ALL0" denotes all months 0 (1 =...=12 =0), which corresponds to the linear model (1). In
each column, we show constrained parameter estimates in boldface. "*" denotes significance
at the ten percent level.

                                 Figure A1: SIE , Actual and Residual




Notes: The left panel uses different scales (actual on the right, residual on the left), so the residual is greatly
enlarged. The right panel uses a common scale, making clear that the residual is negligible.


                 Figure A2: SIE Residual Histogram and Best-Fitting Gaussian




Notes: We show the residual histogram, together with a Gaussian density fit to the residuals.



                                                        24
B      Simulation Methods
We estimate scenario probability distributions using the simplified quadratic model (that is,
the quadratic model (3) subject to the constraints 8 =9 =10 and 11 =12 =1 =...=7 ) and
a simulation procedure that accounts for parameter estimation uncertainty and allows for
potentially non-Gaussian serially correlated stochastic shocks. To describe this simulation
procedure, it is useful to re-write the quadratic model (3) in a more concise notation:

                                           SIEt = xt  + t

                                            t = t-1 + vt

                                             vt  iid(0,  2 )

                                         SIEt = max(SIEt , 0),

where xt =(D1t , ..., D12t , D1t ·T IM Et , ..., D12t ·T IM Et , D1t ·T IM Et2 , ..., D1t ·T IM Et2 ) and
 =(1 , ..., 12 , 1 , ..., 12 , 1 , ..., 12 ). We estimate the model by maximum likelihood us-
ing the historical data sample t = 1, ..., T , as discussed earlier, and then we simulate
i = 1, ..., 10, 000 future paths based on the estimated model. Simulation i proceeds as
follows:

    1. Draw  (i) from the sampling distribution of the estimated parameter vector ^, and
       form xt  (i) , t = T +1, ..., 2099M 12.
               (i)
    2. Draw vt by sampling with replacement from the observed v
                                                              ^t 's (with equal weights
       1/T ), t = T +1, ..., 2099M 12.
                                                                            (i)                 (i)
    3. Draw (i) from the sampling distribution of        ^, and form t = (i) t-1 + vt , t =
       T +1, ..., 2099M 12, using the last observed historical residual ^T as the initial condition.
                     ( i)          (i)
    4. Form SIEt = xt  (i) + t , t = T +1, ..., 2099M 12.

Finally, we estimate event probabilities of interest as the relative frequency of occurrence
across the simulated paths.
