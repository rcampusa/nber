                                         ABSTRACT

       Empirical research on the permanent income hypothesis (PIH) has found that consumption
growth is excessively sensitive to predictable changes in income. This finding is interpreted as
strong evidence against the PIH. We propose an explanation for apparent excess sensitivity that is
based on a quantitative equilibrium version of Becker's (1965) model of household production in
which permanent income consumers respond to shifts in sectoral wages and prices by substituting
work effort and consumption across home and market sectors. Although the PIH is true, this
mechanism generates apparent excess sensitivity because market consumption responds to
predictable income growth.

   The permanent-income/life-cycle hypothesis (PIH) has come to occupy a cen-

tral position in mainstream macroeconomics since its inception nearly forty years

ago in the writings of Milton Friedman (1957). Although the PIH is taken as

axiomatic in many macroeconomic investigations, the question of its empirical

accuracy continues to form the basis for an active empirical literature which we

survey in section I below. Many of these studies find that consumption growth

rates are robustly correlated with predictable changes in real income. This finding

is sometimes described as the "excess sensitivity" of consumption to income and

is interpreted as strong evidence against the PIH.

   This paper proposes an explanation for apparent excess sensitivity that is

consistent with the PIH. Our starting point is Gary S. Becker's (1965) model of

a household in which individuals substitute between home and market produced

consumption goods according to their relative price. We will show that a model

incorporating production and consumption of home-produced goods provides a

compelling rationale for the observed empirical relationship between consumption

and output.

   The link between household production and the business cycle has been the

subject of several recent papers.1 These papers find that interactions between the

                                        2
household and market sectors in a quantitative general equilibrium model improve

the model's predictions concerning the central business cycle facts relative to a

prototypical one-sector real business cycle model. These household production

models do not test the PIH: they embed permanent income theory as part of the

structure of the model. However, the model turns out to have striking predictions

for the empirical findings that a researcher would obtain if he investigated excess

sensitivity using data on market consumption and market output alone.

   The basic idea behind household production in a theory of the business cycle

is that individuals substitute between home and market goods depending on the

wage rate. That is: the market wage rate measures the opportunity cost of engag-

ing in household production, so an increase iu the market wage during an economic

expansion should be accompanied by an increase in market work and purchases of

market goods and a corresponding decrease in household production. Examples

of goods for which there are especially good possibilities for substitution between

market purchase versus home production include the following: child care; home

maintenance (housecleaning, lawn mowing, painting, repairs, and the like); food

preparation; financial services such as preparation of income tax returns; and

clothing (sewing and repair).

   Since the household production model predicts that income growth and growth


                                         3
in the opportunity cost of home-produced goods are highly correlated, there is

a natural reason for a positive correlation between market consumption growth

and predictable changes in income. Using a quantitative equilibrium business

cycle model with household production, we show that the empirical finding of

excess sensitivity of market consumption to market income emerges even though

individuals have rational expectations and act as permanent income consumers

when consumption is appropriately defined to include goods produced at home.

Essentially, the standard "excess sensitivity" regression is misspecified because it

focuses on market consumption and market income, when it should properly be

specified as a relationship between aggregate consumption and aggregate income.2

   The paper is structured as follows. Section I reviews the empirical literature

on the excess sensitivity of consumption. Section II develops a partial equilibrium

model of consumer choice that illustrates how apparent excess sensitivity arises

naturally in the presence of a nonmarket consumption good. The partial equi-

librium nature of the model allows us to develop intuitive, closed-form solutions

for the relationship between consumption growth and predictable income growth.

Section III closes the model of section II by specifying the production side of the

economy and determining prices and interest rates endogenously. The section ends

with a brief description of the business cycle implications of the model. Section

                                         4
IV studies the implications of the general equilibrium model for the coefficients

in a regression of market consumption growth on the predictable component of

income growth and on the interest rate. We consider several plausible specifica-

tions for the productivity process which drives the model. Further, we explore

the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to alterations in the specification of the

consumption regression and explore the extent to which small sample bias may

be important. Overall, we find a robust prediction of "excess sensitivity" in the

sense that expected income growth in the market sector predicts growth in market

consumption. Section V concludes.



I. Related literature

In his seminal paper, Robert E. Hall (1978) showed that consumption should

follow a random walk in a simple intertemporal equilibrium model with a con-

stant interest rate. He finds that lagged income is not significant for consumption

growth, and he thus concludes in favor of the permanent income hypothesis. Sub-

sequently, however, Marjorie Flavin (1981) found that consumption is excessively

sensitive to income in the sense that current income still has explanatory power

after accounting for the innovation in permanent income. Most recently, John Y.

Campbell and N. Gregory Mankiw (1989, 1990, 1991) used instrumental variable

                                          5
techniques to estimate the coefficient on predictable changes in income in con-

sumption growth regressions and argued that this coefficient measures the frac-

tion of consumption attributable to individuals who, as a rule of thumb, consume

their current income.

   In addition to the rule-of-thumb consumption function, several possible ex-

planations for the empirical failure of Hall's basic model have been suggested.

Most of these consider the relaxation of the simplifying assumptions of the initial

model. The following representation of the consumer's first order condition, which

is somewhat more general than Hall's, suggests various avenues for reconciling the

empirical evidence with modern versions of the permanent income hypothesis:



                   u'(C, X) = i3E[u'(C+1, X+1)(1 + rtt+i)]                    (0.1)



In the expression above, u'(C,X) is momentary marginal utility which depends
on consumption of nondurables and services, C, and on other factors X which

affect the marginal utility of consumption, and rt,t+i denotes the interest rate

between periods t and t+1. Thus one possible explanation for the failure of Hall's

basic model is a variable interest rate. Campbell and Mankiw consider whether

the interest rate explains excess sensitivity. They find, however, that empiri-


                                         6
cally the interest rate does not explain much of consumption growth. Another

proposed explanation for excess sensitivity is time-varying precautionary saving

behavior, related to a time-varying conditional variance of consumption. This line

of argument has been pursued by Ricardo J. Caballero (1990). Finally, Lawrence

Christiano et al. (1991) explore the role of temporal aggregation in generating

spurious excess sensitivity.

   Another proposed reconciliation of the PIH with apparent excess sensitivity is

based on other factors which enter nonseparably in the marginal utility function,

as represented above by the variable X. The most obvious are nonseparabilities

related to different classes of consumption goods (e.g., consumer durables vs. con-

sumer non-durables, or consumption vs. leisure), or nonseparabilities over time

due to habit formation. If movements in Xt1     are   predictable and if they are re-

lated to predictable changes in income, the nonseparability can generate the excess

sensitivity result. John Cochrane (1991) suggests this as one potential interpre-

tation of the Campbell-Mankiw results. Empirical evidence on the hypothesis

that excess sensitivity is due to nonseparability of consumer durables from non-

durables is inconclusive: Campbell and Mankiw (1990) and Mankiw (1985) do not

reject separability, while Martin Eichenbaum and Lars Hansen (1990) find some

evidence against separability between durables and nondurables.

                                         7
   Our proposed explanation for apparent excess sensitivity hinges on a partic-

ular nonseparability: that between market goods and home goods in momentary

utility. While substitutions between consumption and leisure are also part of our

story, it is more plausible that the most important channel involves substitution

across alternative methods for producing final consumption goods. Further, in

addition to substitution across consumption goods, individuals in our model also

substitute between productive activities depending on the relative rewards to work

in each sector. The combination of these two effects provides an explanation for

the empirical finding of excess sensitivity.



II. A simple model

This section develops a partial equilibrium model of consumer choice that il-

lustrates how apparent excess sensitivity arises in the presence of a nonmarket

consumption good. Specifically, we show that the growth of market consumption

is positively related to the predictable component of labor income growth.

   The representative individual derives utility from market consumption, C,

from home-produced consumption, H, and from leisure, L, and maximizes ex-




                                          8
pected lifetime utility given by:


                                     1
                       E0t (             )                                     (0.2)



where y(.) is a linearly homogeneous aggregator of the two consumption goods;

v(L) measures the utility derived from leisure; a is the coefficient of relative risk

aversion; and 3 is the subjective discount factor. The individual's time constraint

takes the form:



                               T—NHt+NAIt+Lt                                   (0.3)


where T is the amount of nonsleeping time available for working or consuming

leisure; NHt is the amount of time that individuals allocate to the production of

the home-produced good; NAIt is time devoted to market work; and L denotes

time spent in leisure activities. We follow the literature in assuming that an hour

devoted to market work generates the same disutility as an hour of nonmarket

work.

   The representative individual's assets evolve according to the following:


                      = (1 + rt,t+i)(Zt + W(T — NHt — L) — C)                   (0.4)


                                          9
where Z,1 denotes individual asset holdings at the beginning of period t + 1 and

W, is the wage rate in the market sector. We have assumed, for simplicity, that

the representative agent holds a single asset (which may be a portfolio) that earns

the exogenous real return rt,t+i between periods t and t + 1.

      Household production is assumed to require labor alone, according to a linear

technology (this assumption will be relaxed in the general equilibrium model of

the next section). Letting AHt denote the (possibly stochastic) level of labor

productivity in the home sector, consumption of the home good, H, is constrained

by:



                                   AHtNHt =    H.                             (0.5)

                      (1 —   a)(C, Ht)v(L)             II)
   Equation (0.6) is the intertemporal efficiency condition relating the marginal

utility in period t to discounted marginal utility in period t + 1, while equations

(0.7) and (0.8) are intratemporal efficiency conditions relating relative prices and

marginal utilities.

   We can obtain a closed form solution for this model by taking a log-linear ap-

proximation to the Euler equations. To simplify, we let productivity be constant

in the household sector: AHt = AH. Log-linear approximation of (0.6) yields

the following relationship between expected growth of consumption and expected

wage growth, where lowercase letters denote percentage deviations from the point

of linearization (except for rt,t+1, defined earlier as the risk-free interest rate):



                       Et(Ac+i) = aiEt(twt+i) + Q2Etrt,t+1.                        (0.9)

In the expressions above, s denotes the share of market consumption in the

consumption aggregate y; (denotes the elasticity of substitution between market

consumption and consumption of goods produced at home;                is the elasticity

of the marginal utility of the consumption aggregate with respect to leisure

denotes the own-elasticity of the marginal utility of leisure.

   To gain insight into the relationship between consumption growth and wage

growth, it is instructive to study two special cases of equation (0.9).          First,

suppose there is no household good, so that s = 1. Then the expression for a1

simplifies to

                              a1 =                     .                        (0.10)
                                       ae11 + (1 —

The denominator of (0.10) is negative by concavity of momentary utility. The

numerator          0 if a    1, so the condition for a1 >     0   in the case with no

household production is a >     1:     the marginal utility of consumption falls with


                                              12
increases in leisure.

    A second special case involves zero elasticity of substitution between the home

and market good:        0. In this case,        becomes


                                       —
                                          (1 — )e11
                                   a    + (1 —



Compared with the no-household-production case, this expression for c has a new

term in the numerator, —(1—s)j, which reflects a "price effect" of an increase in

the market wage on consumption. When the market wage rises, the consumption

aggregate becomes more expensive because time is needed to produce the home

good. This price effect, taken by itself, would tend to reduce consumption of the

composite good. Thus introducing household production in a way that permits

no substitutability between home and market goods would tend to reduce the

responsiveness of market consumption to changes in the wage rate.

     When individuals are willing to substitute between home and market goods,

C   > 0, then the final term appears in the expression for c: (1 — s)(.      This
term reflects the effect on market consumption of substitutions between home

and market goods when their relative price changes. As noted above, an increase

in the market wage increases the price of home goods relative to market goods.


                                           13
Individuals will then shift consumption toward market goods—the extent to which

they are willing to do this depends on the elasticity of substitution (.

   Thus, we find that ci is likely to be positive, even if there is no home produc-

tion, simply because of substitution between consumption and leisure. The price

effect of home production tends to reduce the value of c, while increases in the

substitutability between home and market goods will increase o. A sufficient

condition for c > 0 is a > 1, (    1. As we discuss more fully in the next section,

these parameter restrictions appear to be satisfied in the data.

   How does effort devoted to market work vary with the market wage and the

interest rate? Working again with the log-linear approximation to the model, we

obtain the following expression for the growth rate of market labor input:



                     Et(AnAI,t+l) = y1Et(Awt+i) + 'y2Er,+1                   (0.11)

                                         14
Whether labor input is expected to rise or fall with increases in the wage rate

depends on the sign of 'y. Since 'Yi     is   the related to the compensated labor

supply elasticity, it is likely to be positive. Further, we find that 'y is positive

when parameters are set in accordance with estimates obtained by others in the

context of household production models, as we shall show below.

   Putting these pieces together, expected income growth is given by



                     E(Ay+1)       Et(Ariji,t+i) + E(Aw+1).                          (0.12)



Using equations (0.9) and (0.11) above, we find that expected consumption growth

is related to expected income growth by the following:



            E(Ac+1) =          1E(Ay+1) +                       2Etrtt+i      .      (0.13)
                          1


Thus we have that expected growth of market output is positively correlated with

the growth of market consumption if           >   0   and (1 + 'y) >   0,   as seems like'y

in light of our prior discussion.3 The economic mechanism behind this result is

made transparent by the simplicity of the model. When future market wages are

expected to be high, individuals plan to substitute labor input away from the

home good and toward production of the market good. At the same time, they

                                         15
plan to substitute consumption of the market good for consumption of the home

good (which they must since, holding AHt constant, there will be relatively less of

the home good available if labor supply to the household sector declines). Thus

there is a natural mechanism linking predictable income growth to the growth of

market consumption.4

   Finally, note that the coefficient on the interest rate is not equal to 1/a = 1

unless ci =     1.   Thus this equation cannot, in general, be used to estimate a as

the inverse of the coefficient on the interest rate. To estimate a in the context of

this model, it is necessary to have data on household sector activity that would

permit estimation of the shares and elasticities embedded in the coefficients in

equation (0.13).



III. A general equilibrium model

This section closes the partial equilibrium model of section II by specifying the

production side of the market economy, allowing both capital and labor to be used

in the household sector, and determining prices and interest rates endogenously.

   While a growing literature has shown that household production considerations

may be important for understanding macroeconomic phenomena at business cycle

frequencies, our concern is how household production alters the interpretation of

                                          16
standard tests of the permanent income hypothesis. Specifically, does the presence

of the nonmarket sector rationalize the fact that consumption growth is related

to predictable income growth? We find that the answer is "yes." Central to

our story is the idea that individuals substitute labor supply across the market

and nonmarket sectors depending on the relative opportunities available. At the

same time, consumers value consumption of both the market-produced good and

the non-market good (the home good), and substitute between these goods with

variations in their relative price. The basic intuition developed in the partial

equilibrium model of last section will carry over to this general equilibrium model.

That is: when productivity is expected to be high in the market sector individuals

will choose to increase labor supply to that sector. At the same time, the relative

price of market goods will decline, so that expected consumption of the market

good will rise. Thus expected growth of market output will be able to predict the

growth of market consumption even though individuals act as rational, permanent

income consumers.


A. The model

equation (0.2) above, subject to their time constraint, equation (0.3).

      Production of the market good is governed by the following constant-returns-

to-scale technology:

                             Y1 = AjtK1 (XN1)1                                (0.14)


while production of the nonmarket good follows


                                 = AHtKt(XtNHt)''9.                           (0.15)



X is the deterministic trend in labor-augmenting technical change, common

across sectors, which grows at the rate 'y = X+1 /X. The variables A1 and

AHt are the stochastic components of technical change, which may contain unit

roots.

      In each sector, capital is subject to convex costs of adjustment, so that in-

vestment in each sector, Ijt and 'Ht is translated into installed capital according

to:

   The government of this economy purchases the market good in the amount

G, taxes the returns to market work and market capital at the constant rates TN

and TK, and rebates any potential surplus proceeds to consumers as lump-sum

transfers, TR. Government purchases neither yield utility to private individuals

nor enhance the productivity of private factors of production. The government's

budget constraint, expressed in units of the market good, is given by:



                  TNWtNMt + TK(rKt — öM)KMt        G + TR                 (0.18)



where W is the market wage rate, and TKt is the rental rate of market capital.

   Output of the nonmarket good is used solely for consumption, thus the asso-

ciated resource constraint is simply

B. Calibration

We have calibrated our model to conform as closely as possible with the recent

literature on household production as summarized in the survey by Jeremy Green-

wood et al. (1995). Our procedure is similar to theirs, in that we solve for the

deterministic steady state of the model and calibrate the model's steady state

by setting the following quantities to match corresponding averages in U.S. time

series: the capital-output ratio in the market sector; the ratio of household cap-

ital to market capital; the shares of investment in the two sectors as a fraction

of market output; time allocated to each of the two sectors and to leisure; tax

rates; the trend rate of growth of total factor productivity; and the real interest

rate. These parameters jointly determine the steady state, and thus implicitly

define the following parameters: the growth-adjusted subjective discount factor;


                                        20
the depreciation rates in the two sectors; labor's share in each sector; capital's

share in each sector; and the share of market goods in aggregate consumption.

The following parameters have no effect on the steady state; rather, they affect

the model's dynamics: the elasticity of substitution between market and home

goods; risk aversion; the own-elasticity of leisure; the elasticity of the adjustment

cost function; and the parameters of the productivity shock process. Our baseline

parameterization of the economy is as follows.


1. Preferences

The time period is a quarter of a year. The growth-adjusted subjective time

discount factor is set so that the steady state real interest rate is 6.5% per year.

The share of market goods in the consumption aggregate              is s = 0.63.   The

amount of available nonsleeping time is normalized to 1, of which NM = 0.33

is spent in market work including commuting, NH = 0.25 is spent in household

production, and L = 0.42 is consumed directly as leisure. These shares are from

the 1971-1981 Michigan time surveys, and are averages over both men and women.

The own-elasticity of leisure is set at =     —1   in the baseline case. The coefficient

of relative risk aversion is a = 2.

    The elasticity of substitution between market and home goods, , plays an


                                         21
important role in our analysis. Until recently there has been little research which

attempts to determine the appropriate value of this parameter. In the two early

quantitative models with household production, researchers established a 'pre-

ferred value" that was chosen to insure that the model performed well in terms of

some key business-cycle facts. Specifically, Greenwood et al. (1995) chose ( = 3,

while Jess Benhabib et al. (1991) report a preferred value of ( = 5. Subsequently,

Ellen McGrattan et al. (1997) constructed a household production model similar

to ours and used maximum likelihood to obtain an estimate of ( using macro-

economic time series data. Their point estimate was 1.75 with a 95% confidence

interval of (1.25, 2.95).

   In another study, Peter Rupert et al. (1995) used micro data from the PSID to

estimate ( for three groups of consumers: single males; single females; and couples.

The point estimate for single males was = 0.94 (the 95% confidence interval is

(0.05, 1.82). For single females, they report =   1.80 with   95% confidence interval

(1.37, 2.24). For couples, the estimate ranges from ( = 1.09 (95% confidence
interval is (0.45, 1.73)) to   4.00 (95% confidence interval is (3.02,4.98)). The

estimate depended on whether specific cross-equation restrictions were imposed

during estimation. Based on this group of studies, a plausible range for seems

to be ( E (0.00,5.00). Our benchmark value is ( = 3, but we also report results

                                         22
for other plausible values of .


2. Technology

The parameters of the two production technologies were set to match the following

steady state values. First, the capital-to-output ratio in the market sector is equal

to 4, based on a concept of market capital that comprises producer durables and

nonresidential structures. The ratio of household capital to market capital is

set at 0.625; this is half the value chosen by Greenwood et al. (1995). We

depart here from their assumption that the household capital is equal to the

entire stock of durables plus residential structures to capture the idea that part

of this stock is not used for household production, but rather is used solely for

leisure (this assumption does not affect significantly our results). The share of

market investment is constrained to equal 11.8% of market output, and the share

of household investment is set equal to 6.75% of market output. Labor's share in

the market sector is 0.69, and is 0.80 in the household sector. The elasticity of

substitution between capital and labor in each sector is 1. The adjustment cost

function is parameterized so that no adjustment costs are incurred in maintaining

the steady state capital stock (i.e., in the steady state Tobin's q is one). The
elasticity of the investment-to-capital ratio with respect to movements in Tobin's


                                         23
q is set at i'     13.3 as   in Marianne Baxter and Mario J. Crucini (1993,1995). The

depreciation rates on the two capital stocks are 5M                     2.55   percent per quarter in
the market sector, and oH           2.30   percent per quarter in the household sector.


3. Productivity

The quarterly trend rate of growth of labor-augmenting technical change is set at
  =   1.004.   The stochastic components of productivity, A11 and AHt, are governed

by the following vector AR(1) process:


                         Pi v1           log AAIt           P2   i-'2          log AM,t_1
                    =                                 +                                       +
                         V1    p1        logAH              V2 P2              logAH,_1
                                                                                                  (0.21)

with the correlation of innovations set at 0.67 in accordance with the parameter-

ization of Greenwood et al. (1995).

    We study three stochastic processes for the productivity shock. In the first

case, we assume that technology follows a trend-stationary process with Pi                         0.90,

P2 =   0.      In the second case, we assume that technology is an AR(1) in first

differences: we set Pi =        1.25,   P2 =   —0.25.     In both cases we assume that there

is no transmission of shocks from one sector to the other: u1 =                             = 0. In the

third and final case we assume that productivity is trend stationary, but that

                                                 24
innovations in productivity spill over to the other sector with a one-quarter lag.

This specification captures the idea that innovations that initially apply to one

sector (such as microcomputers used in the market sector) eventually find uses in

the home sector (microcomputers can be used at home to prepare one's own tax

return). Specifically, we set Pi =   0.81,   v1 = 0.10,   P2   = i-'2 = 0. In each case, we

assume that the standard deviation of innovations to productivity shocks in both

sectors is 0.0075, following Greenwood et al. (1995).


4. Government

The government has an essentially passive role—the reason for including a gov-

ernment sector is that taxation of capital is important for the level of the capital

stock, investment shares, and the capital share in the market sector. The tax

rate on market capital, TK, is set at 0.70, which is in the range estimated by

several authors: see, for example, Martin Feldstein et al. (1983). The tax rate on

market labor is set at TN = 0.25, which is in line with current effective tax rates,

as reported by McGrattan et al. (1997). The model's results regarding excess

sensitivity are largely insensitive to variations in these tax rates, even over fairly

wide ranges. Government purchases are set at C = 0, so that all tax proceeds are

returned to individuals as lump-sum transfers.


                                             25
C. Business-cycle implications

Although this paper is not concerned with the business-cycle implications of the

model per se, we present these for two reasons. First, for readers unfamiliar with

the household production literature, we provide some evidence on the extent to

which the household production model performs well in terms of replicating the

salient features of business cycles. Second, these results show the extent to which

our model of household production generates cycles that are similar to those

generated by the earlier models.

   Table 1 presents summary business-cycle statistics for postwar U.S. data and

for our household production model. We present results for all three parame-

trization of the productivity shock process. Table 1 shows that our household

production model fits the basic business-cycle statistics about well as the other

household production models in the literature. In particular, the stationary mod-

els generally do a good job of replicating the pattern of relative volatility of market

consumption (relative to market output), and produce relative volatility statis-

tics for investment that are close to those in the data. The model underpredicts

somewhat the volatility of labor input to the market sector, while the relative

volatility of the wage rate is closer to that found in the data.

   Although corresponding figures are not available from the data, it is interesting

                                          26
to see that the model predicts that household and market output are positively

correlated although not strongly so, while household and market consumption

are roughly uncorrelated. The model predicts that market consumption is highly

correlated with market output, in fact, somewhat more so than found in the

data. Overall, however, the model fits the stylized facts of household and market

business cycles fairly well.



IV. The excess-sensitivity regression

Following an idea of Hall (1978), Campbell and Mankiw (1989) propose a model

in which there are two types of consumers: permanent income consumers, and

"rule-of-thumb" consumers who simply consume their current income. Combining

these two types of consumers leads to the following specification for consumption

growth, /Ct, as a function of income growth, E_1y, and the ex-ante real interest

rate rt_i,t (which is known at time t — 1), and an error term Ut that captures the

part of consumption growth that is unpredictable given past values of income

growth and the interest rate, and other sources of error such as measurement

error:

                               = + AE_i/y + Ort_i,t + Ut.                   (0.22)




                                         27
   Campbell and Mankiw argue that A in equation (0.22) measures the fraction of

the population that follows a rule of thumb; their instrumental-variables estimates

of A range from 0.29 to 0.66, depending on the instrument list and whether the

interest rate is included in the regression. Their estimates of 0 are typically very

small, ranging from 0.02 to 0.15, which they also view as inconsistent with the PIll

since, in their specification, 0 = 1/a is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution

and should thus be somewhat larger.

   Campbell and Mankiw's regression is, of course, mis-specified in our model

economy. That is: the error term t includes other variables (notably, household

sector variables) that affect the growth rate of market consumption. Most impor-

tantly, these omitted variables are correlated with expected income growth and

the real interest rate. But it is still of interest to know what coefficient estimates

an empirical researcher would find in our economy using the Campbell-Mankiw

approach.    This section shows that the empirical finding of excess sensitivity

could result from individuals' substitutions between home and market work and

between home and market consumption goods as relative prices and wages rates

change. To show how excess sensitivity arises in our model, we begin by assuming

that the model is true and that the researcher has an infinitely-long time series

on all the variables in the model. Next, we show how the model implications for

                                          28
excess sensitivity change when the researcher continues to have an infinitely-long

sample but has observations on only the conventional variables typically used as

instruments. Finally, we suppose that the researcher is constrained by a finite

sample (of approximately post-war length) and has access to data on the conven-

tional instruments. In all cases, we find that data generated by the household

production model would generate apparent "excess sensitivity" of the magnitude

commonly found in the empirical literature.


A. Large sample, full information results

In this first example, we take as given that the household production model is

correct, and explore the implications of this model for the coefficients ) and 0 when

we suppose that the researcher has an infinitely long sample period and a dataset

that includes all the variables in our model (the details of the computations are

given in the Appendix). In the context of our quantitative equilibrium model,

we can use the model solution to compute the exact conditional expectations

of income growth and the ex-ante interest rate—we do not need to simulate the

model. Given the conditional expectations and covariances, we can then compute

the regression coefficients in eq. (0.22). Our interpretation of these estimates is

that these are the large sample full-information coefficients of \ and 0 implied


                                         29
by our model. Table 2 presents results for benchmark model together with an

extensive sensitivity analysis.

    We begin with the benchmark parameterization. For the trend-stationary

model without transmission of shocks across sectors, this approach yields A =

0.32, 0 = —0.03.    For the difference-stationary case, we obtain A = 0.36, 0 =

0.08.   The model with transmission of shocks across sectors produces A = 0.69,

0    —0.43.   Thus the benchmark model of household production model predicts

that a researcher running the typical consumption growth regression should find

apparent excess sensitivity in the form of a positive coefficient on expected output

growth.

    The positive coefficient on expected output growth derives from the intersec-

toral movement of labor in response to expected productivity differentials. Fur-

ther, the model predicts a coefficient on the interest rate that is close to zero,

especially in the absence of transmission of shocks across sectors, which is in line

with the Campbell-Mankiw results. However, as shown in the simpler model of

section II (see equation (0.13)) the coefficient on the interest rate is not, in gen-

eral, equal to 1/a, which would be 0.50 under our parameterization. Thus a small

value of 0 cannot be interpreted as evidence that consumers are insensitive to

variations in the interest rate.

                                         30
   The sensitivity analysis in Table 2 shows how these results vary with changes

in the parameterization of the model. We begin by exploring the implications

of altering the elasticity of substitution between home and market consumption

goods. Our explanation for apparent excess sensitivity hinges on substitutions

between different goods, so it is important to explore the effects of changing

these elasticities. Experiments 1 and 2 show the effects of a reduced elasticity of

substitution between home and market goods; experiment 3 increases the elasticity

of substitution to the high end of its plausible range. Even with zero elasticity

(experiment 1) there is still apparent excess sensitivity, with A ranging from 0.11

to 0.17. The reason that apparent excess sensitivity arises in this case is that

the consumer still undertakes substitutions between leisure and the consumption

aggregate. Put differently, the aggregate supply of labor (to home and market

sectors together) responds to variations in the real wage. A high elasticity of

substitution leads to increases in A,   as   expected.

   Experiment 4 presents results for a case in which the aggregate labor supply

is fixed (leisure is constant or, equivalently, individuals do not value leisure).

Apparent excess sensitivity arises in this case as well, with values of A ranging

from 0.40 to 0.75. In this case, apparent excess sensitivity stems from the fact that

the consumer substitutes between consumption of the home and market good,

                                             31
even though aggregate labor supply is fixed. Evidently, then, apparent excess

sensitivity will only disappear if market consumption enters the utility function

separably from home production and leisure. Based on the existing empirical

evidence, we view this specification as implausible.

   Experiments 5 and 6 show that variations in risk aversion have little effect on

the excess sensitivity result. Experiment 7 reduces the correlation of the shocks to

the home and market sectors, which tends to increase apparent excess sensitivity

by increasing the scope for substitutions across sectors (there is less tendency

for marginal products in the two sectors to move together). Experiments 8 and

9 illustrate the effect of changing the assumed elasticity of adjustment costs for

capital. Abolishing adjustment costs has little effect on apparent excess sensitivity,

while increasing adjustment costs leads to much higher apparent excess sensitivity.

Finally, experiment 10 shows that apparent excess sensitivity will arise even if

there are no productivity shocks to the household sector—shocks to the market

sector alone are sufficient. Overall, we find that the predictions for the coefficient

on income growth )       are remarkably robust, whereas 0 is      found to be more

sensitive to departures from the baseline model.




                                         32
B. Large sample, limited information estimates

The preceding sub-section showed that the household production model can ex-

plain apparent excess sensitivity, based on the population, or large sample, mo-

ments implied by the baseline parameterizations of the model. However, empirical

research is constrained by the fact that some variables that are important for con-

structing conditional covariances (i.e., some useful instruments) are not available

to the researcher. This sub-section follows standard empirical practice in using

lagged values of consumption, output, and the interest rate as instruments (see

the Appendix for details). That is: we use our model to construct 'instrumented'

versions of z.yt and rt_i,t as linear projections on lagged endogenous variables.6

Following Campbell and Mankiw (1989), we choose the following as our basic in-

strument set: Act_i,         Ac_3, Tt_2,t_1, rt_3,t_2, Tt_4,t_3. In the context of the

model, it is not necessary to instrument rt_i,t because this is a risk-free rate (it

is unrelated to the period t error since it is known at time t-1). However, we

instrument this variable since this procedure is typically followed in the empirical

literature.7

   Table 3 gives the results for the procedures that use lagged observable en-

dogenous variables as instruments. With this procedure, there is no sampling

uncertainty and no small-sample bias. Table 3 shows that, in the stationary case

                                         33
without transmission of cross sectors, the estimates are A = 0.05, 8 = 0.42. In the

nonstationary case without transmission, the estimates are A = 0.30, 8 =       0.43.

(The corresponding coefficients from Table 2 are presented for comparison.) These

coefficient estimates differ from those computed using exact conditional expecta-

tions because the linear projections yield an imperfect measure of the exact con-

ditional expectations which were used in Table 2. With transmission of shocks

across sectors (panel C), the full information procedure yields A = 0.69, 8 = —0.43;

while the limited information procedure yields A = 0.44 and 8 = 0.06.


C. Finite sample, limited information results

To explore the small-sample properties of the procedure which uses a restricted

set of variables as instruments, we followed a Monte-Carlo approach.        Specifi-

cally, we simulated our model to generate time series of length 130 quarters (32.5

years—approximately the length of time studied by prior researchers). Using the

simulated data, we computed the instrumental variables estimates of A and 0 us-

ing the instrument list specified earlier. We performed 1000 such simulations;

the mean estimates of the coefficients are reported in Table 3, together with the

standard deviation of the coefficient estimates across the 1000 simulations. This

table also reports sample means of the partial R2 statistics from the first-stage


                                         34
regressions, which Shea (1996) recommends as the correct measure of instrument

relevance in multivariate settings.

   For the stationary case without transmission of shocks across sectors (Panel A)

the mean values of the coefficients are A = 0.53, 9 —   —0.75,   while the population

values for the model-based variables approach were A =       0.05,   0=   0.42.   Over

1000 trials, the standard deviation of the coefficient on output (A) was 0.15, The

considerable difference between the computed and the simulated coefficient values

is linked to the weak predictability of the regressors and of consumption growth

itself. This can be seen in the low values of the R2 and partial R2 statistics for

the regressions of consumption, output and the interest rate on the instruments.8

   In the nonstationary model without transmission (Panel B) we find similar

results. The average value of the coefficients from the simulated, shorter sample

differ markedly from both the population values for the model-based variables

approach and the coefficients yielded by the exact conditional expectations. There

continue to be low partial R2 statistics for the instrumented variables.

   Looking at the model with transmission of shocks across sectors, we find that

the three groups of coefficients differ less than in the prior two cases due to im-

proved predictability of consumption with this shock process.

   Campbell and Mankiw also report regressions of consumption growth on out-

                                        35
put growth without the interest rate:



                             Ct = L + )Ly + Et     .
                                                                            (0.23)



We explored estimation of eq. (0.23) as a check on the robustness of our estimates

of A; these results are not reported in the paper. In each case, we found that the

values for A obtained from this equation to those obtained when the interest rate

is included.9


D. Implications for testing the PIH

Our results have implications for empirical testing of the PIH.'° In particular, we

have shown that it is inappropriate to test the PIB by looking at the correlation

between market consumption and income growth due to an increase in market

wages. However, tests that involve income growth due to windfalls or changes in

the timing of predictable income receipts should still be valid tests of the PIH.

Tests of this latter sort have been carried out using micro data by lvlatthew D.

Shapiro and Joel Slemrod (1995) who surveyed consumers to determine effects of

the 1992 change in income tax withholding procedures. Nicholas Souleles (1996)

studies the relationship between consumption and the receipt of income tax re-


                                        36
funds. These studies find some evidence of excess sensitivity and thus present an

ongoing challenge to the PIH,

   In the context of our model, a decrease in government purchases acts as a

windfall increase in consumer disposable income that is unrelated to wages. We

used our model to study an unexpected, purely temporary decrease in government

purchases." The excess sensitivity coefficient is A =    —0.0175   for this type of

shock (using the model's exact conditional expectation). The intuition behind

the finding of a slight negative dependence of consumption growth on windfall

growth in disposable market income is as follows. The decrease in government

purchases increases households' wealth. Leisure rises, as does consumption of the

home good. Consumption of the market good increases, while labor input to the

market sector falls. Thus, we have a natural mechanism leading to a negative

correlation between labor income and market consumption. This suggests that

an alternative approach to testing the PIH would be to determine the effect on

consumption of changes in government spending on goods and services that do

not affect individual utility (or affect it only additively) and which do not affect

labor productivity.

V. Summary and conclusions

This paper has shown that a macro model with household production can ra-

tionalize the observed "excess sensitivity" of consumption growth to predictable

output growth. Our story is based on the idea that consumers substitute between

home goods and market goods according to their relative price, and substitute

between work at home and work in the market depending on the relative wage.

That consumers and workers do undertake these substitutions has been docu-

mented by Benhabib et al. (1990) Victor Rios-Rull (1990), and F. Thomas Juster

and Frank P. Stafford (1991). Our paper shows that plausible substitutions along

these lines can produce exactly the empirical finding that predictable growth in

market output is correlated with consumption growth. We began by demonstrat-

ing this result within a simple, partial equilibrium model of consumer choice, and

then showed that the result continues to hold within a general equilibrium model

with neoclassical investment dynamics. We explored the implications of the quan-

titative equilibrium model for the empirical estimates that would be obtained by

researchers running the "excess sensitivity regressions" on data generated by our

model. We found that these researchers would find a positive coefficient on output

growth in this regression, which should not be interpreted as excess sensitivity or



                                        38
as a violation of the PIH. Further, we found that the coefficient on the interest

rate is predicted to differ substantially from the inverse of the coefficient of rel-

ative risk aversion, and that this coefficient estimate is particularly sensitive to

choice of instruments and to small sample bias.

   Our story has stressed substitutions of labor effort across sectors depending

on the relative wage rate. It is natural to wonder how things would work if

hours of market work were unrelated to wages or productivity, as in Richard

Rogerson's (1988) "lottery model," or if there were "involuntary unemployment."

Apparent excess sensitivity would still arise in these settings, for the following

reason. Following dismissal from the work force, an individual would have less

market income and more time to allocate to leisure and to household production.

Less market income leads to lower consumption of the market good, while the

increase in the time available for non-market activities would lead to increases in

the consumption of the home good and leisure. Qualitatively, these are the same

effects stressed in our equilibrium model. The only difference is that we would

not expect the value marginal product of labor to be equalized across home and

market sectors in these alternative settings.

   Finally, empirical results obtained in a recent paper by Attanasio and Brown-

ing (1995) can be interpreted as lending support to the household production

                                         39
story. Attanasio and Browning study micro data on consumption and find that

excess sensitivity of consumption to current income disappears once one controls

for variables such as the individual's age, number of children, whether one or both

spouses work, and the amount of labor supplied to the market. These variables

all seem likely to be good proxies for the relative costs and benefits to working in

the market sector and consuming market goods versus working in the home sector

and consuming home-produced goods.

   Overall, our results suggest that it would be premature to abandon the PIH

as a central component of modern macroeconomic models. However, these results

also strengthen the case that understanding substitutions between the household

and market sectors are likely to be central to understanding the behavior of con-

sumption over the business cycle.

1. See, for example, the contributions of Benhabib, Rogerson, and Wright (1991),

Jeremy Greenwood and Zvi Hercowitz (1991), Greenwood et al. (1995), McGrat-

tan et al. (1996), Fabio Canova and Angel Ubide (1997), and John Y. Campbell

and Sydney Ludvigson (1997).

2. This is an example of the type of problem discussed by Peter Garber and

Robert G. King (1983).     It is also possible to generate apparent excess sensi-

tivity through substitutions on the consumption/leisure margin, as in Orazio P.

Attanasio and Martin Browning (1995). We focus on alternative ways of generat-

ing consumption goods through substitution between home and market-generated

consumption, while incorporating standard labor/leisure choice.

3. In fact, the coefficient on expected output growth will be positive even if

is negative, so long as 1 + is positive.

4. Anyone who has found himself eating pizza for the fifth night in a row when

trying to meet a deadline will understand the basic idea here.

5. Adjustment costs are incorporated into our model, in contrast to the model of

Greenwood et al., because they substantially improve the investment behavior of

the model. The importance of adjustment costs for the dynamics of investment


                                       47
in multi-sector environments is discussed in Baxter and Crucini (1993,1995) and

Baxter (1996).

6. One of the puzzles uncovered by Campbell and Mankiw is that the correla-

tion between consumption and predictable income is higher than the correlation

between consumption and raw income. As a result, the OLS estimate of A, which

should in theory be upward biased due to a positive correlation between income

innovations and optimal consumption, turns out to be lower than the IV estimate

of A empirically. This is not the case for our model, as reconciling these results

seems to require measurement error in aggregate income. Our model abstracts

from measurement error.

7. An alternative strategy would be to take an ex-ante uncertain return, such as

the return on capital, so that the IV procedure would actually be necessary. We ex-

perimented with this alternative approach, but it did not lead to significantly dif-

ferent results. We also experimented with alternative instrument sets. For exam-

pie, we used the following instrument set:       /yt—2, Ay_3, rt2,t_1, Tt_3,t_2, rt4,t3.

The results did not change appreciably. Also, many researchers use twice-lagged

instruments to avoid potential problems due to time-averaged consumption data;

for the results reported here we lag the instruments only once. Exploration with

time-averaged model-generated data and twice lagged instruments did not yield

                                        48
different results.

8. As a check on our Monte Carlo procedure, we performed 30 simulations of

length 3000 (750 years) for the stationary model without transmission. The mean

coefficient values that we obtain are A = 0.15, 0 = 0.29. These are much closer

to the large sample, full information coefficients of A   0.05, 0 = 0.42. Thus with

sufficiently long samples, the procedure converges to the large sample, limited

information estimates. A discussion of this econometric issue can be found in

Nelson (1990).

9. An alternative choice for the instruments, Ay_1, Ay2,            leads to similar

conclusions.

10. We are grateful to a referee for pointing out these implications to us and for

suggesting the experiment involving changes in government spending.

11. We specified that shocks to government purchases were i.i.d., and then studied

the response to a decrease in purchases. The steady state share of government

purchases was set at 20% of total output. Results were similar for persistent but

ultimately temporary shocks to government purchases.

App end ix

This appendix explains the methods used to compute the results in Section IV.

The solution to our model can be written as follows. First, the state variables of

the problem evolve according to:



                                  St   Ms_1 + G€                              (Al)


where St   1S an   s x 1 vector of state variables, Et is a k x 1 vector of shocks,

and Al and C are coefficient matrices. The solution to the model is given by

(0.24) together with eq. (0.24) which describe how other variables of interest—

consumption, output, the interest rate, labor input, etc.—depend on the state

vector:

                                       W = Hst                                (A2)


where W is a w x 1 vector and H is a w x s coefficient matrix.

   We use this system to generate the results that a researcher would find if

he were studying data produced by our model economy. Some of the results

are obtained under the assumption that the researcher has an infinite amount

of data on all variables in the model. These results are termed "large-sample,


                                          50
full-information" results. Other results assume an infinite amount of data but

on a limited set of variables. These results are termed "large-sample, limited-

information" results. Finally, we explore Monte-Carlo results based on a sam-

ple length of 130 quarters (approximately the sample length used by prior re-

searchers) using a hmited set of variables. These are called "finite-sample, limited-

information" results.

   The Campbell-Mankiw equation is given below:


                          = t + AE_1y + 9E_1r1_1, + LLj.                        (A3)



   Since the expectations in (0.24) are not observable, Campbell and Mankiw

specify their estimating equation as follows:



                           ct = ,u + AL\y + OTt_it + e                          (A4)



and then use instrumental-variables procedures to try to correct for the simultane-

ity bias that arises because the expectation errors in YL and Vt_it are correlated

with e,.

   As discussed in the text, this equation is mis-specified in the model, since



                                         51
the growth rate of market consumption depends on more variables than income

growth and the interest rate.   Specifically, there are omitted variables in this

regression that are included in the "error term" Et. These omitted variables will

influence the results that would be obtained by a researcher estimating (0.24)

using data generated by the household production model.



A-i. Large sample, full information results

To produce our "large sample, full information" results, we proceed as follows.

First, we work directly with the specification (0.24) since we can use our model

to compute the necessary expectations. Specifically, from (0.24) and (0.24), we

have

                                       = HE1s                               (A5)



                                   =   HMs_1

                                   =   Fst_i.


   Estimates of the coefficients A and 0 are found by solving the least-squares




                                       52
'normal equations':



                      (E_1Ac —             — 9Et_irt_i,t)   E_1y 0           (A6)



                 (E_1c —                — 9E1r_1,) Et_iArt_i,t = 0.          (A7)


   In the context of our model economy, we use equation (0.24) to construct the

expectations in (0.24) and (0.24), where the notation F3 denotes the row of the

matrix F associated with variable, yielding:



                        (Fast_i —   Fs_1 — 6FrSt_i) Fs_1 0                   (A8)



                        (Fast_i —   Fs_i   —
                                               OFrSt_i) FrSt_i   0.          (A9)


   For the "full-information" results, we take the probability limits of (0.24) and

(0.24) as T —p oc to obtain:



                                    —    — OUyr   =0                        (AlO)


                               acr —     — Oarr   =0                        (All)


                                        53
where Ujj denotes the population, or large-sample covariance of variable i with

variable j. Given these covariances, these 2 equations can be solved for the two

unknowns, ,\ and 0.

   It is easiest to see how the moments in (0.24) and (0.24) can be calculated if

we assume that the system is stationary. Let      denote the probability limit of

the variance-covariance matrix of st_i. This variance-covariance matrix can be

computed in a variety of ways for example, by solving the matrix equation =

MM' + E(EE'). We then obtain the following versions of the normal equations:

                               —
                                   .\FF1 — 0FrF'y 0                         (A12)



                        FCF. —               — 0FTF, 0.                     (A13)


These two equations are then solved for the two unknown coefficients, \ and 0,

as reported in Table 2. When the shocks to the state variables are nonstationary

  does not exist. Note, however, that even in the nonstationary case the covari-

ances in (0.24) and (0.24) are still well-defined, as they involve growth rates of

consumption and income as well as the level of the real interest rate, all of which

are stationary.



                                        54
A-2. Large sample, limited information results

In applied econometric contexts, the researcher typically does not have enough

information compute the necessary expectations: in our context, these would

be E_1iy and E_1r_1,. Thus researchers like Campbell and Mankiw use an

instrumental variables procedure which we find convenient to discuss as two-stage-

least-squares. Under this procedure, the variables /yt and rt_i,t are regressed

on instruments, where valid instruments are any variables correlated with

and rt_i,t but are uncorrelated with t in (0.24) and with the expectation errors

(Yt — E_1Ly) and (rt_i,t — Et_irt_i,t).
   We let X denote the n ><       1   vector of date t observations on the instruments.

For compactness, we rewrite (0.24) as



                                         Ac =                                     (A14)



where Z = [1   ,    , rt_i,t]'   and = ) 0]'.       The 'first-stage' regression involves

running an OLS regression of Z on Xt:


                                          =   'X + et.                            (A15)




                                              55
   The 'second-stage' regression involves replacing Z in eq. (0.24) with the fitted

values, Z =          from eq. (0.24). Then the two-stage-least-squares estimator

of /3 is given by:
                                   T          -1 T
                        /2SLS =                                               (A16)
                                  [ z1'zt] [ 2ct]
   As T — 00 the estimator I32SL8 converges in probability to E(t)_1E(2zct).



   We used our model to compute a large sample version of /325L5 as follows. In

the 'first stage' we computed Zt by projecting Z on the instruments X. The X
depend on the state vector as follows:



                                   X = Fxst_i                                 (A17)


through a version of equation (0.24), where (0.24) reflects the fact that, in our ap-

plication the instruments X contain no date-t variables at all. Further, the state

vector St_i must be augmented to include additional lags of the state variables as

necessary, depending on the instrument list employed. The 'first stage' projects

   on X, yielding an estimate of 6; the second stage computes /32SLS according

to (0.24). These estimates are reported in Table 3.




                                         56
A-3. Finite sample, limited information results

To investigate the properties of estimates obtained by researchers constrained to

using a finite amount of data, we employed a Monte Carlo procedure. Specifically,

we generated 1000 simulations of our model, where each simulation was of length

130 quarters. For each simulation, we used the simulated data to construct an

estimate of /2SLS in exactly the same way as Campbell-Mankiw would have, had

their data been generated by our model. The mean estimate of /32SLS over the

Notes:

1.        The equation estimated is zc=M+?                     See the Appendix for the details of the estimation procedure.

2. The case with =10 requires             to be larger in absolute value to insure concavity of momentary utility. We set E = -10 for this case.

1. The equation estimated is zc=M+)                       For the large sample, full information results and the
large sample, partial information results, we used the model solution to directly compute measures of the
expectations in this equation. For the finite sample, partial information results, we simulated the model and
employed standard two-stage-least-squares procedures on the following equation, which replaces expectations
with realizations: /.c=ii+?.                 See the Appendix for the details of the estimation procedure.

2. In the finite sample, limited information case, the simulation results are obtained from 1000 runs with 130
usable data points; numbers in parentheses are standard errors of the coefficient estimates over the 1000 runs.
Time required for 1000 runs on a Pentium Pro 200 Mhz processor was approximately 5 minutes. Instruments for
both limited information cases are Ac1,        cE3, rE21, r32, r43.
3. Partial R2 statistics are described by Shea (1996).
