   TRANSITIONAL DYNAMICS AND ECONOMIC CROWTH IN THE NEOCLASSICAL MODEL


                                        ABS TRACT

    An understanding of the quahtatzve nature of the transitional dynamics of
the fleociasslcal model—the process of convergence from an initial capital
stock to a steady state growth path—is a key part of the shared hnowledge of
most economists.   It forms the basis, for exale, of the widespread interest
in hypotheses about convergence of levels of national economic activity.
Based on several quantitative experiments undertaken in the 1960s with fixed
savings rates versions of the neoclassical model, nary economists further
believe that the transition process can be lengthy, potentially rationalizing
differences in growth rates across countries that are sustained for decades.

    In   this paper,    we undertake a systematic quantitative investigation of
transitional      dynamics within the most widely eloyed versions of the
neoclassical      model with interteorally optimizing households. Lengthy
transitional episodes arise only if there is very low intertemporal
substitution.  But, more important, we find that the silest neoclassical
model inevitably generates a central implication that is traced to the
production technology.  Whenever we try to use it to explain major grooth
episodes the model produces a rate of retu.rm that          is
                                                      counterfactually high
in the early stages of development. For exale, in seeking to account for
U.S—Japan differences in post war growth as a consequence of differences  in
end—of—war capital, we find that the iediate postwar rate of return in
Japan would have had to exceed 5007. per annum.

    Frequently employed variants of the basic neoclassical model—those that
introduce adjustment costs, separate production and consumption sectors, arid
international capital mobility—can potentially sweep this marginal product
implication under the rug. However, such alterations necessarily cause major
discrepancies to arise in other areas. With investment adjustment costs, for
example, the implications resurface in counterfactual variations in Tobin's Q.

    We interpret our results as illustrating two important principles.
First, systematic quantitative investigation of familiar models can provide
surprising new insights into their practical operation. Second, explanation
of sustained cross country differences in growth rates will reqyire departure
from   the familiar neoclassical environment.

     The neocassical model of capital accumulation developed by Solow [1956]

Swan [1963]   ,
                  Cass [1965]   ,   and Koopmans   [1965] is one of the major theoretical

             for dynamic   economic analysis.        It has been the impetus for much
paradis
theoretical research into the behavior of dynamic systems, including

elucidation of such key properties as the local and global turnpike theorems.

In the hands of Solow [1957), Denison [1962) and their followers, the basic

neoclassical model has further provided an empirical framework that has

stimulated important      research into the sources and         nature of economic growth.

     Virtually                             trained in the last two decades is
                   every professional economist
familiar with the central properties and the intuitive mechanics of the basic
neoclassical growth model. The model is so familiar that the reader may be
skeptical that      there is anything new to learn about tt.          In this paper, by

contrast, we take the view that its transition path dynamics are largely

unexplored from a quantitative        standpoint and   that   this exploration is essentla.
to                       the model can plausibly explain major differences in
     understanding whether

rates of economic growth over time and across countries, We examine the

transitional dynamics of the most coon versions of the neoclassical model
for a wide range of parameter values. On this basis, we conclude that—while
some features of the adjustment path toward the steady state are model and

paraineterization specific—there is a key, common counterfactual implication
of all the models examined. An important role for transitional dynamics in
explaining growth over long periods is inconsistent with observed variation
in   interest rates, asset prices and        factor    shares over time and across

countries.

      The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section II, we provide

the specific discrete time version of the basic neoclassical model that we

use throughout the paper, including some discussion of alternative nodes of
                                                                                                     2




saving behavior along the lines of Solow [1956] and              of   the alternative put

forward by Ramsey [1928] , Cass [1965]          ,   and Koopmans [1965]     In   section       III,
we review    key quantitative      analyses    by R. Sato [1963] and Atkinson [1969]
that have led macroecononiststo view transitional dynamics as potentially

very protracted and, hence, as potentially capable of explaining sustained
cross country differences in growth rates.

       In section IV, we provide our basic experiments,           computing the transition

paths that the neoclassical model must follow if it is to explain seven fold

growth in output over a century. This experiment was selected because seven
luckily corresponds to key differences in U.S. history and in the
international cress section. First, it is roughly the ratio of U.S. per

capita real gross domestic product currently to that of a century ago.

Second, in the international cross section of              Suners and Heston      (1984]   ,    it
also corresponds      to the gap between poor countries   the U.S. in 1950.
                                                                and
Thus, we    investigate the quantitative nature of transitional dynamics if
capital     is initially such that output is one seventh of its stationary value.

We find that transitional dynamics            are every   rapid—unless the    intertemporal
elasticity ot     substitution is mscb smaller than the range generally

considered by macroeconomists. Consequently,               the conclusions of our

investigation differ importantly from the traditional view that originates in

Satos (1963]     experiments.
    In computing growth paths under some alternative assumptions about saving

behavior—corresponding          to alternative values of      the intertesporal

substitution elasticity—we find a recurrent puzzle.                Even if transitional

dynamics are    required    to account for only one half of this growth, then                  the
real   rate of return is counterfactuallyhigh             at the beginning of    the century

(about 40 percent per year).          We identify this implication with a basic
                                                                                                 3




characteristic of the production technology in the neoclassical model: there
are major variations in the marginal return to the reproducible factor,

physical capital, if the level of the capital stock is varied over the ranges
we consider.    For this reason, we conduct a detailed investigation of

alternative neoclassical production technologies—varying, for example, the

elasticity of substitution between factors and the steady state factor

shares—and     find   little change in the implications of         our   basic model.       In

section IV.2,   we then    explore   the   robustness   of our result     to   some

alterations in the basic model:            (i)   extensions to distinct technologies for
production   of consumption and capital goods;            (ii)   the   introduction of

adjustment costs;      and (iii)     consideration      of a small open economy facing a


given real interest rate.         These modifications can permit us to overcome the

real interest rate implications,           but they do so only at the cost of producing

some other, related counterfactualbehavior.              For example, with the

introduction of adjustment costs, the link between marginal product of

capital and the real interest rate is weakened.             But the model then implies

counterfactual variation in the relative price of installed capital and nev

investment goods, i.e., Tobins [19693 "q'.

    Overall,    the results suggest that for realistic parameterizations of the

production function there is a very minor role for neoclassical transitional

dynamics in the explanation of observed growth rates.                  In our view, this

pushes one to think       about   models of endogenous economic growth which,

following Schultz [1961)      ,   Uzawa [1965), Romer [1986) and         Lucas   [1988) ,   assign
a larger role to other      des      of accumulation,     such as human     capital   formation

or endogenous technical progress. But the strength of our negative results

also gave us concern that our experiment was too extreme, i.e., that asking

the neoclassical model to explain major portions of U.S. growth over the                      last
                                                                                                 4




century gas just too mach of a task.           (Although,   it is only fair to point out

that, when we presented results on models of endogenous economic growth, many

people suggested that        the transitional dynamics of the neoclassical model

were central to (i) explaining U.S. growth in this century or (ii) sustained

cross country differences in growth rates.)            For this reason, we decided to

additionally consider a more restricted experiment suggested by Barro's

E1987] discussion of the neoclassical models content for understanding

differential growth experiences for countries during the post World War II

interval.     This corresponds to the idea that for 'losing countries,               the 1950

levels of output per capita can be used to identify the war induced decline

in physical capital stocks.          For   exale,   during 1950—1980, Germany moved

from a per capita output of 45% of the U.S. to 88% and Japan moved from                  19'/.



to 74%.     In these growth experiences,       in which we take the       US.   as defining

the growth of the "technical frontier",          we find that there continue to be

major counterfactual implications of the basic neoclassical model:                  if all

Japanese capital accuntulation was to be financed by domestic saving, then its

1950 interest rate should have been nearly 500% in this alternative

experiment. These extreme predictions for the real interest rate are also

present under the assumption,         implicit in descriptions of the convergence

hypothesis       such as Baumol [1986] and    DeLong [1988)   ,   that   technological

progress    is   embodied.   A   final section provides some conclusions.

I.     The Basic leoclassical Model

       In    this section, we        set     out the basic neoclassical model of capital

accumulation that will be used in our                     analysis.       With minor modifications,

the model is that of Solow [1956] translated to discrete time.                                At the hear

of the model is a constant returns—to—scaleaggregate production function,



       (1)          =
                         F(K.    NXt).


where          is conodity output,             K   is physical capital,               is labor      input (in
man hours)          and.       is a measure of labor productivity. Holding fixed                         and.


       the production function has the familiar form displayed in Figure lÀ,

with positive and              diminishing returns        to the reproducible factor K.                This

                                                                                                       has the

               form displayed
    In introducing technical change into the production function (1), we ha7e

expressed it in labor augmenting form so as to admit steady—state growth whsn
technical change and labor input grow at constant rates. (See Swan [1963]
and    Phelps [1966]). This requirement is                    interpretable in two ways.               First,

if    we have a general constant returns to                   scale   production function, then            we

must                                 that    only labor     augmenting     change     is present.       Second,
        literally          require

if the production function is Cobb—Douglas                            =                                 with

0 <    a<     1, then we can always express all forms                     of   technical change in a

labor augmenting form by       defining X =                                    X1(t_a)/a.

Further,       in a steady state many key ratios—such as                 consumption's     share of

output or labor's income share—are constant since numerator and denotninator

variables have equal growth rates.

      Savings Behavior.          We    study   the model    under two alternative assumptions

about savings behavior.                 The first is Solow's E1956] assumption that saving

                           is a fixed fraction of income,           -

(net investment)

    Our second specification is the Ramsey—Cass---Koopmans assumption that

saving is an outcome of optimal consumption choices by an iortal family.

In    the most of the current paper, as in the bulk of the growth literature, we

abstract from consideration of choice of labor supply, assuming that each

for two general reasons.                   First, there is steady state growth associated with

growth in productivity and population. Second, there is transitional growth
associated with movement from an initial capital stock toward the steady

state growth path.           For example, under Solows [1956] assumption of a fixed

savings    rate with zero depreciation, then             the dynamics of accumulation are

given   by


                  —
    (10)            Kt = SF(Kt, nItX).


Grovth    relative to the steady state path is then given by

                               From any initial value of       k,    this difference equation

converges monotonically to a unique stationary value satisfying (7xN_1)k* =
             as demonstrated in       Solow     [1956], but this general property leaves

open the issue of the rapidity of this transitional growth.

    Since along the steady state per capita output grows at rate

cross—country differences in growth rates can only be                    explained if we

assume that they are the result of different rates of technical progress.                             It

is now widely recognized that this explanation is vacuous.                        If the

neoclassical model is to help us understand more than why consumption,

investment and output move together along a growth path, the model's

transitional dynamics have to play an important role in explaining

cross—country growth differences.

    In the sections below we refer to the fraction of growth explained by

transitional dynamics which we define as                                     —                where

III.     Traditional Views of Transitional Dynamics

       In   this   section, we discuss the conventional perspective on the

quantitative importance of transitional dynamics.             We begin by describing

several key quantitative experiments with the neoclassical model that were

performed in       the   1960s which indicated that these dynamics could be very

protracted. Then, we discuss the potential magnitude of             transitional
dynamics      that is indicated       by looking at cross country and within country
economic growth. Finally,             we consider this issue from the perspective of

"growth accounting" that originates in the research of            Solow t1957] and

Denison [1962)



111.1 The Sato—Ltkinson Experiments
       If the neoclassical       model    is to be used as a description of actual growth
experiences, then         one   is   naturally led to ask what portion of observed growth
is attributable to steady state mechanics—population and productivity—and

what portion is attributable to transitional dynamics,            i.e.,   growth relative

to   the steady state.
       Two key quantitative experiments by R. Sato [1963] and Atkinson [1969]

demonstrated that the neoclassical model's transitional dynamics may exhibit

very slow adjustment toward the steady state path and hence be responsible
for a significant fraction of the observed expansion in per capita output.

       Working with the Cobb—Douglas production function and a fixed savings
rate,       Sato [1963] showed that there could plausibly be a very long adjustment

period in response to a fiscal policy induced shift in the savings rate.

Using parameters drawn from U.S. time series, Sato concluded that "for a 10

percent      adjustment    (in capital) 4 years must pass; for a    50   percent
                                                                                         11




adjustment. 30 years; for a 70 percent adjustment, 50 years; and for a ninety

percent adjustment. 100 years."3

       Figure 2 provides our version of Sato's [1963] experiment.          Rather than

concentrate on a shift in the savings rate, we assume that the capital stock

is such that output is 50 percent below the steady path in the initial

            We assume that   a   =   2/3,   which is a conventional value for labor's
period.

share; that the savings rate is 12 percent; that the depreciation rate is 10

percent; that the growth rate of labor is 1.5 percent; and that the growth
rate of labor augmenting technical change is 2 percent.              (These parameter

values conform to those employed by Sato [1963]).             We study the transformed

economy with    k=K/O4Xt); ytYtI(MX);               etc.   Further, we express all

variables as a percentage of steady state values.

       In Figure 2, we see that the adjustment process is indeed very lengthy,

with transitional dynamics that correspond reasonably closely to those

described by Sate [1963] in the sentences quoted above, even though there are

some differences in the details of our experiments3.

       Atkinson's [1969] experiments        involved a model that admitted capital

augmenting technical change, so that the asymptotic share of capital would be

driven to zero    and   no steady state growth path existed.        Atkinson showed that

the model might never—the—less be consistent with the observed small



2Folloving Solov [1956], Ryuzo Sato worked with a model without depreciation
and his results were critiqued by Kazuo Sato [1966], who showed that adoption
of the saving specification 1 =       resulted in the dramatically faster
transition paths when depreciation was introduced.   However, Kazuo Satos
results were much the same as Ryuzo Sato's when the saving specification was
(7).  For this reason, the basic lesson from the results of the two Satos
experiments was that plausible versions of the Solow model could generate
transitional dynamics that were very protracted.
3His derivations were in continuous time and ours are in discrete time; we
incorporate depreciation and use the savings function (7) rather than
omitting depreciation.
                                                                                      12




vements      in the share of capital over one hundred year periods.        Thus,

constancy    of these factor shares alone could not be used to judge the

adequacy of models of technical change and accumulation.

      T&xen together, the Sato and Atkinson experiments have been viewed as

suggesting that the steady state need not be the full story about the growth
of   nations and, as well, that transitional dymanics      could be a key component

of   observed growth experiences (see,    for instance,   Summers (1978] , page    23)


111.2 The Convergence Implication
      Even   if the process of   convergence   is relatively slow, the neoclassical
del does have the implication that convergence should ultimately occur and
the Sato experiments suggest that one should be able to detect this process
with several decades of economic data. That is, other things equal,
countries which begin with a relatively low capital and, hence, low income,
should initially grow faster. One specific device for testing this
implication of the model is shown in Figure 3, which plots the level of real

output   per capita   in 1950 versus the subsequent growth rate over the

remainder of the postwar period for the countries included        in the   Suimners   and

Heston (1984] data set.      Contrary to the convergence prediction, we see in

Figure 3 little tendency for a low initial level of income (in 1960) to be

followed by high rates of expansion over the subsequent two decades.

      This fact is often taken to be a strong refutation of the neoclassical

model but we are skeptical about relying on it in a world with potential

heterogeneity in production possibilities,         preferences and public policies.

The basis for our skepticism can be illustrated by using a version of the

Solow (1956] model     that incorporates heterogeneity     by adding a country
superscript    j and    specializing the production function to the               Cobb—Douglas

form.    Solow's difference equation then               takes the form:



                                            1—a          a
                    —        =
      (12)
                                 s A     Kt (N1X)

The   implied dynamics of transformed capital are:


                                  =    s.

     In this simple application of the Solow model,                  there is potential

heterogeneity in initial conditions                     >    and terminal   conditions     (k) .    A

country may be growing fast either because it has a low                     k     or because it

has a high    k.    Thus, it is possible for levels and growth rates to be

roughly uncorrelated as in Figure 3.                 That is, we have an identtfication

problem of the same general form that arises when both the demand and supply

curves   shift, so that prices and quantities                 can easily become roughly

uncorrelated.



111.3 Perspectives From Growth Accounting
      Following    the lead of        Solow     [19573 and Denison   [19621 , a   basic
macroeconomic accounting framework has been used to                   attempt to account for
differences    in economic growth across time and across countries,                       The net

result of the early growth             accounting studies       was to (i) stress the

difficulty of raising the growth rate of final output by raising the rate of

physical capital accumulation, since a one percentage point change in the
growth rate of capital translates to only a (1—ck) percentage change in the
gro"th rate of output; and (ii) to generally emphasize the importance of the
"residual factor" in explaining growth (for example, Solow [1957] estimated
that only one eighth of US. economic growth over 1909 through 1949 was due
to physical capital accumulation). Since the transitional dynamics of the

neoclassical   del revolve around the     accumulation          of physical capital, these

findings might suggest a minor role for this factor in the growth process.

    But the growth accounting investigations that followed Solos               [1957]

proceeded to make this line of argument more tenuous.                These investigations

generally assign a much more important role to capital accumulation (a survey
of these results can be found in Maddison [1987])           .   In   a recent and

comprehensive volume, Jorgenson, Gollop and Fraumeni [1987] conclude that

"growth in capital input is the most important source of growth in value

added, growth in labor input is the next most important source, and

productivity growth is the least important."             In particular, these authors

estimated that capital   inp'ut   accounts for   46'!.   of growth in aggregate output

over 1948—1979,   during which the average rate of growth per annum was 3.42.

    For this reason, we believe that one cannot understand the properties of

the basic neoclassical model without undertaking a detailed quantitative

evaluation of its properties when its parameters are restricted by empirical

evidence.
                                                                                                   15




IV.   Transitional Dynaics of       Quantities     and Prices

      The modern version of Satos [1963) experiment that we wish to conduct

involves consideration of the dynamic path arising with a particular

specification of preferences over time.                That is, we    are     interested in the

character of outcomes when saving behavior is altered from the Solow [1956]

form to that     ilied by      optimal choices of consumption over time, as in

Ramsey [1928]    ,   Cass [1965] and Koopmans [1965]

      Since we   are   interested in   considering solution paths that arise from
intertemporal optimization, we         must consider how the capital stock and its

marginal value (shadow price) evolve through time, as                  is     familiar from
textbook presentations of optimal accumulation (see,                  e.g.. Phelps [1966,

essay 3) or Burnieister and Dobell [1970, chapter 11]).                       However, since we

are working in discrete time, we are led to a system of difference equations

in the capital stock and shadow price.             Because preferences are concave               and

technology is convex in        the models   we   consider,      there is a unique corrtpatitlve

and optimal path for the economy.           This path occurs when we select the

unique,   initial value of the      shadow price for which the solution path

satisfies the transversality condition and, hence, capital converges to the
steady state path. In appendix A, we review the familiar numerical solution
methods that we apply to produce our results.



11.1 Perfect Foresight Transitional Dynamics

      Our procedure      in studying the transitional        dynamics under        perfect
foresight is as follows. First,          we restrict      the    production      function   to

Cobb-Douglas     form,   Y      A(K)l_0(n.XM)a. Then, we normalize the level
parameter   A to unity       and choose the labors share parameter a to be 2/3, which

accords with     the estimates reported in Naddison [1987, table 8] and is
otherwise        a conventional value.      Second, we choose a constant value of per

capita hours devoted to work,             n.2,    a selection which accords with the post

World War        II U.S.   exnerience.4    Third, we select the depreciation rate =.i0

which is in the range reported by Naddison £1987, table 71                    .   Fourth,   we

require that the steady state real interest rate be                 6.5'!,   percent per annum,

which corresponds to the annual average real                 retu to    equity for the post

war   US.        Fifth, we set the growth rate of population to              1.47.   per year, which

is its average value for the U.S. in the period 1950—1980 (see Barro                        [1987],
page 296)    .    Given other parameters of           the problem, this implies a value of

the discount factor          .
      A key determtnant of the characteristics of solution paths is the

preference parameter c, which controls the intertenporal substitution of per

capita consumption. In the baseline experiment, we set c to unity and then

we experiment with smaller elasticities of intertemporal substitution

indicated by Hall £19881         ,   raising      to ten.5

      Choice of initial conditions and of the growth rate of exogenous

technical progress are obviously central determinants of solution paths.                         To

choose the initial level of the capital stock we simply require that per

capita output in the initial period, t=0, be one seventh of its steady state

level:
            F(k0,1)/[F(k*,1)(75]               1/7.   mis    requirement allows us to compute

Household Survey published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
5This value of   implies that if 17<1, in order for the steady state real
interest rate to be 6.5'!., has to be greater than one. Values of     greater
than one are admissible since, in the optimizing model described in section
II, the condition that is necessary for finiteness of utility is                'y <        7

with fi > 1.

the initial capital to labor in efficiency units ratio, k, as a function of

its steady state value (which in turn is determined by the production

function,        the rate of steady state growth, the rate of time preference, and

the depreciation rate)               The initial capital stock, K0 is then given by    =
                                                                                    K0
k0nX 00
      N

       I.n all   the    parameterizatidns     of the    basic model described below we choose

the growth rate of technical progress so that, if there were no transitional

dynamics,        the    economy would experience half of the expansion in per capital

output that occurred in             the US.   during the period 1870 to 1970.      This   yields
a   value of      'y1
                        of   L0114 which    is the solution to the equation          =     +

6/2.
       Figure 4 provides basic information about the transitional dynamics of

the neoclassical model when momentary utility is logarithmic (o1).                       Its six


panels depict the variations in output, consumption, investment, share of
output devoted to gross investment, growth rate of output, and real interest
rate.      All variables are         expressed in      per capita terms.   Output, consumption
and    investment were deflated by           X and their steady state value was
normalized        to one. Notable implications of these trajectories are as
follows.         First, consution displays             an increasing level and diminishing

growth     rate, as          is familiar from analytical results    with constant elasticity
utility      specifications.          Second, there are three results that are less

expected.         The pace of convergence is very rapid, one half of the gap between

the initial level of output and its stationary value is eliminated in about




This calculation implicitly assumes that all transitional gro"th takes place
within the first century. This is an approximation since, in effect, these
dynamics are infinitely lived. However, since their effect after the initial
one hundred years is negligible, this approximation is of no consequence.
sixyears: rates of economic growth are very rapid early on and then are
sharply reduced. Investment displays a "hump shaped trajectory, which would
not   be picked up by local approximationsaround the steady state.           Finally,

the   ilied     value of the real interest rate at the beginning of the century

of economic growth is very high, approximately 40Y, per year.         This feature

reflects the diminishing returns to reproducible factors that is a key

feature of the neoclassical del.        As we shall see, counterfactual

implications for the marginal product of capital are a necessary implication

of the model if its transitional dynamics are asked to explain major

components of economic growth.
      The pace of transitional dynamics can be slowed considerably if we reduce

the intertemporal substitutabilityof consumption (1Io)         .
                                                                   Figure   5 describes

the transitional dynamics associated with a value of o-=1O which is among the

lower estimates obtained by Hall t1988]     .   This   decrease in the degree of

intertemporal substitution changes the sign of the slope of the investment

path, as would be predicted by the local dynamics of the model around the

steady state.      It also makes the growth process much more protracted—the

half life is 24 years instead of 6 as we obtained when c=1.          But, when we

reduce intertemporal substitutabilityand increase the duration of

transitional dynamics, we      also increase the interval    over which there are

very high levels of the real interest rate.

      Ta.ken together, these two experiments demonstrate     that a plausible

reparameterization of the neoclassical model        sily    shifts the key

difficulty—diminisbing marginal producivity—to another area.            We   will
repeatedly encounter      this theme as we proceed through this section.       -



      The   third parameterization, studied in Figure 6,    modifies momentary

            to be of a   Stone—Geary form: u(C/M)                    — C), whereC
utility                                                  logC(C/X)
denotes the subsistence level of per capita consumption. With this

specification of preferences the elasticity of intertemporal substitution ls
                            and   thus   is no longer     constant.
     In   this   model,    there is an    unstable   steady state at the level of

sustainable capital stock compatible with C.                 This     low level steady state

resembles somewhat         the "poverty trap" familiar from the development
literature.       That    is,
                        despite the good investment opportunitIes the country
does   not invest because production is barely enough to attend to subsistence
consunpticn and to the replacement of the depreciated capital stock. In the
parameterization examined, we chose C to be 907, of production in period zero.
The growth       rate of   output for    this   economy   displays    a "hump shaped" path

which resembles       the evolution of      Japan    after World    War II   (see Figure 11) as
well   as descriptive accounts of          the   growth process suggested by development

economists.        The reason for this pattern of evolution is that the elastlcity

of   intertemporal       substitution is variable, declining from an initial value of

1/60   to its steady state value of 1.              Altering preferences to produce more

protracted transitional dynamics generates a longer period with high real

interest    rates    in initial stages of development than those associated with

the baseline       scenario.
       Figure    7 displays the dynamics associated with a version of the basic

model in which physical capitals share is 1/2, which we think is a plausible

upper bound, Transitional dynamics are more persistent relative to the

baseline model but real interest rates, though lower, are still high in the

early stages.        This parameterizationmakes clear that to generate protracted

transitional dynamics that are consistent with moderate values for the real

interest rate we need to postulate a share of capital that is close to one,

so that the production function comes close to being constant returns in the
factor that can be accumulated. But a capital share close to one is
courterfactual, if we maintain that capital earns anything close to a
competitive factor share.
      The   con result of the preceding              experinents is that the real interest
rate    is very       high in    the   early stages of development, if we require
transitional          dya.mics    to   explain half of the growth in per capita output that
occuired in       the    1870—1970      period.    In the next section, we     explore the
sensitivity of this result to the details                  of our   experiment.

      When technology        is Cobb—Douglas there is a simple relation between the

interest   rate and the couxiterfactual behavior of the capital—outputratio                       are

two   sides of the same coin, we choose to emphasize the real interest rate
implications          for two reasons:       (i) the information available about

capital—labor ratios is restricted to few countries and short                     time periods;
and    (ii) there       are substantial      measurement   problems associated with       the
capital     stock data.



11.2 The       Real   Interest Rate      an Technolo
      One   can   extract    valuable information about the behavior of the real
interest rate in the neoclassical       without specifying preferences,
                                                  model

simply by utilizing the implications of the production function for the level
of output and for the marginal product of capital. In this section, we
explore these         implications. Since the coutations discussed here are
                                                                                                    21




independent of the rate of population growth we treat population as constant

throughout this section.

    Our    procedure is    as follows     W require that there is               a tine invariant

production function of the form,          Y = F(K0,nX), where          y ow              is   the

rate of growth of technical change.          In a steady    state,     we           that the

marginal product     of capital   ist     satisfy [DiF(K.nX)           —   61     r*,   where   r   is

the steady state rate of interest,          This defines a steady state path of

capital or, equivalently,       a level of K/(nXt).        With given values for X0,

r, 5, then,    we   can           level of K0 that is compatible with outp
                          determine the

growing 7 fold over 100 years. Then substituted into the marginal product
schedule, the capital stock K0 implies a value of the initial real interest
rate r0.     Throughout this section, we report results based solely on

technology which are calculated in this manner.
    Table lÀ suarizes the predicted values for r0 under difterent

hypotheses for the growth rate of exogenous technical progress. These
hypotheses range from that displayed in the first row, in which all of growth

is attributed to technical change and none to transition path dynamics, to

that shown in the last row, in which all of the growth is attributed to

transition path dynamics.         Naturally, the value of the real interest rate in

the beginning of the period is lower when a smaller fraction of growth is

associated with transitional dynamics.          Further,    if   all       of the growth is

attributed to technical change, so that there are no transitional dynamics,

the rate    of interest is the same in the beginning and in the end of the

period.

    The first    colun of     Table lÀ is devoted to the baseline model which has

the technology we described in the last section.             The computation of the real

interest rate in the last line of this column (the case of no technical

progress)    is depicted in Figure       1.    Colus   2, 4 and 5 consider perturbations

of    this baseline scenario which involve different rates of depreciation,

capital shares and terminal real interest rates.                In Colui 3 per capita

end of the period, so as          to reflect the decrease in hours      devoted    to market
Cork occurred in        the last century (see Maddison     £1987] ,   table A—9)
      Table IA   makes clear that the tension that we identified in the last

section carries over to a wide range of experiments with Cobb—Douglas

technologies:       transitional dynamics cannot account for a large fraction of

the           in output without generating ilausible values for the real
       expansion
interest rate in the beginning of the period. In order for all the output
expansion to be associated with transitional dynamics the real interest rate
one    century ago    should have been higher than     1O0'/,   unless we postulate an

ilausibly high share of capital in production.
      Table 18 explores a variation of the baseline model in which the

elasticities of substitution in production are different from the unitary

elasticity ilied by the Cobb—Douglas production function. All economies

have a CES production function with elasticity of substitution p and the same

terminal capital stock, KT = 100.             The remaining two parameters of the

production function are chosen so that rT is           6,57.    and the share of capital in

output at tine      T   is 1/3.   This ensures that at time T all the economies have




7Looking   first at Figure lB we
                               can find K, the steady state capital stock by

searching for the value of K that has associated a marginal product of r*+ 5.
We can then use Figure lÀ to determine
                                       K0 the level of capital that implies
that production is seven times smaller than at the steady state. Going back
to Figure lB we can find the marginal product of capital associated with K0,
which is roughy 800%.
                                                                                              23




the same capital stock, real interest rate,            production and       capital share but
different elasticities of substitution.
      With non—unitary elasticity        of substitution in production the capital

share is no longer constant over time when the economy is not following a

steady state path.        It decreases    over tine when p <     I   and   it increases for
p >   1.   Table 25 indicates that varying the elasticity of factor substitution

away from one moderates in some cases the predicted values for r0—with no

exogenous productivity growth the value of r0 associated with p = .5                 is
111.6,     roughly seven tines smaller than that associated with Cobb—Dougas

production.S      However, the values of r0        continue to   be extremely high      in lIght
of the historical evidence when          the role of transition dynamics is


significant.     Furthermore, varying the elasticity of substitution generates

ilausible ilications for the evaluation of the                  share of capital in

production (for instance, with p =          .5   the share of capital decreases by

roughly 3 fold over the course of a century)




An estimate
         of the        elasticity of substitution,        p =    .6,   is provided by   Lucas
[1967)
GOne might expect that with       elasticities
                                         of substitution lower than one the
value of r0 would be higher than that associated with Cobb—Douglas
production.  This    is
                     not necessarily true as the last line of Table 15
shows—without technological progress, a decrease in the elasticity of
substitution from .9 to .5 actually decreases r0. Wheu we lower p the value
of    (associated with a seven fold increase in output) incre,ses. If the
marginal product schedule were independent of p this would lead to a decrease
in the real interest rate. But the marginal product schedule is shifted by
the decrease in p so that the value of r may increase, decrease, or remain
the same depending on the combination of these two effects.

IV.3    Historical Evidence   on Interest Rate Movements

      The behavior of    the real interest rate over the course of recent history

is inconsistent with a major role for neoclassical transitional dynamics.

Rough constancy of the real interest rate over tine is one of the stylized

facts of economic growth (see Kaldor [1961]        ,    Solow [1970]    and Romer [1988]

for   discussions).1°    We present two tables that may       aid the   reader in
                                                                         thinking
about the range of variation. The first      provides information on the behavior
of alternative rate of return constructs for the U.S. over              1926-1987 drawn

from    Ibbotson and Sinquefeld [1988] .   Table       2 shows that there are major

differences across returns on assets of varying risk, but that there are

relatively minor differences across time.      The second set of information is

drawn    from Homer   [1963], providing long period evidence on movements in         real
interest rates, beginning with the 13th century.            This table is provided

since there is nothing necessary about the identificationof a 100 year

period of transitional growth with the last 100 years of U.S. history. This
evidence    needs   to be interpreted with caution, the rates of return in Table           3
were constructed to be the closest possible analog to todays prime rate,
but are nominal rates and correspond to an extremely diverse set of assets.

Nevertheless, it remains iossible to find the magnitude of interest rate
variation that is suggested by the results of the last two sections.




'0This   constancy led Cohen and Hica.n    [1987]—in their version of the
neoclassical    growth sdel—to    postulate that  entrepreneurs seek to earn a
constant    real rate of   return rather than to maximize profit.

V. Robustness of the Results of the Basic           Experiments
     In   this section, we consider whether our        basic result—which suggests a
madest    role for   the neoclassical models transitional dynamics—is robust when

we alter the basic model in several ways that are relatively standard in
applied research in macroeconomics. First, we consider differentiating
between production technologies for the production of             physical capital and
consurmtion    goods.    Second,      we consider the introduction of investment

adjustment costs, so that the marginal product of installed capital need              r.ot


equal the real interest rate.           Third, we   consider   a small open economy

version of the neoclassical modeli



1.1 The leoclassical Two Sector Model

     One might think that the results of the experiments above are peculiar to

the one—sector nature of the model.           Figuie 8 sheds light on this conjecture.
It            the adjustment path for a two—sector model in which both
     surmarizes

production functions are Cobb—Douglas with level parameters normalized to

one The labor share in the capital sector is taken to be .5. The labor
share in the consumption sector was chosen so that, along the steady state
path, the aggregate share of labor is 2/3 (this ilies a labor share for the
consumption industry of 727.). The remaining parameters coincide with those
of the baseline model. The initial capital stock was chosen, as before, so




"Another    con version of the neoclassical model involves making labor
supply endogenous. We did not pursue this alteration of the model since the
near—steady—state dynamics studied in King, Plosser and Rebelo (1958)
indicate that, for standard preferences, when capital is below its steady
state value, labor supply is greater than in the steady state, leading to
higher values of the real interest rate than those for the exogenous labor
supply dels that        we   study.
                                                                                         26




that output increases by seven fold over the period considered.'2           The dynamics

of this economy are remarkably        similar   to those of the comparable one sector

del described in Figure 4.          Separating out the capital sector and making

its production function more linear in capital still           generates implausible
values     for r0.   In order to obtain empirically plausible values for      r,   one

has to postulate that the share       of capital in   the   production function of the

capital sector is close to one.

V.2    Imvestment Adjustment Costs

      Costs of changing the capital stock are another potential avenue for

eliminating the counterfactual implications for the behavior of the real

interest     rate,   We   consider below a version of the neoclassical model with

adjustment costs similar to the one developed by Abel and Bla.nchard [1985]
To preview the results of this investigation, it is true that if one freely

chooses     the adjustment cost function, then     one can   overturn the implication
for   the beginning of period real interest rates.          But there are then other

undesirable implications. Moreover,         we would like to employ adjustment cost

functions     that are empirically reasonable on other grounds. For this
purpose,     we draw on work by Hayashi [1982] that develops the connection

between     adjustment costs and Tobins q—the       ratio of stock market valuation of

existing capital to its replacement cost.          We conclude that one can   only
overturn the     implication of implausibly high interest rates at the cost of

generating counterfactual values for Tobin's         q.   That is, initial period q



'2The value of
                  K0 was found by trial and error.        It

falls well outside the range of values that have been                      timated in the

literature on enirical investment equations.

   The introduction of adjustment costs requires that                     we   alter the resource
constraints of the neoclassical model as follows

In the   standard model, one           unit of investment     increases the capital        stock by
one additional unit.         No's it     is    necessary to   invest 1 +

                        where Dh(.) denotes the derivative of b(.).
(ZjK1)Dh(Z/K),
   The adjustment cost function                 b(.)   is assumed to be homogeneous of degree

zero in Z and K.        As Hayashi [1982] has shown, this makes the theory

operational since it allows us               to determine Tobins      marginal q by measuring

average q.     We assume that b(s)              0 and Dh(â)        0, so that the steady state

capital stock is    not     affected by the introduction of             adjustment    costs.
Without    this assution the adjustment costs economy would have a lower

steady state capital stock than the coarable standard                      del.       This would

contribute to an    increase          in r0.     To make   clear   that our    conclusions do   not


hinge on    this effect,     weto eliminate it.
                                     chose

    Finally, we postulate that both the adjustment costs and the total cost
of investing are increasing: Db(.) 0, and 2Db(Z/K)) + (Z1/K)D2b(Z/K)                                   >


0, where D2b(.) denotes the second derivative of h(.).

     D1F(.) denotes the            partial derivative of F(.) with respect to its first

      The consideration of adjustment costs introduces two conflicting effects
on the real interest rate. First, the fact that the cost of increasing

capital by an extra unit           is    now higher than one
                                                                           (q1       1 +
                                                                                           h(Z/K) +
                                        1 ) lovers the real interest rate relative to the

non—adjustment cost case.               Second,    the fact that an additional unit                  of
capital lowers adjustment costs
                                ((Zt/Kt)2Dh(Zt/Kt)
                                                    0 ) contributes to a

higher value of the real interest rate. Equation (17) makes clear that by

values of    the   real interest rate can               only   be    obtained by      introducing

adjustment costs that imply large values of                         q.

      Suers    (1981] showed that when h(.) takes                         the   functional form (18), the

     Withthese parameter values in hand we can study the models implications
for the behavior of real interest rate. Figure 9 summarizes the transitiona.
dynamics of a version of the baseline model in which we introduced the form
of adjustment costs described above. While the introduction of adjustment
costs moderates the implications of the model for          r,
                                                     it does so by
simultaneously generating implausibly high          values for Tobins q.    The average

value of    q   in the first five years of the simulation is 3.2.       This value is

well outside the range of values for q estimated in the investment literature

(the highest value of      q   reported by Summers for the period 1933—1978 is

barely above 2)

     The conclusion that low values of
                                               r0 can only be obtained by   postulating
empirically unacceptable adjustment costs is independent of the connection
between adjustment costs and Tobins q which we used to organize our

discussion.      To demonstrate the implausibility of      the   adjustment costs that

underlie Figure 9 it is sufficient to cite the fact that they imply that—at

tine zero—the marginal adjustment costs associated with increasing installed

capital by one unit axe        equal   to 3.4 units of output.



1.3 11ications for A Small Open Economy

     The   numerical results reported so far have been interpreted using the
neoclassical del       as a model of a closed economy or alternatively of the

world as a whole.      Taken together, the versions of the model considered

involved    implausibly high    real interest rates for the beginning of this

century.     Alternatively, one might view the neoclassical model as predicting
how the real interest rates should be related to the level of development in
the absence of international capital markets.        Under this interpretation

        becomes the differential between the rate of     return to     capital in
r0_r*
developed and    underdeveloped    countries predicted by the model.     Assuming that

the same technology is available in all parts of the world, the interest rate

associated with poor countries       is given by the last line of Table lA.        For

the baseline model this interest rate is 798.5X,       ilying       an interest rate

differential between the U.S and these countries of 798.5             .S=7927,    This

differential is so large that it is hard to believe that investment flows

from rich to poor countries would not take place, even taking into account

such factors as political risk, transaction costs, etc.

     In fact, in the standard open economy neoclassical view, capital flows

could instantaneously equalize the rate of return in all countries so the

process of adjustment would be instantaneous.        Again, one might think that

introducing adjustment costs would eliminate this unrealistic irplication by

creating a wedge between the marginal product of capital and the real rate of
return to capital. In other words, making the cost of investment increasing
in the rate of expansion of the capital stock might potentially smooth out
the floe of investment from rich to poor countries       so   that the transition
period   might be very long.      Table 4 sussnarizes the transition path of an

economy with adjustment costs identical to the one that underlies Figure 9

but that can borrow and lend in the international capital market at              the rate
of   6.5% per   year. The growth rates reported    in this Table correspond to the

case of   no technical progress.      They can be corrected for the presence of

technical progress by computing        '7'
                                                      where   'y   is the rate reported

in   the Table and     the corrected   rate.
    This Table shows that, even with adjustment costs that imply values for
Tobin's q greater than 20, the model still predicts a fast process of
convergence—the average growth     rate of output   in the first five years is     13/.


per annum.    This leads us to conclude that it is not possible to     attribute an
iortant      role to transitional dynamics in accounting for the expansion    of
per   capita income observed in the last century.    On the basis of the

neoclassical    del,   we cannot reconcile the presence of (possibly    ierfect)
international capital markets, with the absence of a very rapid process of

cross—<ountry convergence.

VI.    A    Case Study: Ecomoic Growth Alter World War         II
      The   eirical power of economic     theory is at times best tested by looking
at    the response to major   events which put     into the background other factors

than   those that one   is primarily interested in investigating.         For example,
Cager [1956]       Sargent [1986] and   many   others have used interwar
hyperinflations to study aspects of the dpamic relation between money and
inflation; Bano [1981,1987], Ahmed [1986], Wynne [1987] and others have used
wartime experiences to develop interteoral substitution ilications of
equilibrium naoroeoonomio madels. For economic growth, the post World War                II
experiences of developed countries appear to offer a similarly decisive field
for evaluating aspects of the neoclassical model (see also Christiano
[1389])
       Figures iO and 11 are drawn from Robert Berr6s Macroeconomics, which
contains the first systematic investigation of the predictions of the

neoclassical madel for the post World War II experience.             As Barro notes,

there is a clear association between initial levels of output (in 1950) and

the wartime positions of countries.            That is, it is plausible that the

winners (the U.S., the U.K.) lost less capital than occupied countries

(Austria, Denmark             or the losers (Japan, Germany and Italy) . It
                       and France)
is also plausible that the losers of the war suffered the most severe decline

in initial capital.
    Broadly, these predictions are borne out for the levels of output per
capita in      1950 as depicted in Figure 10.       Further,   Figure ii shows that the

countries with the lower imitial levels of output subsequently display the

higher growth rates, with reductiom in cross—national dispersion of output

levels at the end of the interval.
                                                                                                         33




    A   plausoble interpretation           is that this Figure reflects the           importance of
transitional        dynamics in economic growth.             Under this     interpretation, for
example,      Japan moved from about 1/5 of U.S. per capita output in                     1950 to

about 3/4 of the U.S. level in 1980 as a result of capital accumulation.

    To investigate whether the convergence suggested by Figures 10 ant 11                              oar:


be the result of neoclassical transitionai dynamics we study the innlicstoors

of baseline model that underlies Figure 4 for the evolutio,i of Japan                             To

accomplish this we assume that tne U                 S.   wss in 1950 following a steady           st

tschristiano [1989] also            investigates the "reconstruction hypothesis"              for the
divergence post  war development of Japan and the U.S. Christiano [1989,
page i4] takes Japanese output in 1946 as about 47% below trend,
extrapolating from pre World War II Japanese economic performance. By
contrast, we take the U.S.. as defining the steady state growth path and,
then, find Japanese percapita output as 19% of U.S. percapita output.
Ch.ristiano reports his initial condition as 12% of steady state capital; ours
is .65%. Hence, Christiano's coutations                      ily

VII.   Conclusion

     The basic neoclassical model of capital accumulation, in its                 various
versions,     has been for three decades the central framework for most research

that relates to the process of economic grosth.                   Indeed, for this reason,         it

is frequently referred to as the "growth model,"

     A  central feature of this           model is its    assution of     dimonishiog    returr.c


to   the reproducible factor of           production,    physical capltal.    Under savings

specifications as different of those of Soloa [i956 and Cass

[i965]—Koopmans £1965]         ,

     When we      seek   to use the neoclassicaltransitional dynamos t:

however, diminishing returns to capital turns out to induce major
counterf actual       implications   -

diminishing returns to capital induces intertemporal reallocations wh:ch near.
that transitional dynamics are important only for very short periods, unless
agents have little low intertemporal elasticity of substitution. Hence, it

is difficult to use the neoclassical model to explain 3v.3taimed differences in
growth      rates,   with conventional assumptions about preferences. In this

regard, we reached the opposite conclusion to that suggested by earlier

research of Sato [1963) and              Atkinson   [1969), which has become part       of   the
popular visdon as indicated by Barros [1987] textbook treatment of the
economic growth    process.

    On the other hand, even if one makes agents very unwilling to substitute

over tine so as to deliver a sustained transitional period, interest rates or
asset prices will drematically display the implications of diminishing
returns      In general, we found that in order for transitional dynamics to be

ianortant,   the marginal product of capital has to be very high in the early
stages of    economic development.      In simplest model of Solow [1955] with a

Ocbbcuglas   production function, for example, tbis marginal product
translates directly into an implication for the real rate of return, implying
     ;t is iarlausibly high relative to historical observations. Notably, in
coder   for the Japanese convergence tcward the U.S. income level in the post

war era to be the result of transitional dynamics,         the Japanese real interest

rate would have been over       500   per year in 1950.   In exploring some plausible

alterations of the Solow model, we found that it was impossible to understand

important components of economic growth in terms of transition dynamics

vlthcot   introducing some related implication that strongly contradicted
historical   experience.      For example, introduction of adjustment costs simply

shifts the marginal product implication from the interest rate to Tobins "q,

implying variations unlike anything observed.

   Throughout the course of this research, we have received many suggestions
from   other researchers, mast    of wbich suggested that some straightforward

modification of   our setup would readily overcome the central message of this
paper. We    have tracked down many of these leads. But our conclusion remains
unaltered: the transitional dynamics of the familiar model of capital
accumulation cannot account for important parts of sustained cross country
differences in rates of       economic development.
                                                                                       37



      We   view our   results   as pointing to the use of   dels     that do not rely on

exogenous     technical change—endogenous growth'         dels such as those of Romeo
[1986]     and Lucas [1988]—as the primary vehicle              the process
                                                         for research on

of economic growth. But, more generally, our results suggest the value to a
quantItative approach to evaluating the adequacy of alternative growth
paradigms.     The neoclassical models       qualitative properties are well
understood by    st      economists,   but we found   surprising   new implications about

its properties as a growth model.           In newer theoretical frameworks,    with

general properties as yet undocumented, the quantitative approach sill also
help us learn about which model predictions are robust and which are tightly

dependent on aspects of economic structure.   In the process of quantitative
evaluation, we thus will gain a sharper understanding of why models succeed
or   fail in explaining the      pace and   pattern of economic developmeut

     This appendix describesthe numerical method used to coute the
transition paths discussed in the main text. For all the models considered
io this paper characterizing the coetitive equilibrium amounts to solving                   a

two point boundary value problem, i.e. a system of difference equations with
                                                                              We will use
toundary conditions specified at two different points in time.

the basic neoclassical model of section 2 to illustrate the operation of the

algoritbn.       The coetitive equilibrium for that economy is characterized by

a systen of two first order difference equations:

     To solwethis problem we eloyed a shooting method that relies cm
owledge of the near—steady—state dynamics of this system of equations. By
linearizing the system around the steady state it is possible to show that,

depending    of the value selected for A three types of paths                   may   arise:   (i)
paths along      which the capital stocks always grows, eventually overshooting

the steady state and continuing to grow at an accelerating rate; (ii) paths
along which the capital stock decreases or increases initially and then

decreases; (iii) one path along             which the   capital stock increases         convergong

to   the steady state. Paths type (i)            and    (ii) violate the transversaloty
condition    so only (iii) is the desired solution.                 We denote the value ci

associated      with (iii) by       A.    Paths type    (i) occur for values of A         >

while   paths type (ii) correspond to           < A.        Thi     suggasts a simple algorthn

to search for      AZ:
                    0


      Step 1:     find a value of A that          generates a path type         (i); denote ot by
                  A

      Step 2:     find a     value of    that generaes a path type (ii),                denoto
                                 =

                  smallest number recoized by the couter as different from
                  zero).

      The number      of iterations needed for convergence            is given by     the first

integer j such that          j    > ln(/tol)/ln2,   where   tol is the chosen tolerance and
     the initial value of          A—A.
      This method is different from            'ile'     and   'multiple'      shooting which are

the   standard algorithms used to solve this type of problem. The advantage of
both of these algorithms is that they require no hmowledge of the dynamics of

the systen.          A detailed discussion of these methods can be found in Roberts

and Shipman (1972) and in Lipton et al (1982) but we provide here a brief

description to contrast then with the shooting method that we employed.

     The     basic idea underlying simple shooting                             is that   a system of equation

such as       (At)    —   (A.2) can be viewed              as   defining a function          ZT
                                                                                                   =
                                                                                                       Ao)       vhere

A,   is an arbitrary         guess and         ZT
                                                    is the difference between the value of the
boundary oondition           at   T    associated with               A    and   the desired value      for that
boundary condition.            A      numerical method               for finding     zeros   of equetions (e.g.
Nevton—Rapbson) is then used to generate a new guess for                                       with the process

being repeated iteratively until                     Z,.
                                                           =    0.       In our   exale     the second boundary

condition       is at infinity so           it is usually approzimated by choosing 7 to be a
large       number   (say,   200 years)             ZT   can be defined as (B )                        —   0 or as
                                                                                ATk.T+l
       since paths that satisfy the transversality condition converge to the
  k5
steady state.          Simple shooting does not usually work because arbitrary

guesses for A0 can generate paths for the capital stock along which kt

becomes negative leading to nonsensical complez values for                                         and           To
                                                                                             k.r         AT.

avoid this it is often necessary to split the path into various parts and

apply the method to each part (e.g. compute the path for the first five

years   •    then use     k5 as an initial condition to compute the path for the

following five         years,      etc.),      a   technique that               is hnown as iltiple        shooting.
     The numerical         results      that       we obtained           for    the models described        in

section       IV using moltiple shooting                 were        very similar to the paths           computed

with cur shooting algorithm.
     As a second          check on the algorithm that we employed we also verified that

the paths computed numerically for the one and two—sector dels replicated

      This Appendix shows
technological progress as eodied, along the lines of Solow (1959]
generates an economy that is basically observationally equivalent to the
original model
      The   technology of the Solow (1959] model translated to discrete tine is
corrsed by the following equations:

      (3.2)

                  ti
                  vt = (p Kvt)1Nt

TIe   first equation expresses the output at time t          of   a production technology

of vintage v as        a   Cobb—Douglas function of the capital of that vintage in

existence      at time t     and of the labor   coined   vith that capital.   The rate of

eodied        technical progress is denoted by 'yg        Equation (3.2) relates the

stock of capital of vintage v existent at time t+l to the original investnent

made in that vintage (Iv) and of the rate of depreciation.  Equation (3,3) is

the adding—up constraint on labor1 (3.4) states that total output is the sum

of the output produced by the various vintages and (3.5) that total output

can be devoted to          consutionor    investment.
                                                                                                     2




      An efficient allocation of labor requires that its argina1 product be

equated across the different vintages.                  Solov    [1959J showed that using this

fact the vintage—specificcapital stocks can                     be   aggregated into a   coosite
capital stock     J       defined as:




      (B.6)
                          f—i

                                '
The advantage of defining this cocosite                  capital good is that total       outpuo
can be expressed as a function of Nt and


      (B.7)           =   A
                                    N.

The   lay of notion for             (B6) can   also     be expressed without reference       to the
vintage—specific      capital stocks:



      (B.8)               =
                                               It
In the steady state capital grows at rate                       =              where     is the

      It is easy to show, using the description of technology given by (B5),

(B.7) and     (B8),   that at any        point in   time the real interest rate is given

by:

      To study

1000 we start by using (8.9) and the )owledge of the steady state real

interest rate, rt, to cornute the steady state value of                 i.
                                                                 Next we use

Assuming that the nuer of hours worked per capita is the same in the two
countries (in fact this number was higher in Japan so that this assumtion
blasas the results toward finding a low interest rate), wa can rewrite (5.10)
in tens of        js as:
                    .3   = .US        11(1—a)

Under the assumption           that the U.S. was at the steady state in 1950, i.e.,

=   e, we can compute             an the associated real interest rate implied by

(89).       Using the parameter values employed in the main text, a=213, 5=10,

            and      = 1.01 (the Japanese population grew at 1% in the post war
r5=.065
period—see Sarro [1987], page 296) and choosing               so that the steady      state


growth rate of per capita output is 2% per year, the value of the Japanese

interest rate implied by the model is 560%.

      In terms of dynamics this model is almost identical to the baseline

economy of section II.            The system of Euler equations that governs the the

competitive equilibrium for this economy is identical to (Al),               (A.2) with
