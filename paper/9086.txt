                                               ABSTRACT

        This paper explains the differential impacts of trade on countries in terms of institutional
differences which result in factor market distortions. We modify the Ricardian, Specific Factor and
Hecksher Ohlin models of trade to capture these. Trade has both terms of trade effects and output effects.
Both work to raise welfare in an undistorted economy. In a distorted economy, price effects work to
improve welfare, while output effects work to reduce it. Large distorted countries are more likely to lose
from trade as beneficial price effects are lower. In addition the greater the substitutability between goods,
the more likely it is that welfare rises through trade.

1     Introduction

The latter part of the 20th century saw a surge in trade volumes. Some develop-

ing countries liberalized trade hoping to emulate the success of the East Asian

miracle economies; others just out of the socialist bloc looked to the world for

consumer goods. Most did not perform very well. During the early stages of

liberalization, incomes even fell in many transition economies. It would seem

appropriate to ask what might lead to such diﬀerent experiences with trade

liberalization.

    We argue that labor market distortions and their interactions with trade

liberalization might be important in answering this question. This paper is

related to the literature in trade on factor market distortions, work in Labor

Economics on heterogenous labor as well as to work in Development Economics

on organizational diﬀerences between developing and developed economies.

    While factor market distortions and their eﬀect in open economies have

been a focus of much work in trade, attention has been targeted for the most

part on the eﬀects of minimum wages. See for example, the work of Brecher

(1974a,b) (which looks at the eﬀect of a minimum wage distortion on an open

economy) as well as the recent work of Davis (1998) (which looks at the eﬀects

of trade between an economy with a minimum wage distortion (Europe) and

one without it (the U.S.) and argues that trade may simultaneously prop up

U.S. wages and cause greater unemployment in Europe). The minimum wage

distortion in these studies is exogenously specified. Brecher (1992) develops an

eﬃciency wage model with an endogenous factor market distortion which results

in unemployment. The endogenous distortion in our model result in resource

misallocations, not in unemployment.1
   1 See Rodrik (1987) for some other examples of endogenous distortions and the importance

of modelling them in terms of structural parameters.




                                            1
   If firms are unable to identify the ability of workers and workers are unable to

fully signal their ability then wages are positively related to the average ability

of the labor pool firms draw from. For example, Weiss (1980) develops such a

model in a partial equilibrium closed economy setting and argues that job queues

or unemployment could occur. Although our model has some common features

with these models, we have a general equilibrium model in an open-economy

setting.

   There is also a large literature in Development Economics on the eﬀects

of family farms. However, most of this work deals with homogeneous labor

in a closed economy setting. Family farming results in workers earning the

average rather than the marginal product in agriculture. When workers are

identical in ability and marginal product is diminishing, as has been assumed

in this literature, average product exceeds marginal product so that too many

workers remain in agriculture. In the development literature this distortion has

been linked with the concept of “Disguised Unemployment”, see Sen (1960).

However, when labor varies in ability, as in our model, only lower ability labor

remains in agriculture. The marginal worker obtains a wage below his marginal

value product. As a result too few workers remain in agriculture rather than

too many!

   Diﬀerences in the way labor markets work crucially aﬀect how production is

organized in various economies. In market economies, workers are paid the value

of their marginal product so that labor allocation between sectors is eﬃcient.

Such economies can only gain from trade. On the other hand, institutional

constraints may prevent an eﬃcient allocation of labor. In this paper we look

at a particular kind of factor market distortion that can be interpreted in both

the context of an economy making the transition from a socialist to a market

economy, or in terms of institutions existing in parts of the developing world.


                                        2
   In the former socialist economies (transition economies), the state owned

sectors (the distorted sector) usually pay a flat wage per worker which is only

loosely related to ability. If other sectors are undistorted and pay a productiv-

ity based wage, the best workers are attracted to the undistorted sector while

the lower ability ones flock to the distorted sector. In developing economies,

agriculture is run along family farm lines so that workers in agriculture (the

distorted sector) can be thought of as obtaining a fixed wage rather than the

value of their marginal product. When workers diﬀer in their abilities, this leads

to higher ability workers leaving agriculture.

   With either interpretation, the eﬀect of the distortion is the same. In au-

tarky, too little of the distorted good is made and its price is too high. As a

result, the distorted economy has a comparative disadvantage in the distorted

good which is imported when the economy is opened up. This reduces the out-

put of the distorted good and worsens the distortion. On the other hand, trade

results in the usual price eﬀects which raise welfare. Thus, welfare may rise or

fall as a result of trade liberalization. However, a large distorted economy always

loses from trade as it does not reap any beneficial price eﬀects. This is in line

with the literature on the theory of the second best, (see Lipsey and Lancaster

(1956)) where a recurring theme is that in the presence of existing distortions,

reduction or removal of a distortion can lower welfare. See, for example (Ethier

1982).

   In autarky, the eﬀect of the distortion on welfare depends on the extent

of substitutability in consumption. If the goods are perfect complements, in

autarky the consumption levels are the same as in an undistorted economy.

However if there is any substitutability, there is too little output in the distorted

sector. The more the substitutability, the greater the deleterious eﬀects of the

distortion; since the price of the distorted good is higher than in an undistorted


                                         3
economy, consumers substitute away from it a lot when substitutability is high,

causing far too little of the distorted good to be produced (as compared to the

eﬃcient level).

   Trade involves importing the distorted good and with a Constant Elasticity

of Substitution formulation, greater substitutability results in gains from trade.

The more substitutable the goods are in consumption, the greater the price eﬀect

through trade. As the price eﬀect is beneficial, trade tends to raise welfare.

   This paper builds on Krishna and Yavas (2002), which uses a Ricardian

setup to show how such labor market distortions in transition and developing

countries aﬀect the level and distribution of income and hence the demand for

indivisible consumer goods. In their model, eﬀects in transition and developing

economies diﬀer, though the basic story is similar. They argue that in the

absence of trade, wages are high due to the distortion, and as a result demand

for indivisibles is high, which sustains these high wages. However, as the cost of

the distorted good is higher in the distorted economy, it tends to be imported,

with adverse consequences on the level and distribution of income.

   Such factor market distortions have similar eﬀects even when goods are di-

visible. By modifying the standard trade models, namely the Ricardian, Specific

Factors, and Hecksher Ohlin models, we are able to look at a wider set of issues.

   Section 2 develops the Ricardian model and shows how this distortion aﬀects

labor allocation and output and why trade always makes existing distortions

worse. We also look at the eﬀects of substitutability between goods on the

gains from trade for a distorted economy. Section 3 develops the Specific Factors

model and argues that similar eﬀects obtain when the marginal productivity of

labor is diminishing. Section 4 deals with the Hecksher Ohlin model of trade

with an endogenous allocation of capital and shows that it does not alter the

flavor of the results either. Section 5 contains some final remarks.


                                        4
2     The Ricardian Model

There are two economies, Home and Foreign, which have access to the same

technology, but diﬀer in their institutional arrangements2 . There are a contin-

uum of individuals, indexed by γ, who are uniformly distributed on the unit

interval with density related to the labor size. Type γ is endowed with γ units

of eﬀective labor. There are two goods, X and Y , and both goods are produced

under competitive conditions. It takes one unit of eﬀective labor, E, to make a

unit of either good.

    Let Y be the numeraire good with a price of unity. Let I be the total income

of the economy, and let P and P ∗ denote the autarky price of X in Home and

Foreign. Let L and L∗ be the size of the labor force, i.e., the density of the

distribution of γ, in Home and Foreign, respectively. Labor in the Y sector is

paid the value of its marginal product in both economies. Labor in the X sector

is paid its marginal product in Foreign, but is paid a constant wage per worker,

independent of ability, in Home.

2.1      Autarky Equilibrium

In the undistorted economy, called Foreign, a worker with productivity γ earns

γ if he works in Y and γP ∗ if he works in X. For both goods to be produced,

P ∗ has to equal 1.3

    Let w̄ be the fixed wage per worker in sector X in the distorted economy.

This fixed wage has two interpretations. It can be interpreted as the wage

per worker paid by state owned manufacturing firms. Alternatively, it can be

interpreted as the income of a worker who works in the family farm and obtains
   2 Since we are looking at the eﬀects of diﬀerent labor market institutions we abstract from

diﬀerences in technology. These can be easily added to the model.
   3 For both goods to be produced, there must be some workers willing to work in each sector.

However at any P ∗ 6= 1, all workers will prefer working in one or the other.

wage w, workers with γ > w, that is workers in OA, choose to work in X. The

remaining workers choose to work in Y. An increase in the wage rate attracts

workers with higher ability into X and raises the average quality of labor there.

   At wage w̄, and assuming γ is uniformly distributed, w̄L workers are em-
                                                                              w̄
ployed in X, and total labor cost is w̄2 L. On average, each worker has       2    eﬀective

units of labor. Total output of X at this wage, denoted by X(w̄), is their prod-

uct,
                                                w̄2
                                    X(w̄) =         L.
                                                 2
Hence, cost per unit of good X, and hence its price, P, is 2.

   In Home, as a result of the fixed wage per worker in sector X, workers (other

than the marginal one) earn more than they would in the undistorted sector.5

This raises the cost of producing good X, and hence its price. This, in turn,

reduces the demand and output of the distorted sector in autarky equilibrium.
  4 We  asssume that all family farms have the same average ability.
  5 Note  that in the market economy, the productivity of the workers in X is equal to the
value of marginal product in Y .

Thus there are too few workers in the X sector. This is depicted in Figure 2.

The Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) of the distorted economy is the same

as that of the undistorted one and given the Ricardian setup, it is linear. The

undistorted economy produces at point A where the indiﬀerence curve is tangent

to the PPF. As there is no unemployment, the distorted economy remains on

the PPF. However, it produces at the wrong point, at B, making too little X.

At B the price line is flatter than the PPF but is tangent to the indiﬀerence

curve since consumption decisions are not distorted.6
   6 In the extreme case where goods are perfect complements, the consumption and hence

output levels in a distorted economy under autarky are the same as in an undistorted economy.
However as long as there is any substitutability, there is too little output in the distorted sector.




                                                 7
2.2    Trade Equilibrium

Trade equilibrium is best understood using the standard relative demand (RD)

and relative supply (RS) framework. In Figure 3, RS W depicts the world rel-

ative supply. At P = 1, the undistorted economy becomes willing to produce
                                     L∗
good X and it can produce up to       2   units while the distorted economy produces
                  L
only good Y ,     2   units of it. Thus, the relative supply of good X at P = 1 is,
           L∗                              L∗
at most,   L .   For P ∈ (1, 2) , RS W =   L .       At P = 2, the distorted economy also

becomes willing to produce good X and RS W becomes horizontal. Thus, the

price under free trade, P F , depends on the relative size of the two countries, L

and L∗ .

   Given identical homothetic preferences across countries, the world relative
        ¡      ¢
demand RDW depends on relative prices alone and is identical to that for

either country. If, in addition, X and Y enter preferences symmetrically, then
                                                                             L∗         L∗
RDW = 1 at P = 1. Since relative supply at P = 1 is at most                  L ,   if   L    < 1,

then the intersection of RS W and RDW must occur at a point like b or c in

Figure 3. Hence P F must be greater than unity, and the undistorted economy
                                           L∗
completely specializes in good X. If       L     ≥ 1, then this intersection must occur

at a point like a in Figure 3. So P F = 1 and the distorted country completely

specializes in good Y.
                                                L∗
   This pattern makes sense since if            L     < 1, then Foreign is small relative

to Home, and it must specialize in the distorted good, X, in which it has a
                                                            L∗
comparative advantage. On the other hand, if                L    ≥ 1, then Foreign is large

relative to Home, it can produce enough to meet world demand of good X, and

therefore Home completely specializes in the undistorted good, Y, in which it

has a comparative advantage.

2.2.1    Welfare Eﬀects

The undistorted economy never loses from trade. The eﬀects on the distorted

economy are varied. There are two eﬀects at play. Recall that the distorted

economy produces too little of the distorted good in autarky, and it has a

comparative disadvantage in its production. Trade makes this distortion worse

as the country produces even less of the distorted good after trade. There may

however be a welfare gain through lower prices of X. The net eﬀect depends on

which one dominates. If substitutability between goods is parameterized using a

constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function, simulations show that
                                     ∗
welfare rises due to trade for (σ, LL ) that lie above a weakly downward sloping
                        ∗
curve denoted by σ( LL ).
        L∗
   If   L    ≥ 1 then Home makes only Y. Hence, the output eﬀect is adverse.

However, as P F = 1, Home obtains the same welfare as that of an undistorted


                                             9
economy. Hence, trade must always raise welfare in Home.
         L∗
    If   L    < 1 then P F must exceed unity, occurring at a point like b or c in
                          L∗
Figure 3. For a given     L ,   the lower the substitutability the higher the price in

free trade. This occurs because when goods enter preferences symmetrically, the

relative demand curve must always go through the point (1, 1), i.e., the point a

in Figure 3. It is easy to see that when σ is high enough the free trade price is

close to unity, so Home welfare under trade approaches that of an undistorted

economy. As a result, Home gains from trade. As σ falls from this high value,
                                                                              L∗
relative demand becomes steeper, rotating about the point (1, 1). Since       L    < 1,

the intersection with relative supply occurs at a higher price. At some level, say

σ̂, P reaches 2. At this level of σ, welfare must fall due to trade since Home

makes only Y and prices are its autarky prices. By continuity, at some value of

σ in between Home neither gains nor loses from trade.

    Once σ reaches σ̂, further decreases in σ do not aﬀect the price in free trade.

However, Home starts to produce both X and Y . In this region, Home must

lose from trade as there is no positive price eﬀect, and since Home imports X

its production of X must be lower than under autarky.7


3        Specific Factors Model

Would the results derived above carry through if labor faced diminishing returns

as it would in the presence of other factors? In the next two sections we show

that their spirit does indeed carry through.

    Consider the specific factors model. Each sector has a fixed amount of a

specific factor which cannot move across sectors while labor is mobile. We

assume that Home and Foreign are identical in every respect except that Home

has a labor market distortion in X. Let E i denote the eﬀective units of labor
  7 Suppose its output of X was the same as under autarky. Then as price is the same as

Home’s autarky price, it must neither import not export which is a contradiction.



                                            10
employed in sector i, and K i denote the fixed amount of specific factor employed

in sector i, for i = X, Y . Let X(E X , K X ) and Y (E Y , K Y ) denote the constant

returns to scale production functions for the two sectors, and let the price of Y

be unity so that P denotes the relative price of X.

3.1    Autarky Equilibrium

As before, X pays a fixed wage per worker regardless of workers’ ability while

workers earn the value of their marginal product in Y . As a result of this, lower

ability workers prefer to work for X while higher ability workers opt for Y. Let

γ̃ be the worker who is indiﬀerent between working for X and Y.

   Let we = Y1 (.) be the wage per eﬀective unit of labor in Y (where subscript

i denotes the derivative with respect to the ith argument). The earnings of a

worker with ability γ in Y are we γ while the earnings of a worker in X are w̄.

In equilibrium, the highest ability worker in X, or γ̃, is indiﬀerent between the

two sectors so that

                                     we γ̃ = w̄.                                    (1)

                                                                             w̄
Note that a worker’s decision whether to work for X or Y depends on          we .   As

this goes up, γ̃ rises, and the number of workers as well as the eﬀective labor in

X rises while that in Y falls.

   What determines the allocation of eﬀective labor in equilibrium? Note that

given our assumption that ability is distributed uniformly over the interval [0, 1],
                                                     γ̃
the average ability of workers employed in X is      2.   We assume competition so

that firms in X take w̄ and the average ability of the work force, ( γ̃2 ), as given,

and choose only how many such workers to hire.

   Thus, the problem faced by firm j in X facing P, γ̃ and w̄ is

                                     γ̃
                           max P X(nj , KjX ) − w̄nj
                            nj       2



                                         11
where nj is the proportion of labor force employed by firm j, and hence nj γ̃2 is

the total units of eﬀective labor employed by firm j, denoted by Ej . KjX is the

amount of the factor specific to X that firm j has. The first order condition of

the problem yields
                                       γ̃      γ̃
                               P X1 (nj , KjX ) = w̄
                                       2       2
which in turn implies that

                                                w̄
                                P =    γ̃     X    X
                                                         .                                   (2)
                                       2 X1 (Ej , Kj )

Since all firms face the same prices and wages, their marginal products are equal-

ized. Given constant returns to scale production functions, marginal products
                                                             EjX
are homogeneous of degree zero and depend only               KjX
                                                                 .   Hence, it is equal for all

firms and equal to that for the hypothetical aggregate firm. Thus,

                           X1 (EjX , KjX ) = X1 (E X , K X ).                                (3)

Using equation (3) and substituting for w̄ using (1) into (2), and noting that

we = Y1 (.) gives
                                             Y1 (.)
                                      P =2                                                   (4)
                                             X1 (.)
as the relation defining the allocation of labor and relative supply in the distorted

economy.

   Also note that when factors are paid in this manner, the value of output

exactly equals factor payments.

                    P X(EjX , KjX ) = P [EjX X1 (.) + KjX X2 (.)]
                                           γ̃
                                      = P [ nj X1 (.) + KjX X2 (.)]
                                           2
                                      = w̄nj + rKjX .

   The first equality follows from constant returns to scale. The second equality
                                                                                  γ̃
follows from the fact that hiring nj workers of average quality                   2    gives the

                                           12
eﬀective labor EjX . The last follows from (2) and competitive capital markets.

As a result, whether one thinks of a fixed wage per person being paid in X or

whether one thinks of workers in X being equal residual claimants to output in

X (once capital has been paid) gives the same result.

   In an undistorted economy the marginal value products of the two sectors

are equalized so that

                                  P X1 (.) = Y1 (.),

and relative supply is given by

                                          Y1 (.)
                                    P =          .
                                          X1 (.)

   Figure 4 illustrates these relative supply curves. For any given allocation

of labor, and hence supplies, the price needed to elicit this relative supply in

the distorted economy is twice that needed to elicit the same relative supply in

the undistorted economy. Hence, at any given horizontal coordinate in Figure

4, the vertical coordinate of RS is twice that of RS ∗ . Given that preferences

are identical and homothetic, relative demand is the same in all economies, so

that diﬀerences in relative supplies translate to a higher autarky price of X in

the distorted economy. In Figure 4, point A depicts the autarky equilibrium in

Foreign, and point B depicts the autarky equilibrium in Home.

   Given the higher autarky price, the distorted economy’s relative demand for,

and hence supply of, good X is lower than that in an undistorted economy, and

therefore sector X in a distorted economy employs too little eﬀective units of

labor relative to an undistorted one.

   These results can be better understood using Figures 5 and 6. Figure 5

illustrates the allocation of eﬀective units of labor using the standard specific

factors diagram. The two ends of the box are the origins for the two sectors

and the downward sloping curves (with respect to their origins) depict the value

of marginal product of an eﬀective unit of labor in each sector. In the absence

of a factor market distortion, the marginal productivity of labor in each sector

is equalized. This is represented by point A. On the other hand, with labor

market distortions, from (4) , it follows that

                                   P X1 (.) = 2Y1 (.)

and the marginal value product of an eﬀective unit of labor in X equals twice

that in Y. In other words, the equilibrium allocation of eﬀective units of labor is

such that the vertical length of the V M P EX , denoted by wX , is twice that of

the V M P EY , denoted by wY , as illustrated by point B in Figure 5. Note that

at any price, less of X is made and more of Y is made as a result.8

    Figure 6 depicts the production possibilities frontier for the distorted and

undistorted economies, as well as production (which equals consumption) in

autarky. Both economies have the same production possibility frontier (PPF) by

assumption, and they both produce on the frontier as there is no unemployment

in either. In the undistorted economy, the autarky relative price of good X (of
Y1 (.)
X1 (.) )   is tangent to both the PPF and to the indiﬀerence curve of the economy

at point A. On the other hand, the distorted economy has a higher autarky
                                  2Y1 (.)
relative price of good X, (of     X1 (.) )   and it consumes and produces less X as

depicted by point B. Moreover, the slope of the PPF at B is steeper than the

price ratio which equals the slope of the indiﬀerence curve through B. Note that

as a result its welfare is below that of the undistorted economy.

3.2        Free Trade Equilibrium

What will be the eﬀect of trade in this environment? Does the distortion always

get worse as in the Ricardian model, or can it get better? The answer follows
   8 With many sectors the same arguments work. As in Figure 5, draw the horizontal sum

of V MP E in each distorted sector using OX as the origin and the the horizontal sum of
V MP E in each undistorted sector using OY as the origin. In equilibrium, the V MP E in
each distorted sector equals the twice that in each undistorted sector.

quite simply. Given the relative supplies of the two economies as depicted in

Figure 4, the world relative supply is given by RS W which must lie in between

RS and RS ∗ . As relative demand for the world equals the common relative

demand of the two countries, the free trade price must lie in between two autarky

prices, as depicted by point C in Figure 4. Therefore, after opening up, Home

observes a decline in the relative price of good X and hence its relative supply

falls short of its relative demand and it imports good X and exports good Y.

   Note that a reduction in relative supply of X moves Home along its P P F

to point C in Figure 6, thereby worsening the distortion in output. At given

prices, this reduces welfare. However, the price of X also falls through trade. As

Home is an importer of X, this raises welfare. The net eﬀect of trade depends

on which of these two eﬀects, the output eﬀect or the price eﬀect, dominates.

Under free trade, Home consumption lies along the line through C with slope


                                       16
P F . It lies to the left of C as X is imported. Similarly, Foreign consumption in

Free trade lies along the line through D with slope P F . It lies to the right of D

as X is exported.

    As an economy gets larger, the relative price in the free trade equilibrium

approaches its autarky price, and therefore the extent of the beneficial price

eﬀect falls. If Home country is very large, then the free trade price will be very

close to its autarky price, and the price eﬀect will be negligible. On the other

hand, since the other country will export good X and import good Y at, the

output eﬀect will remain. Therefore, it follows that a large economy must lose

from trade.9

    It is worth noting that trade between two distorted economies, one with a

distortion in X and the other with a distortion in Y, causes the distortion in

both countries to get worse as each country has a comparative disadvantage in

the production of the good in which it has a distortion, and it will import this

good in trade equilibrium producing even less of it.


4     Heckscher-Ohlin Model

What makes the Heckscher-Ohlin model diﬀerent from the specific factors model

is the assumption that K as well as E is mobile across sectors. This allows us to

ask how the allocation of capital is aﬀected by the distortion in the labor market,

the eﬀects of trade on this allocation decision, as well as the consequences of

endogenous capital allocation for trade.

    Assume, as usual, that there are no factor intensity reversals. Let cX (w, r)

and cY (w, r) denote the unit cost functions in the two sectors in the absence

of any distortions where w is the wage per eﬀective unit of labor and r is the
   9 Diﬀerent groups are aﬀected by trade as in the standard specific factors setup. The real

return to the specific factor whose relative price goes up rises, while that of the other specific
factor falls. The eﬀect on the real return of labor depends on their preferences.




                                               17
rental rate. In equilibrium, cX (w, r) = P and cY (w, r) = 1. These conditions

are depicted in Figure 7 by the curves X and Y respectively. For both goods to

be produced, factor prices must lie at their intersection, namely A.10 As in the

standard model, price cannot exceed cost as profits are zero, and if cost exceeds

price, output is zero.

    In the presence of the distortion, the wage per eﬃciency unit of labor will

diﬀer between sectors. If the wage per eﬃciency unit of labor in Y is wY , then

workers choose between earning wY γ in X and w̄ in Y. The marginal worker,

type γ̃, gets the same in both sectors so that

                                         wY γ̃ = w̄.                                      (5)

                                                                    γ̃
Note that each worker in X has an average eﬃciency of               2.   Let wX denote the

implicit wage per eﬃciency unit in X. Thus, using (5) gives

                                             w̄
                                    wX =     γ̃
                                                  = 2wY .
                                             2

As there is no capital market distortion, r is common to both sectors. Conse-

quently,

                                     cX (2wY , r) = P                                     (6)

and

                                      cY (wY , r) = 1                                     (7)

give the analogous equilibrium conditions in the distorted economy. The curve

X 0 which lies halfway between the curve X and the horizontal axis depicts (6)

in Figure 7. In the absence of specialization, factor prices are given by the point

B for the Y sector and the point C for the X sector. It is worth noting that

the factor market distortion can easily lead to specialization in Y at a given

price as X 0 and Y may not intersect though X and Y do. The specialization

dual.

in Y can be analyzed along standard lines. Here we focus on the case where

both countries produce both goods. We look at how the distortion aﬀects factor

prices, capital labor ratios, factor allocations and output in a distorted economy

relative to an undistorted one and whether it depends on whether X is capital

intensive relative to Y or not.

   If X is capital intensive, as depicted in Figure 7(a), then the wage-rental

ratio, and hence capital-eﬀective labor ratio, rises in both sectors relative to

that in the undistorted economy. Since C is vertically above B, the wage-rental

ratio rises by more in X than in Y, and X remains relatively capital intensive.

Since total capital and labor is given, the only way for capital intensity to rise

in both sectors is for the output of the labor intensive good, Y, along with the

allocation of both factors to Y, to rise.

   This is easy to verify using the standard Rybczynski box with dimensions K

and E, the availability of capital and eﬀective labor in the economy, as depicted

in Figure 8. Factor market clearing can be depicted by adding the vector of

factor use in X to that in Y (or Y to X) and having this sum reach the other

end of the box, i.e., factor markets clear. If X is capital intensive, then the ray

denoting the vector of factor use in X is steeper than that in Y , as depicted in

Figure 8(a). For given wage-rental ratios, the output levels and factor usages in

the two sectors are implicitly given by the intersection of the two rays, at point

A. The coordinates of point A give the capital and eﬀective labor usage in X

while the remaining factors are used in Y. An increase in the wage rental ratio

raises the capital-eﬀective labor ratio in both sectors, making both rays steeper.

At the new intersection, at point B, X must use less capital and less eﬀective

labor, so that at a given price, relative supply of X is lower in the distorted

economy.

   What if X is labor intensive, as depicted in Figure 7(b)? At a given price,

if both goods are made, the distorted economy has a lower wage-rental ratio,

and hence capital-eﬀective labor ratio, relative to the undistorted economy in

both X and Y since the slope of the line from the origin through A exceeds that

through B or C. The only way for capital intensity to fall in both sectors is for

the output of the capital intensive good, Y, along with the allocation of both

factors to Y, to rise. Again, this is easy to verify using the Rybczynski box. If

X is the labor-intensive sector, then the ray denoting the vector of factor usage

in X is flatter than that in Y as illustrated in Figure 8(b). A decrease in the

wage-rental ratio will reduce the capital-eﬀective labor ratio in both sectors. In

the Rybczynski box, this corresponds to both rays getting flatter. At the new

equilibrium, at point B, sector X uses less capital and less eﬀective labor, and

hence relative supply of X is lower in the distorted economy, as earlier.

   One might ask at this stage why X must be labor intensive relative to Y in

the distorted economy. Since the wage-rental ratio, and hence, one might argue,

the capital-eﬀective labor ratio, could rise by more in X than in Y, it seems that

X might become the capital intensive sector in the distorted economy, despite

the absence of factor intensity reversals. That is, what prevents the slope of

X at C from exceeding that of Y at B? We argue that this cannot happen

in the absence of factor intensity reversals. The reasoning is simple. Fix a

price. Assuming that both goods are made in the undistorted economy, the

capital-eﬀective labor ratio in the two sectors in the undistorted economy must

bracket the economy’s capital-eﬀective labor ratio. As X is labor intensive, its

capital-eﬀective labor ratio must lie below k, the capital-eﬀective labor ratio of

the economy as a whole, while that of Y must lie above k. Since the wage rental

ratio falls in both X and Y, so do capital labor ratios. If the capital-eﬀective

labor ratio in Y falls so much that it lies below that in X, both sectors’ capital

labor ratios must lie below k. However, this is inconsistent with factor markets


                                       22
clearing in the distorted economy.

    Thus, whether X is capital or labor intensive, the distortion in the labor

market in X results not only in a decrease in the allocation of labor to X but

also a decline in capital allocated to X at given prices. In other words, the

eﬀects of distortion on the relative supply of X is more pronounced than in the

specific factors model where capital could not move across sectors. The relative

supply for the distorted and undistorted economies (RS and RS ∗ ) are as in

Figure 4. As relative demand is the same for both, the points E and F depict

their autarky equilibria. Since RS lies to the left of RS ∗ , the autarky price

in the distorted economy must exceed that in the undistorted one and the free

trade price lies in between them. As a result, the price of X in the distorted

economy falls due to trade, and it imports X which further reduces its output

of it. Once again, while the price eﬀect of trade raises welfare in the distorted

economy, the output eﬀect reduces it. The net eﬀect will depend on which of

these dominates as earlier.

    Our main results are thus independent of which model we choose to use. The

factor market distortion creates a comparative disadvantage in X. The price of

X falls through trade for the distorted economy but as X is imported so does

its output. The fall in the price of X raises welfare while the fall in output of

X makes existing distortion worse.


5     Conclusion

The last decade has seen a large number of countries embracing trade reforms.

However, many of them have not been able to emulate the success of the fast

growing East Asian countries. Our analysis suggests that labor market distor-

tion prevalent in developing countries might lead to a fall in welfare, especially

for a large country, when such economies open up to trade. While the East


                                       23
Asian economies were small, economies that have not done as well tend to be

larger.

    Our results are consistent with the experiences of some transition economies.

Most sectors in the erstwhile socialist economies were state owned in the old

regime. This corresponds to all sectors having the labor market distortion. It is

easy to verify that in our model if all sectors are distorted, production decisions

remain eﬃcient. Reform consisting of privatizing some sectors would however

result in ineﬃciencies in production decisions, which would be worsened through

trade. This is yet another example of the Theorem of the Second Best and the

dangers of partial reform. Our analysis suggests that a dip in national income

occurring in the initial stages of privatization is likely. This is consistent with the

initial post reform experience of almost all transition economies, see Figure 1.2

in a recent monograph, World Bank (2002). Boeri and Terrell (2002) argue that

part of the reason for the diﬀering experiences in transition of the countries of

the Former Soviet Union (FSU) and those of the Central and Eastern European

(CEE) can be explained in part by the diﬀerent labor market policies they

adopted.11

    While our work here focuses on the implications of a labor market distortion,

there are, of course, many other aspects of the experience of both developing and

transition economies which are not addressed here. Many reasons have been put

forward to explain the diﬀerential performance of developing economies. See,

for example, Krueger (1984) and Ray (1998) for an overview of some of this

literature. Similarly, there have been a number of interesting hypotheses put

forward to explain the sharp decline in industrial output and GDP in Eastern

Europe and the former Soviet Union countries. These include slow adjustment
  11 The CEE countries propped up wages at the bottom of the distribution while the FSU

countries allowed greater wage flexibility. As a result, unproductive sectors collapsed more in
the former than in the latter.

resulting in unemployment, see Gomulka (1992), investment delays caused by

the unwillingness to invest till a good match is found since investment is rela-

tion specific, see Roland and Verdier (1999), and the disorganization hypothesis

of Blanchard and Kremer (1997), where strong complementarities between in-

puts allows suppliers to exercise their bargaining power and disrupt production

chains.

   Our work has some natural extensions. In this paper, we assume that when

there are other scarce factors of production, labor in the distorted sector shares

the residual output after these factors are paid the value of their marginal prod-

uct. This corresponds to the existence of a perfect market in land and capital.

All those who own land or capital earn the return from it and this is separate

from who works it. However, in many developing countries, leaving the family

farm means giving up your rights on the land, and workers who remain in the

family farm share the entire output of the farm. The implications of such a

labor market distortion are diﬀerent than the one analyzed here. For one, the

factor market distortion could result in too little or too much being produced.

   Another natural extension concerns capital flows. There have been large cap-

ital flows between market economies and transition and developing economies

(see Lucas (1990)). Here we do not allow capital to move between countries.

Augmented versions of this model can also help explain the simultaneous occur-

rence of factor movements and goods trade without resorting to explanations

relying on trade barriers (as does the work on Multinationals) or adjustment

costs (which results in capital flows being spread out over time). Extending the

model in these directions is part of an on-going research agenda.
