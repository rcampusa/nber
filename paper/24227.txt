                                         ABSTRACT

An often overlooked population in discussions of prison reform is the children of inmates. How a
child is affected depends both on what incarceration does to their parent and what they learn from
their parent's experience. To overcome endogeneity concerns, we exploit the random assignment
of judges who differ in their propensity to send defendants to prison. Using longitudinal data for
Norway, we find that imprisonment has no effect on fathers’ recidivism but reduces their
employment by 20 percentage points. We find no evidence that paternal incarceration affects a
child's criminal activity or school performance.

       There has been a dramatic rise in incarceration over the last 40 years in OECD countries,
raising important questions about the accompanying societal consequences.1 Arguments
about the effects of incarceration on convicts’ own recidivism and future employment are
central to policy debates about the criminal justice system (e.g., Bhuller et al. 2016, Kling
2006, Mueller-Smith 2015). An often overlooked, but sizable, population which is also critical
for policy is the children of these inmates. It is estimated that over 1 million minor children
in EU countries and 2.7 million in the U.S. have a parent behind bars at some point during
a year (Glaze and Maruschak 2010, Philbrick, Ayre, and Lynn 2014). Stated differently,
roughly one in every 50 children in the EU and one in every 28 children in the U.S. has a
parent in prison in a given year.
       The experience of having a parent imprisoned could have important spillover effects on
a child. Parental incarceration could create emotional trauma, increase stigma and social
alienation, or impose financial hardship. However, it is also possible that imprisonment could
serve as a salient deterrent to a child’s own illegal behavior or temporarily remove a negative
influence from a child’s life. How children are affected will depend both on what prison does
to their parent and what they learn from their parent’s experience. If prison rehabilitates a
parent so that they commit less crime and enter the labor market, this could have positive
role model spillovers on the child and increase family income. On the other hand, if a parent’s
time behind bars is criminogenic, it could cause children to copy their parent’s negative
behavior or disrupt the stability of their home environment.
       Despite the importance of the issue, data limitations and endogeneity concerns mean
that we know little about the effects of incarceration on parents and the accompanying
intergenerational spillovers. The first challenge is that the data requirements are high. One
not only needs a panel dataset for parents’ criminal behavior and labor market outcomes,
but also the ability to link this to data for their children. The second challenge comes from
omitted variable bias. Which parents are sent to prison is not random, and moreover, there
   1
    In Western Europe, the average incarceration rate per 100,000 residents rose from 62 in 1980 to 112 in
2010. The increase was even larger in the U.S., going from 220 to over 700 (World Prison Brief, 2016).

could be unobserved characteristics common to both parents and children. This short paper
overcomes both the data and identification challenges in the context of Norway’s criminal
justice system. As far as we know, the only other quasi-experimental work on this topic is a
contemporaneous working paper by Dobbie et al. (2017) using data from Sweden.

1   Research Design and Data
This section describes our research design and data, copying some of the most relevant
information from Bhuller, Dahl, Løken, and Mogstad (2016, hereafter BDLM). While further
details can be found there, here we highlight the richness of the data and how the random
assignment of judges can be used to estimate the effects of incarceration on both a parent’s
own behavior, as well as that of their children.

1.1 Research Design. We deal with omitted variable bias by exploiting the random assignment
of criminal cases to Norwegian judges who differ systematically in their stringency. Our
measure of judge stringency is the average incarceration rate in all other cases a judge has
handled. This variable serves as an instrument for parental incarceration since it is highly
predictive of the judge’s decision in the current case, but as we document, uncorrelated with
a parent’s observable case characteristics. This approach builds on our prior work (BDLM
2016), which uses a similar setting to estimate the causal effect of incarceration on inmates’
future crime and employment, without regard to parental status.
    The criminal justice system in Norway works as follows. If the police suspect an individual
of a crime, they file a formal report. A public prosecutor then decides whether the individual
should be charged with a crime as well as whether the case should proceed to a court trial.
About half of police reports lead to a formal criminal charge. Of these charged cases, the
public prosecutor advances approximately 40% of them to a trial. The other charged cases
are either dismissed, directly assigned a fine, or sent to mediation by the public prosecutor.
    Of the cases which proceed to trial, approximately 60% are non-confession cases, while
the remaining are cases where the defendant has confessed to the charges filed by the public



                                               2
prosecutor.2 We focus on non-confession cases in this paper. Once a case proceeds to trial, it is
assigned to a judge. If the judge finds the accused guilty, he or she can assign a combination of
possible punishments which are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Slightly over half of cases
result in incarceration, with probation, community service and fines combined accounting for
44% of outcomes. In a small fraction of cases (5%), the defendant is found not guilty.
       The law in Norway dictates that cases are assigned to judges according to the principle
of randomization. There are a few exceptions, such as for especially severe crimes or cases
involving juveniles, which we exclude from our sample. To have a sample of randomly
assigned cases for the same pool of judges, we limit our sample to regular judges handling
non-confession cases. Regular judges are permanent civil servants (versus deputy judges who
generally serve for a limited 3 year term).3
       We measure the strictness of a judge based on their incarceration rate for all other
cases they have handled, including both past and future confession and non-confession cases
between 2005 and 2014, and not just those cases which appear in our estimation sample.
There are 597 judges, each of whom have presided over an average of 238 randomly assigned
court cases. To construct our judge stringency measure, we calculate the leave-out mean
judge incarceration rate and regress it on fully interacted court and year fixed effects to
account for the fact that randomization occurs within the pool of available judges. The
residual from this regression is our measure of judge strictness.
       Table 1 verifies that judges in both the entire sample, as well as the sample of fathers we
will be focusing on, are randomly assigned to cases.4 The first column regresses incarceration
on a variety of variables measured before the court decision for the sample of male defendants
with children. It reveals that demographic, type of crime, and past work and criminal history
variables are highly predictive of incarceration, with most coefficients being individually
   2
     A defendant chooses whether to confess prior to knowing who their assigned judge will be. The absence
of plea bargaining makes the interpretation of our IV estimates easier to interpret (see Dobbie et al. 2016).
   3
     We further restrict the dataset to judges who handle at least 50 randomly assigned cases and to courts
which have at least two regular judges in a given year. Our regression samples are limited to cases between
2005 and 2013 so that each defendant can be followed for three years.

     While it would be interesting to also study the effects for mothers, there are too few female inmates.

significant. In column 4, we repeat this exercise for all defendants, regardless of whether they
have children, and likewise find these variables significantly predict incarceration. There are
a few differences in which variables are most predictive across the two samples; for example,
past employment history matters more for male defendants with children.
   In columns 2 and 5, we examine whether judge stringency can be predicted by this same
set of variables, and find no statistically significant relationship. This is true for both the
sample of all defendants, as well as the subsample of male defendants with children. The
estimates are all close to zero, and the number of significant coefficients is not more than
would reasonably be expected due to chance. The coefficients are also not jointly significant,
providing strong evidence for conditional randomization.

1.2 Data. We use several administrative datasets which can be linked using individual
identifiers. Information on all court cases between 2005 and 2014 comes from the Norwegian
Courts Administration. We link this information with administrative data that contain
complete records up to 2016 for all criminal charges, including the type of crime and date
of a crime. We merge these datasets with administrative registers containing demographic
information from Statistics Norway for every resident. A key advantage of the Norwegian
registry data is that we can link children to their parents.
   Columns 3 and 6 of Table 1 report descriptive statistics for individuals accused of a
crime and brought to trial. It documents means for the sample of fathers, and contrasts it
with the overall sample. Regardless of parental status, individuals accused of a crime are
a disadvantaged group: they have little education, low earnings, and high unemployment.
But the table also reveals that incarcerated fathers differ from the overall sample in several
salient dimensions. First, while the average age of all defendants is 33, the father subsample
is over 41 years old. Fathers are also slightly more educated, and commit relatively more
property crimes and fewer violent crimes. Additionally, fathers are significantly more likely
to be employed prior to incarceration. These differences will be important to keep in mind
when comparing the effects of imprisonment for fathers versus inmates in general.

2       The Effect of Incarceration on Fathers
Remarkably little is known about the causal effects of incarceration for convicts, let alone
the consequences of incarceration for convicts who are fathers. So we begin our analysis
by estimating the effects of prison on fathers, and compare these estimates to those for all
inmates. This is an important first step, as how children are affected will depend on what
prison does to their father and what they learn from his experience.
        One factor which could negatively affect children is an increase in a father’s criminal
activity after release from prison. A child who observes their father getting into trouble
with law enforcement could copy this role model. Continuing criminal behavior could also
contribute to an unstable home environment. While an emerging literature explores the causal
effects of incarceration on recidivism, there is little quasi-experimental evidence focusing
specifically on parents.
        Another factor which has been hypothesized to negatively impact children is a drop in
income due to imprisonment. Johnson (2009) uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and
its Child Development Supplement to document that family income drops when a parent is
incarcerated, and that income does not fully rebound after release. While this is some of the
first panel evidence on family income and incarceration, its observational nature means it
could still suffer from omitted variable bias.5
        To obtain causal estimates for an incarcerated father’s recidivism and earnings, we use
instrumental variables. In the first stage, we regress the probability a defendant is sent
to prison on our judge stringency measure, along with a set of fully interacted court and
year dummies and the controls listed in Table 1. As expected, the instrument is highly
relevant. While not reported in a table, for fathers the estimated first stage coefficient on
judge stringency is 0.498 (s.e. = 0.078). A similarly strong first stage is found for the entire
sample of defendants.6 The validity of this instrument is discussed in BDLM (2016).
    5
     Our prior work (BDLM, 2016) documents an Ashenfelter dip in earnings prior to incarceration, illustrating
the limitations of an event study design for this question.
   6
     The estimate for the entire sample is 0.434 (s.e. = 0.060). Note the first stage coefficient need not be one

     Table 2 presents results for the direct effects of incarceration on fathers. In these regressions,
we include the same set of control variables used in the first stage, including the full set of
court times year dummies. Our first outcome is whether the father was ever charged with at
least one crime within 36 months of his original court date; 58% of fathers in our defendant
sample re-offend based on this measure. OLS estimates reveal a positive correlation between
incarceration and future crime, with a 7 percentage point increase in the probability of being
charged with another crime. In contrast, the IV estimate has the opposite sign, and is close
to zero. While the standard error is large, there is no evidence of a recidivism effect.

are two-way clustered on judge ID and defendant ID. *p<0.10, **p<0.05, ***p<0.01.


     We next turn to employment. Our outcome variable is whether the father is ever employed
in the 36 months after his court date. Only 43 percent of defendant fathers find employment,
highlighting their weak labor market attachment. The OLS estimates in Table 2 suggest
a modest drop in employment of 6 percentage points. The IV results, on the other hand,
indicate a far more dramatic employment effect. Incarceration reduces a father’s employment
probability by a statistically significant 20 percentage points. The contrasts between the
OLS and IV results, both for this outcome and recidivism, are striking, and imply that the
wrong conclusions would be reached with a correlational analysis.
     To enable a comparison, we also present estimates for the sample of all defendants. While
since the sample of cases used to calculate the stringency measure differs from the estimation sample, and
because there are covariates (e.g., a full set of court times year dummies).


                                                                 7
the OLS estimates are similar to those for the father sample, the IV estimates diverge sharply.
For all defendants, we find a strong reduction in recidivism, with re-offending being cut
by almost one third. We also estimate a small, and statistically insignificant, effect on
employment for all defendants. This is the opposite pattern of results compared to panel A,
which showed results for fathers. This contrast is important, because it implies that results
for all defendants, even if causal, do not carry over to the subsample of fathers. For example,
policy interventions focused on helping families of inmates should arguably focus more on
the employment margin compared to the re-offense margin based on our IV estimates.
    The heterogeneous effects for fathers dovetails well with the results we found in our
prior work (BDLM 2016). For all defendants, we found that imprisonment discourages
further criminal behavior, with a reduction extending beyond incapacitation. We showed
the estimated decline in crime was driven by individuals who were not working prior to
incarceration. In contrast, for individuals working prior to incarceration, there was no
reduction in future crime, but earnings dropped substantially both during imprisonment and
post release. Our sample of fathers is more similar to individuals who were working prior
to incarceration, including in prior employment status, gender, and age. Hence, it is not
surprising the effects for the two subsamples are similar. Our results for parents are also
broadly consistent with those found in the working paper by Dobbie et al. (2017), which
finds that incarceration has little effect on recidivism for parents, but negatively impacts
participation in the labor market and family structure.

3   The Effect of Paternal Incarceration on Children
We now turn to the effect of a father’s incarceration on his children. In the U.S., researchers
have documented that children of incarcerated parents have more behavioral problems, are
less successful in school, and complete less education (e.g., Johnson 2009, Haskins 2014,
and Rud et al. 2014). Looking at intergenerational correlations in crime, Hjalmarsson and
Lindquist (2012) document that children with criminal fathers have more than twice the
probability of being convicted of a crime themselves, but that much of the effect can be


                                              8
accounted for by a parent’s education and other behaviors. Weijer, Augustyn, and Besemer
(2017) likewise document intergenerational correlations in crime for the Netherlands, England,
and the U.S. Contemporaneous research by Dobbie et al. (2017) uses a similar identification
strategy as we do, and finds large increases in teen crime and pregnancy, and a reduction in
youth employment in Sweden.
     We start our analysis of children by presenting OLS estimates in Table 3. These add to
the limited set of correlational papers on intergenerational effects. To maximize the sample
size, we follow children for as long as possible (up to 10 years after their father’s court date).
The results we show capture both a short run effect, while a father is still in prison, and a
longer run effect, after a father is released; this is because there is not enough precision to
separately estimate the two effects. We find that children whose father serves prison time are
1 percentage point more likely to themselves be charged with a crime, relative to a mean of
13%. We also report OLS estimates for school grades, and find no significant effect.

Notes: Ever charged is a dummy for whether a child is charged with at least one crime in the ten year period (up to 2016)
after the father’s court date. School grades are points on national tests (mean 50, std. dev. 10) in 5th, 8th, and 9th grade and
GPA points on a similar scale in 10th grade, and are averaged over all scores available in the ten year period (up to 2016) after
the father’s court date. Due to institutional constraints and data availability, we restrict the ever charged sample to children
over age 5 as of the parent’s court date (age 15 is the minimum age of criminal responsibility) and the school grades sample to
children age 1–15 as of the parent’s court date. Regressions include all variables listed in Table 1 as controls, plus court x court
entry year fixed effects and child age at time of parent’s court appearance. Standard errors are two-way clustered on judge ID
and defendant ID. *p<0.10, **p<0.05, ***p<0.01.


     Of course, these OLS results could simply reflect unobservables which are correlated across
generations, rather than the experience of having a father imprisoned. This motivates our
analysis which uses judge stringency as an instrumental variable. As shown in Table 3, we


                                                                 9
find no statistical evidence that having a father incarcerated affects a child’s own criminal
activity or performance in school, although we are not able to rule out modestly-sized effects.7
Many researchers have hypothesized that child gender could matter (e.g., Philbrick, Ayre,
and Lynn 2014), so we also separately estimated the effects for sons versus daughters. While
the OLS estimates go in the predicted direction (with sons being more negatively affected),
the IV estimates are too imprecise to be informative.

4   Discussion
Little is known about the impact of incarceration on inmates who are parents, and even
less is known about the impact on their children. Various theories predict children could
be either harmed or helped by having a father imprisoned, but the evidence base is scarce.
These results are some of the first causal evidence on the effect of prison for fathers and the
intergenerational spillovers on their children.
    We find that incarcerated fathers experience a large drop in employment but no change in
the probability of re-offending. Understanding that fathers are differentially affected by prison
time is useful for predicting and interpreting the intergenerational effects on children. We find
no causal evidence for an intergenerational link in crime or for an effect on school grades. We
are quick to point out that our IV estimates for children are imprecise enough that we cannot
rule out modest spillover effects. Hence further research using quasi-experimental designs
could help provide a better understanding of the collateral costs of parental incarceration on
children. As more data become available which can follow children for a longer time period,
it would be especially interesting to study longer-term outcomes like children’s adult crime
and employment.
    It is important to recognize our findings may not extrapolate to other countries, where
the experience of being in prison for a parent could be quite different. For example, prisons in
Norway (as in many European countries) emphasize rehabilitation and are relatively humane
   7
     One possible reason our results diverge somewhat from Dobbie et al. (2017) is that both their estimates
and our estimates are imprecisely estimated, and so the differences between the two studies are due to
statistical noise.

compared to the U.S. And while prison sentences in Norway and the rest of Europe average
around 8 months, they are closer to 3 years in the U.S. These divergent sentence lengths
contribute to the fact that the U.S. is an outlier in incarceration rates, with a rate which is
roughly 7 times the European average.8 For these reasons, our findings are probably more
applicable to Europe than the U.S.
