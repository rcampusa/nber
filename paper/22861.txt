                                         ABSTRACT

We develop a conceptual framework and empirically investigate how a permanent emergency
department (ED) closure affects patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We first
document that large increases in driving time to closest ED are more likely to happen in low-
income communities and communities that had fewer medical resources at baseline. Then using
a difference-in-differences design, we estimate the effect of an ED closure on access to cardiac
care technology, treatment, and health outcomes among Medicare patients with AMI who lived in
24,567 ZIP codes that experienced no change, an increase of <10 minutes, 10 to <30 minutes, and
30 minutes in driving time to their closest ED. Overall, access to cardiac care declined in all
communities experiencing a closure, with access to a coronary care unit decreasing by 18.64
percentage points (95% CI -30.15, -7.12) for those experiencing 30-minute increase in driving
time. Even after controlling for access to technology and treatment, patients with the longest
delays experienced a 6.58 (95% CI 2.49, 10.68) and 6.52 (95%CI 1.69, 11.35) percentage point
increase in 90-day and 1-year mortality, respectively, compared with those not experiencing
changes in distance. Our results also suggest that the predominant mechanism behind the
mortality increase appeared to be time delay as opposed to availability of specialized cardiac
treatment.

Introduction

       Emergency departments (ED) play a critical part in the U.S. health care system. They

serve as the first and last resort for those who need immediate care as well as those without

access to regular care, and they play a key role in disaster response (Institute of Medicine 2006a).

Within the past two decades, the annual number of ED visits increased by over 40%, but the

number of EDs decreased by 11% (AHA 2015), with an increasing proportion of the remaining

EDs considered “safety-net” EDs (Tang et al. 2010). This shift has resulted in great concern

about the availability of emergency care and the healthcare system’s ability to provide accessible

care (Hsia et al. 2012b; Institute of Medicine 2006b).

       The closure of an ED can have a profound effect on a community. On the one hand, prior

literature has documented the adverse effects of ED closures, which include an increase in ED

travel distance (Hsia et al. 2012a), higher mortality rates (Liu, Srebotnjak, and Hsia 2014), and

an increase in crowding and ambulance diversion (Sun et al. 2006). On the other hand, it has

been posited that closures of EDs or hospitals could improve acute care by removing poor-

performers from the market (Evans 2015); that is, even if people must travel further, they would

receive superior care (Fleming et al. 1995). Moreover, permanent closure of a local ED could

have an amplified effect for patients experiencing time-sensitive illnesses requiring prompt

intervention, such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

       While concerns about the potential adverse effects of ED closure remain at large, little

systematic empirical evidence investigates the effect of ED closure on patient care and health

outcomes at the population level. The closest study examined changes in mortality rates among

Medicare AMI patients between 1995 and 2005, and found that communities that experienced an

ED shut down and large increases in driving time to their next available ED had substantial



                                                                                                    3
higher mortality rates; however, the effects dissipated after a few years (Shen and Hsia 2012).

       In this study, using nationally representative data, we expand upon this previous work

and present a comprehensive framework that explores the mechanisms through which permanent

ED closure affects patient access, treatment, and health outcomes in a community. Proper

identification of these mechanisms allows policymakers to identify high-risk communities that

might need targeted interventions and implement evidence based solutions that improve overall

population health. Our research objectives are two-fold. In the first part, we document the

geographical distribution of ED closures and explore differences in communities where ED

closures occurred. Second, based on the conceptual framework developed below, we compare

changes in access to cardiac technology (availability of catheterization lab, cardiac care unit, and

cardiac surgery capacity), treatment received (PTCA and thrombolytic therapy), and health

outcomes (30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality) among Medicare AMI patients whose

communities experience varying degrees of driving time increases to their next available ED

when the closest ED to the community shuts down, relative to patients from communities that do

not experience any permanent ED closure.



Conceptual framework

       Figure 1 lays out potential paths through which patient care and outcomes could be

affected when the closest ED to the community shuts down. First, patients would have to travel

further to the next available ED (path A). Consequently, the time delays could result in a more

severe infarction, leading to worse health outcomes and patients potentially requiring more

intensive treatment (path A-1). Indirectly, the time delays could result in delayed or reduced

access to cardiac technology and likelihood of treatment (path A-2), which, in turn, could lead to



                                                                                                   4
poorer health outcomes. Under this framework, time delays have an unambiguous effect on

health outcomes, but an ambiguous effect on treatment rate. Our empirical models seek to tease

out these two competing effects of time delay on treatment rate.

       Second, if an ED shuts down in a community, patients would have to redistribute to

remaining operating EDs that might not have the same capabilities as the closed ED (path B). If

more patients redistributed to hospitals with better resources (either cardiac or non-cardiac

resources), we might expect to see improved health outcomes (or that access to better hospitals

would mitigate the adverse effects caused by time delays). On the other hand, if more patients

redistributed to hospitals with fewer resources, we would expect to see worse health outcomes

given the same amount of time delay.

       Lastly, the relative importance between path A and B (i.e., between time delay and

patient redistribution) would likely depend on the amount of time delay caused by the ED

shutdown. In densely populated communities, the next available ED might only be a few minutes

away. We hypothesized that in those communities, time delays would not play a major role in

affecting patient welfare. However, in rural areas where the next available ED might be more

than 30 minutes away, time delays could become a critical factor. Our empirical analysis

investigates the interactions between these two paths.



Data and Variable Definitions

       We obtained patient data from 100% Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR)

and linked the data with death date (if applicable) for years 2001-2011. These admission records

contain relevant diagnostic, comorbid and procedural information, as well as patient

demographics, including location (as identified by ZIP code). We further linked them with the



                                                                                                  5
Healthcare Provider Cost Reporting Information System and American Hospital Association

annual surveys to obtain additional hospital-level information.

        We identified the physical address and availability of the ED for each hospital using the

AHA annual survey between 2001 and 2013. To minimize reporting errors, we used California

Office of Statewide Health Policy and Development (OSHPD) facility data, an administrative

database, to verify ED status for California hospitals. In order to identify the closest ED for each

patient’s community, we obtained longitude and latitude coordinates of a patient’s ZIP code

geographical center using Census data, and longitude and latitude coordinates of hospitals’

physical address or heliport from prior work (Horwitz and Nichols 2009).



Patient Population

        We identified AMI patients by extracting records with 410.x0 or 410.x1 as the principal

diagnosis code. Following prior work (McClellan, McNeil, and Newhouse 1994; Shen and Hsia

2012; Shen and Hsia 2015), we excluded patients who had prior AMI admission within the past

12 months to minimize selection bias. As done in previous studies (Shen and Hsia 2015), we

excluded patients who did not incur any ED expenses during their inpatient stay (since admission

to the ED is the relevant population) 1, and those who were admitted to hospitals more than 100

miles away from their mailing ZIP codes. To minimize estimation noise, we also excluded

patients from communities that experienced multiple changes in driving time to their closest ED.

Finally, we excluded ZIP codes that do not have patients both before and after the access change

occurred. The final sample of the study included a total of 1.35 million patients from 2001-2011,

 Before 2006, we could identify admission from emergency department directly from MedPAR records
using source of admission as the criteria. Starting 2006, the data field was removed from MedPAR but
ED expense is available for all years. In order to have consistency for the entire study period, we use ED
expense as a proxy for admission through ED.

with annual number ranges from 107,000 to 134,000 patients.



Defining Access, Treatment, and Mortality Outcomes

       We examined three sets of outcomes. First, we examined whether a patient was admitted

to hospitals with the following cardiac technology: catheterization labs, cardiac care units

(CCUs), and cardiac surgery capacity (CABG). Second, we examined whether a patient received

the following treatments: percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), thrombolytic

therapy, and coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). While a certain degree of overlap between

the concept of treatment received and access to technology exists (for example, a person

receiving catheterization would have to be admitted to a hospital with catheterization capacity),

they both capture different pathways by which ED closure can affect patient outcomes as

described in our conceptual framework. Lastly, we examined whether a patient died within 30-

day, 90-day, and 1-year from the initial admission date.



Defining ED availability for each year

       Our key variables of interest included whether a patient’s community experienced an ED

closure and how far a patient from such a community had to travel to reach the next available

ED. To quantify the ED access change, we identified ED operation for each hospital in a given

year in the following steps. First, we used a combination of AHA and OSHPD data to identify

the ED service line for each hospital. Second, due to possible reporting errors in the AHA and

OSHPD data, we imputed missing or incorrect values using adjacent years (Hsia, Kellermann,

and Shen 2011; Shen 2008). Third, we followed prior literature in defining ED availability for

each hospital (Baker and Phibbs 2002; Hsia et al. 2011; Shen 2008). Opening year was defined



                                                                                                    7
as the first year of the first consecutive pair of years in which a hospital reports operation of an

ED. Closure year was defined as the year after the last year in which our data show the hospital

operated an ED.



Defining ED access change categories

       We identified the closest ED to a given community by computing actual driving time

between each patient-hospital pair using Google Maps queries based on the pair’s geographical

coordinates (via Google maps API key and automation software from Stata (Ozimek and Miles

2011)). For each year, hospitals with an operating ED were designated the closest ED for that

community if the driving time was the shortest for that patient-hospital pair. One drawback of

Google Maps is that the driving time is subject to real time traffic, which can be volatile. To

minimize errors in this estimation, we restricted our sample to communities where the same ED

was identified as the closest ED based on driving time and driving distance (which excluded

0.79% of our patient sample).

       Once we identified the closest ED for each community for each year, we evaluated year-

to-year change and classified the communities according to whether the driving time between a

community and the nearest ED met the following conditions between 2001 and 2011: (1) did not

increase (the control group); (2) increased by less than 10 minutes; or (3) increased by 10-30

minutes; and (4) increased by more than 30 minutes. The thresholds for the three treatment

groups, based from prior work (Shen and Hsia 2012), reflects the importance of timely care. The

three driving time increase categories allowed us to investigate the extent to which time delays

affect patient outcomes. We excluded patients from communities that experienced multiple

changes in ED access during the study period (0.12% of the patient sample).



                                                                                                       8
Methods and Results

Geographical Distribution of ED Closures and Community Characteristics

       Between 2001 and 2013, the number of operating EDs in general acute short-term stay

hospitals decreased, from 4,296 in 2001 to 3,875 in 2013 (Figure 2). Using the ED access

change definition described above and population count from the 2010 Census, Figure 2 also

shows the cumulative percent population in communities affected by ED closure. As of 2013,

15% of the population had experienced ED closure in their communities sometime during this

period. Figure 3 shows geographical distribution of communities that experienced changes in

ED access. While over 80% of the communities maintain the same driving distance to their

closest ED, closures happened all across the U.S., and was not concentrated in only a few states.

       We further explored whether there were systematic differences between the control and

each of the three treatment communities during the pre-change period by implementing three

sets of pairwise comparison using logistic regression. In the first set, we included communities

that did not experience any change in ED access (control group) and communities that

experienced <10 min increase in driving time (treatment) during our study period, giving the

dependent variable a value of 1 if the community belonged to the treatment group. The

independent variables included community population characteristics, hospital market

characteristics within 15-mile radius, and baseline mortality level. Specifically, we included a

community’s distribution of median family income, racial or ethnic minorities (black, Hispanic),

foreign-born populations, and elderly residents (≥65 years old). For ease of interpretation, we

divided all communities into three categories based on the distribution of a given subpopulation

(i.e., low, median, and high share). Hospital market characteristics included an indicator for



                                                                                                   9
whether the 15-mile radius market was ranked in top tertile of hospital HHI distribution, whether

the community’s hospital market included teaching, for-profit, government hospitals, and

whether the community had access to catheterization lab, cardiac care unit, and cardiac surgery

capacity within 15-mile radius. Lastly, to document possible differences in baseline mortality

rate, we used the National Death Index and included indicators for communities that were ranked

in the top tertile of deaths per capita due to AMI, accidents, and all deaths. In the next 2 sets of

analysis, we repeated the same analysis but change the treatment group to communities where

driving time to closest ED increased by 10-30 or ≥30 minutes, respectively.

       The pairwise comparison in Table 1 reveals several insights. First, large increases in

driving time were more likely to happen in low-income communities (those that ranked in the

bottom 1/3 of median family income) and communities with a low share of black population.

Compared to the reference community, a low-income community was 1.6 and 9.53 times more

likely to experience 10-30 minute and ≥30 minutes increase in driving time, respectively.

Second, communities that experienced a ≥30 minutes increase in driving time to their next

available ED were more likely to have fewer hospitals within its 15-mile radius; specifically,

they were 4.57 times more likely to be in a market that ranked in the top 1/3 of the hospital HHI

distribution. Additionally, there were virtually no teaching hospitals among those communities.

Third, baseline access to catheterization lab was low in communities that experienced large

increases in driving time. The odds of having access to catheterization lab within 15-mile radius

were 0.65 and 0.29, respectively, for communities that experienced 10-30 minute and ≥30

minute increase in driving time. There did not appear to be differences in AMI and accident

death rates (conditions that might be sensitive to immediate access to a hospital) between the

control and treatment communities. As we explain below, the multivariate models that


                                                                                                   10
incorporated community fixed effects controlled for these baseline differences across

communities.



Estimating Effects of ED Driving Time Change on Access, Treatment, and Outcomes

        Using a difference-in-differences design, we estimated the following equation:



where

   𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑡 = access, treatment, and health outcomes of patient i in community j in year t;

   Inc10𝑗𝑡 =1 for community j on and after year t when time to closest ED increased by <10 min;

   Inc10_30𝑗𝑡 =1 for community j on and after year t when time to closest ED increased by 10-30 min;

   Incgt30𝑗𝑡 =1 for community j on and after year t when time to closest ED increased by ≥30 min;

   𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 = demographic and comorbid conditions of patient 𝑖 in community 𝑗 in year 𝑡;

   𝐻𝑖𝑡 = hospital characteristics of patient i's admitting hospital;

   𝑍𝑗 = ZIP codes �ixed effects;

   𝛼𝑡 = year dummies.



Under this set up, our control group comprised of patients who lived in ZIP codes with no

increase in driving time to their closest ED. We applied a linear probability model with ZIP code

fixed effects to estimate the effect of increased driving time to the nearest ED on patient

outcomes (access, treatment received, and mortality), while controlling for time-varying

characteristics. They key variables of interest consisted of the three ED access change categories

defined above. The ZIP codes fixed-effects allowed us to remove time-invariant differences in

underlying population, health care resources and economic environment across communities that

                                                                                                11
experienced different degrees of ED access change during the study period. In essence, we

compared changes in outcomes from patients in affected communities before and after an ED

closure occurred to the change in outcomes during the same period from patients in communities

that did not experience an ED closure.

       In all models, we controlled for patient demographics, including 5-year age groups,

gender, minority and other non-white race, urban, as well as 22 comorbid measures based on

prior work (Elixhauser et al. 1998). We also included year indicators to capture the macro trends

and took into account the hospital organizational characteristics of the admitting hospital, such as

hospital ownership (for-profit, government), teaching status (defined as resident-to-bed ratio

exceeds 0.25), case mix index to capture overall severity of the underlying patient population,

size (measured by log transformed total inpatient discharges), occupancy rate, system

membership, and Herfindahl index to capture the competitiveness of the hospital market within a

15-mile radius (0 being perfectly competitive and 1 being monopoly).

       We applied this main model to all outcomes (access, treatment, and health outcomes).

The results on access allow us to directly assess whether ED closure redistributed patients to

hospitals with better or worse cardiac capacity. Coefficients from the three ED access change

indicators effectively capture the “net effect” of time delays as the result of ED closure (without

differentiating the mechanisms) for treatment and health outcomes. In the second model, we

control for access (by including indicators to capture whether admitting hospital had cardiac care

technology) when estimating treatment outcomes. Comparison between results from Models 1

and 2 allows us to decipher whether an ED closure affects treatment patterns through path A-1 or

A-2. In the third model, we controlled for access and treatment when estimating health

outcomes. Model 3 allows us to isolate the direct effect of time delays on health outcomes (i.e.,



                                                                                                  12
path A-1).

       Our final patient sample consisted of 1.35 million Medicare patients with AMI from

24,567 ZIP code areas whose admission dates were between 2001 and 2011. Table 2

summarizes the descriptive statistics of the population. In general, patient characteristics, such as

age, sex, race, and comorbid conditions, did not differ much across groups with different

increases in driving times. However, mirroring differences at the community level shown in Tale

1, patients in communities with a ≥30 minute-increase in driving time had a lower probability of

being admitted to hospitals with catheterization labs (40% vs. 82%) before the ED closure

occurred. They had a higher probability of being admitted to government hospitals (31% vs.

12%) and lower probability of being admitted to teaching hospitals (1% vs. 11%).

       Table 3 presents the coefficients of the three ED access change indicators from our main

model (Appendix Table 1 shows complete regression results). We did not find that patients

redistributed to hospitals with better cardiac care capacity when an ED closure occurred. For

example, the percent of patients admitted to hospitals with CCU decreased in all three treatment

groups after an ED closure occurred in the community, relative to patients in communities with

no ED closure during the same period. Findings showed a particularly striking decrease among

patients in communities where the next available ED was more than a 30-minute drive (by 18.64

percentage point, 95% CI -30.15, -7.12). We had similar findings of decreased admission to

hospitals with a catheterization lab and cardiac surgery capacity among patients in communities

that faced less than a 30-minute increase in driving time. For communities where patients had to

travel 30 minutes or more to reach the next available ED, access to a catheterization lab

remained similar after the ED closure occurred.

       As described in our methods section, we captured the net effect of time delays when


                                                                                                  13
examining treatment without controlling for access to cardiac technology. Model 1 showed no

associations between treatment rate and increased driving time due to ED closure except for a

small decrease in likelihood of thrombolytic therapy in patients with a driving time increase of

10-30 minutes (-0.69 percentage points, CI -1.29, -0.09) (Table 2). However, when we controlled

for access to the cardiac technology (Table 4; complete regression results are in Appendix

Table 2), we found that PTCA rates increased steadily across the three ED access categories: by

1.99 (CI 0.49, 3.49) in communities with <10 minutes increase in driving time, 2.37 (CI 0.61,

4.13) in communities with 10-30 minutes increase, and 2.67 percentage points (CI -3.42, 8.76,

wide CI likely due to small sample size) in communities with at least a 30 minute increase,

respectively, relative to patients in communities with no ED closure nearby.

       Consistent with the conceptual framework’s prediction, we found that a substantial

increase in driving time was associated with higher mortality rates. In Model 1 (Table 3),

patients whose driving time related to local ED closure increased by ≥30 minutes had a

statistically significant increase in 90-day mortality by 6.20 percentage points (CI 1.97, 10.43)

and 1-year mortality by 6.00 percentage points (CI 0.78, 11.23). To put the magnitude of the

mortality rate increases in perspective, the 90-day mortality rate is 22% in the reference group. A

6.20 percentage point increase represents a 28% increase in 90-day mortality. Patients whose

driving time increased by 10-30 minutes had a significant but less pronounced increase in 90-day

and 1-year mortality of 1.36 percentage points (CI 0.28, 2.44) and 1.76 percentage points (CI

0.67, 2.85), respectively. Patients whose driving time increased by less than 10 minutes did not

experience higher mortality rates after ED closure occurred in their communities. When we

controlled for access and treatment to examine the direct effect of time delays on health

outcomes (Table 4), the increase in mortality rate was even greater compared to the unadjusted



                                                                                                    14
results. Patients who experienced a drive time increase of 30 minutes or more had an increase in

90-day mortality by 6.58 percentage points (CI 2.49, 10.68) (representing a 30% higher 90-day

mortality relative to patients not experience any decline in access), and an increase in 1-year

mortality by 6.52 percentage points (CI 1.69, 11.35) (representing a 21% higher 1-year

mortality).

       We further investigated whether access to better cardiac care resources might mitigate the

adverse effect of time delays on health outcomes. We re-estimated Model 3 by stratifying the

sample into those that were admitted to PCI-capable hospitals and to non-PCI hospitals (Table

5). We found that the adverse effect of time delay was more pronounced among patients

admitted to non-PCI hospitals compared to patients admitted to PCI-capable hospitals.

Specifically, when we restricted the sample to those admitted to non-PCI hospitals, those who

had a ≥30 minute increase in driving time due to closure had an increase in 90-day and 1-year

mortality by 7.17 percentage points (CI 0.38, 13.97) and 7.83 percentage points (CI 1.40, 14.26),

respectively, relative to patients with no increase in driving time to their nearest ED. These

percentage point differences represent a 28% and 21% increase in 90-day and 1-year mortality,

respectively. Among patients admitted to PCI-capable hospitals, we still observed a statistically

significant increase in 90-day mortality rate albeit at a smaller magnitude (4.28 percentage

points, CI 0.27, 8.29).



Discussion

       In this study, we presented a conceptual framework and empirically explored the type of

communities affected by ED closures and how local ED closures can affect patients who require

prompt medical interventions. We did not find evidence in support of the concept that an ED



                                                                                                  15
closure benefits communities by closing down poor performers and redistributing patients to

hospitals with better resources. Even in densely populated communities where local ED closure

only increased driving time to the next available ED by less than 10 minutes, access to cardiac

care technology decreased after the closure occurred.

       We found that without controlling for access, the net effect of ED closure on treatment

was negligible, as there were virtually no decreases in likelihood for PTCA or thrombolytic

treatment when a community experienced a local ED closure. Such finding likely reflects two

competing effects of ED closure described in our conceptual framework: time delays might

increase the need for more intensive treatment, but at the same time decrease access to cardiac

capacity. When we controlled for access to cardiac technology, we found that the rate of PTCA

increased as driving time to the next available ED increased, suggesting that time delay is

associated with increase medical need for PTCA. An alternative interpretation is that after an ED

closure, patients who ended up in PCI-capable hospitals were systematically redistributed to

hospitals that had higher propensity to perform PTCA, holding all other factors constant. Our

data did not allow us to explicitly differentiate between the two possible explanations. However,

if such an alternative interpretation is true, we would expect the magnitude of the treatment rate

increase to be similar across the three treatment groups.

       Our results suggested that when patients had to drive at least 10 more minutes to their

next available ED upon local ED closure, time delay became the dominant mechanism in

affecting health outcomes when local ED closure occurred, both directly (as time delays causes

more severe infarction) and indirectly through its effect on access and treatment. Consistent with

the conceptual framework, we did not find an increase in mortality for patients experiencing a

small (less than 10 minutes) increase in driving time, suggesting that a closure of an ED



                                                                                                  16
relatively close to another ED may not have as serious consequences on a community compared

with longer increases in driving time. However, the adverse effect of time delay on mortality

rates became evident in communities that experienced 10-30 min increase in driving time, and

became substantial in communities that experienced more than 30-minute increase in driving

time. The adverse effect did not resolve even after we controlled for access and treatment,

suggesting that the time delays likely made the prognosis worse, directly affecting mortality

rates. It is also important to note that these affected communities are also the ones that started

out with fewer medical resources than the communities that experience no or little change in

driving time. Moreover, patients admitted to non-PCI hospitals had substantially greater adverse

effects of time delay on health outcomes, suggesting that availability of cardiac care technology

might mitigate the adverse effect of time delay. Prior studies have suggested that manageable

increases in patient volumes can result in better outcomes for a particular ED and medical

facility (Halm, Lee, and Chassin 2002; Kocher et al. 2014; Schull, Vermeulen, and Stukel 2006),

and this could counteract any potential modest delays in treatment. We are cautious in this

interpretation because we found that a relatively small increase in driving time related to ED

closure was associated with noticeable increases in mortality.

       This study differed notably from prior studies, as it covered a comprehensive set of

outcomes, used real-time data for precise driving times, and covered a more recent study period.

We acknowledged that people do not always use the closest ED in their community as their

source of care. Rather, our intention was to use changes in driving time to the nearest ED as a

proxy for disruption to permanent ED access in the local community. In addition, we evaluated

the effect of ED closure as a whole, without differentiating between ED closure as the result of

hospital closure or as a result of hospital closing their ED service line, as our goal was to



                                                                                                     17
evaluate the effect of disruption in ED resources in a community.

       We performed a variety of sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the results. In one

robustness check, we limited our patients to those with similar baseline area characteristics; in

another, we limited our analysis to communities where the number of hospitals at baseline was

comparable to one another. We obtained similar conclusions from all of these sensitivity

analyses.

       Nonetheless, our study had several limitations. First, our driving time computation was

based on longitude and latitude information of ZIP codes’ geographical center as defined by

Census. Even though queries from Google Maps allow us to take into account general traffic

conditions, mountain roads, and bodies of water, actual driving time to the same ED can be

different between two people from the same ZIP code especially in rural communities. Second,

we did not account for ED capacity on the day of a patient’s visit, which introduced

measurement errors in our measure of access change. Third, we could not capture the quality of

pre-hospital care; however, no study has shown an association between quality of EMS care and

ED availability.

       Our findings of increased AMI mortality point to the need for a more careful

consideration of the implications of ED closure. The loss of a local ED, particularly in regions

with limited options for acute care can exacerbate time-sensitive illnesses other than AMI.

Accordingly, prior to closing an ED, more targeted planning to distribute system-level resources

is needed.

       In particular, changes in ED access could have different consequences for different

communities, depending on the baseline medical care resources available. A closure of an ED

may not necessarily be detrimental for communities that have other medical care resources



                                                                                                    18
available within close proximity. However, our data suggest that ED closures are more likely to

happen in low-income communities that have worse access to critical cardiac care technology to

start with, and that ED closure can potentially have substantial adverse effects on communities

with limited resources for acute care.



Conclusions

       Our study showed that patients with AMI whose driving time to the nearest ED after

local ED closure increased by 10 minutes or more had a significant increase in mortality.

Among those who experienced a closure that resulted in a drive time increase of 30 minutes or

more, they experienced a 30% higher 90-day mortality and 21% higher 1-year mortality.

Increased driving time due to a closure was also associated with an overall decrease in access to

cardiac technology in the remaining hospitals. Our findings suggest that permanent ED closure

has substantial consequences on patient outcomes, particularly among communities with limited

resources for time-sensitive illnesses such as AMI. We find that the predominant mechanism by

which patients’ outcomes decline is primarily due to time delay, as opposed to changes in

availability of treatment. We can conclude that while provision of necessary cardiac technology

is one important factor for remaining hospitals, the effects of a time delay due to an ED closure

are not easily mitigated.
