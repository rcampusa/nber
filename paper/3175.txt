                                 THE AGGREGATE MATCHING FUNCTION


                                            ABSTRACT

   We present a picture of the labor market, one with large flows of jobs and workers,

and matching.     ~e   develop a consistent approach to the interaction among those flows

and the stocks of unemployed workers and vacant jobs, and to the determination of

wages.   ~e   estimate the matching function, using both aggregate data and data from

manufacturing and find evidence of a stable matching process in the data.       ~e   examine

the joint movements in unemployment, vacancies and wages -the Beveridge and Phillips

curve relations- in the light of our model.      We conclude that aggregate activity shocks

rather than reallocation shocks dominate the movement of unemployment.
