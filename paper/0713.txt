        Effects   of   Inflation on the Pattern   of International Trade



                                     ABSTRACT



     This paper examines the relationship between inflation, exchange

rates, and the pattern of international trade and payments in a small

economy with utility—maximizing agents and a transactions demand for

money. Fully anticipated inflation has real effects in the model

through its role as a tax on money and thereby on monetary transactions.

     An increase in the rate of monetary expansion generally reduces the

value of domestic output and alters the composition of domestic produc-

tion. The result is a change in the pattern of international comparative

advantage and trade flows. The initial depreciation of the exchange rate

following an increase in the rate of monetary expansion is accompanied by

a trade surplus and capital outflow, while the subsequent depreciation is

accompanied by a trade deficit.

 I. Introduction

      The relationships between exchange rates, monetary policies, and real

 trade flows have received renewed attention recently as Dornbusch and

 Fischer (1980), Lucas (1980b), Rodriguez (1980), Weiss (1980), and Stockman

 (1980a, 1981a) have examined the effects of real shocks on the exchange rate,

 relative prices, and trade flows. Dornbusch and Fischer, and Helpman and

 Razin (1981) also examine the impact of
                                           systematic anticipated monetary policy
 on the exchange rate and real trade flows. Wilson (1979a) investigates similar

 issues in the context of Dornbuschts (1976) model. The
                                                          current paper integrates
this research with recent work by Lucas (1980a),
                                                   Wilson (1979b), 'Jovanovic (1981),
 and Stockman (1981b), and examines the influence of fully anticipated inflation

on the exchange rate, relative prices, and the pattern of international trade.

Fully anticipated inflation has real effects in the model through its influ-

ence on the cost of holding money, which is used to facilitate transactions.

These real effects have impacts on the exchange rate, relative prices, and

the pattern of the international division of labor and trade flows.

     The conclusions reached here contrast with those reached by Obstfeld

(1980) in a related analysis. The essential difference between the analyses

is that Obstfeld places money directly into the utility function, whereas

money yields indirect utility in the analysis here, through its use in

facilitating transactions. This latter formulation has been utilized by Lucas,
                                        -2-



Helpman (1981), Helpman and Razin, wilson (197gb), and Stockman (1980a, 1981b)

and a related formulation has been utilized by Jovanovic. The conclusions

reached here also differ from those of Helpman and Razin, as this paper

extends their analysis to incorporate elements of capital accumulation,

the labor-leisure choice, and the markets for factors of production.1

      The analysis is conducted for the case of a small country that takes

its terms of trade as given by the outside world, although the last section

of   the paper discusses the implications of relaxing this assumption. The
setup of the   model is described in Section II.   Sections III and IV   inves-

tigate the effects of systematic, anticipated inflation on the relative

price of nontraded goods, the production and consumption of importables,

exportables, and nontraded goods, and the pattern of international trade.

Section V discusses international trade in assets and extensions of the

analysis to a full world equil ibrium model.



II. A Small-Country Model

       Considera country in which there is a representative agent who consumes

exportables, importables, and a nontraded good. Since trade patterns in this

model will be determined endogenously, the two traded goods will be referred

to   simply as good one" and "good two." Good one can be consumed directly,
or turned into "capital ," which is an input into the production of all three
goods.    The representative agent chooses a sequence of consumptions of the

three    goods, C1, C2, CN leisure, 1-i, and the allocations of capital and labor
across industries, to maximize utility,


                                                                                  (1)

  It will be assumed that U is concave and                                       = 0

  for all i       j, where U. denotes the second derivative of U with respect to
  its ith and jth arguments).

The nominal prices of goods one, two, and N,
                                             are denoted                    and Nt in
units of domestic currency. These
                                        goods are produced with capital, K, and
labor, £, inputs into the production functions
                                                        f, g, and h. Capital and labor
are both freely transportable across industries, so

                                Kt                                                 (4a)

       In addition to the budget constraint, the agent faces a payments technology

that requires that all purchases during a uperiodI be made with money holdings

acquired by the beginning of the period. This is formalized by a "cash-in—

advance" constraint that has been used in the papers cited above by Lucas, Wilson,

Helpman, Helpman and Razin, and Stockman. The constraint takes the form,3



                              +            +            +              -                                 (5)

           (7) equates marginal rates of substitution and relative prices, and the

 marginal utility of each good per dollar spent to the marginal utility of

 money on hand at the beginning of the period, A +                y.   (8) equates the shadow
 price of leisure to the value of the marginal product of labor in each industry,

 and (9) equates the shadow price of capital to the value of the marginal product

 of capital in each industry, (10)
                                                   equates the discounted marginal value of
 future capital with its marginal cost, and (11) does the same for money balances.

           Note that the marginal value of current period capital is



                  +
      V1              (l-ô)(A+y)p1                                                         (12)



and the marginal value of money at the beginning of the current period is



      V2 = A +        y.
                                                                                           (13)



Thus (l0)'and (11) can be replaced by the Euler equations

                                         (A+y)p1                                          (14)

       This completes the description of the optimization problem for a

representative, price—taking, agent in the domestic economy.5      The next

section investigates the characteristics of the equilibrium for the case of

a small economy (taking as given the terms of trade and foreign nominal prices).



[II. Equilibrium of a Small Open Economy

       The equilibrium conditions for the economy require that the money market

and the market for the nontraded good clear, i.e.



     Md = MS   and h(KN,N) = c4.                                                (16)




Together, the equations (16) and the budget constraint (2) require a zero

balance of trade.6

       The domestic nominal prices of traded goods, p1 and p2, are equal to the

exchange rate times the (fixed) foreign currency prices of goods one and two.

The domestic price of nontraded goods and the exchange rate, are, however,

determined endogenously by (16).

       Denote the rate of monetary expansion (through transfer payments) p,

so




     Mt =   (l-fp)Mti.

Then consider a steady state equilibrium. Since consumption is constant over

time in the steady state, (7) implies that there is a unique, constant steady

state value of p1(X-i-y). So (15) implies that there is a unique, constant

steady state value of Api, while (14) implies that c    is   constant in the steady

state.      (9) then implies that Xp1 takes a constant steady state value. So

(15) implies that, in the steady state,
                                                 -7-.


           A
                                                                                         (17)



 is positive except when there is deflation at the discount rate                   which is
 the rule for the optimal quantity of money. A positive value for y, however,

 implies that (5) holds as a strict equality for all t, so that the velocity

 of money is fixed in the steady state (at              unity),

    t4 =          + K' -   (1-6)K) + p2c2   +
           p1(c                                 PNcN                                     (5')
 and so



                                                                                         (18)
    p1




 Combining (9), (14), and (18), we have



                  =
                      (1+)]                                                              (19)



as an analog to the result in Stockman (1981b). Given employment of labor in

industry one, a higher rate of monetary expansion reduces capital and production
                                                            p1
in that industry. Given fixed terms of trade,               —, to   the small economy, similar
                                                            p2
results hold in industry two:




                                                                                        (20)



The change in proiuction in each of the traded goods industries, when i

changes, is independent of demand for those goods, given employment of labor

in the traded good industries. However, that is not true in the nontraded

goods industry. There, the equilibrium conditions impose domestic market-

clearing, so the response of demand for the nontraded good is central, as

discussed below.7
                                               -8-

     Equations   (19) and (20) utilized the first equation in (9) in their

derivation, so that they hold whenever the total capital stock is endogenously

determined. It is useful, however, to first investigate the properties of

the model with a fixed capital stock. This will be discussed in two stages.

First, both the aggregate domestic capital stock and its allocation across

industries will be taken as fixed. The model then is similar to Jones' (1971)

specific-factor model. Second, the aggregate capital stock will be assumed

to be exogenously determined, but the allocation of capital services across

industries will be chosen endogenously. Finally, Section V will return to the

case of an endogenously determined aggregate capital stock.



Exogenous Capital in Each Industry

     When capital in each industry is exogenously fixed, equations (9) and

(14) are not part of the model. As noted above, (7) and (15) imply that

(x+y)p1 and Ap are constant in the steady state. Now, sThce (8) implies a

constant steady state value of Xp1, (15) implies that



                 =      1
                        p1



which, in the steady state, implies (17). So, unless there is deflation at

the rate         (5')   and (18) continue to hold.

     The effects of an increase in p can then be determined from the following,

which follow directly from (7), (8), (5'). and (17),8

 Without loss of generality, units can be chosen so thatp2—                is   unity.
                                                                      p1
         The system of equations (21) -         (24) is discussed in the Appendix.
 Differentiation of the system leads to the result that a rise in p reduces

 Ap1, and through (22), reduces                   and         This reflects a substitution

effect on the part of agents away from goods and toward leisure asp rises, as
discussed in Wilson (1979b), Stocknan (1980b), and Aschauer (1981). The

allocation of labor across traded good industries changes to maintain equality

of (the value of) the marginal products of labor in these industries.

        The change in the pattern of international trade as p rises depends on

the relative magnitudes of f22 and g22, and on U11 and U22. Suppose, for

example,     that both the exportable and importable goods industries have Cobb-
Douglas production functions with the same constant-returns-to-scale technology
(same parameters), but that industry one, the exportable-goods industry, has
a greater (fixed) capital stock than the importable-goods industry. Then

              <    0 and an increase in p reduces production of the exportable by
g22 < f22
more   than it reduces production of the importable. If             U11 = U22 then the
reductions        in c1 and c2 are identical, so that both exports and imports fall.
An increase in p, in this case, reduces the total volume of international
trade.

       Production of the nontraded good falls with an increase in ii, but the

effect of a higher p or the relative price of the nontraded good,                        ,   is
                                                                                   p1
ambiguous, reflecting both a decrease in supply and a decrease in demand.

The effect of a higher p on the exchange rate can be determined from (5k),

(16), (2), and the condition
                                               -10-



     p. =   ep,           i =   l,2

where e is the exchange rate and p and p are the foreign currency prices

of the two traded goods. The exchange rate is consequently



     e=                    .                                                        (25)
          f ÷ p2
               —g + _Lh
             p1     p1


An increase in i, by reducing f, g, and h? raises e except in the case where

— (which may rise or fall with a higher p) rises sufficiently to offset the
p1
falls in f, g, and h. This exceptional case would correspond to a kind of

immiserizing (negative) growth, where the reduction in the supply of the non-

traded good raises its price sufficiently to increase the value of total output

in all industries.

       These results have been obtained for the case of fixed capital stocks in

each industry. If the aggregate capital stock is fixed but capital is free

to move across industries, then the last two equations in (9) are relevant

for determining the equilibrium distribution of capital across industries.

If there were no nontraded good, then the change in the pattern of production

in the economy when ji      rises     would be given by the Rybczynski theorem, with the

pattern of trade affected also by wealth elasticities of demand. With nontraded

goods in the model, the resulting reallocation of production depends partly on

consumer preferences, through the effect of preferences on the relative price

of the nontraded good and consequently on the amounts of labor and capital

employed in the nontraded goods industry. The derivation of these results is

straightforward; the next section turns to the case in which investment,

and hence the aggregate capital stock, is endogenous.

  IV.         Endogenous Determination of Investment and Capital
              If the amount of investment, and hence the aggregate capital stock,

  is viewed as endogenously determined, then (14), and consequently (19) and

  (20), are again relevant to the model. Given total employment of labor in

 each industry, (19) and (20) show a negative relationship between u and

 production in each of the traded goods industries. Similarly, given the

 employment of labor in each industry, (2), (7), and (16) imply

which is seen to be negative. However, unlike the effects of a higher rate

of monetary expansion on 1(1 and K2 (from (19) and (20)), (29) involves parameters

of demand as well as supply, and involves supply parameters from all three

industries.

       Given these results, (28) can be used to obtain the change in the relative

price of nontraded goods when the rate of monetary expansion changes, assuming

that          £2) and   are fixed. This is seen to involve two opposing effects.

First, the increase in (A+y)p1 as p rises, which can be obtained from (26),

(27), and (28), represents a wealth effect reducing the demand for nontraded

goods. On the other hand, the shift in the capital stock involves a reduction

in supply. So although production of the nontraded good is reduced, the

relative price may either rise or fall as p rises.

       The effect of an increase in p on the exchange rate is again obtained

from (25), this time using (19), (20), (29), and (28). Again, as in the

previous section, an increase in p raises e except in an Himmiserizing.growthhJ

type situation.

       These results hold fixed the employment of labor in each industry.

Given these employments, capital in each industry falls when p rises, and

the pattern of international trade is changed. Similarly, it was shown in

the previous section that, given the employment of capital in each industry,

the employment of labor in each industry falls as p rises. In both cases

the   relative price of the nontraded good may either rise or fall, and unless
the relative price of the nontraded good rises substantially, the exchange
rate rises (domestic currency depreciates).
       When   both total employment and the aggregate capital stock are free
to   adjust, and to move freely between industries, there are two additional

effects on the patterns of production and trade. First, since with a fixed
                                                -13--



 total capital stock (or employment of labor), an increase in p reduces

 employment        (or   the capital stock), the marginal product of capital (or labor)

 is reduced. This tends to reduce production in each industry. Second, the

 negative wealth effect of an increase in p raises the supply of labor, which

 tends to increase production.

         The interindustry allocation of capital and labor is now affected by

consumer preferences as well as technology and prices. This is true even in

the absence of a nontraded good. In order to see this, ignore the noritraded

good. Using (21) — (24) (except the last equations in (21) and (22), which

refer to the nontraded goods industry), one obtains



      c1 =                           < 0
             J(p1x1j1!),                                                            (30)



from the first equation in (21), and

          The first term on the right-hand side of each equation in (36) is

negative, as expected from the earlier results when the employment of labor

in each industry (ant total employment) was fixed. Now, however, there is a

second effect in (36) on capital employed in each traded goods industry,

associated with the change in the pattern of production when i rises.            As a

result, it is possible that capital employed in one of the two industries

(though not both) rises when i       rises.
          Suppose production in each traded goods industry is Cobb-Eouglas, and

that the exportable goods industry (industry one) is more capital intensive

than the importable goods industry. Then

Consequently, the second terms on the right-hand side of equations (36) work to

further reduce K1 but to increase K2. Equations (35) then can be solved for

the change in        and    as i   rises.   it is straightforward to show that

aggregate production falls when p rises. In the example being considered,

production of exportables falls, while production of importables may either

rise or fall (with a rise more likely the greater the divergence in capital

intensities across industries). With a homothetic utility function, the

volume of trade falls (as long as good one remains an exported good). If

the capital intensities are sufficiently diverse, then an increase in p may

cause good one to become the imported good and good two the exported good,

that is, there may be a complete reversal in the pattern of trade.

V. Asset Trade arid World Equilibrium

     The previous sections have examined the effect of an increase in the

rate of monetary expansion on international trade by comparing steady states

for an economy that faces a relative price of traded goods determined in the

outside world. This section discusses changes in portfolio and asset, positions

during the transition from one rate of monetary expansion to another, and the

impacts of an increase in p on the rest of the world and feedbacks on the

domestic economy.

     The steady state is associated with a constant net credit (debt) position

for the domestic economy with respect to the rest of the world. Initially,
                                           p1
retain the small country assumption that — is given by the rest of the world,
                                           p2
and assume that there is a foreign asset, that may be held by domestic residents,

that earns a real rate of return of        Consider an increase in p. The

resulting decline in K in the steady state can be accomplished immediately

if capital can be exported. Since consumption behavior (see (7)) is of a

permanent—income type, the domes.tic country does not trade away capital in

return for consumption goods, but, rather, for foreign assets. The interest

on these assets then finances a steady stream of future consumption, with

the principal intact. Thus an increase in p leads to an immediate current

account surplus and capital account deficit. Recall that this is associated

with a depreciation of domestic currency. Following this immediate current

account surplus is a trade deficit (associated with an equal service account

surplus) in the new steady state, and a continuing depreciation of domestic

currency. So, while the initial increase in the exchange rate following an

increase in p is associated with a trade surplus and capital outflow, the

subsequent rise in the exchange rate over time is associated with a trade

deficit.
      The changing relationship between the balance of trade and exchange

 rate movements is similar to a conclusion reached by Dornbusch and Fischer

 as a response to an anticipated one-time change in the money supply. In

 their model the initial surplus and subsequent deficit are part of the

 transition back to the initial real equilibrium. Here, the initial surplus

and subsequent trade deficit occur in response to an increase in the rate

of monetary expansion, and are associated with the economy's movement to

a new real equilibrium.

     Although the model presented in this paper considers a single (small,

open) economy, the results can shed some light on the new world equilibrium.

In the Cobb-Douglas case considered in Section IV, the decline in exports

of good one and imports of good two due to an increase in the rate of
                                          p1
monetary expansion would tend to raise — on world markets. This would
                                          p2
induce the rest of the world to shift resources away from industry two

and into industry one. As a result, world factor prices'would change.

If industry one is relatively apita1 intensive in the rest of the world,

as it is in the domestic country, the Stolper-Samuelson theorem implies

an increase in the real return to capital and a decrease in the real

return to labor. This would induce additional investment and capital

accumulation in the rest of the world until the foreign analogs of (19)

and (20) are satisfied. Consequently, in the new steady state equilibrium,

the reduction in the domestic capital stock would be partly offset by an

increase in the foreign capital stock.
                                     p1
     The extent to which a change in —, determined on world markets, feeds
                                     p2
back on the domestic economy obviously depends on the size of the country,

the magnitude of the initial shift in trade patterns following a change in

p, and the elasticity of substitution in production along the transformation
                                         -18-


curve in the rest of the world. It also depends upon the behavior of labor

supply in the rest of the world, since, through the foreign analogs of (19)

and (20), the behavior of labor supply affects the magnitude of capital

accumulation in the rest of the world. Foreign capital accumulation thus

provides an additional margin of substitution when a single country

experiences an increase in inflation. This additional margin of sub—

stitution would be absent, however, if the increase in inflation were world-

wide.




VI.     Concluding Remarks

        Recent models of exchange rates and real trade flows have focused

on the effects of real disturbances in relative prices, exchange rates,

and asset accumulation. The effects of monetary changes in these models

have typically emphasized real-balance effects or Mundell-Tobin non—

neutralities. This paper has examined the effect on exchange rates and

the pattern of international trade of an increase in the rate of monetary

expansion. The framework for the introduction of money was borrowed from

recent research on monetary economies with transactions technologies that

motivate a demand for fiat money. Although the paper has focused on the

effects of monetary expansion, the framework of the analysis maintains the

features that have been emphasized in the recent work on the effects of real

disturbances.

        An increase in the rate of monetary expansion has real effects in the

model presented here because it raises the cost of transacting, since, with

a transactions demand for money, money is more costly to hold. Given an

exogenous stock of capital and its allocation across industries, an increase

in the rate of monetary expansion reduces the employment of labor in the

exportables, importables, and nontraded goods industries, and alters the
                                       —l 9-




 nation's comparative advantage. When capital can freely move between

 industries, the total employment of labor falls but some industries may

 expand production. With capital accumulation or decumulation permitted,

an increase in the rate of monetary expansion reduces the aggregate

capital stock as well, further affecting the nation's comparative

advantage. The movement of capital between industries can result in an

increase in production in some, but not all, industries. If capital

intensities across industries are sufficiently diverse, the pattern of

trade may undergo a complete reversal, with previously imported (exported)

goods becoming exports (imports). If financial assets are traded, then an

increase in the rate of monetary expansion results in a depreciation of

domestic currency associated initially with a trade surplus and subsequently

with a trade deficit.

     The paper has not analyzed a full world equilibrium along the lines

of the paper by Helpman and Rain, and it would be important to do so for •

an empirical application, since the effects of a change in foreign inflation

on a country's pattern of trade would have to be distinguished from the

effects of a change in its own inflation rate. Furthermore, the transactions

technology postulated to motivate a demand for money is quite crude. Alter-

native transactions technologies might consider the role of other assets and

perhaps a system of financial intermediation. If the financial industry uses

capital and labor inputs and if the volume of financial services expands

with inflation, then there will be additional factors affecting comparative

advantage and the pattern of trade.

       'Helpman and Razin, however, examine a full 2 country world equilibrium

 model, while the current paper is mainly restricted to a small open economy.

      2The representative agent is a demander and supplier of all three goods.

 While any individual may actually supply labor to only one industry, financial

 markets within the economy permit each agent to act as if he were a hypothetical

 representative agent supplying all three goods.

      31n the papers by Lucas (1980b), Helpman (1981), Helpman and Razin (1981),

 and Stockman (1980a), there are two equations of the form (5), one for domestic

 money and domestic purchases, and the other for foreign money held by domestic

 residents associated with their purchases of foreign goods. Here it is assumed

 that domestic importers are able to exchange domestic money for foreign money

just prior to their purchase of foreign goods, so there need not be a trans-

actions demand for foreign money. Alternatively, the analysis in the paper

may be interpreted as assuming that the domestic currency is used in all

international trade transactions.

     4An interior solution is assumed, so non-negativity constraints are not

explicitly considered.

     5A1 though the current analysis does not explicitly include trade in

financial assets, their introduction into the analysis is straightforward,

following, for example, Helpman (1981). Section V discusses the transition

between alternative steady states in the presence of tradeable financial

assets.


     6More generally, the equations imply a zero balance of payments. See

footnote 5.


      See equation (29).

           Equation (24) comes from (2) and (16)

           The real return may be in terms of either traded good, since —   is

fixed. If the real return differed from , then there would be no steady

state, since individuals would choose a rising or    falling   consumption path

over   time in order to equate the marginal rate of substitution of consumption
in   adjacent periods to the relative price.
