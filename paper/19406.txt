This study makes use of detailed student-level data from eight cohorts of first-year students at Northwestern
University to investigate the relative effects of tenure track/tenured versus non-tenure line faculty on
student learning. We focus on classes taken during a student’s first term at Northwestern, and employ
a unique identification strategy in which we control for both student-level fixed effects and next-class-taken
fixed effects to measure the degree to which non-tenure line faculty contribute more or less to lasting
student learning than do other faculty. We find consistent evidence that students learn relatively more
from non-tenure line professors in their introductory courses. These differences are present across
a wide variety of subject areas, and are particularly pronounced for Northwestern’s average students
and less-qualified students.

I. Introduction

       The role of tenure in American higher education has been reduced dramatically in

recent decades. In 1975, 57% of all faculty (excluding graduate students) were in the

tenure system; by 2009 that figure had been cut almost in half to 30%.1 Some observers

predict that the share of tenured/tenure track faculty will bottom out at between 15-20%,

with tenure being largely limited to the flagship public and private research universities

and the wealthiest of the liberal arts colleges.2

       There is evidence that this trend accelerated after January 1, 1994, when

mandatory retirement for faculty was abolished by federal law. Ehrenberg (2012) reports

that between 1995 and 2007, the share of part-time faculty rose at almost all institutional

types while, among full-time faculty, the movement away from the tenure system has

quickened. Especially notable is the rise of the full-time, non-tenure track professor at

Ph.D. granting universities. Their representation within the entire group of full-time

faculty went from 24% to 35% at public doctoral institutions and from 18% to 46% at

private non-profit doctoral institutions.

       This trend has led some observers to lament the potential blow to academic

freedom dealt by the decline of tenure and to focus on the often challenging employment

conditions under which many non-tenure track faculty work (see, for example, June

(2012) and Wilson (2010)). Further, McPherson and Schapiro (1999) point to efficiency

gains from tenure; they outline its positive role in influencing the distribution of authority

within colleges and universities.

(2010) is a good example.

       While those considerations certainly have relevance in evaluating the impact of

the growing demise of the tenure system, there is an educational outcome that may be

measured more directly: do undergraduates taught by faculty outside the tenure system

learn as much as those taught by tenured/tenure track faculty?

       There have been a number of attempts to answer this question. On a national

level, Ehrenberg and Zhang (2005) present evidence that hiring more part-time and non-

tenured faculty lowers institutional graduation rates. This result is bolstered by Bettinger

and Long (2006), who find a similarly negative effect on aggregate levels of persistence

when they focus specifically on part-time adjuncts. These types of results indicate that

even if non-tenure track professors are more popular with students – perhaps because of

classroom behaviors that maximize student evaluations but not student learning – they

nonetheless might not be successful in improving students’ longer-term prospects.3 To

date, however, there exists little evidence on the effects of faculty tenure track status on

genuine student learning.

       The limited existing evidence on the relative performance of tenure track/tenured

professors versus faculty outside the tenure system makes it difficult for college and

university decision-makers to determine the optimal staffing of their classrooms. This is

particularly relevant for research universities, which face a multi-tasking problem of

maximizing an objective function that includes both the production of cutting-edge

research and the provision of outstanding undergraduate teaching. While the paper

closest to this one in the literature, Bettinger and Long (2010), presents a novel approach

to measuring the effects of tenure line versus other instruction, their analysis is largely

3
  Carrell and West (2010) show that instructors who have better student evaluations tend
to actually produce lower levels of “deep learning.”

                                              3
centered on institutions whose principal purpose is teaching. In addition, while they find

some evidence that non-tenure track faculty induce student interest in a subject, as

measured by the likelihood that students take additional courses in that subject, they are

not able to study how students perform in subsequent classes – an ideal way to see

whether instructional quality has a lasting impact. When one only observes student

evaluations of their instructors, or the likelihood that students take more classes in the

subject, it is difficult to judge whether one type of instructor is genuinely better at

education – that is, do they produce more “deep learning” in the words of Carrell and

West (2010) – or just whether they are more popular. Hoffmann and Oreopoulos (2009)

evaluate teacher quality in a Canadian research university setting but, like Bettinger and

Long (2010), only observe the likelihood that students take additional classes in the same

subject, rather than observe their academic performance in future classes.4 They find no

evidence that non-tenure track faculty are either better or worse at inspiring students to

take more classes in their subjects. Carrell and West’s (2010) analysis of professor

quality examines follow-on classes, and has outstanding internal validity as it relies on

the random assignment of students to classes, but it is also based at an institution (the

U.S. Air Force Academy) where teaching, rather than research, is the dominant function.

In addition, Carrell and West do not directly take on the question of whether non-tenure

track faculty make for better or worse instructors.




4 Hoffmann and Oreopoulos do study student performance in courses with standardized
tests shared across individual class sections in the same term as their measure of
instructor quality, but they do not perform a head-to-head comparison of lecturers versus
tenure-track faculty members (their comparison controls for a measure of instructor
quality) and they are not able to follow students into future classes to gauge “deep
learning.”

                                               4
       We bring to bear the first evidence within the research university setting regarding

the relative effect of professors within the tenure system as opposed to those outside it

where we can observe student performance in subsequent classes in the same subject.

Specifically, we examine the initial classes taken by first-term freshmen in eight cohorts

of undergraduates at Northwestern University, a mid-sized research university that is one

of the twenty six private universities among the sixty two members of the Association of

American Universities and which consistently ranks amongst the most selective

undergraduate institutions in the United States. Our identification strategy involves

observing whether a student who takes, say, introductory economics with a faculty

member outside of the tenure system and introductory political science with a tenure

track professor in his or her first term at Northwestern is (1) relatively more likely to take

a second political science class than another economics class, and (2) conditional on

taking more classes in both subjects, more likely to perform better in the political science

class than in the economics class.

       The answers to these questions should shed light on one of the most important

outcomes relating to the dramatic change in the professorate – its impact on student

learning.



II. Data and methods

       We make use of data on all Northwestern University freshmen who entered

between fall 2001 and fall 2008, a total of 15,662 students.5 Our principal model for



5We limit our analysis to students who entered Northwestern in fall 2008 or before to
give students sufficient time to complete their studies. 98 percent of students who
ultimately earn an undergraduate degree at Northwestern do so within five years.

                                              5
estimating the relationship between the tenure track/tenured versus non-tenure track

status of a student’s instructor and that student’s level of learning in that subject is

                               Gicst+1 = αi + γcst+1 + βList + εist ,

where, for student i taking a first-term freshman-level class in subject s at time t, L

represents whether the class taken is taught by a non-tenure track faculty member and G

represents that student’s grade (on a four point scale) the next time the student takes a

class in subject s. The subscript c pertains to a specific instructor-class-term-year

combination, so the inclusion of a fixed effect γcst+1 means that we are comparing the

relative performance in subsequent classes in subjects A and B of a student who took a

class in subject A with a non-tenure track faculty member and subject B with a tenure

track/tenured professor during his or her first term at Northwestern, holding constant all

of the specifics of the subsequent classes in subjects A and B. This means that we are

obtaining our identification from subjects where some first-term freshmen take their first

classes from a tenure line professor and other first-term freshmen take their first classes

from a non-tenure track faculty member. We also estimate linear probability models

without the next-class fixed effect but with student fixed effects where the dependent

variable is whether the student takes another class in subject s. We cluster standard errors

at the student level to account for potential within-student error correlation.

        We obtained data from several offices at Northwestern University for the

purposes of this analysis. The registrar’s office provided us with student transcript data,

including student grades, subjects, and instructor information; the office of admissions

provided us with information about the student’s initial declared major and academic

qualifications; and individual academic departments as well as the office of human




                                                 6
resources confirmed the tenure track/tenured versus non-tenure line status of all

instructors.6 Table 1 presents some descriptive statistics of the population of

Northwestern students. Northwestern evaluates freshman applicants on a five-point

academic indicator scale, where 1 is the strongest indicator and 5 is the weakest; 17% of

entering freshman have an academic indicator of 1, 57% have a 2, and 26% have an

academic indicator of 3 or higher (with the overwhelming majority of these students

having an indicator of 3). The average SAT score (or converted ACT score) for

beginning freshmen was 1392, and 17% of entering freshmen had not declared a desired

major at their time of entry to Northwestern. In 74% of cases, students took another class

in a subject that they took during their first term of freshman year, and when they took

the subsequent class, they averaged a grade of 3.39 on a 4-point scale.

       We limit our analysis to first-term freshman students because our identification

assumption is that students select their first classes with limited knowledge about

instructor quality or characteristics. We further condition on student fixed effects

because we are concerned that students who take classes with one type of instructor

versus another may be relatively strong or weak students. The majority of students take

at least one course with a non-tenure track faculty member and at least one course with a

tenure line professor during their first term at Northwestern; 20.1% of students take

classes only with tenure track/tenured professors and 3.8% take classes only with non-

tenure line faculty.




6 We exclude graduate students and visiting professors who hold faculty appointments at
other institutions from our analysis. Our results are fundamentally unchanged if we
include these two groups, regardless of whether we assign them to the tenure
track/tenured category or to the non-tenure line category of instructor.

                                             7
       The third through seventh rows of Table 1 break down descriptive statistics by the

combination of a student’s classes taught by tenure line versus non-tenure track

professors. The small number of students who take only classes taught by non-tenure

track faculty tend to be somewhat weaker than the other students; 36% come from the

bottom ranks of students (as opposed to 26% for the other 96.2% of students), and their

SAT scores average 1362 (as opposed to 1393 for the other students, and 1392 overall).

But among the 96.2% of students who take at least one class from a tenure line faculty

member, there is no apparent relationship between the division of tenure track/tenured

versus non-tenure track classes and initial preparation. All four groups have 17% with

academic indicator 1, 25% to 27% with academic indicator 3 or above, and SAT scores

average between 1391 and 1395 depending on the group.

       On the other hand, and foreshadowing our results, the four groups differ

substantially in terms of their outcomes. The probability that a student takes another

class in the subject generally increases with the number of non-tenure track taught classes

that the student takes in his or her first term at Northwestern, as does the grade earned in

the subsequent class. This latter pattern is especially remarkable, given that non-tenure

track faculty appear to induce relatively marginal students, who might have been

expected to perform worse in subsequent classes, to take those classes nonetheless. The

bulk of this paper explores these relationships in a more systematic manner.



III. Estimated effects of non-tenure track faculty on subsequent performance

       Table 2 presents our basic results. The unit of analysis is the student-class pair for

first-term freshmen at Northwestern. To provide a basis for comparison, we report basic




                                              8
OLS results in the first row of the table, and then successively add layers of fixed effects.

The leftmost columns of the table are for all classes taken by all students, while the

second set of columns restrict the analysis to the 89.9% of classes taken outside of a

student’s intended major.7

       As can be seen in the first row of Table 2, the simple relationships between non-

tenure track status of the teacher of a class and a student’s likelihood of taking another

class and the grade obtained in that next class in a subject are positive and strongly

statistically significant. However, because these relationships could reflect unmeasured

student characteristics, we compare subjects taken by the same student and estimate

student fixed effects models; the estimated relationships remain reasonably large in

magnitude – a non-tenure track faculty member increases the likelihood that a student

will take another class in the subject by 7.3 percentage points (9.3 percentage points

when limited to classes outside the student’s intended major) and increases the grade

earned in that subsequent class by slightly more than one-tenth of a grade point (with a

somewhat greater impact for classes outside of the intended major).8,9 We can further



7
  We show separate results for classes outside the student’s major to isolate the group of
students for whom the choice to take additional classes in the subject is most plausibly
impacted by the quality of the first professor they encounter.
8 Almost all classes taught by non-tenure track faculty at Northwestern are taught by

those with a longer-term relationship with the university. When we exclude the
temporary lecturers and adjuncts, the estimates barely change. Trimming the “one-off”
lecturers and adjuncts, we find that for all students and all classes, a non-tenure track
faculty member is estimated to increase the likelihood that a student takes another class in
the subject by 7.5 percentage points and increases the grade by 0.12 grade points. The
results are similarly nearly identical for all other rows in the table.
9
  The results are also robust when we limit our analysis to each of the specific colleges
(there are six undergraduate colleges at Northwestern) where the classes were offered. In
student fixed effects regressions, the relationship between non-tenure track status and the
probability that a student will take another class in the subject is positive and statistically
significant in three of the four colleges (arts and sciences, music, and engineering, but not

                                              9
restrict our analysis to students with “no choice” – classes that are always taught either by

tenure track/tenured faculty or by non-tenure line faculty during the entire time period

considered. In this restriction, we explicitly eliminate the possibility that a student is

“shopping” across instructors teaching a certain class. This occurs in 35.2% of classes

taken by first-term freshmen. The results are quite similar whether or not we make this

restriction.10

        In the last row of Table 2 we introduce our preferred model specification – one

with both student fixed effects and next-class fixed effects. In this model we cannot

study the relationship between non-tenure track status and the likelihood of taking

another class in the subject because by default all students have taken another class in the

subject. Moreover, we cannot limit ourselves to students with “no choice” because we

must compare those who took the introductory class in subject A with a non-tenure track

faculty member to those who took that same class with a tenure line professor to have

variation when we control for next-class fixed effects. When we estimate this highly-

parameterized model, we still find that having an initial experience in a subject with a


communications) that teach almost all of the first-semester freshman students, and the
relationship between non-tenure track status and the grade earned in the next class in the
subject is positive and statistically significant in all four colleges. In section IV of the
paper we also break down our results by the grading standards of the subjects and the
qualifications of students who intend to major in those subjects.
10 We can also limit ourselves to the small number of cases – 17% of students, 15% of

student-class observations – in which a student declares no intended major preference at
the time of entry to Northwestern. The results for this very restricted group are similar to
those reported in the table: in models with student fixed effects, the coefficient on non-
tenure track faculty is 0.120 (0.138 for students with “no choice”) when the dependent
variable is the probability of taking another class in the subject and 0.089 (0.088 for
students with “no choice”) when the dependent variable is the grade in the next class
taken in the subject. All of these coefficient estimates are statistically significant at the
five percent level or better. However, we do not have sufficient power to estimate our
preferred specification – with both student fixed effects and next-class fixed effects –
with the restricted set of students who are undeclared at the time of entry.

                                              10
non-tenure track faculty member increases a student’s performance in subsequent

experiences with the subject. The point estimates are around half the size of those found

in the student fixed effects only specification, but are still statistically significant and

sizeable in magnitude given that the typical student’s grade in the next class is a robust

3.39 out of 4.

        Because Northwestern relies somewhat more on non-tenure line faculty today

than it did a decade ago,11 and because Northwestern freshman classes have become

progressively more qualified over time, we also investigate whether the estimated impact

of having a non-tenure track faculty member are trending over time. (Of course, we are

estimating all models with student fixed effects and next-course fixed effects, which

would rule out the primary effects of temporal trends). As can be seen in Figure 1, when

we estimate our highly-parameterized model year-by-year we still observe a positive

relationship between having a non-tenure line faculty member and subsequent grades in

the subject in every year. In addition, there is no evidence of a temporal pattern in these

results, suggesting that any over-time trends in the use or utility of non-tenure track

versus tenure line faculty members is not driving the findings that we report.12




11
   The typical freshman in fall 2001 took 38.9% of first-term courses from non-tenure
line faculty, as compared with 41.6% for the typical freshman in fall 2008.
12
   One might also be concerned that changing grading standards over time are potentially
driving our results. However, grading standards have remained quite flat at Northwestern
during this time period. While the average next-course grade did rise modestly from 3.33
for fall 2001 entrants to 3.41 for fall 2008 entrants, student qualifications also rose during
this time period, with SATs increasing from 1376 for fall 2001 entrants to 1421 for fall
2008 entrants, so that average qualifications-adjusted grades actually fell slightly over our
time horizon. We describe in section IV our method for adjusting grades for student
qualifications.

                                               11
IV. Differences by subject and student qualifications

       Are the results the same for all students and for all subjects, or are they present in

some cases but not in others? In order to investigate these questions, we next divide the

course subjects along two dimensions. First, we split the subjects into thirds based on the

SAT scores of incoming students who intend to major in that discipline; we interpret this

as a measure of the perceived challenge of a subject by incoming students. Second, we

split the subjects into thirds based on a measure of the grading standards of faculty

teaching that subject. We calculate grading standards by regressing grades against

observed student qualifications;13 we call the departments that award higher-than-

predicted grades “higher-grading subjects.”14 These two measures are highly negatively

correlated – the correlation between the average SAT scores of intended majors in a

department and the grades that the department awards is -0.69 – but there is enough of a

discordance between the two to make reporting both measures meaningful. For instance,

though the highest-grading subjects generally fall into the low-SAT subject group, 33.3%

of the subjects with the highest grades are in the middle-SAT group, and 4.1% are in the

highest-SAT group.

       We report the results of these splits for our preferred model specification – with

student fixed effects and next-class fixed effects – in Table 3. As can be seen, the

estimated effects of non-tenure line instructors for an introductory course are positive for

all sets of subjects, regardless of grading standards or perceived challenge. That said, the

estimated effects are strongest for the subjects with tougher grading standards (that is, the

13
   Betts and Grogger (2003) and Figlio and Lucas (2004) measure grading standards in
similar ways, by comparing grades awarded to some external benchmark of predicted
grades.
14
   We are restricted by the registrar from identifying specific departments in this paper.

                                             12
relatively low-grading classes) and for those that attract the most qualified students. The

estimated effect of having a non-tenure line faculty member on subsequent grades is

more than twice as large in the high-SAT subjects as in the low-SAT subjects, and is also

substantial when comparing the hardest-grading to the easiest-grading subjects.

       This pattern of results could either be due to the effects being strongest for these

groups of classes or because of ceiling effects – perhaps in the easiest-grading subjects

most students earn top grades and there is little opportunity for distinction. As can be

seen in Table 4, it’s not the case that everyone earns a top grade, even in the relatively

easy-grading subjects. This table presents the percentage of students earning a grade of

A- or A in each group of subjects, broken down by the student’s academic indicator, the

admission office’s pre-enrollment prediction of a student’s academic success at the

university. We see that in the easiest-grading third of subjects, 13% of students with an

academic level 1 earn grades of B+ or lower compared with 28% of level 3+ students.15

While there is certainly more room for grade dispersion in the toughest-grading subjects,

where 45% of level 1 students earn a B+ or lower and 78% of level 3+ students do the

same, the point is that in no subject and for no group of students is a grade of A or A- a

foregone conclusion. Nonetheless, while we cannot say for certain whether the stronger

results for harder-grading subjects and those attracting higher-rated students is due to the

effects of faculty status truly being greater for those subjects or whether there is simply

more room for grade dispersion in those subjects, the key finding is that we observe




15
   It is important to recall that even the relatively marginal students at Northwestern are
still very highly qualified. The average SAT (or ACT equivalent) amongst those students
with an academic index of 3+ is still a very robust 1316.

                                             13
advantages for non-tenure line faculty across all subjects, regardless of our measure of

perceived challenge or grading standards.

       In Table 5 we split the population of students by student academic preparation

and then by both academic preparation and subject type. While we find that the best-

prepared students at Northwestern appear to perform about the same regardless of

whether their first class in the subject was taught by a non-tenure line or tenure

track/tenured professor, the estimated positive effect of having a non-tenure line faculty

member is present and strongly statistically significant for all other groups of students.

Moreover, there appears to be an interaction between class type and student

qualifications: while there is no apparent relationship between instructor type and student

outcomes for the top-rated students, a clear pattern emerges for the other two groups of

students. For students with academic indicator 2, the estimated relationship between

instructor type and subsequent outcomes is about the same for the subjects attracting

relatively low and mid-level students but substantially larger for the subjects attracting

the most-qualified students, and about the same for easiest and middle-grading subjects

but considerably larger for the toughest-grading subjects. For students with academic

indicator 3+, the monotonic relationships are even more pronounced, with by far the

strongest estimated results of all observed for the relatively marginal students at

Northwestern taking the toughest-grading subjects and those attracting the most qualified

students. Note from Table 4 that the gap in the percentage receiving an A or A- between

the toughest-grading and the easiest-grading subjects is 49.7 percentage points for those

with academic indicator 3+, but nearly as high (44.3 percentage points) for academic

indicator 2 and still quite high (32.9 percentage points) for academic indicator 1.

Therefore, this pattern of estimated effects of instructor type broken down by student

qualifications and subject type suggests that these findings are likely due to genuinely

differential effects of instructor type across subject and student preparation, rather than

just pure ceiling effects or differential likelihood of earning higher grades in some

subjects versus others.

       In sum, we estimated models with both student fixed effects and next-class fixed

effects, and found strong and consistent evidence that Northwestern faculty outside of the

tenure system outperform tenure track/tenured professors in introductory undergraduate

classrooms. Moreover, the results held for all subjects, regardless of grading standards or

the qualifications of the students the subjects attracted, though we found that the results

were particularly strong for tougher-grading subjects and those that attracted the most

qualified students. In addition, we found that the apparent benefits of taking classes from

non-tenure track faculty were enjoyed more by the less academically-qualified students

than by the more academically-qualified students – the biggest gains to faculty outside

the tenure system were for relatively weak students taking courses in the toughest-

grading subjects.



V. Conclusion

       Our findings suggest that non-tenure track faculty at Northwestern not only

induce students to take more classes in a given subject than do tenure line professors, but

also lead the students to do better in subsequent coursework than do their tenure

track/tenured colleagues.




                                             15
        How generalizable are these results? Because a key part of our identification

strategy is to limit our analysis to first-term freshman undergraduates, the evidence that

non-tenure track faculty produce better outcomes may not apply to more advanced

courses. Further, Northwestern University is one of the most selective and highly-ranked

research universities in the world, and its ability to attract first-class non-tenure track

faculty may be different from that of most institutions. Its tenure track/tenured faculty

members may also have different classroom skills from those at other schools. Finally,

Northwestern students come from a rarefied portion of the preparation distribution and

are far from reflective of the general student population in the U.S. That said, our

findings that the benefits of taking courses with non-tenure track faculty appear to be

stronger for the relatively marginal students at Northwestern indicate that our findings

may be relevant to a considerably wider range of institutions.

        There are many aspects relating to changes in the tenure status of faculty – from

the impact on research productivity to the protection of academic freedom. But certainly

learning outcomes are an important consideration in evaluating whether the observed

trend away from tenure track/tenured towards non-tenure line faculty is good or bad. Our

results provide evidence that the rise of full-time designated teachers at U.S. colleges and

universities may be less of a cause for alarm than some people think, and indeed, may

actually be educationally beneficial. Perhaps the growing practice of hiring a

combination of research-intensive tenure track faculty members and teaching-intensive

lecturers may be an efficient and educationally positive solution to a research university’s

multi-tasking problem.

Notes: Data include all students who enrolled in their first quarter at Northwestern
University during the fall terms between 2001 and 2008. Northwestern evaluates
freshman applicants on a five-point academic indicator scale, where 1 is the strongest
indicator and 5 is the weakest. SAT score is on the 1600 point scale and converted ACT
score is used where applicable.

Notes: Data include all students who enrolled in their first quarter at Northwestern
University during the fall terms between 2001 and 2008. Each cell represents a different
model specification. Standard errors adjusted for clustering at the student level are
reported in parentheses beneath coefficient estimates. Next-class information is recorded
for the first time a student takes a second class in a given subject area. Intended majors
are recorded by the Office of Admissions. Coefficients marked ***, **, and * are
statistically distinct from zero at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively. Data come
from 15,662 students taking 56,599 first-quarter classes.

                                        Note: These estimates are computed for the model with student fixed effects and next
                                        course fixed effects. Data include all students who enrolled in their first quarter at
                                        Northwestern University during the fall terms between 2001-2008. The black line shows
                                        the estimated next-grade effect, with the dashed red line indicating a 90 percent
                                        confidence interval.
