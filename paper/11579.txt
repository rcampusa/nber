                                            ABSTRACT




This paper examines the use of credit derivatives by US bank holding companies from 1999 to 2003
with assets in excess of one billion dollars. Using the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Bank
Holding Company Database, we find that in 2003 only 19 large banks out of 345 use credit
derivatives. Though few banks use credit derivatives, the assets of these banks represent on average
two thirds of the assets of bank holding companies with assets in excess of $1 billion. Few banks are
net buyers of credit protection and disclose using credit derivatives to hedge loans. Banks are more
likely to be net protection buyers if they engage in asset securitization, originate foreign loans, and
have lower capital ratios. The likelihood of a bank being a net protection buyer is positively related
to the percentage of commercial and industrial loans in a bank's loan portfolio and negatively or not
related to other types of bank loans. The use of credit derivatives by banks is limited because adverse
selection and moral hazard problems make the market for credit derivatives illiquid for the typical
credit exposures of banks.

1. Introduction

    Credit derivatives are bilateral financial contracts with payoffs linked to a credit related event such as

a default, credit downgrade or bankruptcy. A bank can use a credit derivative to transfer some or all of the

credit risk of a loan to another party or to take additional risks. In principle, credit derivatives are tools

that enable banks to manage their portfolio of credit risks more efficiently. The promise of these

instruments has not escaped regulators and policymakers. In various speeches, Alan Greenspan concludes

that credit derivatives and other complex financial instruments have contributed “to the development of a

far more flexible, efficient, and hence resilient financial system than existed just a quarter-century ago.”

(Greenspan, 2004). He further states in the same speech that “The new instruments of risk dispersion

have enabled the largest and most sophisticated banks in their credit-granting role to divest themselves of

much credit risk by passing it to institutions with far less leverage.”

    Statistics from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) show that the market for credit

derivatives has grown dramatically in recent years. The notional amount of credit derivatives increased

from $698 billion at the end of June 2001 to $4,664 billion by the end of June 2004, an annual growth rate

of 88% (see BIS, 2004). Despite the growth of the credit derivatives market, we know little about how

banks use credit derivatives to change their credit exposures. In particular, we know of no published

academic research which investigates whether banks systematically use credit derivatives to reduce their

overall credit risk. In this paper, we examine the use of credit derivatives by U.S. bank holding companies

with total assets greater than one billion dollars for the period from 1999 to 2003.

    The use of credit derivatives is not widespread among banks. In our sample, roughly 6% of banks use

credit derivatives. In 2003, we have 345 banks in our sample and only 19 of these banks, or 5.51%, report

the use of credit derivatives. With the available data, the best proxy for whether a bank uses credit

derivatives to reduce its credit risk exposure is whether it is a net buyer of credit protection. In 2003, the

last year in our sample, only 4.93% of the banks in our sample are net buyers of credit protection. The

total net notional amount of credit protection bought by these banks amounts to $51 billion, or 1.38% of

all bank loans and 2.73% of the loans of banks that are net buyers of credit protection. In our data, there is


                                                       2
no evidence of an upward trend in the net notional amount of credit protection bought, but there is a clear

increase over time in the total notional amounts of credit protection bought and sold.

    After documenting that the use of credit derivatives is limited to a small number of banks and that the

net transfer of credit risk from the banking system using credit derivatives is small, we investigate why

this is so. We first compare banks that are net buyers of protection to the other banks in our sample.

Consistent with existing empirical research on derivatives use by financial and non-financial firms, net

buyers of protection are larger firms.1 While the two groups of banks are not different with respect to the

average ratio of total loans to total assets, they differ with respect to the composition of their loan

portfolios. Net buyers of protection have larger fractions of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and

foreign loans than non-users and a lower fraction of loans secured by real estate than non-users. In

general, net buyers of protection have higher levels of risk than other banks: they have lower capital

ratios, lower balances of liquid assets, a higher ratio of risk-based assets to total assets, and a higher

fraction of non-performing assets than the non-users of credit derivatives. Finally, a larger percentage of

banks that are net buyers of protection also use interest-rate, foreign exchange, equity, and commodity

derivatives.

    We investigate the extent to which the use of credit derivatives to hedge can be predicted using

existing theories about why firms hedge. Hedging theories typically predict that firms with a greater

probability of costly distress are more likely to hedge.2 If higher profitability is associated with a lower

probability of financial distress, then the likelihood of using credit derivatives to hedge should be lower

for more profitable firms. Using probit regression analysis, we show that the likelihood of using credit

derivatives is negatively related to a bank’s equity capital, tier I risk capital, net income, net interest

margin, and liquid assets. Consistent with existing research on banks’ and non-financial firms’ use of

interest-rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives use, we find that an increase in bank size is

positively and significantly associated with the likelihood of hedging with credit derivatives. From these

                                                      3
findings, it follows that the use of credit derivatives is consistent with the predictions of hedging theories.

    We also study whether the likelihood of hedging with credit derivatives is related to the type of loans

a bank makes. We find that banks are more likely to be net buyers of credit protection if they have more

C&I loans in their portfolio and they originate foreign-denominated loans. However, while statistically

significant, the point estimates on the C&I loan variable imply small economic increases in the likelihood

of hedging with credit derivatives.

    Banks also can manage the credit risk of their loans by selling loans directly or through loan

securitization. We find that banks that securitize loans or sell loans are more likely to be net buyers of

credit protection. Consequently, the various tools banks can use to reduce their credit risk appear to be

complements rather than substitutes.

    Our results provide an explanation for the limited use of credit derivatives. A bank choosing to

manage credit risk exposures with credit derivatives must consider liquidity costs, transactions costs, and

basis risk. In a study on the credit default swap market, Fitch Ratings (2004) reports that the most liquid

names in the credit default swap market (the largest sector of the credit derivatives market) are large

investment grade US firms, foreign banks, and large foreign multinational companies. This is not

surprising since adverse selection and moral hazard problems are substantial for loans to firms where

banks have their greater comparative advantage over capital markets (see Duffee and Zhou, 2001). These

adverse selection and moral hazard problems make the market for credit derivatives illiquid for single-

name protection precisely for the credit risks that banks would often want to hedge with such protection.

The positive coefficient estimates on C&I loan and foreign loan shares in a bank’s loan portfolio are

consistent with the hypothesis that banks are more likely to hedge with credit derivatives if they have

more loans to credits for which the credit derivatives market is more liquid. Consequently, the lack of

liquidity of the credit derivatives market for typical credit exposures for most banks explains in part their

limited use of credit derivatives for hedging loans.

    This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the sample and investigates the extent to which

banks use credit derivatives. Section 3 looks at derivatives use of individual banks and shows what they


                                                       4
say about their use of credit derivatives in their disclosures. Section 4 discusses testable hypotheses

explaining the use of credit derivatives for hedging based on theories of risk management and banking

intermediation. Section 5 presents our empirical results. Section 6 concludes.



2. How much do banks use credit derivatives?

      We construct our sample of banks from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Bank Holding

Company database.3 Using this database, we select all U.S. commercial bank holding companies with

total assets greater than $1 billion (book value) and non-missing data on credit derivatives use for fiscal

year-ends 1999 to 2003. We then exclude banks which are major subsidiaries of non-U.S. banks and other

domestic bank holding companies. A bank is classified as a major subsidiary if at least 50% of its shares

are owned by another domestic bank holding company or foreign bank. The sample includes 260 banks in

1999 and 345 in 2003. The average amount of total assets for the banks in the sample is $21 billion in

2003, but the median is only $2 billion, reflecting the extraordinarily skewed distribution of bank sizes.

      To examine the use of derivatives by banks, we report in Table 1 selected descriptive statistics on

banks’ use of derivatives, bank loan sales, and securitization activities for year-ends 2000 to 2003. Data

on banks’ use of derivatives are from Schedule HC-L of banks’ FR Y-9C filings by bank holding

companies (see Appendix 1 for data details).

      Credit derivatives include “credit default swaps, total rate of return swaps, synthetic collateralized

loan, debt, and commercial paper obligations, and other credit derivative instruments.” (Instructions for

Preparation of Reporting Form FY-9C). Table 1 shows that over our sample period, the largest percentage

of banks using credit derivatives is in 2001. In that year, 8.16% of the banks used credit derivatives.

      Regulators require banks to report separately the notional amount of credit derivatives for which the

bank is the guarantor and for which the bank is the beneficiary in the credit derivative. As the guarantor

in the transaction, the bank is selling credit risk protection. As the beneficiary in the transaction, the bank

is buying credit risk protection. Except for 2002, the percentage of banks buying credit protection

                                                        5
exceeds the percentage of banks selling protection. This means that each year, except for 2002, there are

some banks that only buy credit protection.

    Table 1 also reports percentages of banks engaged in loan sales and asset securitization, activities

which also can be used by banks to manage credit risk exposures. Data on asset sales and asset

securitizations are from Schedule HC-S of banks’ FR Y-9C filings. Loans secured by one-to-four family

residential real estate represent the largest groups of loan sales which is not surprising since banks

typically keep only a fraction of the mortgages they originate. Loan sales are small for other types of

loans, but C&I loans are typically the second most important type of loans sold. Insofar as securitizations

are concerned, mortgages again represent by far the largest category of loans securitized.4

    Loan sales and securitizations reduce the credit exposures of banks on the loans sold or securitized,

but the extent to which the credit exposures fall depends on the extent of the risk transferred. Whereas

buying credit protection with a credit default swap on a name for which a bank has an exposure hedges

the bank’s credit risk to the extent of the notional amount of the credit default swap, loan sales without

recourse achieve the same reduction in credit exposure. With securitizations, the same is also true as long

as the bank does not keep any of the securities issued in the securitization or does not make implicit

guarantees.5 Overall, it is evident from Table 1 that loan sales and securitization of mortgages are much

more pervasive in the banking system than credit derivatives usage.

    Among the credit management activities considered in Table 1, selling loans is by far the most

common activity among banks. Though we do not report these results in a table, it is interesting to note

that in 2003, over 60% of the banks do not use loan sales, asset securitization, and credit derivatives as

credit risk management strategies.          Using only loan sales is the most frequently used credit risk

management strategy. In 2003, 16.23% of bank holding companies reported only using loan sales. By

contrast, only 8.99% and 0.87% of banks reported using only asset securitization and credit derivatives

respectively in 2003. Only about 3% of the banks engaged in all three credit risk management activities,

  A securitization involves a loan sale. The category loan sale therefore only involves the loans sold but not
securitized.

i.e., securitization, loan sales, and use of credit derivatives. There are almost no banks which report that

they do not sell and do not securitize loans, but use credit derivatives. In 2003, only three banks behaved

that way.

    The last part of Table 1 considers the use of other derivatives by banks. Banks also are required to

report the notional amount of the types of interest-rate, foreign exchange, equity, and commodity

derivatives used, as well as, the notional amounts of total interest-rate, foreign exchange, equity and

commodity derivatives used for trading and non-trading purposes. Interest-rate derivatives represent the

largest type of derivatives used by banks. Over 50% of the sample banks report using interest-rate

derivatives at year-ends 2000 to 2003.6 Foreign exchange derivatives are the second largest type of

derivatives used by banks with about 20% of the banks reporting the use of foreign exchange derivatives.

Less than ten percent of the sample banks report using equity and commodity derivatives.7

    Table 2 provides a more detailed look at the use of credit derivatives. This table makes it possible to

understand how purchases and sales of credit protection relate to loans of all banks as well as to the loans

of the banks that use credit derivatives. Unfortunately, the data we present is limited by the fact that,

unlike for other derivatives, banks are not required by bank regulators to report information about the type

of credit derivatives instruments used and do not have to split the total notional amount of credit

derivatives positions between positions taken for trading and non-trading purposes.

    Table 2 reports statistics on the notional amounts of credit derivatives used. As reported in panel A,

the total notional amount of credit risk protection bought and sold by banks with total assets of at least $1

billion was $988 billion at year-end 2003, up from $439 billion at year-end 2001. The total notional
6
  This number is significantly higher than previous studies which focus on all commercial banks and not large bank
holding companies. For example, in a recent study of risk management by US commercial banks by Purnanandam
(2003), only 5% of the commercial banks reported using interest-rate derivatives. Unlike our sample of bank
holding companies with at least $1 billion in total assets, Purnanandam’s sample includes all banks with non-
missing assets.
7
  While not reported in table 2, data on the breakdown of derivatives use for trading and non-trading purposes show
that for banks that report using interest-rate derivatives, interest-rate derivatives represent only 16.3% of the total
notional of interest-rate derivatives used by these banks. In contrast, for equity and commodity derivatives users,
derivatives used for trading purposes represent, on average, 65.0% and 91.7% of total equity and commodity
derivatives. About 53% of the banks which use foreign exchange derivatives use them for trading purposes. These
patterns and those reported in table 2 are not surprising given that interest-rate exposure is the largest type of
exposure faced by banks.


                                                           7
amount of credit risk protection bought and sold was 13.44% of the total assets of all sample banks and

26.75% of the total loans of the same banks at year-end 2003, compared to only 7.57% and 14.08%,

respectively, in 2001. Thus, the total notional amounts on bank books increased sharply both in dollars

and as fractions of loans or assets. However, it is important to note that not all of the derivatives recorded

in these calculations represent transfers of risk with counterparties outside the sample. For instance, it is

likely that some derivatives bought are sold by other banks in the sample. We have no way of knowing

when that is the case.

    As a group, buyers and sellers of credit risk protection represent a large fraction of the sample’s total

assets and total loans. The total amount of assets for these banks represents over 60% of the total assets

for all sample banks. The total loans of buyers and sellers of credit risk protection similarly represent

over 60% of total loans of sample banks in most sample years. Hence, while few banks use credit

derivatives, those that do own two thirds of the assets of all banks in our sample.8

    Panel B shows that the net amount of protection bought relative to total loans outstanding is less than

2% of total loans by the banks in our sample. However, the net amount of protection bought as a

percentage of total loans increased by 64.86% from 2001 to 2003. This increase would be consistent with

credit derivatives playing a greater risk transfer role towards the end of our sample period.

    The next three panels report averages across banks. Panel C reports the average total notional amount

of credit protection bought and sold by users of credit derivatives. The first row shows the numbers of

banks that use credit derivatives. The highest number of banks reporting using credit derivatives is 20 in

2001. This number does not change much in our sample since it is 18 in 1999 and 19 in 2003. The

average percentages of total assets and of total loans are smaller than the percentages reported in Panel A.

This can only be the case if the larger banks have larger percentages of total notional amount to assets and

to loans than the smaller banks in the sample.

 The top three banks in terms of total notional amount of credit protection bought and sold represent 30%
of total loans of all sample banks.


                                                      8
    So far, we have focused on the total notional amount of credit protection bought and sold. We now

turn to the banks that are net buyers of credit protection. A recent survey by Fitch (2003) reported the 113

global banks (77 European and Asian, 36 North American) were net buyers of protection. The first row of

Panel D shows the number of banks that are net buyers of credit protection in our sample. This number

varies across years. Though it is 17 in 2003, it is only eight in 2002. The average net notional amount of

credit protection bought is small compared to the total notional amount of credit bought and sold. The

average net notional amount bought by banks in 2003 is roughly $4 billion, which is less than 8% of the

total notional amount bought and sold. The net amounts bought represent less than 3% of total assets and

total loans – less than 3% in both cases.

    We finally turn to banks which are net sellers of credit protection in Panel E. Only two banks are net

sellers in 2003. The total amount of net protection sold in 2003 represents 1.68% of the total notional

amount of protection bought and sold.



3. Which banks are large users and what do they say about their use of credit derivatives?

    Sufficiently few banks use credit derivatives that it is possible to examine what they say about their

use of credit derivatives. Table 3 shows, for 2003, the list of banks that use credit derivatives. For each

bank, we provide information on their use of these derivatives. The most striking fact in the table is that

the total notional amount of credit derivatives bought and sold by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. ($578 billion)

exceeds the total notional amount bought and sold by all other banks in our sample combined ($410

billion). More than half the banks have a net notional amount of credit protection bought representing less

than 1% of the assets. However, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. bought credit protection for an amount that

exceeds its total loans and bought a net amount of credit protection corresponding to 11.74% of its loans.

    Like the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2004), we find that bank holding companies

make credit risk disclosures in various places in their filings. In general, users of credit derivatives

provide information about their credit exposure, net of provisions for loan losses, in their disclosures




                                                     9
about the credit risk of their loans. Information about credit risk exposure broken down by credit rating,

geographic segments, and industrial segments varies across banks.

    Appendix 2 summarizes the disclosures about credit derivatives use for the banks in our sample.

These disclosures vary greatly across banks. When information is disclosed, it is discussed in various

footnotes to the financial statements including trading accounts and related trading revenues footnotes,

derivatives instruments footnotes, fair value of instrument footnotes, securitization footnotes, and in the

management’s discussion of credit risk management. Some banks note that credit default swaps that are

used to manage the credit risk of the bank’s loan portfolio often do not qualify for hedge accounting. In

cases in which banks are both sellers and buyers of credit risk protection, banks disclose if the

transactions are offsetting. Some banks note that the marking-to-market of these two groups of credit

derivatives act like natural hedges. In other cases, banks disclose the amount of loans hedged by the

credit derivatives but in most cases they do not. Finally, banks disclose that credit default swaps are used

to create synthetic collateralized debt, collateralized loan, or collateralized commercial paper obligations.

    The 2002 10-K filing for J.P. Morgan Chase has a section on credit derivatives within management’s

discussion of credit risk management. J.P. Morgan Chase reports a sizeable gain from credit derivatives

for 2002. This gain of $127 million is included in trading revenue. However, the following year it makes

a loss of $746 million on credit derivatives used to manage the firms’ credit exposure that it attributes to a

tightening of credit spreads. The bank divides its use of credit derivatives to asset portfolio and

dealer/client activity. More than 90% of the total notional amount of credit derivatives bought and sold is

related to dealer/client activity. The bank also reports a net purchase of credit protection in the credit

portfolio section of its 10-K. The amount reported there is equal to the net amount of credit protection the

bank bought for asset portfolio activities. It therefore corresponds to a hedge of its credit portfolio.

However, at the same time, the bank is a net seller for $13.70 billion for dealer/client activity.

    Citigroup is the second highest user of credit derivatives. It reports that at year-end 2002, it hedged

$9.6 billion of credit risk exposure through the use of credit derivatives and other risk mitigating

techniques. Given the size of the total notional amount of credit protection bought and sold, it also


                                                      10
follows for Citigroup that the main use of credit derivatives is for trading purposes rather than for hedging

credit exposures in the banking book.

    Some banks, such as Wells Fargo, disclose only using credit derivatives for trading and “customer

accommodations.” It notes that almost all the protection purchases are exact offsets of sales of credit

protection. In contrast, other banks, such as Bank One, disclose primarily using credit derivatives to

hedge the credit risk of their commercial loans and loan commitments.

    In sum, Table 2 shows that a small fraction of large bank holding companies use credit derivatives.

Table 3 further shows that within this small group of banks, credit derivatives use is even more

concentrated. However, the uses of credit derivatives vary considerably across banks. In the next section,

we review the risk management and banking literature to explain why these banks use credit derivatives

to manage risk.



4. Why do banks use credit derivatives to manage risk?

    There is a growing literature that examines why firms hedge. Some of that literature addresses

directly issues concerning banks, but most of it does not. In this section, we examine the implications of

that literature for hedging by banks with credit derivatives.



4.1. Why banks hedge?

    In Diamond (1984), banks are delegated monitors with comparative advantage in assessing and

monitoring the credit risk of obligors. In his model, it is optimal for banks to eliminate all hedgeable risks

because the resulting equilibrium ensures that banks monitor credits efficiently and avoid costly

liquidations. We would therefore expect banks to hedge all their interest rate risk as well as other risks in

which they do not have a comparative advantage. The literature that focuses on the comparative

advantage of banks in monitoring points out, however, that this advantage of banks is likely to be smaller

for loans to large firms because these firms tend to be more transparent and monitored more actively by

other market participants.


                                                     11
    More generally, risk management theories emphasize the benefit from hedging risks that increase the

expected costs of financial distress (Smith and Stulz, 1985). We would therefore expect banks that are

more likely to bear greater costs of financial distress to hedge more. In the banking literature, banks

benefit from leverage. In particular, deposits can be a source of information (Fama, 1985) and a source of

cheap capital if competition is imperfect. Further, following Diamond and Rajan (2000), higher leverage

increases the incentives of banks to monitor and prevents hold-up problems. Since banks benefit from

higher leverage, they can increase their value through hedging since it allows them to have more leverage

for a given probability of financial distress. Through hedging, banks also can take on more risks for which

they have a comparative advantage for a given probability of financial distress. Schrand and Unal (1998)

provide empirical evidence of this phenomenon for savings and loan institutions.

    We would expect banks with less capital, banks with more non-performing loans, with weaker

liquidity, and with smaller interest margins to be more likely to hedge since such banks are more likely to

face financial distress. We investigate the impact of these determinants of hedging with the following

variables. Liquidity is measured as cash and liquid assets as a percentage of total assets. Non-performing

assets equals the sum of loans over 90 days late and loans not accruing, all divided by total assets.

Profitability is measured using the return on assets (net income scaled by total assets), return on equity

(net income scaled by total equity capital), and net interest income scaled by total assets. We expect the

likelihood of credit derivatives use to be positively associated with non-performing assets and loan loss

provisions, and negatively associated with liquidity and profitability.

    The presumption is, however, that the banks have a sufficiently high franchise value that costs of

financial distress are significant for them, since otherwise they might be tempted to take on risk to take

advantage of the deposit insurance put option they hold (James, 1988).



4.2. Why do banks use credit derivatives to manage risks?

    Banks have a comparative advantage in monitoring credits and hence in bearing credit risks. This

suggests that the reasoning for why banks use credit derivatives has to be more subtle than the reasoning


                                                     12
that leads the literature to conclude that banks should hedge interest rate risks.9 Morrison (2001) argues

that the availability of credit derivatives could adversely affect banks by reducing their incentives to

monitor and to screen borrowers. Further, the use of credit derivatives could make bank loans less

valuable to borrowers because the loans would entail less of a certification effect.

       A clean loan sale or securitization removes the risk of a loan completely from the bank’s balance

sheet. Hence, if a bank does not want to bear the risk associated with all or part of a loan, such

transactions can achieve that purpose leaving no residual risk or capital requirements. In practice,

however, the lemons problem in loan sales and securitizations forces banks to take steps to reduce that

problem. As discussed by Gorton and Pennachi (1995) and others, loan sales do so through implicit

guarantees and by retaining risk associated with the loans. For instance, in loan sales banks do not sell the

whole loan and with securitizations banks may keep first loss positions.

       By using credit derivatives, banks keep the loan on their balance sheet. Transferring credit risks with

credit derivatives therefore has risks that credit risk transfers with loan sales or securitizations do not

have. Banks using these derivatives have to bear associated counterparty, operational, and legal risks.

Further, banks often are unable to use hedge accounting when using credit derivatives, so that their

accounting earnings are not hedged even when credit derivatives are used for hedging purposes. As

Duffee and Zhou (2001) point out, these difficulties associated with the use of credit derivatives suggest

that everything else equal a bank would rather sell loans or securitize loans when these mechanisms can

be used at low cost. Consequently, credit derivatives are most likely to be used when the costs of selling

or securitizing loans are too high.

       Loans could be expensive to sell for a number of reasons. We already discussed the adverse selection

and moral hazard problems that arise with banks wanting to reduce their exposure to a counterparty.

These problems are reduced if banks want to reduce their exposure for a period that terminates before

maturity of the loan. A credit derivative would achieve that purpose if it matures before maturity of the

    Kiff, Michaud, and Mitchell (2002) review the issues that arise with various instruments for credit risk transfer.


                                                            13
loan. Since the bank would have exposure at maturity of the loan, it would have greater incentives to

screen and monitor the borrower.

    Most importantly, the existence of a relationship between the lender and the borrower will make it

less likely that the loan will be sold. First, the borrower may not want the loan to be sold since it would be

harder to negotiate with a lender who has no experience with the borrower. Second, the lender may want

to protect the relationship with the borrower. Third, relationship-based lending can involve implicit

commitments on both parties that would become worthless if the loan is sold. In all these cases, the bank

may not be in a position to sell the loan either by itself or through a securitization. In general, these issues

do not arise with small loans that meet recognizable criteria, such as mortgages, retail loans, and credit

card loans because these loans can be packaged in pools and relationships do not play much of a role in

how borrowers are treated in the event of default when the bank is large.

    We expect banks to be more likely to sell or securitize loans secured by real estate and retail loans. In

contrast, we would expect banks to be more likely to retain C&I loans, agriculture loans (loans to finance

agricultural production and other loans to farmers), and foreign loans.

    When banks want to reduce their credit exposure by buying credit protection, they create a lemon

problem. The protection seller has to be concerned that the bank wants credit protection because it has

adverse information about the name on which it wants to buy protection. Duffee and Zhou (2001) argue

that banks can use a credit-derivative contract to transfer loan risk for which that bank’s informational

advantage is small and retain the portion of risk for which the bank’s relative informational advantage is

relatively large. The lemon’s problem is sharply reduced when a bank buys credit protection on a name

with a credit rating since the rating provides a public evaluation of credit quality for the name. The

problem is also much smaller when credit derivatives and public debt are actively traded for the name

since adverse private information is likely to find its way into prices. We would therefore expect banks to

find it more advantageous to use credit derivatives to hedge credit exposures to rated names and to names

for which there is a market for credit instruments. However, if that is the case, banks are most likely to




                                                      14
use credit derivatives on those loans where their comparative advantage is smallest and be unable to use

them where their comparative advantage is largest.

     We expect banks to use all available instruments to manage risk. Therefore, we would expect banks

that use other derivatives or other forms of credit risk management to be more likely to use credit

derivatives. In our sample, all the banks that use credit derivatives also use interest-rate derivatives. We

expect banks that use loan sales, securitization, foreign exchange, equity or commodity derivatives also to

use credit derivatives. Since, as mentioned earlier, there are economies of scale in using derivatives, we

expect larger banks to be more likely to use credit derivatives.

     Credit derivatives also can be used by banks in their intermediary roles. In particular, banks can offer

credit support in transactions they underwrite using credit derivatives. They can also make a market in

credit derivatives. For example, banks can sell credit protection to clients who wish to hedge their credit

exposures and buy credit protection (i.e., sell credit risk) from other clients who want to be long the same

credit exposures.

     If banks use credit derivatives in an intermediary capacity, then we would expect banks which are

dealers in the derivatives market or have clients with which they trade or for which they provide hedging

products to be more likely to use credit derivatives. If credit derivatives are used as credit enhancement

for commercial paper conduit facilities or asset securitization facilities, then we expect the use of credit

derivatives to be positively related to asset securitization. If larger banks and banks which use other

derivatives are more likely to have trading departments for bank and client accounts, we expect to observe

positive associations between the likelihood of using credit derivatives and bank size, and the use of

foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivatives.10

  We do not include interest rate derivatives use as a proxy because all banks in the sample which use credit
derivatives also use interest rate derivatives.

5. Empirical results

    We first compare the characteristics of banks that are net buyers of credit derivatives to other banks.

After having done this, we estimate probit models to investigate whether hedging theories can help us

predict which banks will be net buyers of credit protection.



5.1. Univariate comparisons

    The results of these comparisons are reported in Table 4 for the banks in our sample at year-end 2003.

Sample statistics are similar for other years. We report means and medians.

    The size of the average and median bank holding company (BHC) that is not a net buyer of credit

protection, as measured by the book value of total assets, are $11.322 and $2.195 billion, respectively, at

year-end 2003. The difference between the mean and median is not surprising given the skewed

distribution of bank size. The mean and median of net buyers of credit protection are extremely large

compared to the mean and median of the other banks. This result confirms previous research documenting

that larger firms use derivatives more. The median assets of net buyers of credit are roughly 50 times the

median assets of the other banks in the sample.

    We turn next to the composition of the balance sheet of the banks in our sample. Surprisingly, the

proportion of loans and the proportion of deposits to total assets are smaller for net buyers of credit

protection. However, banks that are net buyers have more C&I loans relative to total loans (23% of the

total loan portfolio compared to 17% for all other banks), more consumer loans, and more foreign loans.

Their loans secured by real estate are dramatically less (48.35% of total loans versus 68.15%) and they

make fewer agricultural loans.

    The huge difference in the proportion of loans secured by real estate is the most striking difference

between banks that hedge with credit derivatives and those that do not. Banks that make mortgage loans

are not expected to use credit derivatives to hedge these loans – though more recently credit default swaps

on commercial mortgages have become available. C&I loans and foreign loans are more likely to be

hedged with credit derivatives than other loans because most liquid names in the credit default swap


                                                    16
market (the largest sector of the credit derivatives market) are large investment grade US firms, foreign

banks, and large foreign multinational companies (Fitch 2004). Thus, it is not surprising that the net

buyers of credit protection have relatively more such loans.

    We turn next to profitability measures. There is no significant difference in return on assets between

net buyers and other banks, but net buyers have a higher return on equity and a lower net interest margin.

The higher return on equity means that the net buyers are more highly levered and hence more vulnerable

to shocks. One would expect such banks to be more likely to hedge.

    When we compare capitalization measures, we see that net buyers are less well capitalized than other

banks. For example, the mean tier-1 risk-adjusted capital ratio for net buyers of credit risk protection is

8.98% compared with 12.30% for all other banks. These results are consistent with Cebenoyan and

Strahan (2002) who find that banks that sell loans have less capital. The net buyers also have more risk-

adjusted assets. In other words, they have more risky assets, but less capital to support them. However,

while the net buyers have more non-performing assets than other banks, the difference is not significant.

    The last panel considers derivatives use. At this point, it is not surprising that firms that use credit

derivatives are more likely to use other derivatives. In fact, all firms that are net buyers of credit

protection also use interest-rate derivatives. Almost all banks that buy credit protection also securitize

assets and sell loans.

    The last two rows show the total trading revenue of banks and total trading revenue scaled by total

assets. This trading revenue includes derivatives trading. Though banks using credit derivatives have

dramatically more trading revenue on average than other banks, there is enough dispersion in that trading

revenue that the difference has a p-value of 0.13 and hence is not statistically significant at conventional

levels of significance. However, the comparison of medians has a p-value of less than 0.01. Strikingly, the

median trading revenue of banks which do not use credit derivatives is zero. When we control for bank

size using total assets, mean and median trading revenue are significantly greater for banks that are net

buyers of credit protection.




                                                    17
5.2. Regression analysis

    We now turn to probit regressions to help us understand whether the likelihood that a bank will use

credit derivatives is related to the determinants of the hedging decision discussed in Section 4.

    We report estimates of probit regressions in Table 5. The dependent variable is the probability of

being a net buyer of credit protection using credit derivatives. We have four years of data, but the early

years do not have data on all the variables we use. Further, the market for credit derivatives evolved

during that period. We therefore proceed as follows. We estimate the regressions separately for 2002 and

2003. We also estimate regressions for 2002 and 2003 allowing for a common component in the residuals

for each year. These three sets of regressions lead to qualitatively similar conclusions. We therefore report

and focus on the regressions for 2003, except for Model (1) which includes all sample years. The table

reports the marginal effect of each regressor and the associated probability value (p-value) of the

test that the marginal probability is equal to zero. For indicator variables, the coefficient represents

the change in the probability associated with moving the indicator from 0 to 1.

    Panel A uses equity capital as the capitalization measure. Panel B uses tier 1 risk-adjusted capital as

the capitalization measure. Model (1) uses only variables that are available in all sample years.

    Overall, the results in panel A are very supportive of the predictions of our analysis of the

determinants of hedging of Section 4. We find that a bank is less likely to be a net buyer of credit

protection if it has more capital, is more profitable, and has more agricultural loans. It is more likely to be

a net buyer of credit protection if it is larger and has more C&I loans. All these results (except those for

agricultural loans) are expected in light of the discussion of Section 4. We would expect banks with more

consumer loans to be less likely to be net buyers of credit protection since a large fraction of consumer

loans are more standardized and can easily be securitized or sold. Though the coefficient on consumer

loans is negative, it is not significant. Model (2) is model (1) estimated for 2003 only. The results are

similar.

    In model (3), we replace total assets with a dummy variable for whether a bank uses equity or




                                                      18
commodity derivatives. A bank that trades actively or is a derivatives dealer will report use of such

derivatives, but other banks are unlikely to do so. We find that banks reporting the use of such derivatives

are significantly more likely to use credit derivatives. The other coefficients remain similar to model (2).

In regressions we do not report, we use trading income instead of the dummy variable for the use of

equity and commodity derivatives. Not surprisingly given the results for univariate comparisons, trading

revenue does not have a significant coefficient.

    In model (4), we find that banks that fund themselves more with deposits are less likely to be net

buyers of credit protection. This could be because banks that use more borrowings to finance themselves

instead of deposits are more vulnerable to adverse changes in their credit condition. Alternatively,

hedging with derivatives decreases the value of the deposit insurance put for a given amount of equity

capital. More liquid banks are also less likely to be net buyers of credit protection. Nonperforming assets

does not have a significant coefficient.

    The next regression adds to model (4) a dummy variable that takes value one if a bank securitizes

loans. We find that banks that securitize loans are more likely to be net buyers of credit protection.

Similarly, in model (6), we show that banks that sell loans are more likely to be net buyers of credit

protection.

    Finally, in model (7), we show that if a bank extends foreign loans, it is more likely to be a net buyer

of credit protection. The marginal probability is significant and positive in the probit regression. Total

C&I loans is replaced by total US C&I loans in this regression.            C&I loans remains statistically

significant and positive.

    Panel B has similar results to Panel A. Instead of using equity capital as our measure of equity

capitalization, we use instead the tier I risk-adjusted capital ratio. We find that this ratio always has a

significant negative coefficient (but the marginal effect are smaller), so that banks with less regulatory

capital measured by this ratio are more likely to be net buyers of credit derivatives. The other regression

coefficients of panel B do not differ much from the comparable coefficients of panel A. In some cases,

coefficients that are significant in panel A are not significant in panel B, but this does not affect our main


                                                     19
conclusions.

    In the regressions, we only include explanatory variables with correlation coefficients of less than 0.3

(Table A.1 in Appendix III reports correlation coefficients.) For example, the ratio of loans secured by

real estate to total assets is highly negatively correlated with the ratios of C&I loans to total assets and of

total consumer loans to total assets. Thus, we do not include a measure of loans secured by real estate in

the probits. In robustness tests, we include this measure and exclude the other two measures of loan

activity. The other regression coefficients are not affected.

    In other robustness tests, we use alternative measures of profitability and capitalization. Specifically,

we include the ratio of net income to total assets as a measure of profit instead of net interest margin.

Overall the results are qualitatively similar to those reported in panel A of table 5. When we measure

capitalization using the tier 1 risk-adjusted capital ratio (panel B), the coefficient estimates on net income

are not statistically significant in models that use net income instead of net interest margin. We also

estimate probit regressions using total risk adjusted capital and the ratio of risk-based assets to total assets

as measures of capitalization. The results are qualitatively similar to those reported in panel A of table 5.

Finally, we estimate the regressions reported in table 5 excluding banks which are net sellers of credit risk

protection. Doing so does not affect our results.



6. Conclusion

    In this paper, we examine the use of credit derivatives by bank holding companies in the U.S. with

assets in excess of $1 billion. We find that few of these companies use credit derivatives. Even though the

median amount of credit protection bought by banks is zero in our sample, the largest banks typically are

net buyers of credit protection. We find that the predictions of hedging theories are supported by our

regression analysis, in that banks that according to these theories would benefit more from hedging are

more likely to be net buyers of credit protection. We argue that the use of credit derivatives is limited by

the lack of liquidity of the credit derivatives market for the credits that banks would most want to hedge.

    Though there has been much discussion about the benefits of credit derivatives for the soundness of


                                                      20
banks, our results show that one has to be careful in drawing conclusions. A small number of banks buy

net credit protection, but these banks also have less capital. To the extent that credit derivatives make it

easier for banks to maximize their value with less capital, they do not increase the soundness of banks as

much as their purchases of credit derivatives would imply. However, if credit derivatives enable banks to

save capital, they ultimately reduce the cost of loans for bank customers and make banks more

competitive with the capital markets for the provision of loans.

Summary of banks’ disclosures about the use credit derivatives. Information is from year-end selected
10-K filings and annual reports for fiscal year-ends 2001, 2002, and 2003. In some cases, information is
from 1999 year-end financial statements.

Amsouth:
Amsouth reports using credit default swaps (CDS) to buy credit protection at year-end 2001 (notional
amount = $85 million) on the BHC database. We are unable to find information in the 10-K filing or
annual report for year-end 1999. The bank reports using no credit derivatives at year-ends 2002 and
2003.

Bank of America (BOA):
In BOA’s annual report and 10-K filing for fiscal year-end 2002, the following information is disclosed:
The Global Corporate and Investment Bank Sector of BOA is responsible for managing loan and portfolio
counterparty risk. The group uses risk mitigation techniques including credit default swaps (CDS). In
footnote (1) of Table VIII (page 62), BOA discloses using credit derivatives to provide credit protection
(single name CDS, basket CDS, and CLOs) for loan counterparties in the amounts of $16.7 billion and
$14.5 billion at year-end 2002 and 2001, respectively. In BOA’s discussion of its trading accounts, BOA
discloses trading-related net interest income of $893 million and $1,054 million at year-end 2002 and
2001, respectively, for credit derivatives. In footnote (3) of this table, BOA discloses that credit
derivatives include credit fixed income, credit derivatives, hedges of credit exposure and mortgage
banking assets. In its’ 10-K filings, the bank reports trading revenue related to its credit portfolio hedges
of -$330 million and $84 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. At year-end 2002 and 2001, BOA
discloses that the notional amount of credit derivatives held by BOA were $92 billion and $57 billion,
respectively. The related credit exposure of the credit derivatives was $1,253 million and $631 million,
respectively. This credit risk does not take into consideration the value of any collateral. It does,
however, take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. BOA also
provides credit derivatives to “sophisticated customers who wish to hedge existing credit exposures” or
take on additional credit risk to generate revenue. BOA’s credit derivative positions consisted primarily
of CDS and total return swaps.


Bank of New York (BONY):
BONY discloses using credit derivatives in footnote 1 under the “Credit risk management” section in its
2002 10-K filing. The bank also uses total return swaps (CDS) to provide credit enhancements to its
commercial paper securitization program. The fair value of the company’s credit derivatives that are held
for trading purposes were $7 million in assets and $3 million in liabilities at year-end 2002 ($8 and $3
million, respectively at year-end 2001). The non-interest income related to trading activities in credit
derivatives was -$5 million in 2002 and $3 million in 2001. The notional amount of BONY’s credit
derivatives outstanding at year-end was $1,818 million and $1,636 million at year-end 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The disclosed credit exposure related to the credit derivatives was $6 million and $8 million
at year-end 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Bank One:
Bank One primarily uses CDS and short bond positions as protection against the deterioration of credit
quality on commercial loans and loan commitments. The change in the fair value of credit derivatives is
included in trading results in the bank’s corporate financial statements, “while any credit assessment
change in the identified commercial credit exposure is reflected as a change in the allocated credit
reserves.” At year-end 2002, the notional amount of credit derivatives “economically hedging”
commercial credit exposure equaled $7.3 billion and related trading revenue was $42 million.

also are used for trading purposes. Trading-related revenue related to credit derivatives is reported as part
of fixed income trading-related revenue in footnote (9). Citibank provides guarantees to customers in the
form of CDS, total return swaps, and other written options. Citigroup also uses credit derivatives to
create synthetic collateralized debt obligations.

section. Credit derivatives use also is disclosed in “Credit portfolio” section of the 2002 financial
statements. The notional amount reported ($33.767 billion) equals the net credit protection bought and
reported on page 52 and discussed above. The bank notes that these derivatives do not qualify for hedge
accounting.

hedges do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. The bank disclosed a net trading loss of $4
million in 2003 related to its use of CDS. The notional amount of CDS outstanding at fiscal year-end
2003 is reported in “other products” of the table in the bank’s footnote on derivative instruments used for

Selected characteristics of banks that were net buyers of credit risk protecting based on their use of credit
derivatives at year-end 2003. A bank is defined as a net of buyer of credit protection if the notional
amount outstanding of credit derivatives on which the reporting bank is beneficiary is greater than the
notional amount outstanding of credit derivatives on which the reporting bank is a guarantor on Schedule
HC-L of form FR Y-9C (Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies).. All data are
measured as of fiscal year-end 2003. The last column report p-values for tests of the equality of means
(medians) between credit derivative users and non users. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%,
5% and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 5. The likelihood of buying net credit risk protection using credit derivatives

Probit regression estimates of the likelihood of buying net credit risk protection using credit derivatives. The dependent variable equals one if a bank is a net buyer of
credit risk protection and zero otherwise. ∆Prob measures the change in the probability of using credit derivatives per unit change in the relevant explanatory variables.
For indicator variables, the coefficient represents the change in the probability associated with moving the indicator from 0 to 1. Panel A uses a banks total equity capital
ratio as a measure of a bank’s capital ratio. Panel B uses tier 1 risk-adjusted capital ratio as a measure of a bank’s capital ratio. Model (1) is estimated using a cross-
sectional time series panel using all sample years for which data are available. The regression is estimated with robust standard errors to control for heteroskedasticity
across sample years. Model (2) is estimated using the 2003 sample with robust standard errors to control for heteroskedasticity across banks. Models (3) to (7) are
estimated using the 2003 sample with robust standard errors to control for heteroskedasticity across banks. All explanatory variables are lagged one year. *, **, and ***
indicate significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels, respectively. P-values are in parentheses.
