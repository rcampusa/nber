                                           ABSTRACT

This paper identifies optimal interest-rate rules within a rich, dynamic, general equilibrium model

that has been shown to account well for observed aggregate dynamics in the postwar United States.

We perform policy evaluations based on second-order accurate approximations to conditional and

unconditional expected welfare. We require that interest-rate rules be operational, in the sense that

they include as arguments only a few readily observable macroeconomic indicators and respect the

zero bound on nominal interest rates. We find that the optimal operational monetary policy is a real-

interest-rate targeting rule. That is, an interest-rate feedback rule featuring a unit inflation

coefficient, a mute response to output, and no interest-rate smoothing. Contrary to existing studies,

we find a significant degree of optimal inflation volatility. A key factor driving this result is the

assumption of indexation to past inflation. Under indexation to long-run inflation the optimal

inflation volatility is close to zero. Finally, we show that initial conditions matter for welfare

rankings of policies.

1       Introduction
Optimal monetary policy is the subject of a large and fast growing body of research in
macroeconomics. A central characteristic of all existing studies is that optimal monetary
policy is derived in highly stylized environments. Typically, optimal monetary policy is
characterized for economies with a single or a very small number of deviations from the
frictionless neoclassical paradigm. A case in point are the numerous recent studies concerned
with optimal policy within the context of the two-equation, one-friction, neo-Keynesian
model without capital accumulation.1 Other cases in which the optimal monetary policy
design problem is studied within theoretical frameworks featuring a small number of rigidities
include models with distorting income taxes (Lucas and Stokey, 1983; Schmitt-Grohé and
Uribe, 2004a), and models with sticky product and factor prices (Erceg, et al., 2000). An
advantage of this stylized approach is that it facilitates understanding the ways in which
monetary policy should respond to mitigate the distortionary eﬀects of a particular friction
in isolation.
    An important drawback of studying optimal monetary policy one distortion at a time
is that highly simpliﬁed models are unlikely to provide a satisfactory account of cyclical
movements for more than just a few macroeconomic variables of interest. For this reason,
the usefulness of this strategy to produce policy advice for the real world is necessarily
limited.
   The approach to optimal monetary policy that we propose in this paper departs from
the literature extant in that it is based on a rich theoretical framework capable of explaining
observed business cycle ﬂuctuations for a wide range of nominal and real variables. Following
the lead of Kimball (1995), the model emphasizes the importance of combining nominal as
well as real rigidities in explaining the propagation of macroeconomic shocks. Speciﬁcally,
the model features four nominal frictions, sticky prices, sticky wages, money in the utility
function, and a cash-in-advance constraint on the wage bill of ﬁrms, and four sources of real
rigidities, investment adjustment costs, variable capacity utilization, habit formation, and
imperfect competition in product and factor markets. Aggregate ﬂuctuations are driven by
supply shocks, which take the form of stochastic variations in total factor productivity, and
demand shocks stemming from exogenous innovations to the level of government purchases.
Altig et al. (2003) and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2003) argue that the model
economy for which we seek to design optimal monetary policy can indeed explain the observed
responses of inﬂation, real wages, nominal interest rates, money growth, output, investment,

consumption, labor productivity, and real proﬁts to productivity and monetary shocks in
the postwar United States. In this respect, the present paper aspires to be a step ahead in
the research program of generating monetary policy evaluation that is of relevance for the
actual practice of central banking.
   In our quest for the optimal monetary policy scheme we restrict attention to what we call
operational interest rate rules. By an operational interest-rate rule we mean an interest-rate
rule that satisﬁes three requirements. First, it prescribes that the nominal interest rate is set
as a function of a few readily observable macroeconomic variables. In the tradition of Taylor
(1993), we focus on rules whereby the nominal interest rate depends on measures of inﬂation,
aggregate activity, and possibly its own lag. Second, the operational rule must induce an
equilibrium satisfying the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. And third, operational
rules must render the rational expectations equilibrium unique. This last restriction closes
the door to expectations driven aggregate ﬂuctuations.
     The object that monetary policy aims to maximize in our study is the expectation of
lifetime utility of the representative household conditional on a particular initial state of the
economy. Our focus on a conditional welfare measure represents a fundamental departure
from most existing normative evaluations of monetary policy, which rank policies based
upon unconditional expectations of utility.2 As Kim et al. (2003) point out, unconditional
welfare measures ignore the welfare eﬀects of transitioning from a particular initial state to
the stochastic steady state induced by the policy under consideration. Indeed, we document
that under plausible initial conditions, conditional welfare measures can result in diﬀerent
rankings of policies than the more commonly used unconditional measure. This ﬁnding
highlights the fact that transitional dynamics matter for policy evaluation.
    In our welfare evaluations, we depart from the widespread practice in the neo-Keynesian
literature on optimal monetary policy of limiting attention to models in which the nonsto-
chastic steady state is undistorted. Most often, this approach involves assuming the existence
of a battery of subsidies to production and employment aimed at eliminating the long-run
distortions originating from monopolistic competition in factor and product markets. The
eﬃciency of the deterministic steady-state allocation is assumed for purely computational
reasons. For it allows the use of ﬁrst-order approximation techniques to evaluate welfare
accurately up to second order.3 This practice has two potential shortcomings. First, the
instruments necessary to bring about an undistorted steady state (e.g., labor and output
subsidies ﬁnanced by lump-sum taxation) are empirically uncompelling. Second, it is ex
ante not clear whether a policy that is optimal for an economy with an eﬃcient steady state

                                                    2
will also be so for an economy where the instruments necessary to engineer the nondistorted
steady state are unavailable. For these reasons, we refrain from making the eﬃcient-steady-
state assumption and instead work with a model whose steady state is distorted.
   Departing from a model whose steady state is Pareto eﬃcient has a number of important
ramiﬁcations. One is that to obtain a second-order accurate measure of welfare it no longer
suﬃces to approximate the equilibrium of the model up to ﬁrst order. Instead, we obtain a
second-order accurate approximation to welfare by solving the equilibrium of the model up to
second order. Speciﬁcally, we use the methodology and computer code developed in Schmitt-
Grohé and Uribe (2004c) to compute higher-order approximations to policy functions of
dynamic, stochastic models. One advantage of this numerical strategy is that because it is
based on perturbation arguments, it is particularly well suited to handle economies with a
large number of state variables like the one studied in this paper.
    In the neo-Keynesian literature, a recursive form for the equilibrium version of the price-
setting equation of ﬁrms (and workers if wages are sticky) is obtained by resorting to linear
approximations at various stages of its derivation. The resulting expression is often referred
to as the expectations augmented Phillips curve. For the reasons given above, such a linear
expression is of no use for evaluating welfare in distorted economies. Therefore, in this paper
we derive a recursive representation of the exact (nonlinear) Phillips curves for price and
wage dynamics. A third consequence of working with an economy with long-run distortions
and thus not being able to work with linearized versions of the equilibrium conditions of the
model is the need to track the evolution of price and wage dispersion over time. This task
gives rise to additional state variables summarizing the degree of relative price dispersion
in the economy. We provide a recursive representation for the equilibrium law of motion of
these state variables.
   The results from our numerical work suggest that in the model economy we study, the
optimal operational interest-rate rule takes the form of a real-interest-rate targeting rule. For
it features an inﬂation coeﬃcient close to unity, a mute response to output, no interest-rate
smoothing, and is forward looking. The optimal rule satisﬁes the Taylor principle because
the inﬂation coeﬃcient is greater than unity albeit very close to 1. Optimal monetary policy
calls for signiﬁcant inﬂation volatility. This result stands in contrast with those obtained in
the related literature. The main element of the model driving the desirability of inﬂation
volatility is indexation of nominal factor and product prices to 1-period lagged inﬂation.
Under the alternative assumption of indexation to long-run inﬂation, the conventional result
of the optimality of inﬂation stability reemerges. All of the above results are robust to a
number of variations of the baseline model, including cashless economies, no habit formation,
and economies with high costs of varying capacity utilization.


                                               3
   The remainder of the paper is organized in six sections. Section 2 presents the theoretical
economy and derives nonlinear recursive representations for the price and wage Phillips
curves as well as for the state variables summarizing the degree of wage and price dispersion.
Section 3 describes the calibration of the model and discusses the solution method. Section 4
provides intuition for the workings of the model by analyzing its dynamic response to supply
and demand shocks under a simple Taylor-type interest-rate feedback rule. In section 5
we derive a second-order accurate measure of welfare conditional upon the current state of
the economy. There, we also derive a second-order accurate consumption-based metric for
the welfare diﬀerences between two alternative monetary policies. The core of the paper is
contained in section 6. It computes the optimal operational interest-rate rule and performs
an extensive sensitivity analysis. Section 7 provides concluding remarks.


2    The Model
The skeleton of the model economy that we use for policy evaluation is the standard neo-
classical growth model driven by productivity and government spending shocks. In addition
the economy features four sources of nominal frictions and ﬁve real rigidities. The nominal
frictions include price and wage stickiness à la Calvo (1983) and Yun (1996) with index-
ation to past inﬂation, and money demands by households and ﬁrms. The real rigidities
originate from internal habit formation in consumption, monopolistic competition in factor
and product markets, investment adjustment costs, and variable costs of adjusting capacity
utilization.
   To perform monetary policy evaluation, we are forced to approximate the equilibrium
conditions of the economy to an order higher than linear. To this end, we derive the exact
nonlinear recursive representation of the complete set of equilibrium conditions. Of par-
ticular interest is the recursive nonlinear representation of the equilibrium Phillips curves
for prices and wages. These representations depart from most of the existing literature,
which restricts attention to linear approximations to these functions. Another byproduct
of deriving the exact nonlinear set of equilibrium conditions is the emergence of two state
variables measuring the degree of price and wage dispersion in the economy induced by the
sluggishness in the adjustment of nominal product and factor prices. We present a recursive
representation of these state variables and track their dynamic behavior.

Each member is a worker. Consumption and hours worked are identical across family mem-

measured by the parameter b ∈ [0, 1). The consumption good is assumed to be a composite

    Labor decisions are made by a central authority within the household, a union, which
supplies labor monopolistically to a continuum of labor markets of measure 1 indexed by j ∈

Here Wtj denotes the nominal wage charged by the union in labor market j at time t, Wt is
an index of nominal wages prevailing in the economy, and hdt is a measure of aggregate labor
demand by ﬁrms. We postpone a formal derivation of this labor demand function until we
consider the ﬁrm’s problem. In each particular labor market, the union takes Wt and hdt
as exogenous. The case in which the union takes aggregate labor variables as endogenous
can be interpreted as an environment with highly centralized labor unions. Higher-level
labor organizations play an important role in some European and Latin American countries,
but are less prominent in the United States. Given the wage charged in each labor market
j ∈ [0, 1], the union is assumed to supply enough labor, hjt , to satisfy demand. That is,

physical capital. The function S introduces investment adjustment costs and is assumed to
satisfy S(1) = S  (1) = 0 and S  (1) > 0. These assumptions imply the absence of adjustment
costs up to ﬁrst order in the vicinity of the deterministic steady state. Owners of physical
capital can control the intensity at which this factor is utilized. Formally, we let ut measure
capacity utilization in period t. We assume that using the stock of capital with intensity
ut entails a cost of a(ut )kt units of the composite ﬁnal good. The function a is assumed to
satisfy a(1) = 0, and a (1), a (1) > 0. Both the speciﬁcation of capital adjustment costs

    This setup departs slightly from most existing expositions of models with nominal wage inertia. It
avoids the need to assume separability of preferences in leisure and consumption to ensure homogeneity of
consumption across households.

and capacity utilization costs are somewhat peculiar. More standard formulations assume
that adjustment costs depend on the level of investment rather than on its growth rate, as
is assumed here. Also, costs of capacity utilization typically take the form of a higher rate
of depreciation of physical capital. The modeling choice here is guided by the need to ﬁt the
response of investment and capacity utilization to a monetary shock in the US economy. For
further discussion of this point, see Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2003, section 6.1).
    Households rent the capital stock to ﬁrms at the real rental rate rtk per eﬀective unit
of capital. Thus, total income stemming from the rental of capital is given by rtk ut kt . The
investment good is assumed to be a composite good made with the aggregator function (2).
Thus, the demand for each intermediate good i ∈ [0, 1] for investment purposes, iit , is then
given by iit = it (Pit /Pt )−η .
    Households have access to a complete set of nominal state-contingent assets. Speciﬁcally,

The variable xht /πt ≡ Xth /Pt denotes the real payoﬀ in period t of nominal state-contingent
assets purchased in period t − 1. The variable φt denotes proﬁts received from the ownership
of ﬁrms, τt denotes lump-sum taxes, and πt ≡ Pt /Pt−1 denotes the gross rate of consumer-
price inﬂation.
    We introduce wage stickiness in the model by assuming that each period the household
(or union) cannot set the nominal wage optimally in a fraction α̃ ∈ [0, 1) of randomly chosen
labor markets. In these markets, the wage rate is indexed to the previous period’s consumer-
price inﬂation according to the rule Wtj = Wt−1

degree of wage indexation. When χ̃ equals 0, there is no wage indexation. When χ̃ equals
1, there is full wage indexation to past consumer price inﬂation. In general, χ̃ can take any
value between 0 and 1.
   The household chooses processes for ct , ht , xht+1 , wtj , kt+1 , it , mht , and ut so as to maximize
the utility function (1) subject to (6)-(8), the wage stickiness friction, and a no-Ponzi-game
constraint, taking as given the processes wt , rtk , hdt , rt,t+1 , πt , φt , and τt and the initial
conditions xh0 , k0 , and mh−1 . Of course, the household’s optimal plan must satisfy con-
straints (6)-(8). In addition, letting β t λt wt /µ̃t , β t qt λt , and β t λt denote Lagrange multipliers

the average marginal cost of supplying labor. The union’s χ̃ marginal

the markup of wages over marginal cost of labor that would prevail in the absence of wage
stickiness. The third factor in the expression for marginal revenue reﬂects the fact that
as time goes by without a chance to reoptimize, the real wage declines as the price level
increases when wages are imperfectly indexed to past inﬂation. In turn, the marginal cost

the average real wage prevailing in the economy. Thus, µ̃t can be interpreted as the average
markup that unions impose on the labor market. The weights used to compute averages are
decreasing in time and increasing in the amount of labor supplied to the market.

    The household’s optimality conditions imply a liquidity function featuring a negative
relation between real balances and the short-term nominal interest rate. To see this, we
ﬁrst note that the absence of arbitrage opportunities in ﬁnancial markets requires that Rt
be equal to the reciprocal of the price in period t of a nominal security that pays one unit
of currency in every state of period t + 1. Formally, 1/Rt = Et rt,t+1 . This relation together
with the household’s optimality condition (10) implies that

The right-hand side of this expression represents the opportunity cost of holding money,
which is an increasing function of the nominal interest rate. The left-hand side is the marginal
rate of substitution between consumption and real money balances. Note that the presence
of internal habit formation implies that the demand for money depends not only on current
but also past and future expected consumption. In addition, if preferences are nonseparable
in leisure and either consumption or real balances, then hours worked will also feature in the
liquidity preference function.


2.2     Firms
Each variety of ﬁnal goods is produced by a single ﬁrm in a monopolistically competitive
environment. Each ﬁrm i ∈ [0, 1] produces output using as factor inputs capital services, kit ,
and labor services, hit . The production technology is given by

                                       zt F (kit , hit ) − ψ,

where the function F is assumed to be homogenous of degree one, concave, and strictly in-
creasing in both arguments. The variable zt denotes an aggregate, exogenous, and stochastic
productivity shock. The parameter ψ > 0 introduces ﬁxed costs of operating a ﬁrm in each
period. It implies that the production function exhibits increasing returns to scale. We
model ﬁxed costs to ensure a realistic proﬁt-to-output ratio in steady state.
   Aggregate demand for good i, which we denote by yit , is given by

                                      yit = (Pit /Pt )−η yt ,

where
                                  yt ≡ ct + it + gt + a(ut )kt ,                           (20)

denotes aggregate absorption. The variable gt denotes government consumption of the com-
posite good in period t.
    We rationalize a demand for money by ﬁrms by imposing that wage payments are subject
to a cash-in-advance constraint of the form:

                                         mfit ≥ νwt hit ,                                  (21)

where mfit denotes the demand for real money balances by ﬁrm i in period t and ν ≥ 0 is a
parameter indicating the fraction of the wage bill that must be backed with monetary assets.



                                                10
       The period-by-period budget constraint of ﬁrm i is given by
                                                                                                          1−η

where Et rt,t+1 xfit+1 denotes the total real cost of one-period state-contingent assets that the
ﬁrm purchases in period t in terms of the composite good. The variable φit denotes real
dividend payments that ﬁrm i makes to households in period t. Implicit in this speciﬁcation
of the ﬁrm’s budget constraint is the assumption that ﬁrms rent capital services from a
centralized market.5 We assume that the ﬁrm must satisfy demand at the posted price.
Formally, we impose                                                                −η

The objective of the ﬁrm is to choose contingent plans for Pit , hit , kit , xfit+1 , and mfit so as
to maximize the present discounted value of dividend payments, given by

where rt,t+s ≡ sk=1 rt+k−1,t+k , for s ≥ 1, denotes the stochastic nominal discount factor
between t and t + s, and rt,t ≡ 1. Firms are assumed to be subject to a borrowing constraint
that prevents them from engaging in Ponzi games.
   Throughout our analysis, we will focus on equilibria featuring a strictly positive nominal
interest rate. This implies that the cash-in-advance constraint (21) will always bind. Then,
letting rt,t+s Pt+s mcit+s be the Lagrange multiplier associated with constraint (22), the ﬁrst-
order conditions of the ﬁrm’s maximization problem with respect to capital and labor services
are, respectively,                                                              

                                       mcit zt Fh (kit , hit ) = wt 1 + ν                                                (23)
                                                                           Rt

                                                    mcit zt Fk (kit , hit ) = rtk .                                      (24)

It is clear from these optimality conditions that the presence of a working-capital requirement
introduces a ﬁnancial cost of labor that is increasing in the nominal interest rate. We note
   5
    This is a common assumption in the related literature (e.g., Christiano et al., 2003; Kollmann, 2003;
Carlstrom and Fuerst, 2003; and Rotemberg and Woodford, 1992). A polar assumption is that capital is
sector speciﬁc, as in Woodford (2003, chapter 5.3) and Sveen and Weinke (2003). Both assumptions are
clearly extreme. A more realistic treatment of investment dynamics would incorporate a mix of ﬁrm-speciﬁc
and homogeneous capital.



                                                                    11
also that because all ﬁrms face the same factor prices and because they all have access to the
same production technology with the function F being linearly homogeneous, marginal costs,
mcit , are identical across ﬁrms. Indeed, because the above ﬁrst-order conditions hold for all
ﬁrms independently of whether they are allowed to reset prices optimally or not, marginal
costs are identical across all ﬁrms in the economy.
    Clearly, because rt,t+s represents both the ﬁrm’s stochastic discount factor and the market
pricing kernel for ﬁnancial assets, and because the ﬁrm’s objective function is linear in asset
holdings, it follows that any asset accumulation plan of the ﬁrm satisfying the no-Ponzi
constraint is optimal. Suppose, without loss of generality, that the ﬁrm manages its portfolio
so as to ensure that its ﬁnancial position at the beginning of each period is nil. Formally,
assume that xfit+1 + mfit = 0 at all dates and states. Note that this ﬁnancial strategy makes
xfit+1 state-noncontingent. In this case, distributed dividends take the form

                                  Pt

For this expression to hold in period zero, we impose the initial condition xfi0 + mfi−1 = 0.
The last term on the right-hand side of this expression represents the ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial costs
associated with the cash-in-advance constraint on wages. This ﬁnancial cost is increasing
in the opportunity cost of holding money, 1 − Rt−1 , which is an increasing function of the
short-term nominal interest rate Rt .
   Prices are assumed to be sticky à la Calvo (1983) and Yun (1996). Speciﬁcally, each
period t ≥ 0 a fraction α ∈ [0, 1) of randomly picked ﬁrms is not allowed to optimally set
the nominal price of the good they produce. Instead, these ﬁrms index their prices to past
                                            χ
inﬂation according to the rule Pit = Pit−1 πt−1 . The interpretation of the parameter χ is the
same as that of its wage counterpart χ̃. The remaining 1 − α ﬁrms choose prices optimally.
Consider the price-setting problem faced by a ﬁrm that gets to reoptimize the price in period
t. This price, which we denote by P̃t , is set so as to maximize the expected present discounted
value of proﬁts. That is, P̃t maximizes the following Lagrangian:

According to this expression, optimizing ﬁrms set nominal prices so as to equate average
future expected marginal revenues to average future expected marginal costs. The weights
used in calculating these averages are decreasing with time and increasing in the size of the
demand for the good produce by the ﬁrm. Under ﬂexible prices (α = 0), the above optimality
condition reduces to a static relation equating marginal costs to marginal revenues period
by period.
   It will prove useful to express this ﬁrst-order condition recursively. To that end, let

2.3    The Government
Government expenditure is ﬁnanced via lump-sum taxes and seignorage

                                                                   πt
                1
where mt = mht + 0 mfit di denotes real money balances and gt denotes per capita government
spending on a composite good produced via the aggregator function given in equation (2).
We assume that the government minimizes the cost of producing gt . Thus, we have that
the public demand for a particular variety i ∈ [0, 1] of diﬀerentiated goods, git , is given by
git = (Pit /Pt )−η gt .
   Monetary policy is given by an interest-rate feedback rule of the form

                             R̂t = απ Et π̂t−i + αy Et ŷt−i + αR R̂t−1 ,                    (33)

where a hat over a variable denotes the log-deviation of that variable from its deterministic
steady-state level (i.e., for any xt , x̂t ≡ ln(xt /x), where x denotes the non-stochastic steady-
state value of xt ). The parameter i allows for backward-looking rules (i = 1), current-looking
rules (i = 0), and forward-looking rules (i = −1). We assume that in period 0 the government
chooses the policy quadruple (απ , αy , αR , i) so as to maximize the lifetime utility of the
representative household. The government is assumed to be endowed with a commitment
technology that allows it to maintain throughout time the policy decision it makes in period

0. As a result, the announced policy enjoys full credibility on the part of the private sector.
    The family of interest rate feedback rules deﬁned by (33) has the property of being
easily implementable. For all of the variables featured in the rule are generally available
macroeconomic indicators. We note that the type of monetary policy rules that are typically
analyzed in the related literature require no less information on the part of the policymaker
than the feedback rule given in equation (33). In eﬀect, the rules most commonly studied
feature an output gap measure deﬁned as deviations of output from the level that would
obtain in the absence of nominal rigidities. Computing the ﬂexible-price level of aggregate
activity requires the policymaker to know not just the deterministic steady state of the
economy, but also the joint distribution of all the shocks driving the economy and the
current realizations of such shocks.


2.4     Aggregation and Equilibrium
We limit attention to a symmetric equilibrium in which all ﬁrms that get to change their
price optimally at a given time indeed choose the same price. It then follows from (4) that
the aggregate price index can be written as Pt1−η = α(Pt−1 πt−1

this expression through by Pt1−η one obtains

                                                             + (1 − α)p̃1−η
                                                 χ(1−η)
                                 1 = απtη−1 πt−1                        t   .                     (34)

2.4.1    Market Clearing in the Final Goods Market

Naturally, the set of equilibrium conditions includes a resource constraint. Such a restriction
is typically of the type zt F (kt , ht ) − ψ = ct + it + gt + a(ut )kt . In the present model, however,
this restriction is not valid. This is because the model implies relative price dispersion across
varieties. This price dispersion, which is induced by the assumed nature of price stickiness,
is ineﬃcient and entails output loss. To see this, consider the following expression stating
that supply must equal demand at the ﬁrm level:
                                                                               −η

Summarizing, the resource constraint in the present model is given by the following two
expressions
                      zt F (utkt , hdt ) − ψ = (ct + it + gt + a(ut )kt )st         (35)

                                                       πt−1
with s−1 given. The state variable st summarizes the resource costs induced by the ineﬃcient
price dispersion featured in the Calvo model in equilibrium. Three observations are in order
about the price dispersion measure st . First, st is bounded below by 1. That is, price
dispersion is always a costly distortion in this model. To see that st is bounded below by 1,
let vit ≡ (Pit /Pt )1−η . It follows from the deﬁnition of the price index given in equation (4) that
       η/(η−1)                                              1 η/(η−1)

      v
   0 it
                 = 1. Also, by deﬁnition we have st = 0 vit              . Then, taking into account
                                                                         η/(η−1)    1 η/(η−1)
                                                                     1
that η/(η − 1) > 1, Jensen’s inequality implies that 1 = 0 vit                     ≤ 0 vit       = st .
Second, in an economy where the non-stochastic level of inﬂation is nil (i.e., when π = 1)
or where prices are fully indexed to any variable ωt with the property that its deterministic
steady-state value equals the deterministic steady-state value of inﬂation (i.e., ω = π), the
variable st follows, up to ﬁrst order, the univariate autoregressive process ŝt = αŝt−1 . In these
cases, the price dispersion measure st has no ﬁrst-order real consequences for the stationary


                                                                       16
distribution of any endogenous variable of the model. This means that studies that restrict
attention to linear approximations to the equilibrium conditions are justiﬁed to ignore the
variable st if the model features no price dispersion in the deterministic steady state. But st
matters up to ﬁrst order when the deterministic steady state features movements in relative
prices across goods varieties. More importantly, the price dispersion variable st must be
taken into account if one is interested in higher-order approximations to the equilibrium
conditions even if relative prices are stable in the deterministic steady state. Omitting st
in higher-order expansions would amount to leaving out certain higher-order terms while
including others. Finally, when prices are fully ﬂexible, α = 0, we have that p̃t = 1 and
thus st = 1. (Obviously, in a ﬂexible-price equilibrium there is no price dispersion across
varieties.)
   As discussed above, equilibrium marginal costs and capital-labor ratios are identical
across ﬁrms. Therefore, one can aggregate the ﬁrm’s optimality conditions with respect to
labor and capital, equations (23) and (24), as

2.4.2   Market Clearing in the Labor Market

Combining this expression with equation (39), describing the demand for labor of type
j ∈ [0, 1], and with the time constraint (6), which must hold with equality, we can write

dispersion across diﬀerent types of labor. The above expression can be written as

                                                                        ht = s̃t hdt .                                           (41)

The state variable s̃t evolves over time according to

                                                                   −η̃                        −η̃            η̃

We note that because all job varieties are ex-ante identical, any wage dispersion is inef-
ﬁcient. This is reﬂected in the fact that s̃t is bounded below by 1. The proof of this
statement is identical to that oﬀered earlier for st . To see this, note that s̃t can be written

as s̃t = 0 W  it

                    di. This ineﬃciency introduces a wedge that makes the number of hours
supplied to the market, ht , larger than the number of productive units of labor input, hdt .
In an environment without long-run wage dispersion, the dead-weight loss created by wage
dispersion is nil up to ﬁrst order. Formally, a ﬁrst-order approximation of the law of motion
of s̃t yields a univariate autoregressive process of the form s̃ˆt = α̃s̃ˆt−1 , as long as there is
no wage dispersion in the deterministic steady state. When wages are fully ﬂexible, α̃ = 0,
wage dispersion disappears, and thus s̃t equals 1.
   It follows from our deﬁnition of the wage index given in equation (32) that in equilibrium
the real wage rate must satisfy

The above set of equilibrium conditions can be written as

where the vector xt contains the predetermined, or state variables and is of size nx , and
the vector yt contains the nonpredetermined variables of the model and is of size ny . Let
n = nx + ny . The state vector xt can be partitioned as xt = [x1t ; x2t ] . The vector x1t consists
of endogenous predetermined state variables and the vector x2t consists of exogenous state
variables. Speciﬁcally, we assume that x2t follows the exogenous stochastic process given by

                                       x2t+1 = Λx2t + η̃ σt+1 ,                                  (45)

where both the vector x2t and the innovation t are of order n × 1. The vector t is assumed
to have a bounded support and to be independently and identically distributed, with mean
zero and variance/covariance matrix I. The scalar σ ≥ 0 and the n × n matrix η̃ are
known parameters. All eigenvalues of the matrix Λ are assumed to have modulus less than
one. The solution to the model given in equation (44) is of the form:

where g maps Rnx × R+ into Rny and h maps Rnx × R+ into Rnx . The matrix η is of order

We use the methodology and computer code developed in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004c)
to compute a second-order approximation of the functions g and h around the non-stochastic
steady state, xt = x and σ = 0.6 The deterministic steady state of the model, (x, y), is the
solution to the system f (y, y, x, x) = 0.

3.1    Functional Forms
We take from Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2003) the following functional forms for
the period utility function, the production function, the investment adjustment cost function,
and the map relating output loss to the level of capacity utilization:
                                                                   1−σ

                                  S          =            −1 ,
                                      it−1       2 it−1
and
                                               γ2
                                                  (u − 1)2 .
                                 a(u) = γ1 (u − 1) +
                                               2
We note that because the function a(u) is assumed to be quadratic, the second-order ex-
pansion of the right-hand side of the optimality condition (14)—i.e., the second-order ex-
pansion of a (ut )—is linear in u. Thus, potential second-order eﬀects stemming from the
curvature of a (u) are left out. We also experimented with the alternative speciﬁcation
        γ2
a(u) = γ12 [eγ2 /γ1 (u−1) −1], which allows for curvature in a (u). As in the case of the benchmark
speciﬁcation, however, we picked a two-parameter functional form because the calibration of
Christiano et al. upon which we draw heavily, provides only independent information about
the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the capacity utilization cost function. Evaluated at the
steady-state value of the degree of capacity utilization (u = 1), this function as well as its
ﬁrst and second derivatives take the same values as the benchmark quadratic speciﬁcation.
Moreover, this functional form has the property that all of its derivatives have a constant
elasticity at the steady state equal to γ2 /γ1 . For the benchmark values assigned to γ1 and
γ2 , the welfare consequences of monetary policy reported below are identical under both
speciﬁcations of the capacity utilization cost function.


3.2    Calibration
The time unit is meant to be one quarter. The calibration follows Christiano, Eichenbaum,
and Evans (2003) and is summarized in table 1. We restrict the steady-state labor input, hd ,
and the steady-state capacity utilization rate, u, to unity and steady-state proﬁts to zero.
The discount factor takes the value of 3 percent per annum. The share of capital in value
added is assumed to be 36 percent. The depreciation rate of capital is set at 10 percent
per year. The fraction of the wage bill that is subject to a working-capital constraint is

assumed to be 100 percent. Households are assumed to hold 44 percent of the aggregate
money supply in the steady state. The remaining 56 percent of money balances is held by
ﬁrms. We set the long-run inﬂation rate to 4.2 percent per year which is consistent with
the average growth rate of the U.S. GDP deﬂator over the period 1960-1998. We assume
full indexation in prices and wages to the previous period’s price inﬂation. That is, we set
χ = χ̃ = 1. The degree of nominal rigidity is calibrated so that product prices change on
average every 2.5 quarters and nominal wages every 2.8 quarters. Steady state markups are
assumed to be 20 percent in product markets and 5 percent in labor markets. The degree of
habit formation, deﬁned by the parameter b, is set at 0.65. The elasticity of the subutility
function that depends on real balances is assigned a value of -9.62, that is, σm = 10.62. The
steady-state elasticity of the marginal capacity utilization cost, a (1)/a(1), is calibrated to
be 0.01. The parameter κ determining the degree of investment adjustment costs takes the
value 2.48.
   Following Christiano and Eichenbaum (1992), the steady-state share of government pur-
chases in value added is assumed to be 18 percent. The processes describing the evolution
of the productivity shock and public spending are assumed to be univariate and ﬁrst-order
autoregressive in logs. Formally,

                                   ln zt+1 = λz ln zt + σηz zt+1

and
                              ln(gt+1 /g) = λg ln(gt /g) + σηg gt+1 .

The innovations zt and gt are assumed to be i.i.d. with mean zero and standard deviation
equal to one. In the notation of equation (45), we have that Λ = [λg 0; 0 λz ] and η̃ =
[ηg 0; 0 ηz ]. King and Rebelo (1999) calibrate the productivity shock process by estimating
an AR(1) representation for the Solow residual. We set λz to 0.979, which corresponds to
their estimate of the ﬁrst-order serial correlation of the Solow residual. As in Christiano
and Eichenbaum (1992), we set λg equal to 0.96. We calibrate the parameter ηz to 0.0072
and the parameter ηg to 0.02. These values correspond to the volatility of the innovation to
the Solow residual process estimated by King and Rebelo (1999) and to the volatility of the
innovation to the government purchases process estimated by Christiano and Eichenbaum
(1992), respectively.
   To complete the calibration of the exogenous driving force process, it remains to pick a
value for the parameter σ, which scales the volatility of the disturbances zt and gt . Following
the calibrations of King and Rebelo (1999) and Christiano and Eichenbaum (1992) would
imply setting σ to unity. However, for this value of the scaling parameter the Christiano-

Eichenbaum-Evans model studied here implies an output volatility equal to 10 percent when
monetary policy is assumed to take the form of a simple Taylor rule, R̂t = 1.5π̂t . Cooley
and Prescott (1995) estimate that the volatility of the cyclical component of U.S. output in
the postwar era is 1.72 percent, which is about six times smaller than the value implied by
the model. One reason why the Christiano-Eichenbaum-Evans model implies such a high
output volatility is that the assumed costs of varying the capital capacity utilization are
modest, which allows ﬁrms to adjust the intensity at which they utilize the existing stock
of capital fairly easily over the business cycle. We therefore set σ to 0.18, which brings the
volatility of output down to 1.72 percent under a simple Taylor rule. We note however, that
because the deviations of our welfare measure from steady state are proportional to σ 2 , the
welfare rankings of alternative monetary policies, which is at the core of the present study,
is independent of the size of σ 2 , provided the implied path for the nominal interest rate does
not violate the zero lower bound.


4         Dynamics Under a Taylor Rule
To gather intuition about the dynamic behavior of the model economy, it is useful to analyze
the equilibrium response of a number of macroeconomic variables of interest to supply and
demand shocks. Before conducting such an exercise, it is necessary to specify a monetary
regime. Here we assume that monetary policy takes the form of a simple interest-rate feed-
back rule whereby the short-term interest rate is set as an increasing function of deviations
of inﬂation from a target, with a coeﬃcient of 1.5. Formally, we assume that

                                                R̂t = 1.5π̂t .

According to the available empirical evidence (e.g., Taylor, 1993; and Clarida, Galı́, and
Gertler, 1998), this is a realistic policy benchmark for the U.S. economy and other indus-
trialized countries over the past two decades. Arguably, a more realistic formulation of the
interest-rate rule would feature the cyclical component of output and the lagged nominal
interest rate as additional arguments of the interest-rate rule (Sack, 1998). However, such
a rich feedback rule complicates the task of building intuition about the workings of the
model. We will analyze richer rules later on when we perform policy evaluations.
   Figure 1 displays the economy’s response to a 1 percent increase in productivity (zt ). In
response to this shock, inﬂation and the nominal interest rate fall, while the average markup
of prices over marginal cost increases.7 To understand why inﬂation falls in response to a

positive technology shock, it is crucial to analyze the behavior of the real interest rate. To see
this, note that up to ﬁrst order (and leaving aside uncertainty) the Taylor rule, R̂t = 1.5π̂t ,
together with the Fisher relation, R̂t = π̂t+1 + r̂t , where r̂t denotes the real interest rate,
imply that inﬂation follows the ﬁrst-order process π̂t+1 = 1.5π̂t − r̂t . It is immediate from
this diﬀerence equation that, because along the entire transition the real interest rate is
below its steady-state level (bottom right panel of ﬁgure 1), in order for the inﬂation rate
not to explode, it must be the case that inﬂation is below its steady-state level during the
adjustment process.
  The question, therefore, is why a positive productivity shock depresses real interest rates.
The answer to this question has a lot to do with the magnitude of investment adjustment
costs. In the absence of investment adjustment costs (κ = 0), the model studied here
predicts that the real interest rate actually increases on impact and then falls gradually.
This is because in the absence of investment adjustment costs, investment displays a large
increase on impact, delaying the positive response of consumption. Indeed, in this case
(habit-adjusted) consumption is hump-shaped. In order for consumers to be induced to
undertake a hump-shaped habit-adjusted consumption proﬁle, the real interest rate must be
above its long-run level during the initial phase of the transition. By contrast, in the presence
of investment adjustment costs (κ positive), which is the case under the baseline calibration
of the model studied here, the real interest rate falls on impact. This decline occurs because
in this case investment is slow to react to the productivity shock making consumption absorb
much of the initial increase in output. As a result, habit-adjusted consumption increases on
impact and then falls. To induce households to adopt such a declining spending path, the
real interest rate must be below its steady-state value. It follows from this analysis, that
when monetary policy takes the form of a simple Taylor Rule, an increase in productivity
is inﬂationary in the absence of investment adjustment costs and is deﬂationary in their
presence.
   Having established why inﬂation falls in response to a positive productivity shock, one
can also understand why markups are above average along the transition. Those ﬁrms
that get to set prices optimally when the productivity shock occurs will tend to keep their
markup close to its long-run mean. Note that equation (26) implies that in their price setting
behavior these ﬁrms penalize more heavily deviations of markups from η/(η − 1) in the short
run because demand is highest during this part of the transition. In addition, the fact that
inﬂation falls on impact requires that ﬁrms that reoptimize prices in that period actually

that s̄t can be written recursively as s̄t = (1 − α)p̃2−η

lower nominal prices. This implies that the relative price of ﬁrms that get to change prices
optimally, P̃t /Pt , falls. Since markups for these ﬁrms are little changed, we deduce that real
marginal costs fall. Now, since real marginal costs are common across all ﬁrms, the markup
of ﬁrms who do not have the chance to reset prices optimally must go up. It follows that
the average markup in the economy increases, as indicated by row 4 column 2 of ﬁgure 1.
The increase in markups produces an ineﬃcient macroeconomic adjustment in response to
the productivity shock.
   Recently, there has been a lively debate about the eﬀect of technology shocks on hours
worked. At the heart of the controversy is whether in post-Volker U.S. data hours increase
or fall in response to a positive innovation in productivity. It is of interest to note that in
the Christiano-Eichenbaum-Evans model hours fall on impact in response to a positive shock
to labor productivity when monetary policy takes the form of a simple Taylor rule. If one
believes that a simple interest-rate feedback rule whereby the short-term nominal interest
rate depends only on consumer price inﬂation with a response coeﬃcient of 1.5 is a reason-
able description of U.S. monetary policy over the past two decades, then the Christiano-
Eichenbaum-Evans model is in line with those suggesting that the empirical evidence points
to a decline in hours in response to a positive technology shock. It is fair to mention that in
the empirical debate technology shocks are typically identiﬁed as permanent changes in total
factor productivity, whereas in our study productivity shocks, although highly persistent,
are assumed to follow a stationary autoregressive process.
    One factor that contributes to the contractionary eﬀect of productivity shocks on aggre-
gate employment in the model is the presence of price stickiness in product markets. When
the number of ﬁrms that do not get to reoptimize (reduce) prices after a positive technology
shock is suﬃciently large (i.e., when prices are suﬃciently sticky), then the fact that em-
ployment at those ﬁrms falls drives the behavior of aggregate employment dominating the
increase in employment at ﬁrms that get to reoptimize prices when the shock occurs.
    Figure 2 displays the economy’s response to a 1 percent increase in government spend-
ing. Because the increase in unproductive public spending makes households poorer, hours
worked increase. To smooth out the necessary adjustment in consumption and leisure, the
private sector reduces investment in physical capital and uses the existing capital stock more
intensively. The resulting response of consumption is negative but negligible, reﬂecting the
fact that households are fairly successful in smoothing out consumption expenditure. The
ﬂat time path of consumption implies a modest reaction in real interest rates. In turn, recall-
ing that inﬂation is linked to real interest rates via the diﬀerence equation π̂t+1 = 1.5π̂t − r̂t ,
the small response in real interest rates translates into an equally small response in inﬂation.
The Taylor rule then implies that nominal interest rates are also little changed.

5     The Welfare Measure
We measure the level of utility associated with a particular monetary policy speciﬁcation as
follows. Let the equilibrium processes for consumption, money holdings, and hours associated
with a particular monetary regime be denoted by {ct , mht , ht }. Then we measure welfare as
the conditional expectation of lifetime utility as of time zero evaluated at {ct , mht , ht }. We
denote this welfare measure by V0 . Formally, V0 is given by

                                        
                                        ∞
                             V0 ≡ E0          β t U(ct − bct−1 , mht , ht ).                (46)
                                        t=0


In addition, we assume that at time zero all state variables of the economy, including c−1 ,
equal their respective steady-state values. We depart from the usual practice of identifying
the welfare measure with the unconditional expectation of lifetime utility because using
unconditional expectations of welfare amounts to not taking into account the transitional
dynamics leading to the stochastic steady state. Because the deterministic steady state
is the same across all policy regimes we consider, our choice of computing expected welfare
conditional on the initial state being the nonstochastic steady state ensures that the economy
begins from the same initial point under all possible policies. Therefore, our strategy will
deliver the constrained optimal monetary rule associated with a particular initial state of
the economy. It is of interest to investigate the robustness of our results with respect to
alternative initial conditions. For, in principle, the welfare ranking of the alternative polices
will depend upon the assumed value for (or distribution of) the initial state vector. For
further discussion of this issue, see Kim et al., 2003.
    We compute the welfare cost of a particular monetary regime relative to a reference rule
as follows. Consider two policy regimes, a reference policy regime denoted by r and an
alternative policy regime denoted by a. Then we deﬁne the welfare associated with policy
regime r as
                                        
                                        ∞

                                        t=0

where crt , mhr       r
             t , and ht denote the contingent plans for consumption, real money balances,
and hours under policy regime r. Similarly, deﬁne the welfare associated with policy regime
a as

                             a
                           V0 = E0     β t U(cat − bcat−1 , mha   a
                                                             t , ht ).
                                        t=0

Let λ denote the welfare cost of adopting policy regime a instead of the reference policy
regime r. We measure λ as the fraction of regime r’s consumption process that a household


                                                   28
would be willing to give up to be as well oﬀ under regime a as under regime r. That is, λ is
implicitly deﬁned by

                                                              
                                                              ∞
      V0a = U(cr0 (1 − λ) − bc−1 , mhr   r
                                    0 , h0 ) + E0                    β t U((crt − bcrt−1 )(1 − λ), mhr   r
                                                                                                    t , ht ).   (47)
                                                               t=1


Note that we do not apply the factor 1 − λ to c−1 , because this variable is predetermined
at the time of the policy evaluation. Using the particular functional form assumed for the
period utility function, equation (49) can be written as

                                                                    β
              V0a − V0r = ln[(1 − λ)cr0 − bc−1 ] +                     ln(1 − λ) − ln(cr0 − bc−1 ).
                                                                   1−β

Resorting to the notation introduced in section 3, let V0a = g va (x0 , σ), V0r = g vr (x0 , σ),
and ln c0 = g cr (x0 , σ), where x0 is the value of the state vector in period zero and σ is a
parameter scaling the standard deviation of the exogenous shocks. Then we can rewrite the
above expression as

                                            cr (x                       β               cr
 g va (x0 , σ)−g vr (x0 , σ) = ln[(1−λ)eg           0 ,σ)
                                                            −bc−1 ]+       ln(1−λ)−ln(eg (x0 ,σ) −bc−1 ). (48)
                                                                       1−β

It is clear from this expression that λ is a function of x0 and σ, which we write as

                                                    λ = Λ(x0 , σ).

Consider a second-order approximation of the function Λ around the point x0 = x and
σ = 0, where x denotes the deterministic steady-state of the state vector. Because we
wish to characterize welfare conditional upon the initial state being the deterministic steady
state, that is, x0 = x, in performing the second-order expansion of λ only its ﬁrst and second
derivatives with respect to σ have to be considered. Formally, we have

                                                                         Λσσ (x, 0) 2
                              λ ≈ Λ(x, 0) + Λσ (x, 0)σ +                           σ .
                                                                             2

Because the deterministic steady-state level of welfare is the same across all monetary policies
belonging to the class deﬁned in equation (33), it follows that λ vanishes at the point x0 = x
and σ = 0. Formally,
                                                     Λ(x, 0) = 0.

Totally diﬀerentiating equation (48) with respect to σ and evaluating the result at (x0 , σ) =



                                                              29

Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004c) show that the ﬁrst derivatives of the policy functions with
respect to σ evaluated at xt = x and σ = 0 are nil (so gσva = gσvr = gσcr = 0). It follows
immediately from the above expression that

                                                Λσ (x, 0) = 0.

Now totally diﬀerentiating (48) twice with respect to σ and evaluating the result at (x0 , σ) =
(x, 0) yields
                                                       va
                                                      gσσ (x, 0) − gσσ

Thus, our welfare cost measure, in percentage terms, is given by

                          welfare cost = −             β     1

                                                                        2

   As mentioned above, in deriving this measure of welfare costs we do not apply the factor
1 − λ to the level of consumption in period −1. Alternatively, one could deﬁne the welfare
cost index applying the factor 1 − λ to the entire argument of the ﬁrst term of the initial
period’s utility function, c0 −bc−1 , rather than just to c0 . In this case, λ is implicitly given by
         !
V0a = E0 ∞  t=0 β U((ct − bct−1 )(1 − λ), mt , ht ). A second-order-accurate measure of welfare
                  t    r      r             hr  r

costs is then given by −(1 − β)[gσσ
                                 va
                                    (x, 0) − gσσ
                                              vr
                                                 (x, 0)] × (σ 2 /2) × 100. Clearly, because this
welfare measures is proportional to the one we adopt, both measure will deliver identical
welfare rankings. Moreover, under the baseline calibration adopted in this paper the ratio
of the welfare cost measure we adopt to the alternative discussed here is 0.9865. Therefore,
both criteria deliver almost identical welfare cost numbers.8
   8
    The reason why λ is always bigger in absolute value under the alternative welfare cost measure is quite
intuitive. Suppose that the reference policy (r) yields less welfare than the alternative policy (a). In this
case, λ is negative, because households living under the reference policy must be compensated by an increase
in consumption. However, if the increase in consumption also applies to the initial stock of habit c−1 , as is
the case under the welfare cost criterion not adopted in this paper, then the compensated initial stock of
habit is higher making the agent worse oﬀ. As a result λ must be bigger.

6       Policy Evaluation
In our search for the optimal monetary rule, we limit attention to what we call operational
rules. To be operational, an interest-rate rule must set the nominal interest rate as a function
of a few readily observable macroeconomic variables. We study rules where the nominal
interest rate responds to its own lag, inﬂation, and output. In addition, an operational rule
is required to posses the following two properties: First, it must induce a locally unique
rational expectations equilibrium.9 Second, operational rules must satisfy the nonnegativity
constraint on the nominal interest rate. For technical reasons, we are unable to impose
this constraint directly. Speciﬁcally, the second-order perturbation approach we apply in
our numerical work is ill equipped to handle occasionally binding constraints.10 Instead,
we require that under an operational rule the target value for the nominal interest rate be
greater than two times the standard deviation of the nominal interest rate. Formally, we
require that ln(R∗ ) ≥ 2σR̂t . If the equilibrium nominal interest rate was normally distributed
around its target value, then this constraint would ensure a positive nominal interest rate
98 percent of the time. A possible alternative would be to require that the unconditional
mean of the nominal interest rate, rather than its target value, be greater than 2 standard
deviations of the nominal interest rate, that is, E ln Rt > 2σR̂t . One reason why we do not
pursue this alternative is that it is computationally more costly. This is because obtaining a
second-order accurate approximation to the unconditional mean of the nominal interest rate
requires approximating the equilibrium up to second order, whereas obtaining a second-order
accurate approximation to the variance of the nominal interest rate requires approximating
the equilibrium conditions only up to ﬁrst order. Admittedly, as long as E ln Rt < ln R∗ ,
the criterion ln R∗ > 2σR̂t is less restrictive than the criterion E ln Rt > 2σR̂t . Indeed, in our
economy, there is a tendency for optimal policy to induce a mean interest rate below the
target R∗ . This is because the demand for money in combination with indexation creates
incentives for policy to gravitate toward the Friedman rule. As we show later, however,
although the operational rule that we identify as optimal implies that E ln Rt < ln R∗ , it
satisﬁes the tighter criterion E ln Rt > 2σR̂t .
    An operational rule is judged to be optimal when it yields a higher level of welfare to the
representative agent than any other operational rule.
    9
     An alternative, not pursued in this study, is to enlarge the set of operational monetary rules by allowing
for policy regimes that render the equilibrium locally indeterminate. This approach requires introducing
plausible assumptions about the expectations coordination mechanism, which is outside the scope of our
investigation.
  10
     Other authors have also faced the need to circumvent the problem of not being able to directly impose
the zero-bound constraint on nominal interest rates. See, for instance, Rotemberg and Woodford (1999, p.
75).



                                                      31
   The family of interest-rate rules presented in equation (33) can be fully characterized by
four parameters, namely, απ , measuring the responsiveness of interest rates to deviations of
inﬂation from the central bank’s target, αy , the output-gap coeﬃcient, αR , measuring the
degree of policy inertia, and i, measuring the backward-, current-, or forward-looking nature
of policy. We further restrict the policy quadruple (απ , αy , αR , i) to lie in the following space:
The parameters απ , measuring the responsiveness of interest rates to deviations of inﬂation
from the central bank’s target, and αy , the output gap coeﬃcient, are conﬁned to take values
in the interval -3 and 3. For both απ and αy , we consider a grid with a step size of 0.0625.
The degree of policy inertia, measured by the parameter αR , can take 3 possible values, 0, 1,
and 2. When αR equals zero we say that policy lacks inertia. When αR equals unity, policy is
referred to as inertial. And, following the terminology of Rotemberg and Woodford (1999),
when αR equals two, we say that policy is superinertial. Finally, we consider three possible
values for the parameter i, 1, 0, and -1. When i = 1, the central bank is backward-looking
in the sense that it sets interest rates based on past information regarding inﬂation and
output. When i equals zero, the central bank responds to contemporaneous realizations of
inﬂation and the output gap. And when i = −1, the monetary authority is forward-looking,
as the current instrument setting is a function of expectations of future price and output
movements. Summarizing, our discretized policy parameter space contains 97 possible values
for απ , 97 possible values for αy , 3 possible values for αR , and 3 possible values for i. This
implies that we evaluate a total of 84,681 diﬀerent monetary policy regimes.
    An alternative to our approach of discretizing the policy space would be to rely on a
numerical optimization routine to ﬁnd the optimal interest-rate rule coeﬃcients απ , αy , and
αR for each value of the policy parameter i. The reason why we choose not to adopt this
numerical strategy is that it identiﬁes local extrema. And, as will become clear shortly,
in our model economy, welfare is a nonmonotonic function of the policy parameters, with
several local maxima.


6.1    Welfare Surfaces
Figure 3 shows the level of welfare associated with the diﬀerent policy rules as functions
of the policy parameters απ and αy holding constant the degree of policy inertia αR and
the parameter i indicating whether the rule is backward-, current-, or forward-looking. The
welfare measure that is plotted corresponds to a second-order approximation to the expres-
sion given in equation (46). Only policies that imply a welfare cost of at most 0.1 percent
of the lifetime consumption stream under the best operational rule are shown. The welfare
surfaces appear to be piecewise smooth in απ and αy . However, the welfare graph displays


                                                 32
Figure 3: Welfare as a Function of απ and αy




                    33
multiple local maxima. This feature motivates our choice of ﬁnding the optimal interest rate
rule using a grid search over the policy parameters rather than relying on local optimization
routines.
   Figure 4 depicts in black the pairs απ and αy for which the associated equilibrium is
determinate but the zero-bound constraint is violated, with grey the pair for which the
equilibrium is determinate and the zero-bound constraint is satisﬁed, and with white the
pairs for which the equilibrium fails to be locally determinate, given values for the policy
parameters αR and i. A cross marks the optimal operational rule given αR and i. Each row
of graphs reveals a tight connection between the degree of interest-rate smoothing, αR , and
the threshold value for the inﬂation sensitivity parameter απ above which an operational
rule exists. In the absence of inertia (αR = 0, left column), operational rules exist only for
inﬂation coeﬃcients greater than unity (απ > 1). This stability condition also appears in
simpler monetary models. When policy is inertial (αR = 1, middle column), operational
rules exist for values of απ greater than zero, and when policy is superinertial (αR = 2, right
column), operational rules exist for απ > −1. This relation suggests a pattern according
to which operational rules exist only for values of απ greater than 1 − αR . The area of
operational rules is roughly symmetric around acyclical rules (αy = 0). As a result, the more
cyclical is the rule (whether pro- or countercyclical) the less likely it is to be operational.
For the subclass of acyclical rules, the set of operational rules is the same as the set of rules
that induce a locally determinate equilibrium.


6.2    The Optimal Operational Rule
Table 2 displays the inﬂation and output coeﬃcients of the operational rules that maximize
welfare for each of the 3 values of the degree of policy inertia considered (αR = 0, 1, 2) and
for each of the 3 values taken by the parameter i measuring the current-, backward-, or
forward-looking nature of policy. The table also shows the level of welfare attained by each
optimized rule and the associated welfare cost relative to the best operational rule using the
welfare cost measure given in equation (49).
   The optimal operational rule takes the form

                              R̂t = 1.125Et π̂t+1 − 0.0625Et ŷt+1 .

This rule can be interpreted as a real-interest-rate targeting rule, for it is forward looking,
has an inﬂation coeﬃcient close to unity, has an output coeﬃcient of about zero, and displays
no inertia. Importantly, the inﬂation coeﬃcient, although close to unity, is in accordance
with the Taylor principle, prescribing a more than one-to-one response of interest rates to

deviations of inﬂation from target.
    Real-interest-rate targeting appears to be a robust feature of optimal operational policy.
In eﬀect, even if one limits attention to either contemporaneous- or backward-looking rules,
the optimal rule lacks inertia, is acyclical in the sense that the output coeﬃcient is nil, and
features an inﬂation coeﬃcient close to 1. The ﬁnding that real-interest-rate targeting is
optimal even when policy is restricted to being contemporaneous or backward looking is
important because some may argue that a forward-looking rule is not truly operational. For
forward-looking rules require knowledge on the part of the central bank of the private sector’s
expectations of future output and inﬂation, which is not readily observable information.
Moreover, some may argue that in practice current realizations of output and inﬂation are
not in the information set of the monetary authority at the time it makes policy decisions,
thus disqualifying current-looking rules from the set of operational rules. For these critics, a
rule is operational only when it is based on past observations of macroeconomic indicators.
Table 2 shows that the welfare costs of restricting policy to be operational in this tighter
sense are negligible. Speciﬁcally, the welfare cost of the best backward-looking rule vis-à-vis
the optimal rule is only 0.0009 percent of consumption per period.
   Table 2 also reports welfare evaluations of some commonly prescribed non-optimized
monetary policy rules. A monetary rule whereby the inﬂation rate is at its target in and out of
equilibrium, labeled inﬂation targeting in the bottom panel of table 2, induces indeterminacy
of the rational expectations equilibrium. For this reason, we are unable to evaluate the
welfare consequences of such a policy. A standard Taylor rule with an inﬂation coeﬃcient
of 1.5 and an output coeﬃcient of 0.5 fails to be operational, as it implies that 2σR̂t > ln R∗
so that the associated equilibrium frequently violates the zero bound on nominal interest
rates. A simpler Taylor rule, with an inﬂation coeﬃcient of 1.5 and an output coeﬃcient
of 0 does satisfy all of the requirements of an operational rule. It entails a welfare cost of
0.0029 percent of the lifetime consumption associated with the optimal rule. This welfare
cost number, although small in absolute terms, is greater than those associated with any of
the optimized rules shown in table 2.


6.3    Inertia, Cyclicality, and the Taylor Principle
The three main characteristics of the optimal operational rule are lack of inertia in interest
rates (αR = 0), acyclicality (αy close to zero), and a mildly active response to inﬂation (i.e.,
an inﬂation coeﬃcient greater than and close to unity). These three features of optimal
policy survive a large number of fundamental modiﬁcations to the baseline model.
   Table 4 presents the optimal operational rule for 7 variations of the baseline model: (1)


                                              37
indexation to long-run inﬂation (i.e., non-reoptimized prices/wages are adjusted by the factor
π ∗ each period); (2) ﬂexible wages (α̃ = 0.01); (3) ﬂexible prices (α = 0.01); (4) Higher costs
of varying capacity utilization (γ2 /γ1 = 2); (5) No habit formation (b = 0); (6) No money
held by households (φ1 = 0); and (7) no money at all (φ1 = ν = 0).
   Under all model variations considered, optimal operational policy lacks inertia in interest
rates. An exception is the case in which prices are indexed to long-run inﬂation. Interestingly,
indexation to long-run inﬂation is implicitly or explicitly assumed in related studies that
identify inertia as a feature of optimal monetary policy (e.g., Rotemberg and Woodford,
1999). This result underlines the importance of the exact indexation modality in shaping
optimal policy.
    The Taylor principle prescribing interest rate rules with an inﬂation coeﬃcient greater
than one is present in 5 of the 7 perturbations to the baseline model we perform. The
largest inﬂation coeﬃcient obtains under ﬂexible wages, where απ = 3. This number indeed
hits the upper bound imposed in our numerical computations. Intuitively, when wages are
ﬂexible, the monetary authority has a larger incentive to stabilize inﬂation to ameliorate the
consequences of the sticky-price distortion. In this case, the central bank stabilizes inﬂation
by setting the inﬂation coeﬃcient in the interest-rate rule as high as it can. As a result,
the equilibrium under ﬂexible wages features a standard deviation of inﬂation of only 0.5
percent, 4 times smaller than in the baseline model.
    Another robust feature of optimal operational rules appears to be a muted response of
interest rates to output. This result cannot be immediately related to the ﬁndings in the
related literature. The reason is that in most existing studies the central bank is assumed
to respond to a sophisticated output gap measure given by the diﬀerence between actual
output and the level of output that would obtain in a world without nominal rigidities. As
we mentioned earlier, this measure of the output gap is not readily observable and thus does
not satisfy our requirement of operationality.


6.4    Optimal Macroeconomic Adjustment
Figure 5 compares the dynamic response of the model economy induced by a 1-percent
technology shock under the optimal operational rule (solid line) to that arising under a simple
Taylor rule (broken line). The response of the real side of the economy is remarkably similar
under both rules. Under the optimal rule, however, the productivity shock produces smaller
though more persistent ﬂuctuations in all real variables. In particular, the real interest rate
displays a much smoother response under the optimal rule than under the simple Taylor
rule. On the nominal side, both rules call for an immediate easing in monetary policy to

accommodate the expansion caused by the improvement in productivity. However, under the
optimal rule the initial reduction in nominal interest rates is accompanied by a commitment
to tighten money market conditions in the future. By contrast, under the simple Taylor rule
the nominal interest rule remains below target along the entire transition. As a consequence,
the two rules induce quite diﬀerent inﬂationary dynamics. Under the best operational rule
an initial decline in inﬂation is accompanied by a large future increase in prices, whereas
under the simple Taylor rule this overshooting of inﬂation is absent.
   As a point of reference, ﬁgure 5 also shows, with a circled line, the dynamics of an
economy without any of the 4 nominal frictions that impede eﬃcient adjustment in the
baseline model. That is, an economy with ﬂexible prices and wages (α = α̃ = 0), and without
a demand for money by households or ﬁrms (φ1 = ν = 0).11 The optimal operational rule
does a remarkably good job at replicating the dynamics of the eﬃcient economy during the
initial phase of the transition. On the other hand, for the later part of the transition the
Taylor rule keeps the real allocation closer to that associated with the economy without
nominal frictions. Our welfare evaluation suggests that the welfare gains of mimicking the
initial transition outweigh the beneﬁts of replicating the later part of the adjustment. Recall,
however, that the welfare diﬀerences between the best operational rule and the simple Taylor
rule are minimal.


6.5     Is Inflation Stabilization Desirable?
Much of the existing literature on optimal monetary policy in the neo-Keynesian tradition
has stressed the importance of inﬂation stabilization as a central goal of monetary policy. A
general result that emerges from this body of work is that as Woodford (2004) puts it in his
recent survey of the inﬂation targeting literature, “it is not a bad ﬁrst approximation to say
that the goal of monetary policy should be price stability.” This conclusion emerges from
models that are highly stylized in the sense that they include a small number of nominal
and real frictions.
    Price stability ceases to dominate the monetary policy prescription in the richer theoret-
ical environment studied in this paper. Speciﬁcally, table 3 shows that under the optimal
operational rule price inﬂation is signiﬁcantly volatile, with a standard deviation of 2 percent
per annum, about half the U.S. mean inﬂation in the past 4 decades. The main force driving
the optimality of relatively high inﬂation volatility is the assumed indexation of wages and
prices to the lagged rate of inﬂation. As shown on line 2 of table 4, when the assumption
of indexation to lagged inﬂation is replaced by the assumption of indexation to long-run
  11
     Because in this economy monetary policy plays no role in the determination of real variables, ﬁgure 5
does not show the response of inﬂation and the nominal interest rate in this economy.

inﬂation, then the optimal volatility of inﬂation falls tenfold to 0.2 percent per annum. A
reason why the role of the precise nature of the indexation scheme in determining the de-
gree of optimal inﬂation volatility did not emerge earlier in the related literature is that by
focusing exclusively in the case of no indexation and zero long-run inﬂation, existing studies
in eﬀect concentrated in a special case of indexation to long-run inﬂation. The intuition for
why the indexation scheme is related to the optimal degree of inﬂation volatility is relatively
straightforward. Under indexation to lagged inﬂation, the distorting price dispersion induced
by price stickiness is smaller than under indexation to long-run inﬂation. This is because
when ﬁrms get the chance to reoptimize prices they need not fully incorporate expected
future deviations of inﬂation from trend in their current markups, as they know that they
will be allowed to keep up with aggregate price changes through indexation. On the other
hand, when indexation is based on long-run inﬂation, it is crucial for ﬁrms to incorporate in
their optimized prices the expected future deviations of inﬂation from trend. An economy
with indexation to lagged inﬂation is in this sense closer to a ﬂexible-price economy than an
economy with indexation to long-run inﬂation. An obvious implication of our ﬁnding is that
investigating what assumptions about indexation is empirically most compelling should be
a high priority for the applied monetary research agenda.
   Previous authors, notably Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000) have argued that the
optimality of low inﬂation volatility is not robust to the introduction of sluggish factor price
adjustment. Speciﬁcally, these authors extend the synthetic new Keynesian model to allow
for nominal wage stickiness and ﬁnd that full price stabilization is suboptimal. We ﬁnd that
this result generalizes to the richer economic environment studied here. Speciﬁcally, line 3
of table 4 shows the standard deviation associated with the best operational rule falls from
2 percent to 0.5 percent per annum when wage stickiness is removed.


6.6    The Role of Money
Optimal monetary policy induces a surprising positive relationship between the size of money
demand and the optimal degree of interest rate and inﬂation volatility. In eﬀect, in the
baseline economy inﬂation and the nominal interest rate display a volatility of about 2 percent
(see table 3). If one eliminates the demand for money by households by setting φ1 = 0, the
volatilities of inﬂation and the nominal interest rate drop to 0.8 (see table 4). This eﬀect
appears at ﬁrst as counterintuitive. For one would expect that the larger is the demand for
money, the stronger is the incentive for optimal policy to smooth the opportunity cost of
holding money, given by the nominal interest rate. This incentive is present in our model
economy. But there is also a payoﬀ for increasing interest rate volatility as the importance of

money holdings increases. Speciﬁcally, the beneﬁt is that higher interest rate volatility may
achieve a lower average nominal interest rate, thus increasing average money holdings, which
is welfare increasing, since money held by households enters into the utility function. The
policy maker resorts to this cumbersome way of reducing the opportunity cost of holding
money because by assumption he must work with an exogenously given target for inﬂation
and the nominal interest rate. Comparing the means and standard deviations of the nominal
interest rate in the benchmark economy with those of the economy in which households do
not demand money, suggest that the policy maker resolves this mean-volatility tradeoﬀ in
favor of lower mean nominal interest rates at the cost of higher interest rate volatility.12


6.7       Transitional Dynamics Matter
The existing literature on macroeconomic stabilization says little about the role of initial
conditions in shaping optimal policy. Typically, policy-evaluation studies are conducted on
the basis of unconditional measures of welfare, which by design ‘integrate away’ the role
of the initial state. We ﬁnd that transitional dynamics are indeed an important factor
  12
   The unconditional mean of the nominal interest rate in the models with and without money held by
households are, respectively, 6.9 and 7.1.

determining the choice of the optimal policy rule. This can be seen by comparing the
conditional welfare numbers reported in table 2 with the unconditional expectation of lifetime
utility, which are shown in the last column of table 5. Based on an unconditional measure
of welfare, the optimal operational rule is in fact the worst of all rules shown in the table.
By construction, the unconditional welfare measure is a weighted average of the conditional
welfare levels associated with all possible values of the state vector with weights given by
their unconditional probabilities. It follows that for some initial conditions the conditional
welfare ranking reported in table 2 should be reversed as well. This result is indicative
of the fact that the optimal operational rule lacks time consistency. In other words, if the
monetary authority was given the chance to reoptimized the parameters deﬁning the interest-
rate feedback rule after period 0, it would in general not choose the the policy quadruple
that was optimal from the point of view of period 0.
   The fact that welfare rankings appears not to be independent of the initial state of the
economy suggests that it is important to consider relevant initial conditions. Here we explore
the initial condition given by the unconditional expectation of the state vector in an economy
in which monetary policy takes the form of a simple Taylor rule (R̂t = 1.5π̂t ). The reason

we consider this initial condition is that the policy rule that induces it can be interpreted as
a rough characterization of actual U.S. monetary policy post 1980.
    Table 6 shows three alternative welfare measures for the 10 operational policies presented
in table 2: namely, unconditional expected welfare, expected welfare conditional on the initial
state being the deterministic steady state, and expected welfare conditional on the initial
state being the mean of the state vector in an economy that follows a simple Taylor rule. An
important result conveyed by table 6 is that changing the initial condition of the economy
from the deterministic steady state to an arguably more relevant one given by the mean of
the distribution of the state vector under a simple Taylor rule does not alter the fact that
the real-interest-rate targeting rule R̂t = 1.125Et π̂t+1 − 0.0625Et ŷt+1 welfare dominates all
other 9 rules considered in table 2. This result suggests that a monetary authority that has
being following a simple Taylor rule in the past could ﬁnd it beneﬁcial to switch policy to
a real interest-rate targeting rule like the optimal operational rule if the economy is in its
average state.

6.8    Optimal Policy One Nominal Friction at a Time
It is well known from the work of Goodfriend and King (1997) among many others that
in a model where sluggish product price adjustment is the only nominal friction, optimal
policy stabilizes inﬂation completely. That is, the optimal monetary policy calls for setting
the variance of πt equal to zero. It is also well known that one way to implement this
policy is by means of an interest-rate feedback rule with a very large inﬂation coeﬃcient
(Woodford, 2001). The existing literature containing this result is based on simple theoretical
frameworks. Here we show that the same conclusions hold is the much richer and empirically
plausible model studied in this paper. In eﬀect, table 4 shows that if one shuts down all
of the nominal rigidities present in our model but price stickiness by setting φ1 , ν, and α̃
equal to zero—and thereby engineering a cashless economy with ﬂexible wages—then the
best interest-rate rule calls for a short-run inﬂation coeﬃcient απ equal to the upper bound
of 3 imposed by our grid, and a long-run inﬂation coeﬃcient, απ /(1 − αR ), of inﬁnity by
making the rule inertial. Moreover, the optimal interest-rate rule is welfare dominated by a
strict inﬂation targeting rule whereby the inﬂation rate is kept at its target level at all times,
π̂t = 0.
    Not surprisingly, in a world where the only nominal friction stems from wage stickiness,
inﬂation stabilization is no longer optimal. Table 4 shows that in this case the optimal
level of inﬂation volatility is 3.5 percent per annum. Also as expected, in the economy
with sticky wages only the volatility of wage inﬂation is smaller than the volatility of price
inﬂation (0.8 versus 3.5 percent per year) whereas in the economy with sticky prices only it
is the other way around (0.1 versus 0). What is somewhat surprising is that the presence of
wage stickiness does not call for stabilizing wage inﬂation. In the sticky-wage-only economy,
the volatility of wage inﬂation under the optimal interest-rate rule is 0.8 percent per year
whereas in the sticky-price-only economy it is only 0.1 percent per year. Interestingly, in the
model we study in this paper, the presence of wage stickiness does not appear to introduce
a meaningful inﬂation-output volatility tradeoﬀ, as found in simpler setups (e.g., Erceg,
Henderson, Levin, 2000). Speciﬁcally, under the optimized rule the volatility of output is
the same, 1.6 percent, in the economies with sticky prices only, sticky wages only, and sticky
wages and sticky prices only (i.e., no money).
   In the economy where money demand by household represents the only nominal friction,
optimal monetary policy is geared toward reducing the average opportunity cost of holding
money to increase mean real money holdings, which enter the welfare index directly. Specif-
ically, the mean of the nominal interest rate is 6.8 percent, compared to 7.2 in the economy
without money. As a result, real balances in the economy with money by households only are
on average 2.4 percent above their steady-state level. The reduction in the average nominal

                                               46
interest rate is achieved at the costs of relatively high interest-rate volatility. As mentioned
earlier, this awkward taste for nominal interest-rate volatility on the part of the central bank
is induced by the exogeneity of the inﬂation target. If the inﬂation target was endogenous,
the monetary authority should choose an inﬂation level in line with the Friedman rule, and,
in the case of money being the only nominal friction, no interest-rate volatility. A diﬀerent
pattern emerges when the only nominal friction in the economy is a demand for money by
ﬁrms. In this case, the mean-volatility tradeoﬀ for the nominal interest rate is resolved in
favor of interest-rate stability.


7     Conclusion
The contribution of this paper is to perform second-order accurate welfare evaluations of
operational interest rate feedback rules in a large-scale, empirically compelling model of
the U.S. business cycle. The stabilization policy problem in this economy is complicated
by the presence of a multitude of nominal and real frictions including sticky wages and
prices, a demand for money by households and ﬁrms, monopolistic competition, investment
adjustment costs, habit formation, and variable costs of adjusting the degree of capacity
utilization.
    The key characteristic of the optimal operational rule is that it stabilizes the real interest
rate. The presence of nominal rigidities play a signiﬁcant role in shaping optimal monetary
policy. This is reﬂected in the fact that when either one of the nominal rigidities is elimi-
nated or when the price or wage indexation scheme is altered, then the form of the optimal
operational rule changes signiﬁcantly.
   The optimal operational rule induces an equilibrium with a non-negligible degree of in-
ﬂation volatility. This implication of optimal policy is sensitive to the particular indexation
scheme assumed for prices and wages. In particular, when the baseline assumption of indexa-
tion to lagged price inﬂation is replaced by the assumption of indexation to the long-run level
of inﬂation, then inﬂation volatility under the optimal operational rule drops signiﬁcantly.
    This paper can be extended in a variety of ways. One is to investigate how optimal policy
changes as the sources of uncertainty driving business cycles is expanded. One alternative
is to incorporate the rich set of shocks identiﬁed in econometric estimations of the model
considered in this paper (e.g., Smets and Wouters, 2004).
    The class of operational rules studied in this paper is clearly not exhaustive. It would
be of interest to investigate whether the inclusion of macroeconomic indicators other than
those considered here would improve the policy makers ability to stabilize the economy. In
particular, the related literature has emphasized the use of measures of the output gap that

                                               47
are diﬀerent from that used in the present study. Additionally, it has been argued that in
models with nominal wage and price rigidities the optimal policy should target an average
of wage and price inﬂation as opposed to only price inﬂation, which is the case analyzed in
this paper.
    The optimal policy problem analyzed in this paper takes the central bank’s inﬂation
target as exogenously given. A natural extension is to endogenize this variable. However, in
the theoretical framework studied here, the optimal inﬂation target is the one associated with
the Friedman rule. This is because the assumption of full indexation to past inﬂation implies
the absence of ineﬃcient price and wage dispersion in the long run. Thus the only remaining
nominal friction is the demand for money by households and ﬁrms. The elimination of
these frictions calls for driving the opportunity costs of holding money to zero in the long
run. In other words, the zero bound on nominal interest rate binds in the non-stochastic
steady state. Unfortunately, the perturbation technique employed in this paper is ill suited
to handle this case. Therefore, analyzing the case of an endogenous inﬂation target entails
either changing the model so that the Friedman rule is no longer optimal in the long-run or
adopting alternative numerical techniques for computing welfare accurately up to second-
order or higher.
   A ﬁnding of this paper is that the initial state of the economy plays a role in determining
the parameters deﬁning the optimal interest-rate rule. This ﬁnding suggests that the optimal
operational rule identiﬁed here is time inconsistent. Throughout the paper we assume that
the government is able to commit to the policy announcements made at time 0. It would be
of interest to compute optimal operational rules in an environment without commitment.
    Finally, the current study limits attention to the special case of passive ﬁscal policy,
taking the form of a balanced-budget rule with lump-sum taxation. It is well known that
the set of operational monetary rules depends on the stance of ﬁscal policy. For instance, the
determinacy properties of the rational expectations equilibrium associated with a particular
monetary rule can change as ﬁscal policy is altered. Therefore, it would be of interest to
introduce operational ﬁscal rules as an additional policy instrument.
