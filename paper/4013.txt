    DETECTION OF BID RIGGING IN PROCUREMENT AUCTIONS


                                 ABSTRACT


         This paper examines bidding in auctions for state highway construction

contracts on Long Island in the early 1980s, in order to determine whether bid

rigging occurred. Detection of collusion is possible because of limited

participation in the collusive scheme. The paper looks at differences in

behavior between ring members and non-members. In these auctions, collusion

did not take the form of a bid rotation scheme, in which only one ring member

submits a bid. Instead, several ring members bid on most jobs. The apparent

role of ring meetings prior to the auction was to designate a serious bidder, and

its bid, and the other firms then frequently submitted phony higher bids. The

bidding data indicate that the bids of non-cartel firms, as well as their rank

distribution, were related to cost measures, such as how much backlog a firm

was carrying. In contrast, the rank distribution of higher cartel bids was

unrelated to similar cost measures, and differed from the distribution of the low

cartel bid.

I.       INTRODUCTION
         Between 1982 and 1988, more than half of the
criminal cases filed by the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice involved bid rigging or price
fixing in auction markets.1 Bid rigging appears to be
a pervasive, problem, with indictments in highway
construction, the distribution of school milk, utility
procurement and other auction markets. Typically, a
government agency, and hence the taxpayer, was the
victim.
         This paper proposes econometric test procedures
that are designed to detect the presence of bid
rigging in procurement auctions.2 Our tests will be
poor substitutes for a wiretap or a disclosure by a
dissident ring member. However, our procedures may be
preferable to the view that patterns of bid rotation,
or relatively constant market shares, constitute
irrefutable evidence of collusion. Rotating bids are
consistent with competitive equilibria when there are
decreasing returns to scale, such as when there are
capacity constraints, as Zona (1986) demonstrates.
Lang and Rosenthal (1991) show that the noncooperative
mixed strategy equilibrium of a multiproject bidding
game, in which firms simultaneously compete            for


     1
          See U.S. General Accounting Office (1990).
     2
          Accordingly,   we refer to the intended victim as
the buyer, and the bidding ring is a subset of the
potential sellers. The effect of the ring, then, will
be to inflate the price paid by the buyer.

                               1
several contracts, may entail negative correlation
between a firm's bids, or an apparent bid rotation
pattern. Similarly, comparisons of winning bids and
engineers' estimates of costs, that attempt to measure
economic returns, may be unreliable.         Engineer's
estimates may be unduly influenced by historical bid
patterns, and so be an inflated measure of true costs.
      In general, finding a single test procedure to
detect bid rigging is an impossible goal. As in most
tests for the exercise of market power, the idea is to

identify   differences    between      the   observable
implications of collusive and competitive behavior.
The difficulty is that both competitive and collusive
equilibria depend, to a great extent, on the economic
environment, such as the auction rules and the nature
of the good being traded.       As Hendricks and Porter
(1989) argue, collusion in auctions can take many
forms, and it is important to tailor empirical work to
specific cases. For example, a cartel might adopt a
pure bid rotation scheme, where members take turns
submitting bids in individual auctions (according to
a "phases of the moon" scheme, for example).
Alternatively, cartel members in addition to the
designated winner may submit higher complementary or
frivolous bids, perhaps to create the appearance of
competition.   It is unlikely that any single test
procedure could detect all collusive schemes, absent
data on economic returns (in which case effective
collusion might be detected by the presence of

                            2
persistently high profits).       As a consequence,
structural modelling and estimation are difficult,
absent more detailed information.      In environments
where complementary bids are submitted, structural
modelling may be impossible, because it is not clear
what complementary bids might be intended to maximize,
apart from being higher than the winner's bid.
      If a broadly applicable test to detect collusion
could be devised, a cartel with full participation
should be able to choose complementary bids so that
the overall bid pattern passed the test. Phantom bid
schemes can be structured so that the difference
between the low and second lowest bids looks
competitive.    Presumably, an auction procedure is
employed precisely because the buyer is not aware of
the exact costs of the individual sellers. Submitted
bids could be designed to be consistent with
competitive    bidding   based   on   some   plausible
realization of seller costs.
      There is a small empirical literature on
collusion in auctions.     Feinstein, Block and Nold
(1985) propose and test a model of a cartel that
manipulates engineers' estimates of the costs of
highway construction jobs, by submitting complementary
bids relatively close to the winning bid. Zona (1986)
propose a test for bid rigging itt highway construction
auctions based on a switching regression model.
Comanor and Schankerman (1976) examine the propensity
of bid rigging schemes to submit identical bids in

                           3
individual auctions. NcMillan (1991) describes Dango,
the negotiation among bidders for Japanese public
works contracts, that is very similar to the collusive
mechanism allegedly employed by some of the firms in
our sample.   McClave, Rothrock and Ailstock (1978)
analyze bidding patterns in Florida school bread
markets. Finally, Howard and Kaserman (1989) propose
a regression based method of calculating damages in
bid rigging cases.
      Our paper examines the bidding behavior of firms
competing for state highway construction contracts on
Long Island in the early 1980s. Our data are somewhat
limited, as we shall explain, but detection of
collusion is possible because of limited participation
in the collusive scheme. Our methodology is intended
to detect differences in behavior between ring members
and nonxnembers.   Ring membership itself probably
depends on unobservable factors which differ across
firms, so that bidding differences may be structural
rather than evidence of collusion.      In our data,
collusion apparently did not take the form of a bid
rotation scheme. In that instance, collusion would be
empirically indistinguishable from the hypothesis that
bid   participation    decisions     merely     reflect
unobservable characteristics of the firms, so that
different firms specialize in different types of jobs.
Instead, member firms submitted bids on most jobs.
The role of ring meetings prior to the auction was to
designate a serious bidder and its bid.       The other

                          4
members were then expected to          submit higher
complementary bids.     Accordingly, our procedure
distinguishes between the lowest cartel bid (recall,
this is a procurement auction in which the lowest bid
wins) and other cartel bids. We take as evidence of
collusive behavior the fact that the lowest noncartel
bidder's behavior is not statistically distinguishable
from that of other noncartel firms, whereas the
determinants of the low cartel bid differ from those
of higher cartel bids.         This discrepancy     is

characteristic of the levels of the submitted bids, as
well as their rank distribution.
      Section 2 of this paper describes the structure
of New York state highway construction auctions. We
document why these auctions may be susceptible to
bidder collusion.     En addition, a subset of the
participating firms allegedly submitted noncompetitive
bids on jobs not in our data set, and therefore
constitute a candidate cartel in our data set.
Section 3 outlines an econometric model of competitive
bidding behavior. We then describe our test, which is
designed to detect departures from competition that
are consistent with the hypothesized nature of
collusive bidding. The available data are described
in more detail in Section 4, and our estimation and
test results are presented in Section 5.




                          5
II.   THE MARKET
      The New York State Department of Transportation
(DOT) is required to solicit bids and award highway
contracts to the lowest responsible bidder.3 To that
end, the DOT periodically distributes a "Notice of
Highway Lettings" to a list of subscribers, to inform
them of highway construction projects to be let in the
near future.     These notices include a very brief
description of the project and a reference nunber to
be used for further information.      Fins that are
interested in submitting a bid on these projects
request plans and specifications from the Department.
A "Plan Buyers List" is also available from the DOT,
and it lists the fins that purchase plans for
specific jobs.     The list of plan buyers is also
distributed to subscribers.     On the day of the
letting, sealed bids are opened and the identity of
all bidders and their bids are announced to those
present. The low bid is accepted provided that it is



         In government auction markets, the lowest
reasonable bid is accepted if the bidder is qualified.
According   to   U.S.   code,   "Contracts   for   the
construction of each project shall be awarded only on
the basis of the lowest responsive bid submitted by a
bidder     meeting     established     criteria     of
responsibility." 23 u.s.c. §122(b) (1982). Under the
same code, states are required to select contractors
through a competitive bidding process when projects
are completely or in part financed by federal funds.
See Joyner (1985) for a more complete discussion of
the bidding process and related law.

                          6
"responsible." The DOT checks calculations, compares
the bid to its own estimate of the job cost, and if it
is satisfied, awards the contract. The DOT announces
the results of the letting process, and all bids and
contracts awarded, to subscribers via the DOT notice
"Tabulation of Results."

        Using the auction mechanism described above, the
DOT awarded about $120 million4 in highway contracts
from April 1979 through March 1985 in Nassau and
Suffolk Coubties on Long Island.      According to our
data, 186 contracts were let in this period, with 161
contracts awarded for less than $1 million. A total
of 66 firms bid on at least one of these 161 smaller
DOT contracts. However, only 22 firms submitted bids
on large jobs (over $1 million), and 45 percent of the
bids on large jobs were submitted by four firms.
        According to local newspapers, one of the large
firms was convicted in federal court of rigging bids
on a Long Island highway construction project. While
the rigged project predates our sample, it may not
have represented an isolated event but rather a
pervasive problem that may be evident in our data. We
argue below that there are several reasons to expect
collusion in this market. We describe a particular
set of fins that may be able to profitably collude,
and we specify a mechanism of bid rigging that is


    "
         All
           dollar amounts in this paper are expressed
in constant 1969 dollars.

                           7
consistent with casual observation of the behavior of
these fins.
      We think of collusion as an arrangement among a
group of bidders, either explicit or implicit, that is

designed to limit competition among the participants.
Limiting competition may enable the ring to increase
profits. Several features of the Nassau-Suffolk DOT
market may encourage firms to collude.               Each
significant feature of the market is described below.
         Firms compete only on price. Under the terms of
the contract, the winning bidder supplies labor and
materials     and   produces       output with specified
characteristics. The definition of "output" is held
constant over all bidders, implying a de facto
homogeneous product.     Product differentiation is not
allowed. A cartel need only coordinate action in the
price dimension to collude.
      The DOT policy of publicly announcing the bids
and the identity of bidders allows cartel members to
detect      deviations    from       cartel   agreements.
Undercutting or cheating would not go unnoticed. In
addition, the availability of plan buyer lists allows
ex ante common knowledge of the set of potential
bidders.     Prospective bidders know who they will be
bidding against before they submit a bid. All of this
information was readily available to firms in our data
set, since the trade associations were subscribers to
the DOT notices.      For example, the information was
routinely distributed by the contractors' association

                               8
to member firms.       A cartel should face less
uncertainty, and therefore perhaps be more stable, in
such an environment,
      During the sample period, the DOT exhibited
almost perfectly inelastic demand. Although the state
sets an overall budget for the DOT based on requests
from the Department, demand is largely exogenous.
With one notable exception,5 every contract was
ultimately awarded to the low bidder, regardless of
the DOT estimate of the cost.      As a result, any
inflation of winning bids due to collusion would be
completely captured as profits. Of course, successful
collusion may result in fewer lettings in the future.



        According to our data, in February 1983,   the
DOT solicited bids on a contract for resurfacing   0.8
miles of road.    Eight bids were submitted and    the
lowest bid was about $4,000,000. The DOT decided   not
to award the contract, because the low bid was
unusually high relative to their own estimate of the
cost. The contract was again put out to bid in May
1983. This time four bids were submitted, three by
firms that had submitted a bid previously, and a
fourth by a new firm.   The low bid was 20 percent
higher, and submitted by the previous low bidder.
Again, the contract was not awarded. The contract was
put out to bid again in February 1984, and this time
three bids were submitted. All three firms had bid in
both previous sales. The low bid was about 10 percent
higher than the previous low bid, and about 30 percent
higher than the low bid in the first letting. It is
notable that the ranking of the bidders did not
change, and the low bidder was the same firm in each
of the auctions.    Because of the unusual bidding
patterns, the contract was not awarded through 1987.

                          9
         The set of firms submitting bids on large
projects was small and fairly stable over the period
analyzed, even though the DOT actively recruited New
York City firms for work in Nassau and Suffolk
Counties.     Entry would have been difficult due to
large transportation costs (the batch concrete and
asphalt plants employed on large jobs are typically
owned by the bidder), and control of local facilities
by the incumbent firms.     In addition, union locals
could have       exerted   significant    control   over
production.6 There may have been significant barriers
to entry, and there was little entry in a growing
market.
         As described above, the market for large jobs
was highly concentrated. Only 22 firms submitted bids
on jobs over $1 million.        On the 25 largest jobs,
45 percent of the 76 bids were submitted by the four
largest firms.      Most of the remainder were from
smaller firms that bid infrequently. In our sample of
paving jobs, 575 bids were submitted on 116 lettings.
Sixteen firms bid on jobs of $1 million or more. Of


     S
      According to an article published in Newsday,
insiders say leaders of the two most powerful
construction unions on Long Island discouraged outside
bidders by threatening future labor trouble. At least
one of the unions covered the entire metropolitan
area.  Thus, when word spread that particular firms
had "the inside track on large public bids on the
Island and the unions wanted it that way. . .very few
people missed the message."   (See Newsday, Sunday,
November 18, 1984, pp. 3, 30.)

                           10
the 79 bids on the 25 largest paving jobs, ranging
from approximately $940 thousand to $8 million,
46 percent were submitted by the four largest firms.
In bidding for the larger contracts, a ring would not
have faced much outside competition.
      Firms had many opportunities to communicate with
each other. Host bidders were active in the local
trade associations. Joint bidding was also allowed,
provided that multiple bids were not submitted. Some
firms did, in fact, submit joint bids.

      Lettings for larger jobs occurred fairly
regularly, early each year.    The regularity of the
lettings may have tended to increase (and make more
predictable) the discounted value of continued
collusion compared to deviation from, and subsequent
expulsion from, any agreement. Although several jobs
were often let on a single day, typically only one
large job was offered on any given day. Spacing the
letting of large jobs may limit the profits that a
defector could earn before other cartel members
retaliated.   Therefore, the timing of lettings may
facilitate collusion.
      Finally, firms were relatively homogeneous. All
cartel firms bought variable inputs in the same market
and presumably paid the same factor prices.7      The



        We do not know if unions enforced common wage
scales, but employees of all the firms were affiliated
with the same labor unions.

                         11
production process was the same for all firms (and
usually specified by the terms of the DOT contract),
with little technological change.      In addition, the
likely ring members were all headquartered on Long
Island.      However, heterogeneities may have existed
because firms owned different mixes of capital
equipment.     Also, the production process could have
exhibited a deep "U"-shaped short-run average cost
curve.     Therefore, small changes in output may have
induced large changes in average cost.         Short-run
heterogeneities can arise when job backlog affects
average costs for firms that have previously been
awarded contracts. In any event, these are short-run
phenomena and all firms are similar in the long run.
The long-run viability of a cartel is enhanced by this

similarity.
         To summarize, the characteristics of this
particular market tend to facilitate collusion. There
is a demonstrated ability of a group of competitors to
coordinate actions (by joint bidding); there are
relatively few bidders on large jobs; characteristics
of the letting process could help cartel members
police collusive arrangements; the DOT short-run
demand elasticity is near zero; the geographic market
is isolated; and barriers to entry seem to exist.
         In 1984, one of the five biggest firms in Nassau
and Suffolk Counties was convicted in federal court of
rigging bids on a Long Island highway construction
project. Four other firms were listed as unindicted

                            12
co-conspirators. All five firms have been named as
participants in bid-rigging schemes in separate
antitrust or racketeering suits filed by New York
State or Suffolk County. In each suit, a single job
was analyzed. No systematic review of other contract
lettings was conducted. This group of five firms may
have been rigging bids on other jobs that were not
analyzed (or have not yet resulted in indictments).
For the purpose of this paper, the five firms
constitute a candidate cartel, potentially operating
in any DOT contract letting. We henceforward refer to
them as "cartel" firms, where the quotations indicate
the tentative nature of the classification.     Other
bidders are henceforward dubbed "competitive." In the
following sections, the cartel firms are individually
referred to as Firms 2, 3, 4, 10 and 14.8      If, in
fact, cartel bids are competitive, then no systematic
differences between the two groups of firms should be
detected.

      Notwithstanding the allegations of conspiracy by
the cartel firms, inspection of the data also
indicates that these firms represent a plausible
cartel. The cartel firms submitted 54 percent of the
bids on larger jobs, and were awarded 37 percent of
all contracts. It is at least conceivable that the



        Firm 10 stopped participating in DOT auctions
very early in our sample of paving jobs, and instead
specialized in other lines of business.

                          13
group could profit by coordinating their bids.         In
addition,     they did not behave       like     ruthless
competitors. The five cartel fins submitted several
joint bids over the period analyzed, demonstrating an
ability and willingness to cooperate.            Table 1
summarizes joint bidding by cartel firms during the
sample period.

          3,4,8       November 1984    $8,000,000


      Joint bids can be mechanisms for allocating the
market and therefore indicative of bid-rigging. Joint
bidding is illegal unless the specified work could not
be performed without the combined capabilities of the
participating firms, or if the bidders could not be
competitive individually.9 Whether or not the bids in
Table I were legitimate, the cartel fins have a
demonstrated ability and willingness to coordinate
action.

      Fundamentally,     any bid-rigging scheme limits
the number of competitive bids that are entered on a


        See, for example, COMPACT v. Metropolitan
Government of Nashville and Davidson City, 592 F.
Supp. 1567 [l984J.

                           14
particular job.       Cartel members could limit
competition on a job either by refraining from
bidding, or by submitting noncompetitive bids.          If
noncompetitive bids are submitted, then a phantom
bidding scheme is being pursued.          Many bid-rigging
practices condemned by the courts have included
phantom bidding.'° Under these schemes, a letting
may appear to be competitive to both the buyer and
noncartel firms.
      The possibility of a cartel phantom •bidding
scheme is consistent with our data. The cartel firms
regularly bid "against" each other. Table 2 shows the
number of occasions on which one of the firms in the
group bid against another in lettings of contracts
involving paving. Joint bids were excluded from our
data set.

For example, Table 2 indicates that on the 48
occasions when Firm 2 submitted a bid, 37 bids were
also submitted by Firm 3. At least one firm in the
candidate cartel submitted an individual bid on all
but two of the large jobs in our data. Table 3 shows
the probability of multiple cartel bids on paving and
nonpaving jobs, given that at least one cartel firm
bids on a job. For example, at least one other cartel
firm bid on a paving job 88 percent of the times when
Fin 2 bid. Every time Firm 14 bid on a paving job,
another cartel firm did as well. The probability that
cartel fins bid against each other on nonpaving jobs
is slightly lower, as demonstrated by the lower
percentages reported in the second column of Table 3.

      In addition to the evidence from the bidding
data, information obtained from insiders suggests that
a phantom bidding scheme was employed by these fins.
These sources describe the process.

      "We all sat at the conference table
      one of the contractors would have a list
      of upcoming contracts ... they'd talk
      about the contract ... how much money
      who won the last one ... who should get
      this one ... The contractors who were
      tagged to be the low bidders would work
      out their bid figures ... The rest of the
      contractors would then come up with higher
      bids ."
Apparently,   the five cartel firms named in the
indictment, together with representatives of two
unions, participated in these meetings. The alleged
role of the union people was to communicate to the
ring members after the meeting what the low bids would
be, and perhaps to help enforce adherence to the
scheme.       For their participation,     the union
representatives allegedly received a kickback of one
percent of the low bid if the job was wonJ2
      To summarize, the available evidence suggests
that a phantom or complementary bidding scheme may
have been employed. We assume that the cartel bids
may exhibit the characteristics of a phantom bidding
scheme, rather than some other form of bid-rigging.
We therefore concentrate on detecting this form of
collusion.
      Before proceeding, we should also report on two
conventional indicators of the presence of a collusive

scheme. The first is the stability of market shares,
the idea being that a cartel will seek to maintain
stability in an effort to keep participants happy. In
our sample of paving jobs, however, the annual market
shares   of    cartel   firms   exhibited substantial
variability. For example, Firm 10 stopped bidding on
paving jobs early in our sample.     (As indicated in
Table 2, Firm 10 submitted only three bids in our
sample.) The other firms also experienced variable
market shares for paving jobs, as measured either by
number of jobs won or the dollar value of the
contracts.    However, as documented in the Newsday
article, market shares were quite stable for business
on state highway and sewer contracts, including many
jobs not in our sample, for more than a decade.
Therefore, market shares on paving jobs might create
an unwarranted impression of competitive bidding
behavior. Within paving jobs alone, or within general
highway lettings, there is no obvious pattern of
rotation of winning bids to ensure market share
stability.
      Second, consider the distribution of cartel and
competitive bids. In our sample of 116 paving jobs,
there were 347 competitive bids on 103 jobs1 and 228
cartel bids on 109 jobs. (All jobs received at least
one bid.)     The bid data are striking in that the
distribution of cartel bids on individual contracts is
more tightly concentrated than is the corresponding
distribution for competitive bids.    For example, on

                           18
the 76 jobs receiving two or more cartel bids, the
second lowest cartel bid is 4.96 per cent higher than
the low cartel bid.   (This statistic is based on the
average difference between the logarithm of the two
lowest bids.) On the 75 Jobs receiving two or more
competitive bids, the corresponding ratio is 6.25 per
cent. Note that there are more competitive bids per
job, and the two order statistics are closer on jobs
with a higher number of bids, so that the reported
discrepancy understates the differences between the
distributions. This finding is similar to the results
of Feinstein, Block, and Nold (1985) for North
Carolina highway contracts, where noncompetitive
bidding apparently led to clustering of bids, in an
attempt to influence engineer's estimates of the cost
of future lettings. This pattern is also consistent
with an attempt to create the appearance of
competition.


In. TUE MODEL
      A competitive bidder must determine an optimal
bid given his likely costs and the probable
distribution of the other firms' bids.  For
expositional purposes, we model this process as an
independent values auction in which bidders know their




                         19
own costs.13     We assume the following: the set of
bidders on any particular job is common knowledge;
costs for firm i on job t are random with a known
distribution; costs are independently distributed
across fins; fin i knows its own costs but only the
distribution of the costs of its competitors; and
firms are risk neutral. Note that we do not assume
that the cost distributions are necessarily identical
across fins or across jobs.
      Based    on    these       assumptions,   the   profit
maximization problem for each fin is
                 max E'll(b) =
                     b

where b is the submitted bid, cit is the cost for fin
i of job t, and 'Pit, is the probability that a bid of b
is the winning bid.       The first term is the profits
earned with bid b, while the second is the probability
that the profits are realized.          The probability of
winning depends on the distribution of costs of other
firms and on the bidding strategies adopted by the
other bidders.      (A strategy specifies a bid as a




     13
         To the extent that idiosyncratic seller cost
differences are qualitatively more important than any
uncertainties concerning aspects of the job that
affect all sellers' costs symmetrically, the letting
process is best modelled as an independent private
values auction.

                             20
function of own cost.) In equilibrium, the bid from
firm I on job t will satisfy the first order condition


         p(b) +(b—c) 8c±(b)           = o             (1)

The first order condition imposes structure on the
equilibrium relationship between a firm's probability
of winning and the level of its bid.            Below, we
analyze the determinants of a firm's probability of
winning and those of its bid.


Analysis Based on the Level of Bids
       Equation (I) can be taken as a characterization

of equilibrium bidding strategies.          We assume that
equilibrium behavior satisfies the log-linear bidding
rule

                         =            +
                log(b)       at   +                    (2)


where at is an auction-specific effect,         is a vector
of observable variables affecting firm i's probability
of winning or its observable costs on job t, and
represents private information, such as idiosyncratic
cost effects, for fin i on job t. The error term has
expectation zero and auction-specific variance,
denoted t2 The variance of the error ten can be a
function of many variables, including the dispersion
of private information on that job.
       Equation (2) is potentially restrictive.             It
imposes a form of symmetry, in that fins are assumed

                             21
to respond similarly to changes in the observable
factors X.         In addition, all commonly observed
auction   specific      information,     such    as   job
characteristics and other aspects of the joint
distribution of costs, are assumed to be captured in
a common auction specific constant. We have adopted
this formulation, in which between-fin rather than
between-job differences are emphasized, because this
dimension of our data is more informative. We do not
have useful'job specific information.
      Least squares can be applied directly to bid
data to estimate the parameters in equation (2).
Ordinary least squares (OLS) applied to competitive
bid data will give consistent estimates of the
parameters (assuming that sample selection issues can
be ignored, say because all eligible bidders submit
bids). Residuals can then be constructed from the OLS
parameter estimates. The auction-specific variance is
estimated by the auction mean squared residual. A
feasible generalized least squares estimate is then
obtained by using the auction-specific variances to
weight the data.
      Firm costs are not observed, so the equilibrium
condition of equation (1) cannot be checked directly.
Nevertheless, abnormalities in cartel bidding can be
detected using the estimated model.         For example,
suspicious behavior may be indicated by behavioral
differences between cartel and competitive bidders.
In particular,       tests    of   differences   in   the

                             22
coefficients in equation (2), when estimated from
cartel and competitive bids, may be informative. Of
course, differences in bidding behavior across sets of
firms may be due to unmeasured auction-specific cost
differences, or more general firm characteristics.


Analysis Based on the Ranking of Bids
       Detecting bid-rigging directly from bid data is
difficult. As suggested above, abnormalities may be
suggested by the bid data, but no strong conclusion
can be drawn directly from this evidence. By instead
analyzing a fin's expected probability of winning,
the construction of tests for phantom bidding are more
direct and less qualified. From a practical point of
view, fins submitting phantom bids know that a
designated firm will submit a bid lower than their
own.    Complementary bids have no probability of
winning, by design.    These bids may be intended to
create the appearance of competition, or to affect the
buyer's expectations of the costs of future jobs (as
suggested by Feinstein, Block, and Mold (1985)). The
designated low cartel bidder, however, must bid
competitively against any fins outside the cartel.
The designated low cartel bidder and other competitive
bidders must balance the level of a bid with the
probability of winning. Fundamental differences may
then exist between the ordering of competitive and
cartel bids conditional on the observed data; this
difference is the focus of our analysis.

                          23
       Note that we can remain agnostic about how the
low cartel bidder is selected. The designated winner
could be chosen on efficiency grounds, according to
the distribution of costs, or the choice may satisfy
some equity criteria to maintain ring discipline,
according to whose "turn" has come. If the cartel low
bid originates from the low cost firm, then one might
expect the estimated parameters for the low bid
probabilities to be similar for the two groups of
fins. In any event, our rank-based test is designed
to detect differences in the ordering of higher bids,
as opposed to the determinants of the probability of
being the lowest bid, for each set of firms. Unless
the higher cartel bids are competitive, we do not
expect their ordering       to   necessarily reflect
observable cost differences.
       Using equation (2), the linear approximation to
the equilibrium bid function, we can characterize the

probability of winning.     We  approximate the
probability of submitting the lowest bid with a
multinomial logit (MNL) model, such that,


                                                  (3)



where 0 is an auction-specific constant, and fi and   t
are    the coefficients from equation (2).         The
parameters can be estimated (using the procedure
described below) from the ranked bid data and equation

(3).


                          24
      Equation (3) could be derived directly from
equation (2) if (minus one times) the error term in
equation (2) is distributed as a Type-i extreme value
random variable.1' In that event, the two approaches
are algebraically equivalent.
         Parameter estimation proceeds as follows.
First, variances are estimated as above, using
competitive bid data, and the data are deflated using
the estimated auction-specific standard deviations.
The deflated data (times minus one) are denoted Z.
The resulting model gives the log probability of firm
i winning auction t   as   a standard MNL. That is,

             hiP [bj<b,           =crt+flZjt

Exponentiating the log probabilities, and requiring
that the individual probabilities sum to one, yields
the familiar form

                                       flit

                                  .3




Note that the auction-specific constant term cancels.
With the MNL specification, the likelihood of
observing any particular ranking of bids on a contract
can be expressed as the product of individual choice
probabilities)5 Denoting the index of the firm with

ranking for auction t can be written, if n bids are

Since this is the likelihood function for data
obtained from a simple choice experiment with varying
choice sets, the model can be estimated using standard
maximum likelihood routines for the MNL.
      When the model is correctly specified, the
parameters can be estimated using any subset of the
data. In particular, the likelihood function can be
factored into two independent parts: the likelihood of
observing the low bidders from all auctions and the
likelihood of observing all other rankings of bids
from those auctions.       If the estimates from the two
subsets of competitive bids are not statistically
different,   then model misspecification is not
suggested. A likelihood ratio can be formed to test
the   hypothesis       that        these                 coefficients   are

                                 26
identical.16 Under the null hypothesis of no phantom
bidding (and given a correctly specified model),
parameters estimated using only the lowest cartel
ranks and those estimated from higher cartel ranks
should be the same. The same likelihood ratio test
applied to these data may lead to rejection for two
reasons.       First, the model may be misspecified for
some reason other than the presence of phantom
bidding. Of course, the test would lead to rejections
if a varialxle was omitted which affected high bids
differently than the low bid. But if the test were
applied to competitive data and did not lead to a
rejection, then it is less likely that a specification
error of this type has been made. Second, the source
of the rejection could be an effect which is common to
nonwinning cartel bids but not nonwinning competitive
bids.       Under the assumptions of the model, the
rejection is likely to be the result of phantom
bidding.


IV.     DATA
        We analyze a subset of all Nassau and Suffolk
County DOT contract lettings from April 1979 through
March 1985.        Only contracts involving paving are




        '   See Hausman and Ruud (1987).

                               27
considered.'7     Joint bids are excluded from the
analysis.'8 A total of 575 bids were submitted on
116 projects. Competitive firms submitted 319 bids on
the 75 projects where at least two competitive bids
were submitted.     The jobs receiving one or fewer
competitive bids are dropped from the sample, since an
auction-specific variance is not identified by the
data. The remaining competitive observations are used
directly in the estimation. Cartel firms submitted
157 bids in the 75 auctions considered.
      The variables are constructed from data for
these auctions from the DOT "Notice of Tabulation."
Three different data sets are used in the estimation.
The first consists of bid data and the exogenous
variables indicated below.     These data are used to
estimate the parameters using least squares. The
second data set, used to estimate the competitive MNL
model, consists of the same exogenous variables and
the ranking of competitive bids rather than the level
of the bid. The third data set consists of the same
exogenous variables and the rankings of cartel bids.
These data are used to estimate the cartel MNL model.



     17
           Contracts involving items like mowing,
painting and traffic signals are not used in the
estimation.   Auctions for paving jobs exhibit most
strongly the market features that may facilitate
collusion.
     18
         Joint bids represent less than 2 percent of
all bids submitted on contracts involving paving.

                          28
The exogenous variables include measures of backlog,
capacity, and headquarters location.
         Job backlog may contribute to differences in
incremental cost across firms. A fin with a large
backlog of work may face large incremental costs for
an additional job. The variable BACKLOG is defined as
the sum of the dollar values of DOT contracts won but
not yet completed by a particular firm. The jobs are
assumed to be completed in about three months, working
at a constant pace.
         In order to capture relatively permanent
differences between firms, a capacity measure CAPS for
fin i is defined to be the maximum BACKLOG carried by
that firm during the sample period.           Hence CAPS —
max(BACKLOG}.             In order to account for possible
nonlinearities, we include squared capacity, CAPSQ,
and a dummy variable that equals one for non-cartel
firms that never won an auction, NOBACK.        (So NOBACK
—   I   if CAPS —   0.)
          Firm backlog at a given time is expressed as a
utilization rate, UTIL, where UTILit — BACKLOGj/CAPj.
(If CAPS — 0, then UTILj — 0 for all t.) Again, to
account for nonlinearities, we include the squared
utilization rate, UTILSQ.
          Geographic proximity to a job may lead to a cost

advantage.          For example, the firm with an asphalt
batch plant closest to a paving job would have a cost
advantage over other bidders.           The dummy variable
ISLAND1 equals one if the headquarters of bidder i is

                                29
on Long Island, and zero otherwise. All cartel firms
were headquartered on Long Island.
      Apart from the bids themselves, we were unable
to obtain any job specific data, such as an engineer's
estimate of costs, and so we rely on the auction
specific constants to capture any such differences.
      The dependent variable in the least squares
regressions is BIDt, the logarithm of the bid of firm
i on job t, where bids are expressed in hundreds of
thousands of constant 1969 dollars.          The mean
competitive bid was $450,000, while the mean cartel
bid was $713,000.
V.    RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION
Analysis of Bid Levels
      The results of generalized least squares
estimation using bid data for all paving jobs are
given in Table 4.    (Absolute values of estimated t
statistics   are    reported   below   the   parameter
estimates.) We report estimation results using three
subsets of data: bids from all firms, bids from
competitive firms, and bids from cartel firms only.
In all three cases, the same auction-specific variance
weights, derived from competitive bids, were employed.
In addition, auction-specific constants are estimated,
but not reported.        If all bids are in fact
competitive, all three estimate the same underlying
parameters. If cartel bids are not competitive, then
the model is misspecified, and only those based on
competitive bids are consistent.

         in parentheses. Auction-specific constants were
         included, but are not reported to save space.
         The Wald statistics are for a test of the joint
         significance of the reported coefficients. The
         coefficients of CAP and CAPSQ are scaled up by
         io and 108, respectively.

         In general, the competitive model fits well, and
the estimates are of the expected sign. Long Island
firms bid about 3 percent lower than nonresident
firms.       Job backlog and capacity affect bids
significantly. As UTIL increases, bids decrease over
a small range and then increase, other things equal.


                               31
At a utilization rate of 30 per cent, bids are about
1.5 per cent lower than usual. At full capacity, when
UTIL is one, bids are about 7.5 per cent higher.
Similarly, bids are first a decreasing function of
capacity, and then increasing, with only one firm in
the sample beyond the minimum point. A Wald test of
whether the displayed variables have zero coefficients
yields a test statistic of 494.7, which is distributed
as a chi-square random variable with 6 degrees of
freedom under the null. Thus, the included variables
add significantly to the predictive power of the
competitive model.
      The parameters identified by the cartel data are
also reported. Since all cartel firms are from Long
Island, the ISlAND parameter is not identified. The
signs of the coefficients differ for cartel firms and
competitive firms. Many of the cartel estimates do
not have the expected sign.
      Of course, if the cartel model is misspecified,
then results using both cartel and competitive data
are potentially biased. A Chow test for equality of
the coefficients estimated using all the data, versus
those obtained front the competitive and cartel data
separately, can be constructed.      Under the null
hypothesis of no bid-rigging, the estimates obtained
from the two subsarnples are identical to those from
the full sample.     The test statistic, which is
distributed as an F random variable with (76, 319)


                         32
degrees of freedom under the null, equals 9.38. We
can reject the null hypothesis of no bid-rigging.
      Based on these results, we are lead to two
conclusions.    First, the model fits the competitive
data reasonably well. Second, bids from cartel firms
statistically differ from those of competitive firms.
The following results suggest the reasons for the
differences between the two types of bids.


Analysis of Competitive Bid Rank Data
      The estimates from the MNL model using
competitive data are similar to the results in Table
4.   The competitive MNL estimates are presented in
Table 5.   (Estimated t statistics are included below
the parameter estimates.) Estimates are given using
three different data sets: all ranks, lowest ranks and
higher ranks.   The estimates are stable over ranks.
The likelihood ratio test statistic of coefficient
stability across ranks is 4.3, which is distributed as
a chi-square random variable with six degrees of
freedom under the null hypothesis. The test statistic
is significant at about the 36 percent level, and
therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no
model misspecification.     We cannot conclude that
competitive bids are generated by a different process
depending on whether they are low or not.

Analysis of Cartel Bid Rank Data
        Estimates from the MNL model using cartel data
are presented in Table 6. The estimated coefficients
are similar to the CLS estimates for the cartel data
presented in Table 4, and differ from all the
competitive estimates.      The likelihood ratio test
statistic of parameter stability across ranks is 8.94,
which is distributed as a chi-squared random variable
with four degrees of freedom under the null
hypothesis.     The test statistic is significant at
about the 94 percent level. Therefore, we reject the

null hypothesis of no phantom bidding. We conclude
that cartel bids are generated by a different process
depending on whether they are low or not.


VI.    CONCLUSIONS
       The idiosyncracies of the DOT auction market
suggest both a candidate cartel and a particular bid-
rigging mechanism. We find that the ranking of cartel
bids does not coincide with rankings of costs.         We
reject the null hypothesis of no phantom bidding in
cartel data. The bid ranking may not coincide with
cost rankings because of the presence of phantom bids.
In the competitive data, bids increase with costs as
expected, and we cannot reject the hypothesis of no

                             35
phantom bidding for competitive firms.     Because we
have no reason to believe that the difference between
cartel and competitive bidding is structural, we may
have found evidence of cartel activity.
      Our testing procedure may be conservative in
that we may have inadvertently classified some cartel
participants as competitive.      Similarly, we have
access to a relatively sparse set of explanatory
variables. Therefore, it is perhaps best to view the
contribution of this paper as methodological, as well
as descriptive.      Unfortunately, if an antitrust
authority or procurement agency were to publicly
announce the adoption our test procedure, it would be
relatively easy for an effective cartel to tailor its
phantom bids to disguise collusive behavior.       For
example,   all    cartel   firms could scale their
competitive bids up by the same percentage. The bid
ranking would then coincide with cost rankings.     If
the cartel was not inclusive, differences between
cartel and competitive bidding would be consistent
with cost asymmetries between the two groups of firms.
Presumably, a non-inclusive cartel is profitable when
cartel fins enjoy a cost advantage over competitive
firms. Absent prior information on cost differences,
bidding differences could not be attributed solely to
non-competitive bidding. Attention would then have to
focus on the determination of the identity of the
lowest bidder, or on rates of return.
