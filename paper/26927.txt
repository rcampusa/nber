                                          ABSTRACT

As financial technology improves and data becomes more abundant, do market prices reflect this
data growth? While recent studies documented rises in the information content of prices, we show
that, across asset types, there is data divergence. Large, growth stock prices increasingly reflect
information about future firm earnings. This is the rise reflected in the previous studies. But over
the same time period, the information content of small and value firm prices was flat or declining.
Our structural estimation allows us to disentangle these informational trends from changing asset
characteristics. These facts pose a new puzzle: Amidst the explosion of data processing, why has
this data informed only the prices of a subset of firms, instead of benefiting the market as a
whole? Our structural model offers a potential answer: Large growth firms' data grew in value, as
big firms got bigger and growth magnified the effect of these changes in size.

   As nancial technology improves and data becomes more abundant, is data benetting all

rms? While recent studies have documented rises in the information content of prices, it turns

out that there are large cross-sectional dierences.   The previously-documented increases in

price information (Bai, Philippon, and Savov, 2016) are driven by a rise in the informativeness

of large, growth stocks. The informational price eciency of smaller assets or assets with less

growth potential is at or declining.   We document this data divergence and use structural

estimation to decompose informational eciency into a part due to data growth and a part due

to changing growth or volatility characteristics of the assets. Data divergence can be explained

by the fact that large growth rms' data is becoming relatively more valuable.       Computing

the expected marginal value of data implied by our structural model reveals the interaction of

growth and size. As large rms grow larger, and growth magnies the eect of their change

in size, the marginal value of processing large growth rm data is becoming more and more

valuable, compared to the value of other rms' data. In short, ever-growing reams of nancial

data may be helping price assets more accurately. But this additional data might not deliver

nancial eciency benets for the vast majority of rms.

   We begin by measuring price informativeness in a traditional way: Estimate the coecient

on prices in a regression of future asset payos on a constant, prices and asset characteristics.

This coecient reveals how useful prices are in forecasting future rm outcomes.       Our main

empirical nding is price informativeness divergence. The rise in price informativeness found in

Bai, Philippon, and Savov (2016) is there. Their sample is S&P 500 rms. Those are large rms.

For small rms, and for the entire sample, price informativeness declines.     Furthremore, the

large-rm increase in price informativeness does not come from all large rms. It is concentrated

in a subset, the large growth rms.

   The trends in the traditional measure could come from many sources. One interpretation is

that data analysis is being concentrated on large growth rms. Another interpretation is that

large growth rms have changed characteristics over time, in a way that aects the price infor-

mativeness measure. Disentangling these changes is not easy. Changes in asset characteristics

can also change the incentives to analyze data.

   To decompose information and asset characteristics, we use a structural approach.        We

derive an expression for price informativeness that holds with minimal theoretical assumptions.



                                               1
Price information is comprised of terms that depend on information, cashow growth and

volatility. By measuring price informativeness, cash ow growth and volatility in the data, we

can back out a measure of market information about the rm. We nd that information about

most rms has stagnated for the last 50 years. There is only one category of information that

has become more abundant: information about large, growth rms.          While rm growth and

volatility have changed over time, these changes work against the trend  alone, they would

reduce price informativeness. Thus, the measurement exercise teaches us that the rise in price

informativeness observed for large growth rms is likely to be a result of more information, i.e.

more data.

   Size shows up in our analysis in two ways. First, small and large rms have dierent growth

and volatility, which aect the informativeness measure directly. Second, size aects the value

of information about the rm. This oers a potential explanation for the informativeness trend:

Data went to the largest rms because investors can use that data to take large positions in

those assets. Growth amplies changes in the value of data. Therefore, when data processing

capacity increased, most of the new data processed was about the large growth rms. Other

rms' equity prices did not benet from the data revolution.



Related literature     Our contribution, relative to the literature is two-fold: 1) We explore

cross-sectional dierences in a traditional measure of price informativeness (Bai, Philippon, and

Savov, 2016); and 2) we propose a new structural method for uncovering the amount of data

being processed about each class of assets in a given period.

   Our methodology is most related to Davila and Parlatore (2016a), who propose an alterna-

tive measure of price informativeness, designed to answer a dierent question. Their measure

captures the ability of prices to aggregate information. They compute the ability of asset payos

to back-cast prices, asset-by-asset, but without examining time trends. Our question is about

how the allocation of nancial data processing has changed over time. Identifying data diver-

gence is dicult, because it requires separating forces that change the information content of

prices from information itself. Our simple structural model of equilibrium asset prices suggests

that noise, size and the growth potential of a rm all interact to drive a wedge between data

and all the previously-used price informativeness measures.     We document these wedges and




                                               2
nd they are substantial. Large rms have more informative prices than small ones. Growth

rms' prices are more informative than value rms' and the interaction eects are large and

signicant. Importantly, these cross-asset dierences are growing. Finally, our structural ap-

proach also has the advantage that it uncovers changes in the marginal value of data. This help

us to understand the reasons for why large, growth rms' data evolves so dierently.

   Trends in the aggregate information environment are also explored in work by Stambaugh

(2014) and Glode, Green, and Lowery (2012).        These authors highlight forces such as rising

institutional ownership and indexation. Such forces could be incorporated into our measurement

framework by changing the marginal benet of data. But our focus is on why these trends dier

across asset classes and what part of that change is information versus asset characteristics.

   The way in which we model data has its origins in information theory (computer science),

and is similar to work on rational inattention (Sims, 2003; Ma¢kowiak and Wiederholt, 2009;

Kacperczyk, Nosal, and Stevens, 2015).     Similar equilibrium models with information choice

have been used to explain income inequality (Kacperczyk, Nosal, and Stevens, 2015), infor-

mation aversion (Andries and Haddad, 2017), home bias (Mondria, Wu, and Zhang, 2010;

Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp, 2009), and mutual fund returns (Pástor and Stambaugh,

2012), among other phenomena.      Related microstructure work explores the frequency of in-

formation acquisition and trading (Kyle and Lee, 2017; Dugast and Foucault, 2016; Chordia,

Green, and Kottimukkalur, 2016; Crouzet, Dew-Becker, and Nathanson, 2016).           Davila and

Parlatore (2016a) share our focus on price information, but do not examine its time trend or

cross-sectional dierences. Empirical work in this vein (Katz, Lustig, and Nielsen, 2017) nds

evidence of rational inattention like information frictions in the cross section of asset prices.

Our model extends Farboodi and Veldkamp (2017) by adding multiple, heterogeneous assets.

What we add to this literature is using the theory for structural estimation.     The structure

allows us to distinguish changes in information from changes in asset characteristics.

   Examinations of the eects of improved data processing are scarce.        Empirical work pri-

marily examines whether particular data sources, such as social media text, predict asset price

movements (Ranco, Aleksovski, Caldarelli, Grcar, and Mozetic, 2015). In contrast, many pa-

pers have developed approaches to measuring stock market informativeness across countries

(Edmans, Jayaraman, and Schneemeier, 2016), or (Durnev, Morck, and Yeung, 2004). These



                                               3
measures are valuable tools for cross-country analysis, but are not consistent with our theoretical

framework and are not appropriate for comparing the informativeness of large and small rms.

For example, Brogaard, Nguyen, Putnins, and Wu (2018) argue that stock return comovement,

as measured by     R2 ,   has increased signicantly over time, suggesting less information.           But,

they conclude that much of this is from the decline of idiosyncratic noise in prices, not less

information. Martineau (2017) shows that information (earnings news) is incorporated more

quickly into prices, in recent times. That could reect more information, or some of the many

regulatory changes dictating what gets announced, to whom and when. For our purposes, these

measures are problematic because there are mechanical reasons why the            R2   of large rm returns

may be higher, and growing, and their earnings announcements incorporated more quickly.

    Explorations of how information production aects real investment (Ozdenoren and Yuan,

2008; Bond and Eraslan, 2010; Goldstein, Ozdenoren, and Yuan, 2013; David, Hopenhayn,

and Venkateswaran, 2016; Dow, Goldstein, and Guembel, 2017; Dessaint, Foucault, Fresard,

and Matray, 2018) complement our work by showing how the nancial information trends

we document could have real economic eects.              Our work also contributes to the debate on

the sources of capital misallocation in the macroeconomy,
                                                                  1 as we add an explanation for why

nancial markets may be providing better guidance over time for some rms, but not for others.




1      Empirical Patterns in Price Informativeness
In this section, we study patterns in a well-known measure of price informativeness  specif-

ically, the one used by Bai, Philippon, and Savov (2016).
                                                                    2   Our focus is on cross-sectional

heterogeneity: we will show that some assets, notably large growth stocks, tend to have higher

price informativeness compared to other assets and this gap has risen over the past few decades.

This measure is known to have many problems. We do not disagree. Our preferred measure

of information in nancial markets will emerge from the structural estimation we do in the

next section. This section simply motivates that analysis by showing new and puzzling cross

sectional patterns in a pre-existing measure. These facts motivate our choice of what features

    1 See e.g., Hsieh and Klenow (2009) or Restuccia and Rogerson (2013) for a survey.
    2 InSection 3.2, we show that the same cross-sectional patterns we document also hold for the measure of
price informativeness proposed by Davila and Parlatore (2016a).

1.1 Measuring Price Informativeness
Data      All data are for the U.S. market, over the period 19622016. Stock prices come from

CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices). All accounting variables are from Compustat.

We measure prices at the end of March and accounting variables at the end of the previous

scal year, typically December. This timing convention ensures that market participants have

access to the accounting variables that we use as controls. In line with common practice, we

exclude rms in the nance industry (SIC code 6).

   The main equity valuation measure is market capitalization over total assets,              M/A   and the

main cash ow variable is earnings over assets, or more precisely, earnings before interest and

taxes, (denoted   EBIT   in Compustat), scaled by current total assets. Both ratios are winsorized

at 1%.

   Since we are interested in the extent to which current prices reect future earnings, we need

to make two other adjustments. The rst is to deal with ination, which can create predictability

in nominal earnings and prices. This is particularly relevant for periods of high ination, such as

1960s and 1970s. Therefore, we adjust all cash-ow variables with a GDP deator. Second, we

adjust for rm exit. We use the delisting price as a nal price and consider dierent assumptions

for cash-ows thereafter. Our preferred solution is to only consider periods during which a rm

has non-missing information. Our results are also robust if we make cash-ows zero when the

rm exits or to use a weighted industry cash-ow as a proxy, as in Bai, Philippon, and Savov

(2016).



Price informativeness           Our baseline measure of price informativeness is the one used by

Bai, Philippon, and Savov (2016). It captures the extent to which asset prices in year              t   reect

cash-ows in year    t+s    and is constructed by regressing the latter on the former, along with

controls for other observable asset characteristics.         We estimate the following cross-sectional

regression, at each date   t,   separately for each asset group    j:

                    Ef,j,t+s                            Mf,j,t
                             = j,t + j,s,t · log                 + j,t · Xf,j,t +   f,j,t ,               (1)
                     Af,j,t                             Af,j,t

                                                    5
where   Ef,j,t+s /Af,j,t      is the cash-ow of rm       f   in group   j   in year   t + s,    scaled by its total assets

in year   t;   log(Mf,j,t /Af,j,t ) is market capitalization scaled by total assets; and                   Xf,j,t   are a set of

rm-level controls, namely past earnings and industry xed eects, meant to capture publicly

available information. We adjust for potential autocorrelation by using Newey-West standard

errors with four lags.

   The coecient of interest is            j,s,t ,   which captures the informativeness of the market prices.

To obtain our measure of (the trend in) price informativeness, we follow Bai, Philippon, and

Savov (2016) and scale          j,t   by the variability of the regressor:



                                                                        M/A
                                              P IN Fj,s,t = j,s,t · j,t                                                     (2)



          M/A                                                                          Mf,j,t
where   j,t      denotes the cross-sectional standard deviation of             log     Af,j,t
                                                                                                  in year t. Finally, since

we are interested in longer term trends, we estimate the following specication (separately for

each asset group       j ):

                                                                          t - 1962
                       P IN Fj,s,t = P IN F j,s 1 + T rendj,s ·                                 + ej,s,t                    (3)
                                                                        2010 - 1962

The ratio on the right simply normalizes the calendar time variable                     t {1962, . . . , 2010}, mapping
it into values between 0 and 1. We use 3 and 5-year-ahead price forecast regressions (s                                    =3
and   s = 5).       Since our last price data is from mid-2016, this means our last annual price

informativeness estimate is 2010.




1.2 Divergence of Price Informativeness
We begin by looking at aggregate trends in price informativeness. The left panel of Figure 1

plots the trend in price informativeness  the tted value from (3)  for the universe of listed

rms. It shows that price informativeness has fallen over time for the market as a whole (right

panel). In fact, over the past 50 years, this declining trend has eviscerated almost all of the

information content in prices. This contrasts with S&P 500 rms (left panel), the sample of

rms studied by Bai, Philippon, and Savov (2016). Consistent with their ndings, we nd that

S& P 500 price informativeness rose. Over 1962-2010, S& P price informativeness has increased

    In other words, the past few decades have been marked by diverging trends in informative-

ness. We will show that this divergence is tied to a broader phenomenon  price informativeness

for large-growth rms has been growing, both in absolute terms and relative to other rms.

Since such rms are disproportionately represented in the S& P 500, price informativeness for

the S& P has diverged from that of the market as a whole.
                                                                                                                                                        3



Price informativeness for large (small) rms has been rising (falling).                                                                                                                                        In order to

explore the connection between rm size and informativeness, we compute our estimates for

two sub-samples: one is the 500 largest rms, and the other, the rest of the rms. We refer to

these sub-samples as `large' and `small' respectively.

    Table 1 reports the results for S&P 500 rms (columns 1-2), large rms (columns 3-4) and

small rms (column 5-6).                                               The increase in price informativeness is very similar for S&P 500

rms and large rms, both for 3-year (columns 1 and 3) and 5-year horizons (columns 2 and

4). By contrast, the price informativeness of small rms, which started from roughly the same

levels as that of large rms in 1962, fell sharply over this time period.                                                                                                                      These patterns are

   3 Appendix A.2 shows that the informativeness of stocks currently in the S&P 500 is similar to non-S&P 500
stocks with similar characteristics. This suggests that dierences in asset characteristics, rather than inclusion
in S&P 500 per se, is the source of the divergence.

robust to alternative criterion for size: we also split the sample into deciles of size, and nd

that moving from the lowest decile to the highest decile of size implies a 17-fold increase in

price informativeness (c.f. Appendix A.1).

Growth rms are central to information divergence.                          Next, we explore the relationship

between growth and price informativeness. Following Fama and French (1995), we rank rms

based on their current book-to-market ratio (dened as the dierence between total assets and

long term debt, divided by the rm's market capitalization).                      The bottom 30% are labeled

`growth' rms and the top 30% `value' rms. We then run our price informativeness regressions

(1) separately for these two groups.

    Columns (1) and (2) of Table 2 reveal that price informativeness declines for both growth

and value rms. However, when we split each category between large and small, we nd that

large growth rms show a signicant increase (positive coecient in column 4) while the small

growth group displays the sharpest decline (column 3). In other words, growth rms drive both

the rise in price informativeness for large rms and the declining trend for smaller rms. The

informativeness for value rms, both large and small, shows more modest declines. The rate

of change in small value rms' (column 5) price informativeness is half that of small growth

trends in price informativeness for large vs. small rms (left panel) and for large-growth vs.

1.3 Other Possible Data Groupings
It is possible that growth, value and size are not, themselves, the relevant characteristics. They

may well be a proxy for some other correlated rm or asset characteristics. While we cannot

rule this out, nor do we need to, there are a couple of other groupings of assets that might be

natural or informative to consider before we proceed.



Market power.       Recent work suggests that market power may be growing throughout the

economy. In Kacperczyk, Nosal, and Sundaresan (2018), market power reduces price informa-

tiveness. Investors with price impact trade less aggressively on their information. This produces

less informative prices. So market power can interact with the measure of informativeness, and

thus with the measurement of data. Sorting assets according to the price impact of the investors

in those assets is not straightforward. It is also not likely to explain our information divergence.

If market power increased and this reduced price informativeness, it could be one reason for the

overall decline in price informativeness. In that case, our data estimates would then be a lower

bound on true data processing. But then to explain why large, growth rms have much more

informative prices than they used to, that market would have to be far more competitive than

it was 50 years ago. We know of no evidence that suggests enormous increases in competition

in some equity markets and the evaporation of competition in others.



Technology rms.        Could the increased prevalence of technology rms explain information

divergence? Appendix A.3 documents that tech rms do have a lower level of price informa-

tiveness, on average. However, a simple cut of the data suggests that the rise of technology

rms is unlikely to account for the divergent trends. The share of tech rms in the large and

small rm samples is similar over time. Therefore, the composition change cannot explain our

new fact: the divergence in informativeness of large and small rms' prices, over time.

   Note also that our structural approach in the next section will strip out the eect of dif-

ferences in fundamentals, e.g.   a more volatile or faster growing cash-ow.       So to the extent

that technology rms are dierent for these reasons, our analysis in that section adjusts for

technology intensity, and still nds divergence.

   However we group the data, the conclusion is the same: If the changes in price informative-




                                                10
ness were driven by changes in information, then, despite the data revolution, there is no more

data available about most rms now than there was 50 years ago. There is a small set of rm

that have benetted from abundant data; those are large, growth rms. For those rms, the

ability of prices to forecast future fundamentals has risen substantially, roughly six-fold. But

that interpretation is complicated by the fact that measuring informativeness and measuring

information is not the same thing. To address this gap, we turn next to a dierent approach.




2     A Structural Framework for Measurement

2.1 Why do we need a structural framework?
What do these divergent trends reect? In particular, to what extent do they point to changes

in data processing? The key diculty in interpreting these facts is that price informativeness is

an endogenous object that reects not just information but also depends on other characteristics

such as growth prospects and volatility. For example, a trend in informativeness could arise

from a trend in cash-ow growth, which aects the sensitivity of prices to cash-ow news or

because of increases data processing, which causes expected cash-ows to more closely track

the true values. It could also reect time variation in the extent of noise-induced variability in

prices.

    One possibility is to use a rich set of xed eects in the reduced-form specication. However,

that would still leave us with the challenge of disentangling trends in data processing from other

trends. Therefore, we use a simple structural model as a measurement framework.

    We work with the simplest theoretical framework that achieves this objective. The setup is a

standard noisy rational expectations model with multiple assets, in the spirit of Admati (1985)

and Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2009). The model yields simple, intuitive expressions

for price informativeness, as a function of both asset characteristics and investor information.

These expressions form the basis for an empirical strategy that disentangles asset characteristics

from information, using observable moments of stock prices and cash ows, providing a deeper

understanding of the trends in the previous section.

2.2 Model
A unit measure of investors trade multiple assets. Each asset is interpreted as a representa-

tive rm in group        j  {SmallGrowth, LargeGrowth, LargeV alue, SmallV alue}.                              To lighten

notation, we suppress the rm subscript and use                     j   to refer to group-level variables.

     A share is a claim to a dividend stream. The ow dividend of representative asset                        j   in period

s,   denoted   {djs }, s = 1, 2, ....,   follows a AR(1) process with normally distributed innovations

and is independent across assets.
                                           5 Formally, for         t = 1, 2....,


                                 djt = gj djt-1 +      jt ,            jt   iid N (0, jd )                             (4)




     Modeling a stream of dividends, rather than a traditional one-shot payo is necessary to

depict growth rms in a meaningful way. However, we consider the simplest such formulation,

with a single round of trading. We then interpret time series data as repeated instances of this

one-shot formulation. At the start of period 1, investors make portfolio choices (conditional on

an information set, described later). At the end of the period,                        dj 1   is observed, investors sell

their holdings and consume. Our key simplifying assumption is that this future sale occurs at

a price equal to the expected value of dividends, discounted at the (gross) riskless rate                         r > 1.6
Given our assumption on the cashow process, this expected discounted value, denoted by                                Vj 1 ,
is given by:


                                                 
                                                       djs          r
                                     Vj 1  E             s
                                                           dj 1 =        dj 1 .                                        (5)
                                                 s=1
                                                       r          r - gj

Thus, an asset with more persistent cash-ows (e.g. growth stock) will have a greater sensitivity

of valuations to current cashows. This allows us to capture time series properties of cash-ow

processes within our one-shot trading model.

     5 The assumption of independence is motivated by our focus on idiosyncratic rather than aggregate variation,
i.e. a stock-picking rather than a market timing perspective. Having said that, it is not dicult to relax this
assumption and allow for correlation across assets. Signals and data processing would then be about independent
risk factors, as in Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2009).
     6 A natural alternative assumption here is that investors sell their assets at a market price, which is a
function, among other things, of the information of future participants, as in Farboodi and Veldkamp (2017).
This delivers a similar solution, except that the dependence on future information introduces another xed point
problem, which complicates the analysis considerably, without providing additional insight.

Supply:                The supply of each asset             j      has a (commonly known) asset-specic mean                               xj   as

well as an unobserved random component. Formally, the total supply is                                                xj + x
                                                                                                                          ~j   shares, where

Preferences and portfolio choice:                               Investors, indexed by               i,   are endowed with an initial
                  i
wealth       W        and mean-variance preferences over their end-of-period wealth.At the start of time

one, they choose a portfolio, conditional on an information set                                        I i.   Formally, investor      i   with

                                                    i
absolute risk aversion              i   chooses   {qj },   the number of shares of asset                      j,   to solve:



                                                                                                  2i

                                          where        W i = rW +                     i
                                                                                     qj (Vj 1 - rPj 1 ).                                       (7)
                                                                               j


where       r    is the riskless rate,    Pj 1   is the equilibrium price of asset                 j   and    Vj   is a present discounted

asset value that will be derived shortly.

        This mean-variance representation can include a broad array of preference specications.

The coecient of absolute risk aversion                          i   can be any non-random function of initial wealth,
    i
W       . Thus, these preferences could be derived from decreasing absolute risk aversion preferences,

or even constant relative risk aversion, in initial wealth.

        7 This
          language suggests discrete numbers of signals. Since working with discrete variables complicates the
analysis considerably and adds little insight, we treat kj
                                                         i
                                                           as a continuous variable. Formally, we can take a
quasi-continuous limit. If each data point has variance , this limit takes the number of data points to be kji

and then sends   . In the limit, the precision of the set of signals becomes continuous.



                                                                      13
   In addition, investors can condition their orders on the realized market-clearing price (Pj 1 )

and also optimally incorporate the information contained in that price. Finally, at the end of

each period, dividends are paid and thus observed. Thus, investor i's information set comprises,

for each asset   j,   the dividend realization from the previous period , a set of private signals

                                                             i,m j    ki
and the market-clearing price:        I i = {{dj 0 }n                n

verify) that the information in the market price can be expressed as a signal of the cash-ow

innovation with additive Gaussian noise. Given this information set, Bayes' law for normally

distributed random variables yields the following expression for investor                    i's   precision, denoted

   -1

Equilibrium:          A rational expectations equilibrium is a set of functions for the price,              Pj 1 , and

portfolio choices     qj   such that, (i) given the induced information sets          I i,    the portfolio choices

   To solve for the equilibrium, we conjecture a linear form for the price function and solve

for the corresponding coecients.            We relegate the details to the Appendix and present the

solution in the following result:

Price informativeness:            Recall that the price informativeness measure in Section 1 is esti-

mated by regressing cashows          s   periods ahead on current prices, controlling for, among other

things, the most recent cashow. Using the equilibrium pricing equation (11), we can express

s-period-ahead     price informativeness as:
                                                 8


                                                                           s

     Equation (16) forms the core of our analysis of price informativeness. It reveals that                        P IN Fj,s
has three components. The rst is          volatility : specically, the variability of cashows relative to

prices. All else equal, an asset whose prices are more volatile (relative to cashows) will exhibit

lower price informativeness.
                                 9 The second component is related to growth : a more persistent,

or faster growing, process will lead to a greater sensitivity of future cashows to current ones.

Under our AR(1) structure, this is summarized by the autoregressive coecient,                                     gj .       Since

prices aggregate information about current cash-ows, a higher                     gj ,   all else equal, makes them

covary more strongly with future cashows, resulting in higher price informativeness. Finally,

the last term reects      information : the less uncertain the average investor is about cash-ows

(for example, due to increased data processing             Kj ),   the lower is    j ,    and therefore, the higher

is price informativeness at all horizons.




3      Estimation of the Structural Framework
Next, we employ the framework developed in the previous section to purge the price infor-

mativeness measure from Section 1 of growth and volatility eects.
                                                                                         10 What is left reveals the

cross-sectional and time series patterns of information in the market. We further separate this

information into cross-asset dierences in the eciency with which markets aggregate a given

    8 See Appendix B.3 for the derivation.
    9 This insight also appears in Davila and Parlatore (2016b).
    10 The P IN F measure in Section 1 is slightly dierent from the one in (16). The former is obtained by scaling
the regression coecient from (1) by the unconditional standard deviation of prices. Our structural analysis,
on the other hand, shows that a more interpretable measure is obtained by re-scaling the regression coecient
by standard deviation of residualized prices (i.e. residuals from projecting prices on the set of controls). The
measure in (16)  and in the rest of the paper  is constructed using this approach. Quantitatively, this makes
little dierence, so, in a slight abuse of notation, we use P IN F to refer to the model-guided measure as well.

3.1 Estimating Data Divergence
Our empirical strategy is to directly measure the growth and volatility components in (16) and

then remove these estimates from PINF, to obtain the information term                      ¯ j.
                                                                                                  To study cross-

sectional variation, we classify stocks into one of four groups: Small-Growth, Large-Growth,

Small-Value and Large-Value, based on the same criteria used in Section 1. Given our focus on

long-term trends, we estimate each decade separately. Specically, for each decade and asset

group, we estimate PINF, growth and volatility. Then, we divide PINF for that decade-group

by the growth and volatility of that decade-group's assets, as in (16).

    To measure the growth component, we estimate equation (4) by running a pooled regression

on cashow data for each decade-group. The resulting estimates of the AR(1) coecient,                          gj ,
and the volatility of innovations,    jd ,   for each decade-group are reported in Table 3. Assuming
                                                                             s

                                                                            gj
                                                                                 , the growth component.
                                                                                                         11
                                                                          r - gj

    Next, note that the numerator of volatility component,           V ar(dj 1 |dj 0 ),   is simply the variance

of innovations,   jd , also reported in Table 3.    The denominator,      Std(Pj 1 |dj 0 ), is obtained (again,
for each group-decade pair) by projecting prices (or more precisely, market capitalization scaled

  11 In our baseline analysis, we use r = 1.025 for the entire sample. In Appendix C, specically in Figure 9,
we relax this assumption and show that our results are robust to using the actual time path of riskless rates.

by assets) on controls, which include past earnings.

      Finally, we estimate price informativeness for each decade-group as described in Section 1.
                                                                                                                 12

We can then recover the information component using:



                                              j              P IN Fj,s

                                                                                                              (17)

      Our decade-by-group estimates for price informativeness and its components are reported

in Table 6 in Appendix C.1.          In line with our focus on longer term trends (and to facilitate

comparison with the facts in Section 1), we plot the tted trendlines for each series in Figure

3.    The rst panel reproduces the patterns documented in Section 1.                       Price informativeness

has trended up for the Large-Growth group, but has remained constant/declined for all other

groups. The top right panel reveals that changes in the information component played a central

role in the divergence.      The trends in this component parallel those in price informativeness

overall: rising for the large-growth assets and stagnating/falling for the others.
                                                                                                  13

      The remaining panels in Figure 3 show other systematic changes in asset characteristics

over time.    In particular, the growth component, reecting the persistence of cash-ows, is

declining. This is consistent with Gschwandtner (2012), who also nds a long run decline in the

persistence of rm prots. This could reect, for example, an increase in competition because of

globalization. Note that this decline is most dramatic for the large-growth assets, which by itself

should have reduced their price informativeness relative to other assets. In other words, the rise

in the information component for large-growth rms is suciently large that it overwhelms the

eect of declining cash-ow persistence on informativeness.
                                                                             14 Finally, the volatility component

shows signicant cross-sectional heterogeneity but is relatively stable over time.

     12 Wemake two modications to tie the estimation closer to the theory: rst, we use M     A in levels (instead of
logs). Second, we use the absolute value of the estimated price informativeness, since the theory cannot reconcile
negative estimates (this only matters for a couple of observations and does not aect conclusions about longer
term trends).
   13 Table 4 sheds further light on the timing of the increase for large growth rms: it shows that the information
component divergence spiked around the 2000's, the same time as the widespread adoption of information
technology in the nancial sector (Abis, 2018).
   14 In Figure 10, we conduct a counterfactual decomposition holding the growth component for each group
xed at its 1960s level. This moderates the magnitude of the divergence somewhat, but the basic pattern  an
increase in information processing for the Large-Growth group and modest declines for the other three groups
 survives. This exercise shows that controlling for changes in asset fundamentals is important for an accurate
quantitative estimate of information.

Market information vs private data.               Next, we explore where information came from: Did

it stem from better information aggregation through prices or from increased data processing?

To answer this question, we decompose overall information,                   ¯ -1 ,
                                                                                       into its components as in
                                                                               j

is the noise with which prices predict contemporaneous earnings. To estimate                        V ar(ej ),   we rst

estimate (1) with    s = 0 and equate V ar(ej ) to the variance of the residuals.               Appendix C derives

the following mapping, which yields an estimate for          jp   for each group by decade:

3.2 Other Measures of Price Informativeness
Davila and Parlatore (2016a) propose an alternative measure of absolute' price informative-

ness. It captures the ability of asset prices to aggregate dispersed information. Their measure

is the precision of an unbiased signal constructed from prices of the current cash-ow innova-

tion.In our setting, this corresponds to     - 1
                                             jp .   It is the same as what we call market information

in Table 4 and Figure 4.

    The divergence between small and large rm information remains intact under this alterna-

tive measure: Large growth rms have market prices that convey more information and that

informativeness increases dramatically over time.
                                                              15 For all other groups, informativeness stag-

nates or declines.    In fact, the divergence is even more stark under this alternative measure

of price informativeness.      The results in Figure 4 suggest a reason why both measures show

the same patterns.      They show that more data processed by investors (higher                  Kj )   was the

key driver of the time trends, which leads to prices being both more accurate as signals (the

Davila-Parlatore notion of price informativeness) and being more sensitive to cashows (the

Bai-Philippon-Savov measure).

    Note that, like our baseline informativeness measure, the Davila-Parlatore one is also inu-

   15 Davila and Parlatore (2016a) use the entire time series to estimate market information for individual
stocks. We group assets into categories based on observable characteristics like size and growth and estimate
price informativeness by group-decade, which highlights how price informativeness has diverged for certain types
of assets (e.g. large-growth stocks).


                                                        21
enced by the fundamental characteristics of the asset: from equation (15), we see that           jp   is a

function of the equilibrium coecients     Bj   and   Cj   and therefore, asset characteristics that aect

these (e.g. cash-ow growth) will also have an eect on            jp .   To be clear, this does not negate

the value of this measure: it merely underscores the value of separating asset characteristics

from information, even in the context of this measure.




4       Why the Surge in Large Growth Firm Data?
Our results show that, while asset characteristics did change over this period, divergence in the

price informativeness for large-growth rms came predominantly from data divergence. This

raises an obvious question: why did so many investors process increasing amounts of data about

large, growth stocks and not about other assets?

    One possibility is that data choices changed over time because the cost of data changed.

For this to explain our ndings, the cost of large, growth rm data must be falling, relative

to the cost of data about other rms. While this is certainly a possibility, we have no direct

evidence to support or quantify this channel. The other possibility is that the marginal benet

of data changed. For this explanation, our model informs us about how measured changes in

asset characteristics should change the value of data. This is the approach we take: Use the

structural model and estimates to determine whether the benets of data have changed in a

way that might explain the changes. This does not rule out  and in fact, is complementary to

 the possibility that changes in costs might have contributed to the observed patterns in the

data.

    In this setting,   marginal values can be misleading. The reason is that, when many investors

process high-value data, they make the data less valuable for others to process. High marginal

values predict more data processing. But more data processing lowers the marginal value. In

equilibrium, data processing choices should push down all marginal values until they equal

marginal cost. This is the same logic that Berk and Green (2004) applied to mutual fund ows

also applies to data ows: Equilibrium forces should equalize marginal returns.

    If marginal value does not reliably explain the amount of data processing, what does? The

initial value of data is what the value of the rst increment of precision would be, if no one




                                                     22
else processed any data on that asset.
                                               16 Using our framework and estimates, we can estimate

that initial value. If the assets for which data processing is high also have high initial values of

information, this could explain the data divergence we see in the previous section.

    Therefore, we use the model to estimate the initial value of one unit of processed data (one

precision unit) about each asset type, in each decade. We nd that the value of learning about

large rms rose substantially over this period, both in absolute terms as well as relative to small

rms. The divergence in data value was driven by the increase in large rms' relative size. This

surge in the relative size of large rms is the same divergence in rm size documented by Davis

and Haltiwanger (2015). The source of this divergence is the subject of an active debate in the

macroeconomics and IO literatures.




4.1 Deriving the initial value of information
To arrive at the value of information, we compute                    ax-ante expected utility and determine its

sensitivity to information choice.         Ex-ante expected utility of investor             i   from asset   j   is given by

  16 This  concept is related to what is sometimes referred to as a water-lling equilibrium in the information
choice literature. Equilibrium is often computed letting agents sequentially choose risk factors to learn about.
Using learning about a risk is like lling its bucket with water. Once suciently full, investors move on to lling
the next deepest bucket. Our value of information is the depth of each bucket, before being lled with water.
See our follow-up paper (Farboodi et. al., 2019)for estimates of the equilibrium marginal value of information
as well.
   17 High negative expected prots are also valuable, because they present protable shorting opportunities.
The 1/2 in eq. (20) comes from subtracting a variance term in the formula for the mean of a log-normal variable.


                                                         23
that makes the expected value of the squared prot high.

     Next, we compute the unconditional expected prot per share:
                                                                                     18


                                                                   2
                                                      r
                                         E   i
                                             j   =¯                    j x
                                                                         ¯j .                                      (21)
                                                    r - gj

Thus, the expected prot per share is the product of the total amount of asset                          j   risk borne by

the average investor, scaled by aggregate risk aversion                ¯.   Faster growth, or equivalently more

                                      r
persistent cash-ows (higher               ) means greater uncertainty about payos (or discounted values
                                     r-gj

of the entire cash-ow stream) for a given level of uncertainty about current cash-ows (j ).

Similarly, larger supply (higher        x
                                        ¯j ) implies more overall risk for the average investor's portfolio
and therefore, a larger compensation in the form of expected prots. In other words, it is more

valuable to learn about large, fast-growing rms with greater uncertainty.

     To compute the          initial value of data, we simply replace the equilibrium information level

j   with its pre-data value, the prior variance       jd    in (20). Then, compute the partial derivative

                        -1
with respect to      (i
                      j) .      This is what we call the    initial value of information (V Ij ):


                                                               2
                                             1 2       r                   1
                                      V Ij =   ¯                   2  ¯2
                                                                   jd x j + jd                                     (22)
                                             2       r - gj                2

     The rst component in (22) is related to the mean of the expected prot per share of asset

j   from (21).      As we saw earlier, higher growth         (gj ),    larger size   (¯
                                                                                      xj )   and more uncertainty

(j )   all raise   V Ij ,   making information about the asset's cash-ows more valuable. Moreover,

these factors enter multiplicatively and therefore, amplify each other. This interaction makes

large-growth rms particularly valuable to learn about.

     The second term in (22) stems from the variance of expected prots per share. Quantita-

                                                                                       r
tively, however, this term is dominated by the rst term, because
                                                                                     r - gj
                                                                                            and   x
                                                                                                  ¯j   are both large,

relative to other terms. In other words, most of the variation in the value of the information,

both in the cross-section and over time, comes from changes in the expected prots.

of information V Ij is dened in (22).




4.2 Estimated initial value of information.
We construct a time series for the value of information (V Ij ), for each of the four asset groups

by decade. Computing        V Ij   requires parameters already estimated in Section 3, as well as risk

aversion    ¯ and   the asset supply    (¯
                                         xj ) .   To estimate total supply by decade, we take the average

(book) value of assets of rms in group              j.   We assume the risk aversion coecient is   ¯ = 0.02.
    The resulting estimates in Figure 5 oer a simple explanation for why so much data has been

processed for large rms, especially large growth rms: information about such rms is more

valuable. Both size and growth increase the value of information, which is also amplied by

their interaction. The combination of being large and growing quickly makes a rm a desirable

target for data analysis. In the gure, the value of information for small growth and small value

stocks is almost indistinguishable from the x-axis, orders of magnitude lower than the value of

the large rms' data.

    The time series for     V Ij   in Figure 5 shows a dramatic rise in the value of large rms' infor-

mation during the 1990s and 2000s. These patterns are driven almost entirely by movements in

the rst term in (22). Why did this component rise so sharply and then fall? The increase can

be traced to the rise in their size (x
                                     ¯j ): in other words, large rms grew larger (both in absolute
and relative terms) during the 1990s and 2000s, raising expected prots per share and making

data about them more valuable. The decline in the 2010s stems from a fall in the estimated

variability of cashows      jd .   This is consistent with the low price of volatility options (the VIX)

during this period.

    The value of large-value rms' information surpasses that of large growth rms' information

for one decade in our sample. This was the combined result of a decrease in the growth prospects

of large-growth rms and a rise in the relative size of large-value rms. One possibility is that

these changes in rms' characteristics was unexpected. If data processing can be frictionlessly

reallocated, one would expect a quick reaction to the surprise change in growth and size. But,

in reality, research groups take time to build, time to hire, and time to develop expertise. It

could be that, much like physical capital, information processing expertise is slow to adjust. A

full exploration of this possibility is a question for another paper.




5    Conclusions
The ability of nancial prices to transmit information about rm protability is often regarded

a measure of the eciency or success of nancial markets.          As data processing technologies

have improved, one might expect this to increase in the information content of all prices.

Instead, what we nd is that price informativeness has diverged across assets.      While prices

of large, growth stocks are getting more informative, the extent of information in prices of all

other assets is stagnant or declining.   This could reect changes in information or changing

asset characteristics. To disentangle trends in various factors inuencing informativeness, we

estimate a structural model and decompose the traditional measure of informativeness into

changes in growth, volatility and information. This decomposition only strengthens the puzzle:

Investors seem to be processing more and more data about large growth assets, but not about

others.

    To explore why data processing might diverge, we use the estimated structural model to

impute a marginal value of data. We nd that the value of large growth rm data has increased,

primarily because these rms grew larger.       Larger rms are more valuable to learn about,

particularly if they are also expected to grow faster. This oers a partial explanation for the

diverging trends in the information content of prices  investors chose to analyze the most

valuable data, that pertaining to large, growth rms.

    If data continues to become more and more abundant, eventually, the value of additional




                                                26
information about large-growth rms should fall, due to diminishing returns. Over time, would

expect to see equalization of marginal value.    The improvements in data technology should

eventually be applied to study other rms.     However, given the substantial  and growing 

inequality in rm sizes, data convergence could take a long time.

   Of course, our conclusions depend on our structural model and measure. One might ask:

What about all the other measures of information out there? Our goal is not to advocate for any

particular measure, but to argue that information is diverging across rms, over the long run.

One might make this point with alternative measures, just as we do with the alternative Davila-

Parlatore measure, at the end of Section 3. However, many of the measures that originate in

the microstructure literature are well-suited to think about high-frequency information, where

knowing a moment before others know something is valuable. Other measures, such as price

synchronicity, are well-suited to low frequency information, but would need to be adjusted

to think about what synchronicity means for a cross-section of assets. One advantage of our

structural equilibrium approach is that it can guide our thinking about how to adapt price

informativeness, synchronicity, or other measures to provide meaningful cross-sectional insights.

Our focus on long-run, low-frequency information leads us to explore an equilibrium model

suited for this purpose.   But the broader contribution is that we can quantitatively assess

the cross-sectional allocation of information and use that knowledge to better understand the

cross-sectional properties of asset prices.

A     Additional Empirical Results
This appendix contains additional results about the evolution of price informativeness.

A.1 Price Informativeness by Size
To estimate price informativeness by size, we pool all rm-year observations and construct deciles of

rm size (dened as market value in 2009 dollars).
                                                          19   We then run the cross-sectional regression (1)

within each bin, i.e. the subscript     j   now refers to a size bin. Price informativeness is then obtained

by scaling the coecient, as in (2).         The results, presented in Figure 6, show a clear pattern: the

informativeness of large rms is signicantly higher than those of smaller rms. This is particularly

true for the largest rms, i.e. those in the top decile.



Figure 6: Price Informativeness by Decile. Price informativeness is dened as in (Eq 2). We run
the regression in (1) for each year t = 1962, ..., 2010, horizon s = 5 and size decile. The sample contains publicly
listed non-nancial rms from 1962 to 2010. The graph shows the average P IN Fj,s,t over the entire sample for
each decile.




  19 This size variable has been shown to matter in the context of CEO compensation, for instance in (Gabaix
and Landier (2008).

A.2 Price Informativeness in the S&P 500
Table 5 quanties the magnitude of the divergent trends for S&P 500 and non-S&P 500 rms

and shows that they are both statistically signicant and economically large.            Price Info (t=0)
reports the magnitude of the predictive power of stock prices for future cashows at the

beginning of our sample period. Because we normalize the time trend between zero and one,

the coecient on     Price Info ×T rend can be directly interpreted as the total evolution of price
informativeness over the period. For the S&P 500 sample, price informativeness at the 5year

horizon rose by 70% (0.026/0.038). For the nonS&P 500 rms, it fell by around 80%. In all

cases, the evolution is signicant at the 1% level.

   To explore whether there is something specic to rms in the S&P 500, we perform two

dierent tests. First, we looked at rms that have never been included in the S&P 500 but are

relatively close in terms of market capitalization and size. It turns out these rms exhibit a

rise in price informativeness nearly identical to that of the S&P 500 rms (though the levels

of price informativeness are somewhat dierent). This suggests that the rising trend in price

informativeness has more to do with rm characteristics (like size) rather than inclusion in

the S&P 500    per se (though being part of the index does increase the level of informativeness
somewhat).

   In other results, we also looked at rms that were in the S&P 500 only for a part of our

sample period. We estimate two separate specications of Equation 1  one for the period of

the rm life when it is in the S&P 500 and for when it is not. We nd that, among the sample



                                                     32
of rms that are in the S&P 500 at some point in their life, the trend in price informativeness is

similar for rms currently in and out of the S&P 500. In levels, price informativeness is actually

higher when a rm is not in the S&P 500, than when they are in.



A.3 Is this All About Tech Firms?
A potential explanation for the decrease in price informativeness for the market as a whole is

that the share of rms, whose shares are harder to price  specically high tech rms  has

increased over time. However, we nd that quantitatively, the rise of such rms explains little

of the divergence in price informativeness, because the tech time trends in the large rm and

small rm samples were not suciently dierent.

   We use R&D intensity (R&D spending scaled by assets) as a proxy for high tech intensity.

First, we sort the full sample of rm-year observations into deciles of R&D intensity. We then

estimate price informativeness for each decile, using the same method as before. We nd that

price informativeness declines strongly with R&D intensity.

   Next, we analyze changes in R&D composition in the cross-section. We use inclusion in the

S&P 500 as our indicator of being a large rm. In both the S&P 500 and the non-S&P 500

sample, the fraction of rms investing more in R&D has increased steadily. The share of high-

tech rms has grown slightly more rapidly in the full sample than in the S&P 500 sample.

Until the early 80's, the high-tech shares for S&P 500 and non-S&P 500 rms track each other

closely. Then, in the mid-80's trends diverge. The share of high-tech rms increases more in

the whole sample, essentially driven by a rapid entry rate of tech rms.      Then, in the early

2000's, the share of tech rms in the S&P 500 increases and tech-shares for S&P 500 and

non-S&P 500 converge again.     Since the tech composition of the samples did not trend, the

prevalence of tech rms, while it may explain the average decline in informativeness, cannot

explain the cross-sectional divergence.



A.4 Evolution of Firm Size
Figure 7 show that S&P 500 rms got larger, relative to non-S&P 500 rms. As we showed

in Section 4 in the main text, size is a key determinant of the value of information, so this

diverging trend in size could help explain the diverging trends in informativeness.



A.5 Price Informativeness by Firm Size and Growth
Figure 8 plots the trend in price informativeness  estimated using (3)  for 4 sub-samples

of rms: Growth-Large, Value-Large, Growth-Small and Value-Small. It shows that informa-

tiveness has increased for the Growth-Large group, but declined or remained constant for the

others.




B      Structural Framework: Derivations
B.1 Proof of Proposition 1
Solving for the equilibrium follows a standard guess-and-verify procedure, widely used in the

noisy rational expectations equilibrium (REE) literature. First, we express total demand for

each asset     j,   as a function of price   (Pj 1 ),   and equate it with total supply   (¯ ~j ).
                                                                                           x+x       Then,

we match coecients on both sides of this market clearing condition to obtain a system of

equations in    Aj , Bj , Cj . Specically, all constant terms are equated to Aj ; terms that multiply
 j 1 get   equated to Bj and nally, those multiplying x    ~j must equal Cj . Simplifying that system
of equations yields the stated result.

Noting that   jp =     2 jx , we can write (28) more succinctly as
                      Bj
                                          2                    2

                V   ar(ej ) =               jd +                 jp                  =           .                 (29)
                               jd + jp             jd + jp                               jd + jp

Solving (29) for    jp   yields the expression in (18).




C     Structural Estimation: Additional Results
C.1 Baseline Estimates
Table 6 presents our estimates for price informativeness and its components by decade and

group.



C.2 Time-varying interest and growth rates
In our baseline estimation, we assumed a constant                r = 1.025          over time.     In this subsection,

we show that this is not a critical assumption. In particular, we compute the actual average

real interest rate for each decade (dened as the dierence between 1-year nominal Treasury

yield from the Federal Reserve Board's H15 release and realized ination over the subsequent

year, computed using the PCE Price Index) and use that series to re-estimate the growth and

information components of price informativeness (note that the volatility component remains

unaected). Figure 9 plots the estimated trends for all three components and looks very similar

to the baseline results in Figure 3.

   Next, we explore the role by changes in the estimated growth rate of cashows. To answer

that question, we re-estimate the model assuming that the cash-ow growth rate (gj ) each

group was xed at the level estimated for the 1960s. The results, presented in Figure 10, still

show a clear pattern of divergence across groups:                 information processed increases for large

growth rms, albeit less dramatically than in the baseline version (note that the scale in the

The variance of expected prot depends, among other things, on the equilibrium pricing coef-

cient    Bj   and the noise in the price signal                       jp .          Higher sensitivity to dividends or more noise

leads to more         ex-ante variability in expected prots. Substituting the mean and variance of the
expected prot per share into (32), we get:

is the marginal value of information for asset                             j       and the precision of the price signal and                         Hj   is

an equilibrium constant that does not depend on                                        i's   information.

   Note that          Mj
                   is a function, among other things, of the amount of data processed by the
                             2
average investor (through j and jp terms). The value of information in (22) in the main text
                                    2
removes these eects by setting j = jd . The implications for jp comes from the pricing

coecients  see (15). If no data is processed by others, then no information can be revealed
                                                                            2
                                                                        j
in prices, so Bj = 0 and jp = . At the same time, the term          1 - jd    becomes zero.

Using L'Hospital's rule, we can show that the latter dominates and therefore, the product

becomes zero in the no-information limit. Combining, the value of information                                                          Mj   reduces to

the expression for           V Ij   in (22).
