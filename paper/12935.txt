Is Well-being U-Shaped over the Life Cycle?

February 2007
JEL No. I1,J0

                                            ABSTRACT

Recent research has argued that psychological well-being is U-shaped through the life cycle. The
difficulty with such a claim is that there are likely to be omitted cohort effects (earlier generations
may have been born in, say, particularly good or bad times). Hence the apparent U may be an artifact.
Using data on approximately 500,000 Americans and Europeans, this paper designs a test that makes
it possible to allow for different birth-cohorts. A robust U-shape of happiness in age is found. Ceteris
paribus, well-being reaches a minimum, on both sides of the Atlantic, in people's mid to late 40s.
The paper also shows that in the United States the well-being of successive birth-cohorts has gradually
fallen through time. In Europe, newer birth-cohorts are happier.

                   Is Well-being U-Shaped over the Life Cycle?



1. Introduction

A large social-science literature is emerging on the determinants of happiness and

mental well-being. As would be expected, this topic has attracted the attention of

medical statisticians, psychologists, economists, and other investigators (including

Easterlin 2003, Frey and Stutzer 2002, Lucas et al 2004, Layard 2005, Smith et al

2005, Ubel et al 2005, Gilbert 2006, and Kahneman et al 2006).           However, a

fundamental research question remains poorly understood. What is the relationship

between age and well-being?

       Traditional surveys of the field, such as Myers (1992), Diener et al (1999) and

Argyle (2001), argue that happiness is either flat or very slightly increasing in age.

Mroczek and Kolarz (1998) provide a discussion of psychologists’ earlier writings.

However, much new work has argued that there is evidence of a U-shape through the

life cycle.   In cross-sections, even after correcting for potentially confounding

influences, there is now thought to be a convex link between reported well-being and

age. This modern literature includes Clark and Oswald (1994), Gerlach and Stephan

(1996), Oswald (1997), Theodossiou (1998), Winkelmann and Winkelmann (1998),

Blanchflower (2001), Di Tella et al (2001, 2003), Frey and Stutzer (2002),

Blanchflower and Oswald (2004), Graham (2005), Frijters et al (2004, 2005), Senik

(2004), Van Praag and Ferrer-I-Carbonell (2004), Shields and Wheatley Price (2005),

Oswald and Powdthavee (2005), Propper et al (2005), Powdthavee (2005), Bell and

Blanchflower (2006), Uppal (2006), and Blanchflower and Oswald (2007). Clark et

al (1996) makes a similar argument for job satisfaction equations. Pinquart and

Sorensen (2001) develops an equivalent case for a measure of loneliness, and Hayo



                                                                                     2
and Seifert (2003) does so for a measure of economic subjective well-being. Jorm

(2000) reviews the psychiatric evidence and concludes that there are conflicting

results on how the probability of depression alters over the life course.

       There is an important difficulty with the conclusion that well-being is U-

shaped in age. As Easterlin (2006) points out, the effect of an age variable is likely to

be contaminated by omitted cohort effects (earlier generations may have been born in,

say, particularly good or bad times). Hence the U-shape in age, uncovered now by

various authors, could be an artifact of the data.

       This is more than a theoretical possibility. Suicide levels seem to vary across

cohorts (Stockard and O’Brien 2002). Moreover, Blanchflower and Oswald (2000)

find some evidence of rising well-being among young people. There is also evidence

-- for example, in Sacker and Wiggins 2002 -- that levels of depression and

psychiatric distress, measured consistently across cohorts, have risen in countries

such as Great Britain. Nevertheless, these matters are still the subject of debate

(Murphy et al 2000, Paykel 2000).

       New work by Clark and Oswald (2007) argues that in British panel data on

well-being it can be shown that the U-shape in age is identified entirely from the

longitudinal element of the data set. The authors’ study can be thought of as literally

following the aging process of particular individuals at different points in the lifespan.

Nevertheless, such research is rare and does not allow cohort effects to be examined,

and it seems important to inquire into the foundations of the U-shape in other nations.

2. Testing for Cohort Effects

This paper offers some of the first cross-country evidence that the curvilinear

relationship is robust to cohort effects. We draw upon randomly sampled data on

approximately 500,000 Americans and Europeans.             These data come from the



                                                                                         3
General Social Surveys of the United States and the Eurobarometer Surveys, and,

necessarily for the design of the test, cover some decades.

       One point, however, should perhaps be made clear from the outset. It is that

the paper can examine only simple so-called single-item measures of well-being, so

cannot allow subtle differentiation -- as favoured in psychology journals -- into what

might be thought of as different types of, or sides to, human happiness or mental

health. Nevertheless, the patterns that emerge are perhaps of interest.

       After controlling for different birth-cohorts, the paper finds that ceteris-

paribus well-being reaches its minimum in a person’s 40s. This U-shape is similar for

males and females, and on each side of the Atlantic Ocean. Moreover, because of the

size of our data sets, the turning point in well-being -- the age at which happiness

begins to lift back up -- is fairly precisely determined.

       The paper’s concern is with the ceteris paribus correlation between well-being

and age, so we later partial out other factors, such as income and marital status, that

both alter over a typical person’s lifetime and have effects upon well-being. This

follows one particular tradition of empirical research.       We read the effect of a

variable’s coefficient from a long regression equation in which other influences have

been controlled for as effectively as possible.

       Despite the commonness of this convention in modern social-science research,

such a method is not inevitable. A valid and different approach is that of, for

example, Easterlin (2006), who focuses on the raw or reduced-form link between

happiness and age.      Interestingly, he finds evidence of an inverted U-shape. As

Easterlin points out, and as explained also in Blanchflower and Oswald (2004), if few

or no control variables other than age are included in an American happiness

regression estimated from the General Social Survey, the effect of age is concave and



                                                                                      4
not convex. A related result is that of Mroczek and Spiro (2005), who establish in a

data set on American veterans, where the youngest person in the data set is 40 years

old (making it hard to do an exact comparison with research on the GSS), that

happiness rises to the early 60s, and then appears to decline.

       As common observation shows, the quality of a person’s health and physical

abilities depends sensitively on the point in the life cycle. Most diseases, and the

probability of getting them, worsen with age. A 90 year old man cannot in general do

the same number of push-ups as a 20 year old man. Hence an important issue is

whether in happiness equations it is desirable to control in some way for health and

physical vitality. There is here no unambiguously correct answer, but the approach

taken in the paper is not to include independent variables that measure physical

health. This is partly pragmatic: our data sets have no objective measures and few

subjective ones. But the decision is partly substantive: it seems interesting to ask

whether older people are happier once only simple demographic and economic

variables are held constant.

3. Conceptual Issues

       There is relatively little social-science theory upon which to draw (though

mention should perhaps be made of Carstensen’s theory, which, put informally, is that

age is associated with increasing motivation to derive emotional meaning from life

and decreasing motivation to expand one's horizons: Carstensen et al 1999 and

Charles et al 2001).

       Conventional economics is in principle capable of making predictions about

the life cycle structure of happiness if conceptualized as utility in the normal

economist’s framework. However, in practice, economists’ standard life-cycle theory




                                                                                    5
does not generate a U-shape in a straightforward way. Instead, the natural conclusion

is that well-being might be predicted to be independent of age.

            To see why, let the individual person be concerned to maximize lifetime

utility V by choosing a consumption path c(a) where a is the individual’s age. Assume

lifespan runs deterministically from time point t to time point T. Assume away

discounting for simplicity (it is straightforward to show here that it makes no

substantive difference, given an efficient capital market where people both discount

utility at rate r and can lend or borrow at interest rate r). Let income y be fixed and

given by the agent’s talent endowment, and for simplicity set this to unity. Then the

agent chooses consumption c at each age a to maximize lifetime happiness

        T
V = ∫ u (c, a )da (1)
        t


subject to an inter-temporal borrowing constraint

    T
1 = ∫ c(a )da      (2)
    t


in which the endowment of income to be allocated across all the periods has been

normalized to one. Assume that u, utility or well-being, is an increasing and concave

function of consumption, c. Spending, by assumption, then makes people happier.

            This is a so-called isoperimetric problem. The first-order condition for a

maximum is the usual one: it requires the marginal utility of consumption to be the

same at each level of age, a. Therefore, solving a Lagrangean L constructed from (1)

and (2):

∂L ∂u (c, a )
   =          − λ = 0 (3)
∂c    ∂c




                                                                                      6
where, from the underlying mathematical structure, the multiplier lambda is

necessarily constant across all the different ages from t to T. Individuals thus allocate

their discretionary spending to the points in time when they enjoy it most.

        If the utility function u(c,a) is additively separable in consumption c and age a,

then equation (3) has a simple implication. It is one that is implicit in much of

economic theory. Consumption will be flat through time (because under separability

u = u(c)) + v(a)) and, therefore, utility will also be flat through the lifespan if the non-

consumption part of utility, v(.), is independent of age.             In plainer language,

happiness will not alter over a person’s life course.

        It is reasonable to suggest that to go from the utility function u = u(c,a) to the

presumption that u(..) is additively separable in its two arguments is a large, and

potentially unwarranted, step. There is no clear reason why the marginal utility of

consumption would be independent of a person’s age. For example, one might

believe that young people wish to signal their status more, and therefore might have a

greater return from units of consumption than the old (so the cross-partial derivative

of u(c,a) would then be negative). Alternatively, one might argue that older people

have more need of health and medical spending, and therefore that the marginal

utility of c is greatest at high levels of a. Then the cross-partial of u(c,a) is positive.

        While it would be possible to assume that early in life the first effect

dominates and then in later life the second one dominates, and in this way get

eventually to a model where well-being was U-shaped through the lifespan, to do so

seems too ad hoc (or post-hoc) to be persuasive theoretically. What this means is that

textbook economics -- without making assumptions about v(a) that could

mechanically lead to any desired shape -- is not capable of producing clear

predictions about the nonlinear pattern of well-being through an individual’s life.



                                                                                              7
4. Empirical Results

To explore this issue empirically, therefore, we draw upon two data sets, which pool

data on approximately half a million randomly selected individuals, and implement a

test that controls for the possible existence of cohort effects. The data do not follow

the same individuals through time. They provide repeated statistically-representative

snapshots, year after year, covering all ages of American and European adults from

age 16 and above.

        The key evidence is summarized in four tables.

        Table 1 takes all the males in the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) from

1974-2004. It estimates a happiness regression equation for this sub-sample, and

shows in its early columns that well-being is U-shaped in age. Then cohort variables

are introduced. These take the form of a set of dummy variables – one dummy for

each decade of birth. Although the introduction of the cohort dummies affects the

turning point of the quadratic function in age, it does not do so in a way that changes

the thrust of the idea that well-being follows a U-shaped path. The same statistical

procedure is followed for the analysis of three further sub-samples, namely, the

females in the GSS data set, the males in the Eurobarometer survey, and finally the

females in the same European sample.

        The exact wording of the GSS well-being question is: “Taken all together,

how would you say things are these days – would you say that you are very happy,

pretty happy, or not too happy?”

        In the Eurobarometer survey it is: “On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly

satisfied, not very satisfied, or not at all satisfied with the life you lead?”

        To give a feel for the raw patterns in the data, happiness in the United States

can be expressed in a cardinal way by assigning 1 to 3 to the three answers above,



                                                                                       8
where ‘very happy’ is a 3. In that case, the mean of US happiness in the data is 2.2

with a standard deviation of 0.6.       Similarly, European life satisfaction can be

cardinalized using the integers 1 to 4, where ‘very satisfied’ is a 4. In this case, the

mean of life satisfaction is 3.0 with a standard deviation of 0.8. Well-being answers

are skewed, in both data sets, somewhat towards the upper end of the possible

distribution.

        The paper tests for a U-shape by examining whether the data take a quadratic

form in age. Almost all the coefficients on age-squared variables in the main part of

the paper are statistically significant at the 0.0001 level. We estimate the effects by

using ordered logit equations. The tables report estimated coefficients, which is an

alternative to odds ratios. This option affects only how results are displayed and not

how they are estimated.

        In the first column of Table 1 a GSS happiness ordered logit equation is

estimated on the pooled sample of 19,027 American males with age entered as an

independent variable. It has, as further independent regressors, a separate dummy

variable for each year in the data set and for each region of the United States. This is

to mop up year-by-year variation in national well-being and unchanging spatial

characteristics such as regions’ climatic conditions.

        The age regressor in the first column of Table 1 has a positive coefficient of

0.0096 and a t-statistic of approximately 11. Hence reported happiness rises as

people get older. In column 2 of Table 1, a set of further regressors are included into

the equation, and the coefficient on age falls somewhat, to 0.0066, with a t-statistic

that indicates it continues to be statistically significantly different from zero at usual

confidence levels. These extra regressors are a variable for the years of education of

the person, two dummies for racial type, 8 dummies for the number of dependent



                                                                                         9
children of the individual, a collection of different dummy variables to capture the

working status (employed, unemployed, …) of the person, a dummy variable that

takes the value one if the individual reported that his or her parents had divorced by

the time the individual respondent was aged 16, and 4 dummy variables to capture the

person’s marital status. Table 1 goes on to check for a turning point in age. It does so

in the simplest way, by fitting a level and a squared term. Table 1 finds in column 3

that a quadratic form seems to approximate the data well: the equation traces out a

happiness function that reaches a minimum at 36.8 years of age. This is effectively

the U-shaped result in the literature to date.

       However, Table 1 then explores the possibility that the U-shape in age is a

product merely of omitted cohort effects.         Column 4 of Table 1 extends the

specification by introducing a separate dummy variable for each decade of birth (it

cannot enter a full set of individual birth-year dummies because the result would be

complete collinearity). The outcome is a U-shape in age, but one where the turning

point is now much later in the typical individual’s life. According to the evidence in

column 4 of Table 1, subjective well-being among randomly selected American

males, bottoms out at an estimated 55.9 years. This is to be thought of, of course, as

the minimum-happiness age after controlling for other influences such as education

and marital status.

       Finally, column 5 of Table 1 introduces an income measure into the equation

explaining well-being (although the causal interpretation here is open to debate,

Gardner and Oswald 2007 document longitudinal evidence that windfalls raise mental

well-being). For simplicity, and following much of the literature, income is entered

as the natural logarithm of the person’s family income. The coefficient is positive

(with a t-statistic of 6.83), so richer people report higher levels of happiness with their



                                                                                        10
lives. Here the U-shape in age bottoms out at age 49.5. The sample size is somewhat

reduced, because of missing income observations, to 11,404 people.

       The remainder of the paper’s evidence is similar. Table 2 moves to a sub-

sample of females from the US General Social Survey. Compared to Table 1, the

sample size is a little larger (because women live longer than men) at 24,148

individuals. Once again, each reports a well-being answer on a three-point scale from

very happy down to not at all happy, and Table 2 estimates an ordered logit equation

with the same structure as for the males in Table 1.

       Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the analytical structure for American women

is almost the same as for the men.

       In Table 2, well-being is at first increasing in age. But once a squared term in

age is introduced, in the third column, it is clear that the data favour a quadratic form,

so once again happiness seems strongly U-shaped in age. When the same set of

cohort dummies are incorporated into the equation, in column 4 of Table 2, the

turning point of the happiness function is at age 44.9 years. This is noticeably less

than the 55.9 years estimated for the male sub-sample. However, allowing for the

separate effect of income upon well-being in column 5 makes women look more like

the men. The minimum in column 5 of Table 2 is reached at age 45.1. Whatever is

going on, in some sense that may not be immediately understandable, these data are

apparently working in roughly but not exactly the same way for American males and

females.

       With only minor differences, Tables 3 and 4 tell the same story, but use

Eurobarometer data pooled from 1975 to 1998. Here, of course, the continent is

different and the sample sizes far larger. A slightly different form of well-being

question (on life satisfaction) has to be employed, but as these estimation methods



                                                                                       11
effectively use only the ordering of well-being answers, the exact wording is unlikely

to matter significantly, and so empirically it seems to prove.

       In Table 3, an ordered logit is estimated for 200,848 males from France,

Belgium, Netherlands, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Ireland, Great Britain,

Greece, Spain, and Portugal.       To allow comparisons, the aim is to achieve an

econometric specification as close as possible, despite some differences in the data

sets on topics such as the level of detail in the measure of income, to that for the

United States in Tables 1 and 2.

       Before the cohort dummies are introduced, the turning point in the male well-

being equation is at a minimum point where age is equal to 43.4 years (see column 3

of Table 3). It is not easy to say why this number might be higher than in the USA

(see column 3 of Table 1), but one possibility is that the Second World War may have

exacted a toll in various ways on this generation of European males. Whatever the

reason, the difference with the United States continues by the time column 4 is

estimated. Now the age at which well-being reaches a minimum is 47.1 years, which

is below the American number.

       After the role of income is entered into the specification, the minimum is 44.1

years. Table 4 produces similar figures, and equations, for the female sub-sample of

214,857 randomly sampled European women.

       At the suggestion of a referee, the Appendix sets out a number of robustness

checks and inquiries. In the interests of brevity, only the results for males are given.

       Table A1 reveals that it is the addition of dummies for marital status that first

makes the U-shape evident in the data of the United States, and this quadratic is

strengthened by a control for years of schooling (see, for example, columns 3 and 4).

It is allowing for an income variable that makes the minimum point of the U-shape in



                                                                                       12
happiness move considerably further to the right (in the last column of Table A1).

These changes across specifications are less noticeable in European data (as in Table

A3). Table A2 divides the data into sub-samples. It is evident that there is a strong

U-shape in age among the sub-sample of American males who never married. This

suggests that, in the full sample, the quadratic is not merely somehow proxying the

fact that happy people tend to go on to get married more. The same general result is

found for Europe in the final two columns of Table A3, where the minimum point of

well-being is estimated at age 49.1 for single Europeans and 37.6 for ever-married

Europeans. Although they are omitted, equivalent results were found for females in

each continent.

       A full set of interaction terms -- interacting the quadratic in age with the other

independent variables -- was also tried, as a robustness check, but these were found to

have coefficients that were almost always insignificantly different from zero at the

95% confidence level.

5. Measuring the Size of the Age and Cohort Effects on Well-being

Even if statistically significant, is such a U-shape in age large enough to be important

empirically? The data suggest that the answer is yes.

       One way to explore this is to compare the levels of well-being between, say,

age 20 and age 45. This difference -- in the equations that control for other factors --

is approximately 0.1 to 0.2 cardinal well-being points, and this is around one fifth of a

standard deviation in well-being scores.        At first sight that does not appear

particularly large. But, because the standard deviation is dominated by cross-section

variation in reported well-being, there is a more useful and evocative way to think

about the size of the age and age-squared effect. Going from age 20 to age 45 is

approximately equal to one third of the size of the effect of the unemployment



                                                                                      13
coefficient in a well-being equation. That is suggestive of a large effect on well-

being.

         Although the birth-cohort coefficients (on Born<1900, Born 1900-1910, etc)

are not always individually well-defined, there are signs from the Tables that the

United States and Europe differ quite strongly in the time structure of the cohort

effects upon happiness. In Tables 1 and 2, there is evidence that successive American

generations became progressively less happy from 1900 to today. This conclusion is

reminiscent of one of Easterlin’s (2006), although he uses a different statistical

method.

         In Europe, by contrast, Tables 3 and 4 suggest that cohort well-being falls

initially from the beginning of the century but, after bottoming out in the 1950s

(which is the omitted base category) has actually been rising throughout the most

recent generations. This is particularly clear for males. The coefficient of 0.3206 (t =

2.36) for the final cohort, in the fifth column of Table 3, implies that, by this criterion

the most recent generation of European men is ceteris paribus the happiest of the 20th

century.

         As with the effect of moving along the quadratic function in age, cohort

dummy variables are here large in magnitude; they are not merely different from zero

on a formal significance test. Put loosely, cohort effects are two or three times as

large as the effect from the U-shape in age. The single greatest effect is visible in the

equations for US males in Table 1.           Here, comparing the happiest cohort of

Americans to the least happy, the cardinalized well-being difference through the

generations exceeds half of one standard-deviation of the happiness measure. In all

the tables, whilst the details differ, estimated cohort effects are quantitatively

significant and not merely statistically significant.



                                                                                        14
       It might be argued that the use of language itself could have altered over the

century (perhaps modern generations of highly educated TV-watchers have become

linguistically more or less expressive), and hence that in the US and Europe the

paper’s estimated happiness-cohort effects are partly or wholly an illusion caused by

this changing nature of words. It is not easy to guard against such possibilities in a

definitive way. Nevertheless, one piece of evidence against such a view comes out of

the clear difference between the two continents’ results. The estimated pattern of the

cohort effects is very different between the US and Europe. As, no doubt because of

common trends in technology, both continents’ ways of living have changed in

broadly similar ways since 1900, it is not easy to see how the coefficients on the

cohort dummies could be explained solely by some form of changed use of language

in the modern world. These cohort effects seem unlikely to be simply a mirage

caused by alterations in the way that different generations use, and perceive the

meaning of, words.

6. Conclusions

This paper studies happiness and life-satisfaction data on 500,000 Americans and

Europeans. It draws two main conclusions. First, psychological well-being depends

in a curvilinear way upon age. Second, there are important differences in the reported

happiness levels of different birth-cohorts.

       The paper’s results draw upon regression equations and use data sets long

enough to distinguish age effects from cohort effects. They suggest that reported

well-being is U-shaped in age and that the convex structure of the curve is similar

across different parts of the Western world. It should be emphasized that, because the

paper’s equations control for many other influences upon happiness and life

satisfaction, including income, education and marriage, these results should be read as



                                                                                    15
describing ceteris-paribus well-being. As Easterlin (2006) has shown, and as we

confirm, in raw American data there is no U-shape (though in European data we

demonstrate that the U-shape is visible without the inclusion of any controls).

       Happiness among American males and females reaches its estimated

minimum at approximately ages 49 and 45 respectively. Life satisfaction levels

among European men minimize at age 44 and among European women at age 43.

Our correction for birth-cohort influences makes some difference to the results

claimed by the earlier literature, especially in American well-being equations, but the

general spirit of a U-shape is unaffected by cohort effects. How these US results fit

together with those of Blanchflower and Oswald (2000) on the rising well-being of

the young is not completely clear, but it seems likely that there are divergent trends

within-cohort.

       It could reasonably be objected that our method has had to rely on decadal

proxies for cohorts of Americans and Europeans.          How to do better than this,

nevertheless, is not clear if the aim is to maintain also age and year effects within the

equations. Moreover, if subtler cohort effects were of major importance, we might

expect to see more evidence of equation instability when they are (imperfectly)

introduced in the form of the decade-long dummy variables.

       By definition, this paper has one important limitation.          It is that these

international data sets do not follow the same individuals over the years. As far as we

know, there is no internationally comparable panel data set on multiple nations in

which general happiness or well-being questions are asked (a European Household

Panel is currently being constructed but asks only questions such as income-

satisfaction and housing-satisfaction). It is perhaps also worth pointing out that panel




                                                                                      16
data have their own disadvantages, particularly that of sometimes high levels of

measurement error.

       What truly causes the U-shaped curve in human well-being, and the noticeable

regularity of its mathematical shape in different parts of the industrialized world, is

currently unknown. Potential answers, some more plausible than others, include the

following.

             •   One possibility is that individuals learn to adapt to their strengths and

                 weaknesses, and in mid-life quell the infeasible aspirations of their

                 youth.

             •   Another -- though it is hard to see how it could be quantitatively large

                 at midlife -- is that cheerful people live systematically longer than the

                 miserable, and that the U-shape somehow traces out in part a selection

                 effect.

             •   A third is that a kind of comparison process is at work: I have seen

                 school-friends die and come eventually to value my blessings during

                 my remaining years.

There are likely to be others.

     Understanding the roots of the U-shaped life cycle pattern of well-being, and

uncovering what might have produced the pronounced birth-cohort effects

documented in this paper, seems an important task for future work.

for parents divorced when respondent was 16, and 4 marital-status dummies. ‘Yes’ means these variables are
included in the equation. The ‘base’ excluded cohort is that for people born 1950-1959. The data set excludes
1979, 1981, 1992, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001 and 2003. The exact wording of the well-being question is: “Taken
all together, how would you say things are these days – would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or
not too happy?”

data set excludes 1981, and columns 2-4 also exclude 1995 and 1996 because there are no income variables for
those years. The exact wording of the well-being question is: “On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly
satisfied, not very satisfied, or not at all satisfied with the life you lead?” The countries are France, Belgium,
Netherlands, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Ireland, Great Britain, Greece, Spain and Portugal.

The numbers in parentheses are t-statistics. All equations are ordered logits and include 10 country-dummies
and 19 year-dummies. ‘Personal controls’ are 9 educational-qualification dummies, 6 workforce-status
dummies, and 5 marital-status dummies. The ‘base’ excluded cohort is that for people born 1950-1959. The
data set excludes 1981, and columns 2-4 also exclude 1995 and 1996 because there are no income variables for
those years. The exact wording of the well-being question is: “On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly
satisfied, not very satisfied, or not at all satisfied with the life you lead?” The countries are France, Belgium,
Netherlands, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Ireland, Great Britain, Greece, Spain and Portugal.

All equations are ordered logits. The numbers in parentheses are t-statistics; they test the null hypothesis of a coefficient of zero. Stars * denote a coefficient significantly
different from zero at the 5% level. The data set excludes 1979, 1981, 1992, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001 and 2003. The exact wording of the well-being question is: “Taken all
together, how would you say things are these days – would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?”. Income is only available from 1977.

All equations are ordered logits. The numbers in parentheses are t-statistics. Stars * denote a coefficient significantly different from zero at the 5% level. The data set
excludes 1979, 1981, 1992, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001 and 2003. The exact wording of the well-being question is: “Taken all together, how would you say things are these days
– would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?”. Income is only available from 1977.
