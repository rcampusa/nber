Measuring the Location of Production in a World of Intangible Productive Assets, FDI, and
Intrafirm Trade

                                              ABSTRACT

As production comes to depend more on intangible productive assets, the location of production by
multinational firms becomes increasingly ambiguous. The reason is that, within the firm, these assets
have no clear geographical location, but only a nominal location determined by the firm's tax or legal
strategies.

The effects of these location ambiguities, and the resulting distortions for tax reasons of the location
of production, are described and it is estimated that for U.S. firms' affiliates in a few tax havens alone,
the exaggeration of value added in those locations amounted, in 2005, to about 4 percent of worldwide
affiliate sales, and the exaggeration of sales to about 10 percent of worldwide affiliate sales.

Some possibilities for estimating the location of production that could supersede the present dependence
on accounting measures distorted by tax-saving policies are described.

Introduction

       In 1971, the U.S. Department of Commerce published the 50th Anniversary issue of the

Survey of Current Business, entitled “The Economic Accounts of the United States: Retrospect

and Prospect.” There was much praise for the work of the Office of Business Economics, the

producer of the Survey and the National Accounts. However, on one issue, the measurement of

capital consumption, several contributors thought that the official data did not measure what they

were supposed to, and that changes were overdue. Edward Denison summarized his objections

by saying that “The measure of total capital consumption allowances is consistent neither among

components nor over time. The only possible use for the nonfarm components is for tax

analysis; they have no relevance to the measurement of output or income.” And, “…for nonfarm

business, it consists of historical cost values and reflects whatever service lives and depreciation

patterns are allowed at a particular time by tax laws and regulations and by accountants” (p. 40).

       In 1975, the BEA announced that the upcoming benchmark revision of the national

accounts would involve abandoning the dependence on tax return depreciation because it “…is

not the proper measure for inclusion in national income and product accounts…” (p. 14).

       I suggest in this paper that the same state has now been reached for measures of the

location of production, especially production by multinational firms, and the corresponding




                                                                                                       1
measures of international trade, especially in industries in which intangible and financial capital

are major inputs into production. The same problems of ascertaining the location of production

exist in domestic measure of regional or state gross product, because much of trade across

regions or states is intrafirm trade, the share of production from intangible or financial assets

differs among locations, and there are incentives to distort values for tax minimization purposes.

The problem extends beyond intrafirm trade, but it is more acute in intrafirm trade because many

product valuations escape market tests. In this paper I concentrate attention on distortions in

international transactions because there is more information available for them.

       As production comes to depend more and more on intangible assets, such as patents,

copyrights, technological and scientific knowledge, techniques of management or of production

and distribution, product and company logos, and company names, the location of production by

multinational firms becomes more and more ambiguous. The reason is that in a multinational

firm, these assets have no clear geographical location, but only a nominal location determined by

the parent company’s tax or legal strategies. The geographical assignment by the firm then

determines where production based on these assets is reported to take place, the distribution of

production across countries, which sales are exports or imports, and the direction of trade.

       If these assignments of intangible assets were made randomly, the only consequence for

the measurement of production and trade would be some loss of accuracy of individual

observations. There is strong evidence, however, that these assignments are not random, but are

made in order to minimize taxes, and that they operate to reduce the measured output of

countries with high tax rates on business income and exaggerate the output of low-tax countries.

They also tend to exaggerate the imports of high-tax countries and understate their exports. The

problem in trade data is probably worse for trade in services than for trade in goods. The




                                                                                                      2
measurement of trade in goods is anchored more in observable physical crossings of borders,

where values must be declared, but it exists also in trade in goods, especially those goods for

which much of the value is contributed by intangible assets. The area of ambiguity is also

increased by the growth in intrafirm trade, especially trade in parts and components, for which

arm’s length transactions, and the corresponding prices, may not exist.

       One purpose of the paper is to summarize the evidence for systematic distortions of the

values of production and trade and to relate them to their causes. A second purpose is to make

some estimates of the extent of the distortions. A third purpose is to suggest possible ways of

estimating economic valuations of these quantities by reducing the dependence of these estimates

on corporate bookkeeping.


The Sources of Measurement Problems

       There are two main sources of problems in measuring the location of production and the

direction of trade. One is the increasing share of intangible and financial inputs into production

and the second is the increasing importance of transactions that take place across national

borders within multinational firms. For regional accounts, the latter problem arises from

transactions within firms across regions. Each of them by itself would give rise to measurement

problems, but the combination of the two magnifies the effects of each one.

       The most fundamental source of the problems is the fact that more and more production

and trade are based on inputs from intangible assets, and to a lesser extent, financial assets, the

location of which is difficult or impossible to define. The OECD (2006, p. 34), describes this

development, with respect to intangible assets, as “One of the most important commercial

developments in recent decades,” and the report points particularly to the fact that “it is common

for intangible property to be used simultaneously by more than one part of an enterprise.” Thus,



                                                                                                      3
many intangible assets have no clear geographical location. Their only definite location is a

legal one, their ownership. The firm that owns such assets, if it is a multinational firm, can move

them from one member of the multinational group to another, changing the nominal geographical

location without changing the geographical location of the use of the asset or changing the

control of the asset. The effect of such a transaction is to shift the apparent location of the

production based on that asset. In the process, the firm may change what had been recorded as

production by a location into imports into that location. The OECD urged “…principled rules so

as to rule out the possibility of the enterprise’s simply nominating one part of the enterprise as

the owner (by booking the intangible assets there) irrespective of whether, for example, that part

had the experience and/or capacity to assume and manage the risks associated with the intangible

property” (p. 35).

       What intangible assets are involved? Software is one asset that has been the subject of

some literature on international shifting for tax purposes, but there are many others. One news

article referred to “…patents on drugs, ownership of corporate logos, techniques for

manufacturing processes and other intellectual assets…” A tax lawyer was quoted as calling

such moves routine, “…international tax planning 101...”, adding that “…most of the assets that

are going to be reallocated as part of a global repositioning are intellectual property…that is

where most of the profit is.” (“Key Company Assets Moving Offshore,” New York Times, Nov.

22, 2002).

       Many of the same problems arise with the location of production based on the financial

assets of a multinational firm, although the valuations of the assets are more easily defined. A

transfer of assets from a parent to a wholly-owned or majority-owned affiliate, or a transfer

among affiliates, can be valued more reliably than a transfer of intangible assets, but it may




                                                                                                     4
involve no change in the degree of the parent’s control of the asset. Production appears to have

shifted its location from one location to another, but all the other inputs into production have

remained in the former locations. This issue has increased in importance in the case of the

United States as the share of U.S. outward FDI in holding companies has risen.

       These measurement problems are not new, but they seem to be growing in importance as

more firms and their financial advisors become aware of the potential for reducing taxes by using

transactions with foreign affiliates. One possible indication of a growing use of this type of “tax

planning” is the rising affiliate share of the net income of U.S. multinationals. The share of

nonbank affiliates in the net income of nonbank U.S. multinationals, which had been around a

quarter in the early 1980s, reached more than a third in the 1990s and close to half in 2003-2005

(BEA web site, April 9, 2008). That doubling of the affiliate share of net income was much

larger than the increase in the affiliates’ share of employment or expenditures on fixed assets of

these multinationals.


The Distortion of Production and Trade Measures

       The main interest in the mismeasurement or distortion of the location of production has

been on the part of tax authorities worried about the loss of tax revenue through such practices as

the shifting of profits to low-tax locations. Much of the evidence on the manipulation of

corporate data stems from the effort to curb tax avoidance. The main purpose of the OECD

report cited above was the creation of a basis for the taxation of multinationals that countries

could agree on. However, the issues raised are important for the measurement of trade and output

in the national accounts.

        One sign of distorted measures of output and its location is the reporting of output and

profits in locations where there is little or no input of labor or tangible capital. Another is the



                                                                                                      5
reporting of ratios of output and profits to tangible inputs that differ to an extreme extent from

worldwide norms. The inputs for which location is most reliably measured and least likely to be

manipulated are of labor (“people functions” in OECD terminology) and of physical capital in

the form of plant and equipment.

       Since much of the distortion comes about in connection with trade and other transactions

and allocations of income within multinational firms, and the United States collects and

publishes the most detailed data on transactions within multinational firms, we can use those data

to try to measure the distortions. These intrafirm transactions are a likely place to search for

distortions because in many cases it is impossible to find comparable arm’s length transactions

by which the tax authorities can judge correct values. Much of the intrafirm trade in goods

involves unfinished goods at various stages of production, not easily compared across firms. The

goods may differ not only in the degree of finishing, but also in the degree to which they

incorporate the firm’s intangible assets and skills or the peculiarities of the firm’s production

processes.

       One source of information on the distortion of output locations by U.S. multinationals is

their reports on operations in tax havens, especially small tax havens with little local

consumption, labor force, or physical capital. They may not be the main locations for distortions

of output measures, but they have so little real productive activity that the distorted activity

measures stand out.

       Hines (2005) reported that “Much of reported tax haven income consists of financial

flows from other foreign affiliates that parents own indirectly through their tax haven affiliates.

Clearly, American firms locate considerable financial assets in foreign tax havens and their

reported profitability in tax havens greatly exceeds any measure of their physical presence there”




                                                                                                      6
(p. 78). Hines goes on to suggest that firms in other countries that largely exempt their firms’

foreign income from taxation, such as Germany and the Netherlands, have even stronger

incentives to locate investment and income production in tax havens (p. 79).

       Other developments in the tax planning strategies of U.S. multinational firms, described

by Mutti and Grubert (2006), focus on intangible assets, adding to the possibilities for the parent

company to “…increase its earnings abroad from exploiting intangible assets that it develops in

the United States…” and “…accomplish the relocation or migration of intangible assets abroad”

(p. 2). This is a “relocation” that is obviously a fiction, since the geographical location of a

company’s intangible assets is indefinable. They can be used in many locations simultaneously.

       Some hints about one way in which U.S. multinationals locate their measured production

and profits in tax havens is given by Table 1. It shows the ratios of U.S. affiliates’ total assets to

their employment, employee compensation, and plant and equipment in the world as a whole

outside the United States and in several low tax countries. Affiliates in the area called “Other

Western Hemisphere,” essentially islands in the Caribbean, own enormous assets relative to their

labor input, measured by employment or employee compensation, and their physical capital

input, measured by their stock of property, plant, and equipment. For example, while the

average ratio of assets to employment around the world in 2005 was about $1 million per

employee, the ratios in the three European countries shown separately were all over $4 million

per employee and those for affiliates in “Other Western Hemisphere” were $16 million per

employee. Within this group, affiliates in Bermuda had assets of almost $150 million per

employee and those in U.K. Islands in the Caribbean, $29 million per employee. While

worldwide, U.S. affiliates owned assets 27 times their payrolls, those in “Other Western

Hemisphere” had assets almost 600 times their payrolls. These ratios could differ across




                                                                                                         7

countries because the industry composition of U.S. affiliates is different. However, industry

composition does not explain all of these differences. Ratios for Depository Institutions and for

Finance (except depository institutions) and Insurance showed similar wide differences between

the tax havens and other countries.

        The wide differences among affiliates in different regions with respect to ratios of assets

to labor input do not represent differences in physical capital intensity. The areas with high

ratios of total assets to labor input were also areas with high ratios of total assets to Property,

Plant, and Equipment. The high capital intensity of these affiliates reflected holdings of financial

or intangible assets, rather than plant and equipment.

        Table 2 displays the “profit-type return” relative to labor compensation for nonbank,

majority-owned affiliates in 2005. Profit-type return is defined by the BEA as measuring

“…profits before income taxes…” excluding “…nonoperating items (such as special charges and

capital gains and losses) and income from equity investments” (U.S. Bureau of Economic

Analysis, 2004, p. M-19). That definition leads to an understatement of the degree of distortion

by excluding income from equity investments, one of the mechanisms for transferring income.

        These ratios are clearly related to the asset ratios of Table 1. While the worldwide ratios

of “profit-type return” to payrolls was 84 percent, the ratio in Switzerland was 160 percent and in

Ireland, over 660 percent. Those profitability numbers, large as they are, pale beside those of

“Other Western Hemisphere,” averaging over 1000 percent, including over 3000 percent in

Barbados and Bermuda. These extremely high ratios of profits to labor income, despite the

omission of income from equity investments, were achieved by attributing large amounts of

financial or intangible capital to affiliates in those countries that employed very few workers and

had little payroll expense.

The Direction of Trade

       The conventions that determine the apparent location of production also determine the

reported direction of trade. Meade (1951, p. 34) defined exports as an element of “…demands

for goods and services which directly or indirectly cause a demand for factors of production (i.e.

for the productive services of land, capital, enterprise and work)…” whose incomes are recorded

in the national income. Imports, correspondingly, lead to a demand for “…the productive

resources of other countries.” That definition invites the question of how to treat output from an

intangible asset developed in Country A by Firm X, but allocated to a wholly-owned subsidiary

of Firm X in Country B. If the output is then exported, should it be considered an export of

Country A or of Country B? A similar question arises if a service is sold by a wholly-owned

affiliate of Firm X incorporated in Country B to a buyer in Country C, but the service is

performed entirely by employees of parent Firm X in Country A. Should it be treated as an

export of Country A or of Country B?

       In the case of one service imported into the United States, insurance services, data on

U.S. imports from all sources, both U.S. affiliates and others, reveal the ambiguities in the

reported location of the production of these services and the meaning of the reported trade (Table

3). U.S. imports of insurance services increased substantially after 2001, and the tiny islands of

the Caribbean were responsible for almost half the imports, and sometimes more.

       An obvious question about the $13 billion of imports of insurance services is whether

they were produced by resources in these islands. Some doubts might be provoked by the fact

that while the United States reported almost $12 billion in payments to Bermuda for insurance

services in 2004 and over $10 billion in 2005, Bermuda reported total exports of insurance

services of only $20 million in that year (Bermuda, Department of Statistics web site). The

United States reported importing almost $3 billion in insurance services from “Other Western

Hemisphere” in 2005, when these countries reported total worldwide insurance service exports

of less than $200 million to all destinations. The question raised by these comparisons is

whether these service imports reported by the United States were, in fact, produced by labor and

physical capital located in the United States, and possibly other developed countries, and

financial assets controlled by parent firms in the United States, but attributed to affiliates in the

Caribbean? Were the $17 billion of reported imports into the United States, in fact, U.S. output

that never left the borders of the country? If that were the case, U.S. output was understated and

U.S. imports were overstated by this amount in this one service industry.

       The shifting of income by paper transactions in order to save on corporate income taxes

is not a phenomenon limited to U.S. multinationals. The European Commission has been

discussing proposals for a uniform method of allocating income among the countries in which a

multinational operates, an idea that has generated strong opposition from several members of the

Union. A recent working paper (Fuest, Hemmelgarn, and Ramb, 2006), based on the Deutsche

Bundesbank’s database on German multinationals’ foreign operations and a matched data base

on the firms’ domestic operations, calculated what firms’ distributions of taxable income across

countries would be under a hypothetical allocation of income based on sales, employment, and

assets, including tangible and intangible assets. The paper showed large discrepancies between

the allocated income distribution and the reported one, although the method of allocation did not

remove all possibilities of profit shifting to reduce income tax.


The Size of the Distortions

       For the United States, the examples of apparent distortions of measurements of output

and trade cited above are confined to a few very small countries, because the smallness of the tax



                                                                                                        13
havens makes the anomalies between inputs and outputs conspicuous. We very roughly estimate

the “true” output and sales from U.S. affiliates in certain tax havens by fitting functions relating

measured output or sales to inputs of labor and physical capital across countries that are not, to a

major extent, tax havens, or at least contain substantial resources of labor and capital, and

applying these functions to the tax havens. The differences between these estimated “true”

outputs and sales and the reported ones are our estimates of the distortions in the income and

trade accounts of these countries from the reporting by U.S. affiliates.

       For 2004, we have estimated the exaggeration of the value added, or output, and of sales

of U.S. affiliates in eight tax havens (Ireland, Switzerland, Barbados, Bermuda, United Kingdom

Islands in the Caribbean, Western Hemisphere, n.e.c., Hong Kong, and Singapore). The

exaggeration of value added, estimated from its relation to labor compensation, was $33 billion,

about 4 percent of the worldwide total of affiliate sales. The estimated exaggeration in the sales

of these affiliates was almost $360 billion, over 10 percent of worldwide sales. Since these are

relatively small markets, most of the reported sales must have been exports, suggesting a larger

impact on exports and imports and balances of payments.

       The paper based on German multinationals’ data, discussed above, estimated the country

distribution of their corporate income in the countries of the European Union under “formula

apportionment” and compared it with that under separate accounting, the current system.

Germany, a high-tax country, would have gained 6 percent in its corporate tax base from 1996 to

2001. Ireland, among low-tax countries, would have lost 40 percent, Belgium would have lost

27 percent, Luxembourg, 18 percent, and the Netherlands, 65 percent (ibid., p.17). Thus, a shift

to formula apportionment, even an apportionment that leaves room for some forms of income




                                                                                                   14
shifting, as mentioned above, would have had large effects on the location of corporate income

in Europe, and corresponding effects on the location of production and trade.

       One of the devices used to transfer income without changing the location of labor,

physical capital, or intangible assets is to route the ownership of foreign affiliates through other

affiliates located in low-tax countries. For majority-owned U.S. affiliates in 1999, 13 percent of

assets were in the form of equity investments in other foreign affiliates. By 2005, the share of

such assets had increased to 23 percent. In “Other Western Hemisphere,” 33 percent of assets

were in that form, in Luxembourg, 72 percent, in the Netherlands, 48 percent, and in

Switzerland, 35 percent. This is, aside from Switzerland, a different set of countries from the tax

havens described above, to which income produced in the United States may have been shifted,

and for some of these countries, a claim might be made that the management of investments had

been transferred as well. That possibility might be tested by seeing whether there was a

corresponding movement of labor or labor income to accompany the transfer of assets.

       Some of these problems, in the case of the United States, are dealt with in the BEA’s

ownership-based accounts (Landefeld, Whichard, and Loewe, 1993) in the sense that they ignore

geographical shifts within a single enterprise. However, these are intended as supplements to the

standard accounts, not as replacements of them, and the differences from the standard accounts

represent conceptual differences, not corrections of distortions. The ownership accounts omit

genuine geographical shifts of resources within the same firm, an important element of national

accounts, because they focus on ownership, rather than location.


Is There a Solution?

       The existence of these measurement problems is more obvious than the solution. We

could move toward a more logical estimate of the location of multinational firms’ production by



                                                                                                   15
discarding the accounting measures supplied by the firms, because they are too badly twisted by

tax avoidance maneuvers, and substituting constructed measures. The location of production

could be approximated by assuming that it is proportional to inputs of labor and capital,

including physical capital, human capital, perhaps represented by labor compensation, and

knowledge capital, for which patents and copyrights, or payments for them, could be a proxy.

For elements of capital with no definite geographical location, such as many forms of intellectual

or other intangible capital, an assignment to the parent firm, or the main location of management

activity would be preferable to the current practice of accepting the firm’s tax-determined

allocation. The same would be true for equity in units of the same multinational firm. One result

would be not only a different allocation of production, but a different picture of the flow of trade,

since a reallocation of production implies a reallocation of trade.

       The problems involved in estimating the location of production and the corresponding

flows of exports and imports are not new to the BEA or other statistical authorities. Similar

issues arise in estimating sub-national output measures. For example, in estimating gross state

product, the BEA must make some geographical allocation of data for central administrative

offices of multiestablishment firms. The process is not described very fully, but seems to

involve a “reassignment” of nonwage value added in mining, manufacturing, and construction

from the states of operating establishments to the states in which the central administrative

offices are located (Friedenberg and Beemiller, 1997). Since the nonwage value added is not

reported by the central administrative offices, the method assumes that the earnings from the

corporation’s intangible assets, reported by the individual establishments, should be attributed to

the headquarters location of the corporation. As in the international case, the reported earnings




                                                                                                  16
may be subject to some manipulation for tax reasons of valuations in transactions among the

corporation’s establishments in different states.


Concluding Comments

       The growth in importance of intangible productive assets, combined with tax-induced

allocations of intangible assets within multinational firms, are increasingly distorting measures of

the location of production, particularly the distribution among countries. Some very crude

measures of the size of the distortions are offered here, only for a group of mainly small tax

havens, because the effects of tax planning are most visible in small host countries. Even for

these countries, the estimated distortion is as large as 10 percent of worldwide sales of U.S.-

owned affiliates.

       While a suggestion is made here for an alternative measure of the location of productive

inputs, particularly intangible inputs, the problem runs deeper than that solution. The important

role of intangible productive assets, which have no clearly definable location and can be used in

many places simultaneously, within the firm, makes any measure of the location of production

ambiguous. The ownership of production is more readily definable than the geographical

location of production. Perhaps the geographical location of production has little meaning for

multinational firms.
