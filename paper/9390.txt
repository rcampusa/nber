                                           ABSTRACT

       What explains the correlations between nominal and real variables in the postwar US data?
Are these correlations indicative of significant nominal price rigidity? Or do they simply reflect the
particular way that monetary policymakers react to developments in the real economy? To answer
these questions, this paper uses maximum likelihood to estimate a model of endogenous money. This
model allows, but does not require, nominal prices to be sticky. The results show that nominal price
rigidity, over and above endogenous money, plays a role in accounting for key features of the data.

1. Introduction

What explains the relationships observed in the US data on nominal money stocks,

nominal interest rates, nominal price inßation, and measures of real economic ac-

tivity? Do the correlations between these variables provide evidence of true causal

eﬀects running from monetary policy actions to changes in the real economy–that

is, of signiÞcant monetary nonneutralities stemming from some form of nominal

price rigidity? Or do the correlations simply reßect the particular way in which

monetary policymakers react to developments in the real economy–the workings

of what might be called an endogenous money, or reverse causation, channel that

operates even in the absence of nominal price rigidity? These questions lie at the

heart of monetary economics.

   Friedman and Schwartz (1963) present what remains the most celebrated body

of evidence in support of the view that changes in the nominal money stock play

a causal role in driving ßuctuations in real output. Ball and Mankiw (1994), for

example, cite Friedman and Schwartz prominently in explaining their preference

for sticky-price models of the business cycle. And a host of recent studies, includ-

ing Hairault and Portier (1993), Yun (1996), Ireland (1997, 2000a, 2001a, 2001b),

Rotemberg and Woodford (1997), and Kim (2000), incorporate nominal price
rigidity into modern, dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium monetary mod-

els. All of these studies imply that monetary instability represents a potentially

important source of real instability.

   Tobin (1970), by contrast, develops an early argument in support of the alter-

native, endogenous money view. He constructs a model in which movements in

the nominal money stock are correlated with, and even appear to lead, movements

in real output over the business cycle. But these patterns arise only because mon-

etary policy responds systematically to nonmonetary shocks that aﬀect output;

in Tobin’s model, money has no causal role in generating real ßuctuations.

   Later work advocating the endogenous money view, including King and Plosser

(1984), Freeman (1986), Freeman and Huﬀman (1991), and Freeman and Kydland

(2000), highlights the distinction between outside money–meaning the currency

and reserves created by the central bank–and inside money–meaning the highly

liquid deposits and money market mutual fund shares created by commercial

banks, savings banks, and other private Þnancial institutions. These studies de-

velop models in which private Þnancial activity ßuctuates along with real economic

activity, giving rise to a positive correlation between deposit creation and output

even though policy-induced changes in outside money are completely neutral. The

emphasis that these studies place on the link between inside money and output is


                                        2
motivated partly by King and Plosser’s observation that, in the US data, output

is more highly correlated with deposits than with currency or the monetary base.

On the other hand, King and Plosser do Þnd positive correlations between output

and measures of outside money, implying that models such as theirs and Free-

man’s provide, at best, a partial explanation of the relationships between nominal

and real variables. Perhaps, therefore, this focus on the outside-inside money dis-

tinction also reßects some discomfort with other speciÞcations, like those found

in Greenwood and Huﬀman (1987), Bryan and Gavin (1994), Finn (1996, 1999),

and Gavin and Kydland (1999), that ignore the distinction and simply assume

that the central bank acts to increase the money supply following nonmonetary

shocks that increase output: why, in an economy in which money is fully neutral,

would the central bank want to increase the money supply whenever output rises?

   Following the publication of Taylor’s (1993) inßuential essay, however, mone-

tary economists have come to appreciate that most central banks, including the

Federal Reserve, conduct monetary policy by managing short-term nominal in-

terest rates rather than some measure of the nominal money supply; in addition,

monetary economists have come to appreciate that most central banks, including

the Federal Reserve, systematically adjust their nominal interest rate instruments

in response to movements in output and inßation. Under nominal interest rate


                                        3
rules like the one popularized by Taylor, all movements in the money supply

become endogenous and most, if not all, movements in nominal interest rates be-

come endogenous as well. Thus, the observation that Federal Reserve policy can

be described by a Taylor rule makes the idea of endogenous money much more

plausible: perhaps, by adjusting short-term nominal interest rates in an eﬀort to

stabilize output and inßation, Federal Reserve policy has generated correlations

that mainly reßect how nominal variables respond to real variables, rather than

the way that real variables respond to nominal variables. It is quite curious,

therefore, that the workings of Taylor rules have been studied exclusively using

models that feature some form of nominal rigidity, such as those developed in the

chapters of Taylor (1999).

   This paper, accordingly, takes a step back and asks whether a model without

nominal rigidity, but with a Taylor-type rule for monetary policy, can account

for the key correlations between nominal and real variables exclusively through

the endogenous money channel. Put another way, this paper asks whether the

assumption of nominal price rigidity is really necessary to achieve a full under-

standing of the postwar American business cycle, once it is recognized that Federal

Reserve policy has worked to make movements in the money supply and in nom-

inal interest rates largely, or perhaps even wholly, endogenous.


                                        4
   More speciÞcally, the research strategy employed here begins by developing a

dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium model that allows, but does not require,

much of the variation in the nominal money supply and in the nominal interest rate

to reßect the central bank’s deliberate reaction to the nonmonetary shocks that

hit the economy. The same model also allows, but again does not require, nomi-

nal prices to adjust sluggishly following any shock–monetary or nonmonetary–

that hits the economy. The monetary policy rule–a kind of generalized Taylor

(1993) rule–provides a channel through which changes in real variables drive

movements in nominal variables. The nominal price rigidity, in turn, provides

a channel through which changes in nominal variables drive movements in real

variables. Thus, the model can potentially attribute the observed correlations

between nominal and real variables to endogenous money, sticky prices, or some

combination of the two.

   The strategy proceeds by estimating the model via maximum likelihood, using

postwar US data. A constrained version of the model without nominal price rigid-

ity is then compared to and formally tested against the unconstrained alternative

that allows for price rigidity. The results of this econometric exercise indicate

whether endogenous money can, by itself, come to grips with the action that is

found in the data, or whether nominal price rigidity is needed as well.

2. Connections to the Existing Literature

By asking whether a model with endogenous money can explain the postwar

US data and by comparing the empirical performance of model variants with

and without sticky prices, this paper extends several branches of the existing

literature. First, as mentioned above, Tobin (1970), King and Plosser (1984),

Freeman (1986), Greenwood and Huﬀman (1987), Freeman and Huﬀman (1991),

Bryan and Gavin (1994), Finn (1996, 1999), Gavin and Kydland (1999), and

Freeman and Kydland (2000) all ask whether models with endogenous money can

account for key facts associated with the American business cycle. None of the

models developed in any of these studies is estimated and evaluated with formal

econometric techniques, however.

   Coleman (1996) estimates a model with endogenous money using a simulated

method of moments procedure; his demanding and highly rigorous approach to

model evaluation is closest to the one employed here. But Coleman’s study, like

all of the others mentioned above, considers only a ßexible-price model. So while

Coleman clearly shows that his ßexible-price model leaves some aspects of the data

unexplained, he leaves open the question of whether his model’s shortcomings

might in fact be shared by all existing models of the monetary business cycle,



                                        6
including those with sticky prices. This paper, therefore, goes a step beyond

Coleman’s by asking: what additional features of the data, if any, can be explained

once sticky prices are introduced into a model of endogenous money?

   Hairault and Portier (1993) and Ellison and Scott (2000) compare the implica-

tions of models with and without sticky prices under the assumption that money

is exogenous. King and Watson (1996), Rotemberg (1996), and Yun (1996) do the

same, while also allowing money to be endogenous. These studies uncover some

of the same strengths and weaknesses of sticky-price models that are documented

here. But, again, none of the models developed in these studies is estimated

with formal econometric techniques and, as a consequence, none can deÞnitively

say whether or not the introduction of sticky prices improves the model’s Þt in

a statistically signiÞcant way. Here, by contrast, the sticky-price model that is

estimated nests a ßexible-price variant as a special case. Thus, the econometric

exercise performed here provides a clean, formal test of the null hypothesis that

prices are fully ßexible against the alternative that prices are sticky. By reporting

the results of such a test, this paper also goes beyond the contributions of Leeper

and Sims (1994), Ireland (1997, 2001a, 2001b), Rotemberg and Woodford (1997),

and Kim (2000), each of which estimates a sticky-price model but stops short of

explicitly comparing the model’s Þt to that of a ßexible-price speciÞcation.


                                         7
   Rotemberg (1982) develops and estimates a model with quadratic costs of nom-

inal price adjustment that represents, as explained below, a direct precursor to

the model used here. Rotemberg also tests the null hypothesis of price ßexibility,

rejecting this null in favor of the alternative that prices are sticky. Rotemberg’s

model includes a very simple demand-side speciÞcation, however, which is elabo-

rated on in the model used here. And, more important, Rotemberg assumes that

money is exogenous, thereby leaving open the question of whether the features

of the data that his sticky-price model explains might also be accounted for by

a model with ßexible prices and endogenous money. Thus, this paper can be

viewed as an extension of Rotemberg’s that tests the null hypothesis of full price

ßexibility after allowing for endogenous money.

   Finally, Roberts, Stockton, and Struckmeyer (1994), Gali and Gertler (1999),

and Sbordone (2002) also extend Rotemberg’s (1982) work by developing and es-

timating models in which prices can either be sticky or ßexible and by testing

for the statistical signiÞcance of parameters measuring the importance of nominal

price rigidity. These studies, however, conÞne their attention to equations gov-

erning the behavior of inßation. Here, the analysis again goes a step further by

considering a more elaborate model with implications for the behavior of money,

interest rates, output, consumption, and investment as well as for inßation.


                                        8
   Thus, monetary economists have long been interested in explaining the corre-

lations between nominal and real variables using models with endogenous money,

price rigidity, or some combination of the two. Past eﬀorts have produced a large

body of literature, to which this paper also contributes.



3. Modeling Strategy

The model used here embeds Rotemberg’s (1982) quadratic speciÞcation for the

costs of nominal price adjustment into a more detailed, dynamic, stochastic, gen-

eral equilibrium model with optimizing households and Þrms and a central bank

that is allowed to systematically adjust the short-term nominal interest rate and

the money growth rate in response to changes in output and inßation. Simi-

lar models appear in Hairault and Portier (1993), Ireland (1997, 2000a, 2001a,

2001b), and Kim (2000); the variant developed here extends those from Ireland

(1997, 2000a, 2001a, 2001b) in two basic ways.

   First, the model developed here builds on those from previous eﬀorts by in-

troducing a more ßexible monetary policy rule that allows the central bank to

use the short-term nominal interest rate, the money growth rate, or any linear

combination of the two as its principal operating instrument and to adjust its

setting for this instrument in response to changes in output and inßation. This

                                        9
more general policy rule nests, as one class of special cases, interest rate rules of

the kind proposed by Taylor (1993), according to which the nominal interest rate

is set as a function of output and inßation. It also nests, as another class of special

cases, money growth rules like those studied by Bryan and Gavin (1994), Finn

(1999), and Gavin and Kydland (1999), which call for the money growth rate to

be set as a function of output. Finally, the general rule nests, as a third class

of special cases, purely exogenous rules for money growth, like those considered

by Rotemberg (1982), Hairault and Portier (1993), and Ellison and Scott (2000).

Thus, this added ßexibility in the theoretical speciÞcation allows the data to de-

cide on the importance of monetary endogeneity, as well as on the exact form of

monetary endogeneity, when the model is estimated via maximum likelihood.

   Second, the model developed here extends those used previously by introducing

shocks to the marginal eﬃciency of investment, like those considered Þrst by

Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huﬀman (1988) and later by Finn (1999). These

investment eﬃciency shocks are included in the model along with four others:

a more conventional productivity shock like the one in Prescott’s (1986) real

business cycle model, a preference shock like the one in McCallum and Nelson

(1999) that enters into the Euler equation linking a representative household’s

consumption growth to the real interest rate, a preference shock like the one in


                                          10
Kim (2000) that acts like a shock to money demand, and a shock to the monetary

policy rule. Here, all Þve shocks are included for the following reason.

   Kimball (1995), King and Watson (1996), Casares and McCallum (2000), and

Kim (2000) all Þnd that the introduction of adjustment costs for physical capital

helps enormously in allowing sticky-price models with optimizing agents match

key features of the data. This Þnding suggests that an adjustment cost para-

meter for physical capital ought to be estimated together with an adjustment

cost parameter for nominal prices in any attempt to quantify the importance of

sticky prices in the US economy. Ireland (2001a), however, discovers that data

on output, money, inßation, and interest rates are insuﬃcient to identify the cap-

ital adjustment cost parameter in a model that is quite similar to the one used

here. Accordingly, this study employs data on both consumption and investment,

as opposed to just output alone, together with data on real money balances, in-

ßation, and the nominal interest rate, to successfully estimate adjustment cost

parameters for both capital and prices.

   Since the maximum likelihood procedure uses data on Þve variables, the model

must include at least Þve exogenous shocks. For with fewer than Þve shocks, the

singularity problem discussed by Ingram, Kocherlakota, and Savin (1994) and

Ireland (2000b) arises: the model counterfactually predicts that certain linear


                                          11
combinations of the observed variables are perfectly deterministic, so that any

attempt to apply maximum likelihood estimation automatically fails. Hence, the

introduction of the investment eﬃciency shock, along with the four others, makes

maximum likelihood estimation feasible and, more speciÞcally, helps sharpen the

estimate of the key nominal price adjustment cost parameter.



4. A Model with Endogenous Money and Sticky Prices

A representative household, a representative Þnished goods-producing Þrm, a con-

tinuum of intermediate goods-producing Þrms indexed by i ∈ [0, 1], and a central

bank operate in an economy in which time periods are indexed by t = 0, 1, 2, ....

Each intermediate goods-producing Þrm produces a distinct, perishable interme-

diate good; hence, intermediate goods are also indexed by i ∈ [0, 1], where Þrm

i produces good i. The model contains enough symmetry, however, to allow the

analysis to focus on the behavior of a representative intermediate goods-producing

Þrm, which produces the generic intermediate good i.

   The representative household carries Mt−1 units of money, Bt−1 bonds, and

kt units of physical capital into period t. At the beginning of the period, the

household receives a lump-sum monetary transfer Tt from the central bank. Next,

the household’s bonds mature, providing Bt−1 additional units of money. The

                                       12
household uses some of this money to purchase Bt new bonds at the cost of 1/rt

units of money per bond, where rt denotes the gross nominal interest rate between

t and t + 1. During period t, the household supplies ht units of labor and kt units

of capital to the various intermediate goods-producing Þrms, receiving Wt ht +Qt kt

units of money in return, where Wt denotes the nominal wage and Qt denotes the

nominal rental rate for capital.

   The household uses its funds to purchase output at the nominal price Pt from

the representative Þnished goods-producing Þrm; the household divides its pur-

chase up into amounts ct and it to be consumed and invested. In order to transform

invested units of the Þnished good into new units of productive capital, the house-

hold must pay an adjustment cost, measured in terms of the Þnished good and

given by
                                        Ã          !2
                                   φk       kt+1
                                                 −1     kt ,
                                   2         kt

where φk ≥ 0 governs the size of the capital adjustment cost and where



                              kt+1 = (1 − δ)kt + xt it .



In this capital accumulation constraint, the depreciation rate satisÞes 1 > δ > 0.

The disturbance xt is Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huﬀman’s (1988) shock to the

                                              13
marginal eﬃciency of investment; it follows the autoregressive process



                                  ln(xt ) = ρx ln(xt−1 ) + εxt ,



where 1 > ρx ≥ 0 and where the zero-mean, serially uncorrelated innovation εxt

is normally distributed with standard deviation σ x .

   At the end of period t, the household receives Dt units of money in the form of

dividend payments from the various intermediate goods-producing Þrms. It then

carries Mt units of money, Bt bonds, and kt+1 units of capital into period t + 1,

subject to the budget constraint

                                                               Ã          !2
Mt−1 + Bt−1 + Tt + Wt ht + Qt kt + Dt           φ                  kt+1               Bt /rt + Mt
                                      ≥ ct +it + k                      −1     kt +               .
                 Pt                              2                  kt                     Pt


   Endowed with one unit of time per period, the representative household acts

to maximize the expected utility function


          ∞
          X t                         (γ−1)/γ      1/γ
      E         β {at [γ/(γ − 1)] ln[ct         + et (Mt /Pt )(γ−1)/γ ] + η ln(1 − ht )},
          t=0




where the discount factor and the weight on leisure satisfy 1 > β > 0 and η > 0.

The preference shock at enters into the Euler equation linking the household’s


                                                 14
consumption growth to the real interest rate; McCallum and Nelson (1999) show

that this type of disturbance resembles, in equilibrium, a shock to the IS curve

in more traditional Keynesian models. And as in Hairault and Portier (1993),

Ireland (1997, 2000a, 2001a), and Kim (2000), the preference parameter γ > 0

measures the absolute value of the interest elasticity of money demand, while the

preference shock et acts like a shock to money demand. Both preference shocks

follow autoregressive processes:



                             ln(at ) = ρa ln(at−1 ) + εat



and

                    ln(et ) = (1 − ρe ) ln(e) + ρe ln(et−1 ) + εet ,


where 1 > ρa ≥ 0, 1 > ρe ≥ 0, and e > 0 and where the zero-mean, serially uncor-

related innovations εat and εet are normally distributed with standard deviations

σ a and σ e .

    The representative Þnished goods-producing Þrm uses yt (i) units of each in-

termediate good i ∈ [0, 1], purchased at the nominal price Pt (i), to produce yt

units of the Þnished good according to the constant-returns-to-scale technology




                                          15
described by
                           ·Z 1                      ¸θ/(θ−1)
                                  yt (i)(θ−1)/θ di              ≥ yt ,
                             0



where θ > 1. The Þrm acts to maximize its proÞts; the Þrst-order conditions for

its problem are

                                  yt (i) = [Pt (i)/Pt ]−θ yt


for all i ∈ [0, 1], implying that −θ measures the constant price elasticity of demand

for each intermediate good. Competition drives the representative Þnished goods-

producing Þrm’s proÞts to zero; this zero-proÞt condition determines Pt as


                                    ·Z 1                  ¸1/(1−θ)
                            Pt =           Pt (i)1−θ di              .
                                       0




   The representative intermediate goods-producing Þrm hires ht (i) units of labor

and kt (i) units of capital from the representative household in order to produce

yt (i) units of intermediate good i according to the constant-returns-to-scale tech-

nology described by

                             kt (i)α [zt ht (i)]1−α ≥ yt (i),


where 1 > α > 0. As in Prescott (1986), the aggregate productivity shock follows




                                              16
the autoregressive process



                     ln(zt ) = (1 − ρz ) ln(z) + ρz ln(zt−1 ) + εzt ,



where 1 > ρz ≥ 0, z > 0, and the zero-mean, serially uncorrelated innovation εzt

is normally distributed with standard deviation σ z .

   Since intermediate goods substitute imperfectly for one another in producing

the Þnished good, the representative intermediate goods-producing Þrm sells its

output in a monopolistically competitive market: during each period t, the Þrm

sets the nominal price Pt (i) for its output, subject to the requirement that it satisfy

the representative Þnished goods-producing Þrm’s demand at that price, taking

the aggregates Pt and yt as given. And as in Rotemberg (1982), the representative

intermediate goods-producing Þrm faces a quadratic cost of adjusting its nominal

price between periods, measured in terms of the Þnished good and given by

                                   "                #2
                                φp Pt (i)

where φp ≥ 0 governs the size of the price adjustment cost and where π measures

the gross steady-state inßation rate. In the special case where φp = 0, the model



                                           17
collapses to a ßexible-price speciÞcation.

   The quadratic cost of price adjustment makes the representative intermediate

goods-producing Þrm’s problem dynamic; instead of maximizing its proÞts period-

by-period, it seeks to maximize its total market value,

where β t λt measures the representative household’s marginal utility of consump-

tion during period t and where Dt (i)/Pt , the real value of the Þrm’s proÞts and

dividend payment during period t, is

                                                                "           #2

   Finally, the central bank conducts monetary policy by adjusting a linear com-

bination of the short-term nominal interest rate rt and the money growth rate

µt = Mt /Mt−1 in response to deviations of output yt and inßation π t = Pt /Pt−1

from their steady-state values, according to the policy rule



          ωr ln(rt /r) − ωµ ln(µt /µ) = ω y ln(yt /y) + ω π ln(π t /π) + ln(vt ),




                                               18
where ωr , ω µ , ωy , and ω π are response coeﬃcients chosen by the central bank and

where r, µ, y, and π are the steady-state values of rt , µt , yt , and π t . The monetary

policy shock vt follows the autoregressive process



                              ln(vt ) = ρv ln(vt−1 ) + εvt ,



where 1 > ρv ≥ 0 and the zero-mean, serially uncorrelated innovation εvt is

normally distributed with standard deviation σ v . As noted above, this policy rule

is considerably more general than those used in previous studies. When ω r > 0,

ω µ = 0, ω y > 0, and ωπ > 0, it becomes a Taylor (1993) rule for increasing the

nominal interest rate in response to higher output or inßation. When ω r = 0,

ω µ > 0, ω y < 0, and ω π = 0, it resembles the policy rules from Bryan and

Gavin (1994), Finn (1999), and Gavin and Kydland (1999), according to which

the central bank increases the money growth rate whenever output rises. Finally,

when ωr = 0, ω µ > 0, ωy = 0, and ω π = 0, it collapses to a purely exogenous,

autoregressive speciÞcation for money growth, like those appearing in Rotemberg

(1982), Hairault and Portier (1993), and Ellison and Scott (2000). Since each

of these special cases sets one or more of the response parameters ω r , ω µ , ω y ,

and ω π equal to zero, it is most convenient to leave each of these parameters



                                           19
unconstrained, pinning down their absolute scale by adopting the normalization

σ v = 0.01. The policy rule thereby remains quite ßexible in terms of the extent

to which and the manner in which it allows money and interest rates to respond

endogenously to shocks that aﬀect output and inßation.

   Pointing out, quite rightly, that the Federal Reserve receives economic data

with a lag, McCallum (1993) criticizes policy-rule speciÞcations like the one orig-

inally proposed by Taylor (1993) and the variant used here, insofar as they call

for an adjustment of the interest rate rt or the money growth rate µt in response

to contemporaneous changes in output yt and inßation π t . An alternative formu-

lation, suggested by McCallum’s critique, adjusts rt or µt in response to expected

changes in output and inßation: Et−1 yt and Et−1 π t . For the purposes of the

present study, however, the rule allowing for a direct response to actual output

and inßation, yt and π t , may be more appropriate. Consider the special case of

the model used here in which φp = 0, so that prices are perfectly ßexible. In this

special case, yt and especially π t jump sharply, immediately, and unexpectedly

when shocks hit the economy; hence, a policy rule that responds only to Et−1 yt

and Et−1 π t severely limits the central bank’s ability to react to those shocks.

Thus, one should recognize that the policy rule used here implicitly assumes that

the central bank can contemporaneously observe and respond to shocks of vari-


                                        20
ous kinds. But again, for the purposes of the present study, this informational

assumption seems at least as reasonable as the assumption that Þrms face costs of

nominal price adjustment. Taken together, therefore, the assumptions embedded

into the model place the ßexible-price (φp = 0) and sticky-price (φp > 0) variants

on equal footing, ex-ante, allowing the data to more convincingly discriminate

between them, ex-post.

   In the model’s symmetric equilibrium, all intermediate goods-producing Þrms

make identical decisions, so that Pt (i) = Pt , yt (i) = yt , ht (i) = ht , kt (i) = kt ,

and Dt (i) = Dt for all i ∈ [0, 1]. In addition, the market-clearing conditions

Mt = Mt−1 + Tt and Bt = Bt−1 = 0 must hold. These conditions, together with

the Þrst-order conditions for the three representative agents’ problems, the laws

of motion for the Þve exogenous shocks, and the central bank’s policy rule, form

a system of nonlinear diﬀerence equations describing the behavior of equilibrium

prices and quantities. This system implies that in the absence of shocks, the

economy converges to a steady state. After the system is log-linearized around its

steady state, the methods of Blanchard and Kahn (1980) yield a solution of the

form

                                  st = Πst−1 + Ωεt




                                           21
and

                                        ft = Ust .


   In the solution, the vector st contains the model’s state variables, which in-

clude the capital stock kt and lagged real balances mt−1 = Mt−1 /Pt−1 as well as

the Þve exogenous shocks at , et , xt , zt , and vt ; lagged real balances enter the state

vector because prices are sticky. The vector εt contains the Þve innovations εat ,

εet , εxt , εzt , and εvt , which are assumed to be mutually uncorrelated as well as

serially uncorrelated. The vector ft contains the model’s ßow variables, which

include consumption ct , investment it , inßation πt , and the nominal interest rate

rt . Finally, the matrices Π, Ω, and U have elements that depend on the parame-

ters describing private agents’ tastes and technologies as well as the parameters

of the central bank’s policy rule. The constraints linking the elements of Π, Ω,

and U to the underlying parameters of the theoretical model cannot be written

in closed form and must instead be derived through numerical implementation of

the Blanchard-Kahn solution procedure.




                                           22
5. Empirical Strategy

The model’s solution takes the form of a state-space econometric model, driven

by the Þve exogenous shocks at , et , xt , zt , and vt . Hence, its parameters may

be estimated via maximum likelihood, using the methods outlined by Hamilton

(1994, Ch.13), with data on as many as Þve variables, while still avoiding the

singularity problem discussed by Ingram, Kocherlakota, and Savin (1994) and

Ireland (2000b). The Þve series used here are those for consumption, investment,

real money balances, inßation, and the short-term nominal interest rate.

   As explained above, data on both consumption and investment are used, rather

than data on output alone, in hopes of obtaining the best possible estimate of the

capital adjustment cost parameter φk . Kimball (1995), King and Watson (1996),

Casares and McCallum (2000), and Kim (2000) all show that capital adjustment

costs interact strongly with nominal price adjustment costs in allowing sticky-

price models with optimizing agents match key features of the data. These studies

therefore imply that data that provide a sharp estimate of the capital adjustment

cost parameter φk will also provide a sharp estimate of the price adjustment cost

parameter φp . And since the sticky-price model developed here collapses to a

ßexible-price speciÞcation when φp = 0, a sharp estimate of φp should, in turn,



                                       23
allow for the most informative test of the null hypothesis, suggested by the strict

endogenous money view, that φp = 0.

   Thus, in the US data, consumption is measured by real personal consump-

tion expenditures, while investment is measured by real gross private domestic

investment. These two series represent the broadest measures of consumption

and investment in the National Income and Product Accounts. Real money bal-

ances are calculated by dividing the M2 money stock by the GDP deßator, and

inßation is calculated as changes in the GDP deßator. Finally, the short-term

nominal interest rate is measured by the three-month Treasury bill rate. All of

these data, except for the interest rate, are seasonally adjusted. The series for

consumption, investment, and real balances are expressed in per-capita terms by

dividing by the civilian noninstitutional population, age 16 and over. The data

are quarterly and run from 1959:1 through 2000:4.

   Several data-related issues must be tackled prior to estimating the model.

First, a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy is widely believed to have

occurred soon after Paul Volker’s appointment as Chairman in August 1979. The

idea that this regime shift worked to alter the correlations between nominal and

real variables in the US data appears both in the literature on endogenous money

(see, for example, Bryan and Gavin 1994 and Gavin and Kydland 1999) and in


                                        24
the literature that emphasizes the importance of sticky prices (see Clarida, Gali,

and Gertler 2000). Thus, to allow for the possibility that the policy parameters

µ, ω r , ω µ , ω y , and ω π change, the full sample period is divided into two disjoint

subsamples, the Þrst running from 1959:1 through 1979:2 and the second running

from 1979:3 through 2000:4. The entire model is estimated with data from each

subsample.

   Second, distinct upward trends appear in the data for consumption, invest-

ment, and real money balances per capita, reßecting the secular growth of the

US economy. The model, by contrast, implies that each of these variables ßuc-

tuates around a constant mean. Ireland (1997) accounts for trends in data for

output and real balances by adding a deterministic trend to the productivity vari-

able zt . The model then implies that all real variables grow at the same rate g

along a balanced growth path, where g may be estimated together with the other

parameters describing tastes and technologies. Here, the use of data on consump-

tion and investment make this approach problematic, since in both subsamples,

investment grows at a distinctly faster rate than consumption. Moreover, the

Federal Reserve’s redeÞnition of its M2 monetary aggregate in 1996, discussed

by Orphanides and Porter (2000), together with the unusual weakness in M2

growth during the early 1990s, discussed by Mehra (1997), introduce diﬀerential


                                          25
trends into the series for real balances as well. More speciÞcally, for the pre-1979

subsample, regressions of the logarithm of each variable on a constant and a time

trend yield slope coeﬃcients of 0.0073 for investment, 0.0055 for consumption, and

0.0046 for real balances. For the post-1979 subsample, the same regressions yield

slope coeﬃcients of 0.0084 for investment, 0.0053 for consumption, and 0.0025

for real balances. Rather than complicating the theoretical model in a way that

explains these apparent departures from balanced growth, the linearly detrended

series are used to estimate the model instead.

   Third, even with data on Þve variables, several of the model’s parameters re-

main unidentiÞed and must therefore be Þxed prior to estimation. The parameter

η, for example, measures the weight on leisure in the representative household’s

utility and cannot be estimated without data on employment; the setting η = 1.5

implies that the household spends about one-third of its time working in the mod-

el’s steady state. The depreciation rate δ cannot be estimated without data on the

capital stock; the setting δ = 0.025 implies an annual depreciation rate of about

10 percent. Finally, the parameter θ, determining the steady-state markup of

price over marginal cost, cannot be estimated without data on wages; the setting

θ = 6 implies a steady-state markup of 20 percent.




                                        26
6. Estimates, Tests, and Diagnostics

Table 1 presents maximum likelihood estimates of the model’s 21 remaining para-

meters for both the pre-1979 subsample running from 1959:1 through 1979:2 and

the post-1979 subsample running from 1979:3 through 2000:4. The standard er-

rors, also shown in table 1, correspond to the square roots of the diagonal elements

of negative one times the inverted matrix of second derivatives of the maximized

log likelihood function.

   Looking Þrst at the parameters describing tastes and technologies, the esti-

mates of the representative household’s discount factor β exceed 0.99 for both

subsamples. The estimates of γ imply an interest elasticity of M2 demand equal

to −0.074 for the pre-1979 period and −0.035 for the post-1979 period. The esti-

mate of α, measuring capital’s share in the production function for intermediate

goods, equals 0.20 for the Þrst subsample and 0.21 for the second subsample.

   Turning next to the parameters of the monetary policy rule, the estimates of

µ translate into annualized, steady-state money growth rates of 4.5 percent before

1979 and 3.6 percent after 1979. The estimates of ω r , ω µ , and ω π are large for both

subsamples, allowing for at least two possible interpretations of Federal Reserve

policy before and after 1979. First, Federal Reserve policy can be described



                                          27
as following a modiÞed Taylor (1993) rule that adjusts the short-term nominal

interest rate in response to deviations of money growth and inßation, instead

of output and inßation, from their steady-state values. Alternatively, Federal

Reserve policy can be characterized as one of Poole’s (1970) ”combination policies”

that adjusts a linear combination of the interest rate and the money growth rate to

achieve a target for inßation. On the other hand, the small estimates of ωy from

both subsamples contradict the endogenous money speciÞcations of Bryan and

Gavin (1994), Finn (1999), and Gavin and Kydland (1999), all of which have the

money growth rate responding directly to changes in output. Note, however, that

these small estimates of ω y need not imply that the endogenous money channel

is unimportant in explaining the correlations between money growth, interest

rates, and output since, to the extent that output is correlated with inßation, the

policy response of money growth and interest rates to inßation will also generate

reduced-form correlations between these variables and output.

   The estimates of e and z allow the steady-state values of real balances and

output in the model to match the average values of detrended real balances and

output in the data. The estimates of ρa , ρe , ρx , ρz , and ρv imply that the model’s

exogenous shocks are quite persistent. And among the estimates of the standard

deviations of the innovations to the shocks, the large estimate of σ x for the post-


                                         28
1979 period deserves special mention: evidently, large investment eﬃciency shocks

help the model explain the investment boom that lifted the ratio of investment

to consumption from 18 percent in 1991:2 to 29 percent in 2000:4.

   Finally, consider the capital and price adjustment cost parameters φk and φp .

The estimates of both parameters rise across subsamples, suggesting the presence

of increased real and nominal rigidity in the post-1979 period, but appear quite

sizeable even for the earlier period. Of special interest here, of course, are tests of

the null hypothesis that φp = 0. In the case where φp = 0, the model collapses to

a ßexible-price speciÞcation; hence, a test of the null that φp = 0 represents a test

of whether sticky prices, over and above endogenous money, are really necessary

in allowing the model to explain the behavior of nominal and real variables in the

US data. Under the null hypothesis that φp = 0, the Wald statistic formed by

squaring the ratio of the point estimate of φp to its standard error is asymptotically

distributed as a chi-square random variable with one degree of freedom. For both

subsamples, in fact, the p-value for the Wald test of φp = 0 is less than 0.05.

   Calculating the standard errors reported in table 1 involves two steps, numer-

ically evaluating the matrix of second derivatives of the maximized log likelihood

function and inverting that large matrix having elements of varying magnitudes,

both of which may introduce approximation error into the Wald statistic described


                                          29
above. Likelihood ratio tests, however, can be performed without reference to the

standard errors and yield, as the useful by-products displayed in table 2, parame-

ter estimates for the ßexible-price model that results when the constraint φp = 0

is imposed. With φp = 0 imposed, the maximized value of the log likelihood

falls from 1466.7 to 1442.4 for the pre-1979 subsample and from 1568.3 to 1521.8

for the post-1979 subsample. Again under the null hypothesis that φp = 0, the

likelihood ratio statistic formed by doubling the diﬀerence between the uncon-

strained and constrained log likelihood functions is asymptotically distributed as

a chi-square random variable with one degree of freedom. Now, for both sub-

samples, the p-value for the likelihood ratio test of φp = 0 is less than 0.01. For

both subsamples, therefore, the introduction of sticky prices yields a statistically

signiÞcant improvement in the model’s ability to Þt the data.

   But precisely which features of the data are explained by the unconstrained

model, with sticky prices, but not by the constrained model, with ßexible prices?

To answer this question, table 3 and Þgures 1-4 present sets of diagnostic sta-

tistics, suggested by McCallum (2001), which assist in evaluating the empirical

performance of each model variant for each subsample of data. Table 3 compares

the standard deviations of four key variables–detrended output (deÞned in both

the model and the data as the sum of detrended consumption and detrended in-


                                        30
vestment), nominal money growth, inßation, and the nominal interest rate–as

implied by each of the estimated models and as seen in the US data. Figures 1-4,

meanwhile, plot the vector autocorrelation functions for the same four variables

in the models and the data. Looking at statistics for aggregate output, instead of

consumption and investment separately, and for nominal money growth, instead

of real money balances, keeps the presentation more concise and also makes the

results easier to interpret: correlations between real output and nominal money

growth, for instance, are more familiar to monetary economists than correlations

between real consumption and real money balances. In both the table and the Þg-

ures, the statistics for the data correspond to those implied by an unconstrained,

fourth-order vector autoregression for detrended output, money growth, inßation,

and the interest rate; Fuhrer and Moore (1995) also use unconstrained vector

autoregressions to summarize the data in this way.

   Table 3, containing the standard deviations, brings to light the same weakness

of the sticky-price model that is emphasized by Ellison and Scott (2000): for

both periods, the sticky-price model overstates the volatility of output. For the

pre-1979 subsample, in fact, the constrained, ßexible-price model comes closer

than the unconstrained, sticky-price model to matching the volatilities of all four

variables. For the second subsample, however, the sticky-price model does better


                                        31
in matching standard deviations from the data, except for the case of output.

   But while table 3 tells a mixed story about the empirical performance of the

sticky-price model, Þgures 1-4 show that the sticky-price model does much better

than the ßexible-price model in matching the correlations between nominal and

real variables at various leads and lags. Comparing Þgures 1 and 3 for the pre-1979

subsample, and comparing Þgures 2 and 4 for the post-1979 subsample, reveals

that the sticky-price model reproduces many more of the correlations, found in

the data, between output and lags of money growth, inßation, and interest rates.

For the pre-1979 period, for example, only the sticky-price model captures what

King and Watson (1996) call the ”inverted leading indicator” property of the

nominal interest rate, as reßected in the negative correlation between output and

lagged interest rates. And for the post-1979 period, only the sticky-price model

comes close to explaining the large positive correlations between output and lagged

money growth rates that appear in the data.

   Surprisingly, perhaps, the ßexible-price model actually does better than the

sticky-price model in reproducing the degree of inßation persistence, as measured

by the correlation of inßation with its own lagged values, found in the pre-1979

data. The ßexible-price model attributes this inßation persistence to persistence

in the exogenous shocks, particularly in the preference shock at . For the post-1979


                                        32
period, however, the inßation persistence implied by the sticky-price model comes

closer to that seen in the data. Thus, while the introduction of sticky prices does

not improve the model’s empirical performance along all dimensions, on balance

it yields a clear improvement in overall Þt.

   But despite these diﬀerences in empirical performance, which lead the data to

clearly prefer the unconstrained, sticky-price model to the constrained, ßexible-

price model, some quantitative implications are shared by both versions of the

model. Tables 4 and 5, for example, break down the variances in detrended

output, money growth, inßation, and the nominal interest rate into orthogonal

components attributed to each of the models’ Þve exogenous shocks. Some of the

results of this variance decomposition diﬀer across models and subsamples. But

for both subsamples, neither the sticky-price model nor the ßexible-price model

attributes more than one percent of the variances of output and the interest rate

to the policy shock vt . Policy shocks do account for nonnegligible fractions of

the variances of money growth and inßation. But looking across results for each

model and each subsample, the percentage of the variances of money growth and

inßation explained by the policy shock never exceeds 40 percent.

   Thus, both the sticky-price model and the ßexible-price model imply that vir-

tually all of the variation in real variables, and most of the variation in nominal


                                        33
variables, found in the postwar US data come from sources other than monetary

policy shocks. Put another way, although the sticky-price model allows nominal

disturbances to have potentially important eﬀects on real variables, the estimates

from that model also imply that monetary policy shocks have played a very small

role in driving business cycles in the postwar US economy. Similar conclusions

emerge from empirical studies, such as Leeper, Sims, and Zha (1996), that use

more conventional vector autoregressions to identify the eﬀects of monetary policy

shocks in the US data; and McCallum (2001) also emphasizes that in theoretical

models like the one used here, the systematic component of monetary policy, as

summarized by settings for the coeﬃcients ω r , ω µ , ω y , and ω π , plays a far more

important role than monetary policy shocks in shaping the dynamic behavior of

key macroeconomic variables. But here, building on these earlier insights, the re-

sults also suggest that the null hypothesis that φp = 0 is rejected, thereby lending

support to the sticky-price model, based mainly on information about the Fed-

eral Reserve’s–and more generally the US economy’s–response to nonmonetary

shocks.

   Finally, Þgures 1-4 illustrate how some of the correlations between nominal

and real variables change across the pre-1979 and post-1979 subsamples. In pre-

1979 data, for example, detrended output is negatively correlated with lagged


                                         34
money growth; in post-1979 data, this correlation becomes positive. And the

negative correlation between output and the lagged interest rate, emphasized as a

key stylized fact in the study by King and Watson (1996), appears here in the pre-

1979 data but not in the post-1979 data. Bryan and Gavin (1994) and Gavin and

Kydland (1999) focus on changing correlations such as these, attributing them

to the shift in monetary policy marked by Paul Volker’s arrival at the Federal

Reserve in August 1979. Here, the parameter estimates from tables 1 and 2 can

be used to test this hypothesis.

   If the changing correlations found in the data primarily reßect changes in

Federal Reserve policy, then instability ought to appear in the estimates of one or

more of the model’s policy parameters µ, ω r , ω µ , ω y , ω π , and ρv . Thus, the Þnal

columns of tables 1 and 2 report the Wald statistic for Andrews and Fair’s (1988)

test for parameter stability in nonlinear econometric models like those estimated

here: this test statistic is formed by squaring the diﬀerence between parameter

estimates across subsamples and dividing the result by the sum of the squares

of the corresponding standard errors. Under the null hypothesis of parameter

stability, this test statistic is asymptotically distributed as a chi-square random

variable with one degree of freedom.

   In both the unconstrained, sticky-price model and the constrained, ßexible-


                                          35
price model, some evidence does appear of a signiÞcant change in the monetary

policy rule across the 1979 breakpoint. Using the estimates from the sticky-price

model, the p-value for the test of the null hypothesis of parameter stability is

less than 0.10 for ω µ and less than 0.05 for ρv . Using the estimates from the

ßexible-price model, the p-value for the test of stability is less than 0.05 for ω µ

and less than 0.10 for ωπ . In general, and broadly consistent with the results from

Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000), it appears that the Federal Reserve has more

aggressively adjusted the interest rate in response to changes in money growth

and inßation in the post-1979 period.

   On the other hand, instability also appears in some of the model’s nonpolicy

parameters. In both the sticky-price and ßexible-price cases, the Wald test deci-

sively rejects the null hypothesis of stability for the discount factor β, the capital

adjustment cost parameter φk , and several of the parameters governing the size

and persistence of the exogenous nonpolicy shocks. Thus, while estimates from

both the sticky-price and ßexible-price models attribute some of the changing cor-

relations between nominal and real variables to shifts in Federal Reserve policy,

those estimates also suggest that other structural changes, unrelated to monetary

policy, have played an important role as well.

7. Conclusion

The maximum likelihood estimates, the formal statistical hypothesis tests, and

the less formal diagnostic procedures described above all indicate that the postwar

US data prefer a model featuring nominal price rigidity to one with purely ßexible

prices. These results obtain despite the fact that both the sticky-price and the

ßexible-price models attribute most of the observed variation in the money growth

rate and the short-term nominal interest rate to the Federal Reserve’s deliberate

policy response to the other, nonmonetary shocks that have hit the economy.

These results, therefore, provide deÞnitive answers to the questions posed at the

outset: evidently, the introduction of nominal price rigidity helps in allowing a

model of endogenous money to account for the correlations between nominal and

real variables found in the postwar US data.

   But while the results do lend empirical support to sticky-price models of the

business cycle, it should also be noted that the maximum likelihood estimates of

the nominal price adjustment cost parameters obtained here, while large and sta-

tistically signiÞcant, are associated with rather sizeable standard errors, indicating

that considerable uncertainty remains about the absolute degree of nominal price

rigidity that is present in the US economy. In addition, although the sticky-price



                                         37
model that is developed here potentially allows monetary policy disturbances to

have large eﬀects on the real economy, the estimated model suggests that, in prac-

tice, such shocks have played a minimal role in driving output ßuctuations over

the postwar period. Thus, these results may also explain why purely real business

cycle models such as Prescott’s (1986) successfully replicate many features of the

postwar American business cycle.

   The empirical results obtained here conÞrm that important changes in the

correlations between nominal and real variables can be found in the US data,

looking across pre-1979 and post-1979 subsamples. Previous studies by Bryan

and Gavin (1994), Gavin and Kydland (1999), and Clarida, Gali, and Gertler

(2000) attribute these changes to the important shift in monetary policy that

is widely believed to have followed the appointment of Paul Volker as Federal

Reserve Chairman and, indeed, the statistical tests from above detect evidence of

instability in the parameters describing Federal Reserve policy before and after

1979. On the other hand, the same tests also detect evidence of instability in

the some of the model’s other parameters, describing private agents’ tastes and

technologies as well as the size and persistence of nonmonetary shocks.

   Thus, the theoretical and empirical analyses conducted here suggest that im-

portant structural changes have taken place in the US economy since 1979–


                                       38
changes that go beyond a shift in the way that monetary policy is conducted.

Identifying the source of these structural changes, and understanding their full

impact on the performance of the American economy, remain outstanding tasks

for future research.
