           INTERTENPORAL DEPENDENCE, IMPATIENCE, AND DYNAMICS


                                   ABSTRACT



This paper develops simple geometric methods for analyzing dynamic

behavior in models with intertemporally dependent consumer tastes.

Since the preferences studied do not assume time—additivity, they

allow the marginal utility of consumption on a given date to vary

with consumption on other dates.     Intertemporal dependence is induced

by the presence of a variable individual rate of time preference.

The optimal consumption responses to transitory and anticipated

changes in incomes and interest rates are easily derived and are

similar in important ways to the responses implied by the standard

model with constant time preference.     Intuitive explanations of the

first—order conditions describing optimal paths are provided.

1. Introduction

      This paper develops simple geometric methods for analyzing

dynamic models with intertemporally dependent consumer tastes. One

appealing feature      of   such preferences              is    that    they relax      the

widely used but restrictive assumption of time-additivity, thereby

allowing the marginal utility of consumption on a given date to

vary with consumption on other dates. Intertemporal dependence is

introduced through the presence of a variable individual rate of

time preference. This type of preference setup was introduced by

Uzawa (1968), and it has recently been extended and clarified by

Epstein (1987a).1

      Mathematical convenience,         rather than innate plausibility,

has   always been the main rationale                for        assuming time-additive

preferences    in economic modeling.           A growing body of empirical

evidence suggests, however, that the assumption of intertemporal

independence     may   be    inadequate        in     practice,            even   as     an

approximation.    Tests     of   the        stochastic           intertemporal        Euler

equations     implied by    recursive        time-additive             preferences     have

typically produced strong statistical rejections, leading a number

of researchers to posit some form of intertemporal dependence in

tastes (see, for example, Dunn and Singleton 1986, Hayashi 1985,

11n Obstfeld (1982), 1 applied Uzawa preferences to study a small
open   economy's    response   to   a   permanent,   unanticipated
terms-of-trade shock. Further applications include Nairay's (1984)
proof that an individual optimum exists,                        and Bergman's        (1985)
study of capital-asset pricing in a stochastic environment.
Uzawa-Epstein preferences fall into the broader category of
general recursive preferences, as defined by Koopmans (1986).
Lucas and Stokey (1984) and Epstein (1987b) study the stability of
steady states under quite general recursive preferences. Epstein
and Hynes (1983) examine some well-known dynamic economic models
using a particular specification of recursive utility. Judd (1985)
uses a preference specification that includes Epstein's (1987a) as
a special case, but his focus is on steady-state results. Becker,
Boyd, and Sung (1989) provide a general existence theorem for
recursive-preference problems of the type explored below.

and Heaton 1988).           Intertemporal dependence has been invoked to

help explain phenomena as                diverse     as        the high return to        U.S.

equity investments over the last century (Constantinides 1988) and

drug     addiction         (Becker     and    Murphy       1988).     Finally,     certain

implications of time-additive preferences seem to clash with the

cross-sectional patterns of consumption and income growth actually

observed in the world economy (Sununers and Carroll 1989)!

        In a deterministic setting with a fixed number of competitive

infinitely-lived households,              constant time-preference rates fail

to produce a determinate steady state in which all households have

positive net worth and consumption (Becker 1980). Translated to a

world of       small      open economies,         each inhabited by an immortal

representative decision-maker, the result implies either that the

long-run global distribution of wealth is indeterminate,                           or that

the economy with the lowest time-preference rate (if one exists)

eventually comes to own all the world's outside wealth. Whether

these    stark      and    (for   some    purposes)        analytically       inconvenient

implications are reasonable               is essentially an empirical matter.

They     can   be      avoided    by     assuming         an    overlapping-generations

structure      with       disconnected       cohort budget          constraints,    or    by

introducing income uncertainty.                   In at least        some   applications,

however, such modifications may complicate analysis considerably

while being economically beside the point.2

        Despite     the     strong     empirical     and        theoretical    cases      for

21n a nonmonetary open-economy setting, Buiter (1981) shows that
models with finite overlapping lifetimes can produce a unique,
nondegenerate long-run distribution of wealth between countries.
Weil (1989) observes that Buiter's result survives generalization
to   a  world in which     new   infinitely-lived households   are
continually born, provided the new households are not linked
altruistically to existing ones.     Clarida (1989)   examines the
stationary distribution of wealth in a stochastic model with
possibly different fixed national rates of time preference.

dispensing    with      constant     time-preference                  rates,     convenient

analytical    methods    for     studying      alternative             models     have    not

entered into general use. Important stability results for models

with endogenous discounting have been established, but these say

little or nothing about the effects on optimal consumption plans

of   a wide variety of common economic                  events.          Readers    of    the

literature in this area often are left with the impression that

the models studied are both analytically intractable and based on

restrictive assumptions
                            .

      Contraryto this impression, however, the dynamic behavior
implied by variable        time    preference         is     easy       to     analyze    and

interpret in many cases of interest.                  This paper supports                this

claim in two ways. First,          it offers an intuitive account of the

Uzawa-Epstein model,       one    that   stresses          the    sense        in which it
generalizes the standard intertemporal preference model.                            Second,

it develops the simple diagrammatic machinery needed to study how

such models respond to rather complicated disturbances, such as

transitory movements in fiscal variables or interest rates. Models

of endogenous time preference are no more difficult to analyze

than models of habit-forming consumption. Indeed, endogenous time

preference can be viewed as a particular special case of habit

formation.

      From a formal point of view,             the main dynamic complication

due to endogenous time preference is the nontrivial influence of

an additional    costate variable            equal,    at        an    optimum,     to    the

maximized lifetime utility function.              The       extra costate           can be
eliminated in interesting special cases, however;                            and even when

3Thus, Blanchard and Fischer (1989, p. 75) warn students that
endogenous time-preference models of the Uzawa variety are 'not
recommended    for general use."

this   is     impossible,          it may be             quite easy       to    account       for     its

effects.      The behavior implied by endogenous time preference                                       is

often strikingly similar, at least in quLalitative terms,                                     to that

implied by the standard model.                       The main difference seems to be

that    the    sometimes           troublesome            nonconvergence         and        hysteresis

implied by constant time preference disappear.

       The    paper        is     organized         as     follows.       Section       2     analyzes

individual      optimization            in     an        economy     with      discrete           trading

periods,       starting           out    with        a     two-period          model        and      then

generalizing         to    an     infinite          horizon.       Particular       attention          is

paid to the effect on time preference of current consumption. The

intuition gained in section                     2    is    applied in section                3,     which

describes       a      continuous-time               formulation          more      amenable           to

diagrammatic methods. Section 4, which is the heart of the paper,

explores       the     geometry         of     the        system     of     dynamic         necessary

optimality conditions derived in section 3. This geometry is used

to derive the individual's responses to exogenous changes in the

parameters of the maximization problem. Section 5 presents a final

application,         to the problem of optimal capital accumulation in a

closed economy.



2. A Discrete-Time Formulation

       It is useful to begin with a discrete-time formulation of the

Uzawa-Epstein         approach          to    modeling          intertemporally             dependent

preferences. The goal of this prologue is primarily expository. A

discrete-time         exposition             clarifies         (i)    the      nature        of      time

preference;         (ii)    the    role      of certain regularity conditions                          in

assuring existence and uniqueness of optima; and (iii) the meaning

of the first-order necessary conditions for optimality that arise

in the continuous-time case.

      Until     section          5,       which    studies          neoclassical      growth,           the

exposition      is    phrased             in   terms      of        an   individual        consumer's

maximization problem. The analysis applies equally well, however,

to a small open economy facing a given world interest rate, or to

a closed economy in which the marginal product of capital is                                              a

technological constant.



2.1. A Two-Period Model

      The     simplest         case       arises     when       a    consumer      lives     for        two

periods and maximizes the lifetime utility from consumption,


(1)    U(c1,c2) —         u(c1)       +   u(c2)exp[-0(c1)].

Maximization         is        carried         out       over        nonnegative      consumption

levels, subject           to     the lifetime            budget constraint


(2)    c1 +    c2exp(-r)          a1,


in which r      is    the instantaneous real interest rate and a1                                       the

consumer's total real wealth at the start of period 1.

      The consumer discounts second-period felicity by the factor

exp[-0(c1)],         which        is        allowed       to        depend    on     first-period

consumption.4        In    the        usual       time-additive          setup,     0(c)    =      0,     a

constant,     so the discount factor for future felicities u(c) does

not depend on consumption choices.

      Provided U(c1,c2) satisfies regularity conditions,                                    a unique


The discussion follows the convention of Arrow and Kurz (1970) in
referring to the subutility functions u(c) appearing in (1) as
felicities. In contrast, the term "utility" always refers to the
consumer's intertemporal objective.

interior      solution         to    the     consumer's            problem       exists       and     is

characterized by the familiar marginal equalities emphasized by

Irving       Fisher        (1930).     Consistent           with        the     infinite-horizon

perspective          adopted    later,       regularity            of    the    lifetime        utility

function        is      achieved       through           conditions            imposed        on     the

building-block functions u(c) and 0(c).5

       First,        there are some standard assumptions.                         Both u(c)          and

0(c)   are     assumed to be           twice continuously differentiable.                            The

discount rate 0(c)             is taken to be strictly positive [0(c) >                              0].
And u(c)      is required to be strictly increasing                             [u' (c)   >    0]    and

strictly concave [u"(c) <

       In    addition,        some    more    specialized conditions--which                          are

obviously        much       stronger       than        necessary- -      suffice     to        deliver

Fisher's      intertemporal optimum.                   One possible set of sufficient

conditions consists of the following inequalities:



(3)      0"(c)        0;



(4)      u'(c1) —      0'(c1)u(c2)exp[-0(c1)]               > 0,        V c1, c2;



(5)      u(c)u"(c) — u' (c)2           0.




Condition       (3)     requires     0(c)     to       be   concave.          Condition       (4)    (as

shown in a moment) is the requirement that lifetime utility rise

with     first-period          consumption.            Finally,         condition     (5),         which

5As will be apparent, some of these conditions are cardinal in
nature. All predictions of the model, however, are invariant with
respect  to   affine  transformations  of  the  lifetime  utility
function.
6Appropriate          Inada conditions            can be      used        to    assure        interior
solutions.


                                                   6
restricts u(c) to be negative,



(6)      u(c)<O


states that log[-u(c)J                 is     a convex function of consumption.

        The       role     of    these       assumptions           is    best         appreciated       by

examining first- and second-order conditions for an optimum. Let

      be the Lagrange multiplier attached to constraint (2). Then the

first-order conditions are



(7)      U1(c1,c2) — u' (c1) — 0' (c1)u(c2)exp[-0(c1)]
                                                                                  —



(8)      U2(c1,c2) =         u'(c2)exp[-0(c1)J             —   )1exp(-r).


Equation           (7)      equates          the        marginal         utility        of         initial

consumption--a positive number, by (4)--to the shadow price of
wealth                   Importantly,         the        marginal        utility         of
              l                                                                                    initial

consumption is the sum of two components:                                first,       the additional

first-period felicity from an increase                              in    c1,     and second,          the

resulting          change       in     the     discounted          value        of     second-period

felicity.         (The second component would disappear with a constant

discount factor,            0' (c)      0). Equation (8) has the marginal present

utility of consumption falling over time at rate r.

        Under the assumptions already made,                              the utility function

U(c1,c2) is strictly concave:



       U11        u"(c1) +      [(0'   (c1)2 —      0"(c1)]u(c2)exp[-0(c1)}               <   0;


       U22        u"(c2)exp[-0(c1)J < 0;


                                                    7
              —         — u"(c1)u"(c2)exp[-8(c1)J

                          + 0' (c1)2[u(c2)u"(c2) —          u' (c2)2jexp(-20(c1)J

                          —    8"(c1)u"(c2)u(c2)exp[-28(c1)J            > 0.



The consumer's choice problem therefore has                      the unique optimum

shown at point A in figure 1, where (2) holds as an equality.



2.2. The Rate of Time Preference

      So far, no direct stand has been taken on the sign of the

derivative    8'(c),     that    is,       on    the   question    of    how     initial

consumption       influences    the    discount        factor    applied    to    future

felicity. A closely related question asks how the rate of time

preference changes as consumption changes; but the two questions

are not the same in general. Figure 1 is useful in illustrating

the distinction.

      Conditions (7) and (8) together equate the marginal rate of

substitution of future          for present consumption to                 the   inverse

market discount factor:



      MRS(c1,c2)       U1(c1,c2)/U2(c1,c2)             exp(r).



The pure subjective rate of time preference can be defined as the

natural logarithm of this marginal rate                   of substitution for          a

contours of an individual whose time-preference rate rises with

consumption.                  The       interpretation               is       that           the        individual's

impatience to consume increases as actual consumption rises.

           What         determines              whether         time          preference                rises    with

consumption, as in the figure, or falls? Define the elasticities

rate is necessarily decreasing in consumption. But if 0' (c) > 0,

                                                                                                           u' by a
the time preference rate can rise or (if                                           e9,       exceeds

sufficiently large amount) fall as consumption rises. Intuitively,

if 8' (c) falls very rapidly relative to u' (c) as c rises, U1(c,c)

can fall toward u1(c,c) so quickly that future consumption becomes

more valuable, at the margin, relative to present.

           There is considerable disagreement over whether impatience to

consume should increase or decrease as actual consumption rises.

Koopmans (1986, pp. 94-95) suggests that a majority of economists

would make               an     introspective             argument            in    favor          of    decreasing

impatience;              while Epstein (1987a,                      pp.   73-74),            who surveys         the

debate on this issue, offers several counter-arguments. Lucas and

Stokey               (1984)     point           out     that          something              like        increasing

Figure 1; Optimal consumption with a variable time preference rate
impatience- -a sort of diminishing private returns                                     to saving- - is

needed       to     produce    unique,        stable,          nondegenerate            steady-state

wealth distributions in a deterministic infinite-horizon setting.8

        In    the    present       two-period           setting,       none       of    the     results

derived       above       requires     assumptions             about     the      slopes        of    the

time-preference              function        10gMRS(c,c)               or      the           subjective

discount-rate function 0(c).                 (It is true, however, that if 0'(c) <

0     and    9(c)    is    concave,        9(c)        turns    negative       at       some     finite

consumption level.)

        Matters are different once the consumer's horizon is extended

indefinitely (as will become evident in section 4). In that case

the     assumption        9' (c)   >   0    is     necessary       for        stability         of    the

long-run optimal consumption plan (and indeed, it may be necessary

for the existence of an individual optimum). While the rate of

time preference            still need not equal                  9(c),      the        two    rates    do

coincide in the steady state. Since it is necessary for stability,

the condition


(11)         9' (c) > 0



will generally be imposed from now on, although further arguments

in favor of this choice will be introduced                          in      context.

        Probably       the    best     way        of     appreciating          the       meaning      of

inequality (11) is to look at the cross-partial derivative of the

utility function,


(12)        U12(c1,c2) — — 9' (c1)u' (c2)exp[-9(c1)J

8Svensson  and Razin (1983) recognize a related point in the
setting of a small open economy, but they do not regard it as a
compelling argument in favor of a time preference rate that rises
with consumption.


                                                  10
If 6' (c) > 0, U12 is negative and consumptions in the two periods

are Edgeworth substitutes: higher consumption in period 1,                                say,

lowers the marginal utility of period-2 consumption by raising the

discount         rate       for          second-period          felicity.          Edgeworth

substitutability is behind the infinite-horizon stability result

mentioned        above.     The    wealth           accumulation     process       converges

when    6' (c)   >    0   because,       as    wealth       and consumption rise,            the

marginal private return to further saving, which depends on the

marginal utility of future consumption, falls.

       If 9' (c) < 0, however, consumptions in different periods are

Edgeworth complements,             not substitutes,            and   a   rise    in present

consumption raises          the marginal utility of future consumption.

An     intertemporal        complementarity             assumption       might     well      be

plausible in a model where goods are habit forming, but it seems

rather unlikely applied to consumption in general.                               This   is    an

additional, introspective argument in favor of the assumption that

the    subjective         discounting          of     future    felicity        rises     with

consumption.         As   argued     in       the    next    subsection,    the     argument

becomes even more compelling in an infinite-horizon setting.



2.3. The Infinite-Horizon Case

       For   a    consumer        with    an        infinite   planning     horizon,         the

analogue of utility function (1) is



(13)     U(C1) Xu(ct)exP[;E16(cs)},


which is maximized subject to the constraint




                                                11
(14)         cexp[r.(t-1)]            a1.


In (13),      C1 stands for the consumption path c1,                      c2,    c3           To

ensure convergence of the sum (13),                    the conditions that u(c) be

bounded below and that 0(c)                 be bounded away from zero can be

assumed (Epstein 1987a, p. 75).

       Introducing again the Lagrange multiplier A1, one obtains the

first-order necessary conditions



(15)     u'(c)exp[E10(c5)] —            O'(c)          u(c)exp[-E10(c5)]
                                                  v—t+l

                                                          —   A1exp[-r.(t-1)],          Vt    1.



The conditions in (15) are completely analogous to                              (7)   and (8),

and    they have       the    same    interpretation.          The   present marginal

utility due to an increase in consumption on date t equals the

marginal felicity that results, plus the induced effects on the

weights attached to felicities accruing after date t.                            (Naturally,

this total is subjectively discounted to date 1.) As before, the

marginal utility of consumption is planned to fall at rate r.

       For    future     reference,         it    is   helpful       to    introduce         two

definitions.      Denote        the    current-value           marginal         utility       of

consumption by


                        t-1
(16)         — A1exp[    E10(c5) —    r.(t-l)],

and the current value of utility from date t+l onward by




                                             12
(17)
             -           u(c)exp[E0(c5)].
                 vt+l


With the help of these definitions, (15) can be rewritten as



(18)      u' (Ct)    —   0' (ct)t —



which     expresses       (15)        in    current-value     terms.    The   multiperiod

analogue of (4),



(19)      u' (ct)        0' (ct)t          0     V t, C1,



is assumed from now on.

        Before       going       on        to    pursue     dynamic     analysis   in   a

continuous-time framework,                     it is useful to look briefly at the
implications of (13) about the complementarity/substitutability of

consumption in different periods. The cross-partial derivative of

U(C1) with respect to consumption on two dates t and v is


                                                                  v-i
       Utv(C1)      — — 0' (ct)[u' (cv) —          ' (c)]exp[-E10(c)]

Given assumption (19),                the condition 0' (c)      > 0 is necessary and

sufficient for consuznptions on different dates                         to be Edgeworth
substitutes.         Further, the expression above suggests that as v —                 t
9 , the cross-partial's current value goes to zero (at least for
consumption paths bounded away from zero).

       The utility specification with 0' (c)                   > 0 therefore has the

intuitive implication that consumption on any given date lowers




                                                  13
the marginal utility of consumption on successive dates, but with

a strength that declines as those dates become more distant. The

implication seems                       most attractive when decision intervals                          are

short, because it                       is     then more likely that a higher level of
consumption            in       one           period      lowers        the    marginal    utility      from

consuming in the next.



3. The Model in Continuous Time

        A continuous-time formulation of the model greatly eases the

study         of       its              dynamic           behavior.           Differential     equations

describing         first-order                  necessary         conditions       are     derived below
using optimal control theory, and in a way that brings out the

analogy        between              the        present         model      and     other     models      with

time-nonseparabilities.



3.1. First-Order Conditions

        To     place        the          model       in    a     form     amenable    to     solution    by

optimal-control methods, assume that the                                      consumer maximizes



(20)         U[C(0)J            fu[c(t)]exp{-f O[c(s)]ds)dt
                                0


subject to



(21)         (t)   —   ra(t)            —    c(t),         a(0) > 0 given.9



In (20),       C[(0)]           is a (piecewise differentiable) consumption path

originating at              t       —    0.    Define the cumulated "excess" subjective


91t is assumed that the implicit constraint a(t)                                           0 never binds
at an optimum.



                                                            14
discount rate10 by



(22)     8(t)       5(G[c(s)J —    r}ds.


Then    the     consumer's   problem         can        be     given     the   alternative

formulation: maximize




(23)   IJ[C(0)] —    5u[c(t)]exp[-8(t)]exp(-rt)dt


subject to (21) and



(24)    (t) = G[c(t)] — r,                8(0)      0.




       Since the felicity function u(c)exp(-8)                     is strictly concave

in c and e under the assumptions made in the last section,                             the

above problem is of the same general form as some others in which

marginal consumption utilities are intertemporally dependent, for

example,      the   addiction problem analyzed by                   Becker     and Murphy

(1988). The essential feature of the latter model is that felicity

directly depends on a stock variable whose rate of accumulation

depends,      in turn, on consumption of some of the available goods.

Here    the     relevant   stock     is     8,     an        indicator    of   accumulated

impatience.

10tJzawa (1968) uses a similar transformation to change variables
from t to a cumulated time-preference measure in equations (20)
and (21);   he   then analyzes the individual's optimal-control
problem as one involving a single state variable, assets. As
pointed out by Kompas and Abdel-Razeq (1987), however, this
procedure is    invalid when the transition equation      (21)   is
nonautonomous. Since I will want to study anticipated disturbances
below, and these shift equation (21) over time, a more general
solution approach involving the two state variables a(t) and e(t)
is used below.

                                            15
        Necessary          conditions               for        an     optimum         are     derived       by

introducing the costate variables, (t) and (t), and the current-

value Hamiltonian



(25)         H[c(t),a(t),8(t),(t),(t)] —                            u[c(t)]exp(-8(t)}

                                         + (t)[ra(t) —                c(t)J    —   (t)(6[c(t)J       —    r}.

The conditions can be expressed as



       ii'    [c(t)Jexp[-8(t)J           — 6' [c(t)J(t) —



       (t)      — 0,



       (t) -        r(t)       —   u[c(t)Jexp[-8(t)J.

(See Arrow and Kurz 1970,                         pp.    48-49.)            To simplify the dynamic

analysis, it is convenient to rescale the costate variables so as

to     eliminate          8(t)      from          the         above        equations.       Let    q(t)

(t)exp[8(t)J             and       (t)     —        (t)exp[8(t)J.              Then     the       necessary
conditions take the form



(26)         u' [c(t)J — 6' [c(t)J(t) —                       q(t),

(27)         4(t)   —   q(t)(6[c(t)J          —    r},

(28)     (t) —          6[c(t)J(t)        —    u[c(t)J.

       Notice that when (t) converges                                 to    some definite long-run

in     words,    (t)--just               as    in    equation             (17)--is       the    discounted

present value of the future felicity stream from the standpoint of

time     t.     Since         the       costate      transition            equation         (27)      is    the

continuous-time version of (16),                           (29) implies that condition (26)

above has the same basic interpretation as did (18),                                           to which it

is formally identical.

        The interpretation is as follows. Consider the term

                                                                 t
                                          t

on the left-hand side of (26). If U[C(t)] is the lifetime utility

function maximized at time t,                         the preceding expression measures

the     increase         in    U[C(t)]            caused     by       a    small        increase      in    the

consumption path at and near                          its    starting point- - a               generalized

notion of        the marginal utility                       of       consumption at            time    t.    In

technical terms,               the relevant notion of derivative here                                 is    the

Volterra derivative of U[C(t)} with respect                                        to    c(t),11 denoted

Dv(U[C(t)],c(t)}.              Just as            the marginal felicity of consumption

rises at rate            B    —     r    in   the    standard model,               here     the Volterra

derivative of utility with respect to initial consumption rises at

rate 9[c(t)] —           r.

  See Epstein and Hynes                       (1983)     and Epstein (1987). An early
application of Volterra                           derivatives to   intertemporal choice
problems is Wan (1970).

3.2. The Role of the Time-Preference Rate

        The quantity


(30)      D(u[c(t)],c(tflexp[-e(t) —                      rt]    —



                                         u'[c(t)]     —    9'[c(t)](t)        exp[-e(t) —       rt],

which     is       the   t    —   0    present value            (in utility terms)            of     the

left-hand side of (26), measures the increase in U[C(0)] due to an

upward perturbation of the consumption path at time t                                    0.     It is

the Volterra derivative Dv(U[C(O)] ,c(t)).

        Expression (30)               can be used to calculate the rate of time
preference          in   this continuous-time model.                    In analogy with the
definition adopted in section 2,                      it is reasonable to associate a

time-preference rate with the rate of decrease in the marginal

utility of consumption along a locally constant consumption path.

Clearly, the rate of time preference associated with any locally

constant c(t) on a consumption path C(0) generally will vary with

c(t) (as before), as well as with subsequent consumption on C(0).

        Epstein and Hynes               (1983)   and Epstein            (1987a)    suggest this

local    approach            to   defining time preference.'2 They consider                            a

consumption path C(0) and a point c(t) on it such that (t)                                           0.

The rate of time preference at that point, denoted p,                                 is (minus)

the logarithmic time derivative of


        p —    —   —. logD(U[C(0)],c(t))I.()Ø.

Application of this formula and of                              (28)   to   (30)   shows      that    p


'21n contrast, Koopmans'   (1986)                     definition assumes             a     globally
constant consumption path.

depends only on c(t) and


(31)            p =   p(c,)        -   O(c){l   +
                                                                                     O'(c)}       >0.


In     a       stationary state with constant consumption ,                                               =

u(a)/O(),              50 (31) implies that p(c,)                           0(c) in this case. More

generally,             however,          (31)    shows         that     the      time-preference               rate

exceeds the discount rate 0(c) when consumption is rising toward a

stationary state, and is below the discount rate in the opposite

case.14 Formally, equation (30)                            shows why this is                    so:    a rise in

the rate of increase of                         S,     other things              the    same,         causes    the

marginal utility of consumption to fall more quickly over time.

This property of the model captures some of the intuition behind

the        "introspective"              finding that people with lower consumption

levels discount the future more heavily.

           By     combining            equations          (26)-(28),            we     obtain         a   dynamic

equation              for        consumption          that        clarifies          the        role      of    the

time-preference rate defined above. Time-differentiation of (26)

shows that [u"(c) —                    0"(c).]c       —   0'(c)            4.    Use    (28)      to eliminate

      and       (27)        to    eliminate      4;       then apply            (26)       to    eliminate       q.


After some manipulation, the solution for                                       that emerges is


(32)
                  -    [u'(c)
                       [u"(c) —
                                   -   8'(c)} [p(c                -   r]
which           states       that      consumption           is       optimally        falling when             the


13Explicit time-indexation is dropped from now on except when there
is a risk of confusion.
14
     Notice that although (31) has been calculated along a path with
           -




locally constant consumption, the formula can be applied to any
path. The function p(c,4) simply measures the rate at which
marginal utility would fall with time, given c and ,   c were to                                  if
remain momentarily fixed.


                                                          19
time-preference                rate       exceeds          the    interest       rate,     rising          in     the

opposite case, but stationary when c                                    c and


           p(c,)      —        r     —    0(c).

Of course, when 0(c) is a constant 0,                                  (32) reduces to the familiar
     —   [u'(c)/u"(c)](O             —    r).
          One final characterization of an optimal program is noted.

Denote       by     V[a(O)]              the    maximized              value    of      (23)        (under        the

constraints).             If       the     optimal          costate (O) has               the        convergent

representation given in (29), then the value function V[a(O)] and

(O) are the equal. Furthermore, by analogy with standard results,

we       would expect              that     V[a(O)]          is    differentiable          and           that     its

derivative         satisfies              V' [a(O)]         —     Dv(U[C(O)]     ,c(O))        =    u'   [c(O)]     —

V[a(O)]0'        [c(O)]        for        the     optimal          consumption          path.        Since        the

foregoing          relationships will continue to hold for t > 0,                                               (26)

and (28) imply that



          V' [a(t)]i(t) -                q(t)i(t)      -    0[c(t)] V[a(t)]           -   u[c(t)]
                                                                         L
                                                                                          O[c(t)]

An analogous          expression holds                       in    the       constant     time-preference

model.      It    implies that the value of saving                                   (in utility terms)

equals      the     annuity              flow     of   the        discrepancy between maximized

utility      and      the          utility        obtained by maintaining                          the    current

consumption          level           permanently.                The     "interest        rate"          used     to

calculate this flow is the subjective discount rate.15

3.3. Relationship to Uzawa's (1968) Formulation

       It is easily shown that intertemporal preferences of the form

suggested by Uzawa (1968) are within the class studied by Epstein

(1987a). The basic argument follows quite closely one that Nairay

(1984) used to prove that the Uzawa problem has a solution.

       TJzawa assumed that utility is given by                  the   functional



(33)     U[C(O)] =      $u[c(t)]exp(-        0[c(s)]ds)dt,
                        0


where 0(c)       8(u(c)) for some function 8:(R            - R.       The functions u(c)

and 8(u) are assumed to satisfy the restrictions


(34)     u(0)     0,        u(c) > 0,       u'(c) >0,          u"(c) < 0,



(35)     8(u) > 0,          8' (u) > 0,      8"(u) > 0,         8(u) — u8' (u) > 0.


Notice    that    the       discount      rate    is   increasing       in     consumption,

because 0' (c)         8' [u(c)]u' (c) > 0        [see (11)]. To obtain Epstein's

formulation, one must add to Uzawa's conditions (34) and (35) the

requirement      that       0(c)   be      concave,     0"(c)          6' [u(c)]u"(c)     +

8"[u(c)]u'(c)2         0.

       Under the preceding specification,                 it    is easy to see that

u(c)/0(c) =      u(c)/8[u(c)]      is strictly increasing in c but remains

bounded as c 4 , even if u(c) doesn't.'6 Define -y                       suptu(c)/0(c))
                                                                         c>O

and use this definition to create a new felicity function, u(c) —

u(c) — iO(c).

16Under (35), one can always find a linear function a + bu, a   0,
b > 0, such that 8(u)     a + bu for u       Then u/8(u)    u/(a +
                                                  , limu/(a
                                          0.
bu), so even if limu(e) —                         + bu) —   1/b
lim,u/8(u).

                                             21
            The point of defining u(c) is that



        U[C(O)]
                       - f u[c(t)]exp(-f           O[c(s)Jds)dt - U[C(O)] -
                         0


so maximization of U[C(O)] leads to the same optimal consumption

path        as   maximization             of   U[C(O)].     However,          u(c)     not      only       is

negative [see (6)],              it also is increasing and strictly concave in

c.11 Thus u(c) satisfies conditions sufficient to yield Epstein's

formulation,           with the possible exception of log-convexity                                    [see

(5)]. Log-convexity is not, however,                             an essential property for
most purposes.



4. The Geometry of Dynamic Adjustment

        The dynamics implied by an optimal plan can be described in

terms of three variables. Two of these,                              consumption and wealth,
are         present     in      the       standard       time-additive              setup.      In     the

time-nonadditive case, however, it is also necessary to keep track

of the present discounted value of future utility,                                         since     that

variable influences the marginal utility of current consumption.

        This     section         analyzes         the     properties          of     the     resulting

three-variable dynai4c system. It is useful to analyze first a

two-variable subsystem of the full system within which the full

system's essential properties are apparent. The extension to three

dimensions        is    then straightforward.                   Concluding the          section are

"Proof: u'(c) —              u'(c)    —   O'(c)    —    u'(c)(l      —   8'[u(c)])         and u"(c) —
u"(c) — iO"(c) — — 8"[u(c) ]u'                           (c)2    +       u"(c) (1
                                                                         —     [u(c)       8'          J
Therefore, by (34) and (35), u'(c)                       >0 and u"(c) < 0 if 1 —                 8'(u)
> 0 Vu. To establish this last inequality, observe that by (35),                                           1

> [u/8(u)]8'(u) Vu; but since 8(u) >0, 1 >                                 [limuu/S(u)JS'(u)               —

4.1 Dynamics    of   Lifetime Utility and Consumption

       The dynamic    behavior        of optimal plans is described by three

equations,    (21),    (28),    and (32).        They are reproduced below for

easy reference:



(21)     'ra—c

(28)         9(c) — u(c)


(32)
              [u' (c) —   9' (c)J                 -    r].
              [u"(c) —    9"(c)4]

Three-variable systems typically are difficult to analyze. That

this will not be the case here                   is    due     to    the block-recursive

nature of the equations of motion. Assets a enter the system only

through equation (21); (28) and (32) form a separate subsystem in

  and c.     Thus, while consumption drives asset accumulation,                           the

level of assets affects lifetime utility and consumption only by

determining the initial optimal choices of those variables, Once

these initial choices are made,                  and c evolve autonomously.

        Figures 2 and 3 show two possible configurations of the phase

diagram described by equations               (28)      and     (32).      Along the      —   0

schedule,    future     lifetime utility equals                     the   current felicity

level    divided by       the   current       subjective            discount   rate:         =

u(c)/9(c).     Along the          —    0   schedule,         the     time preference and

interest rates        coincide:       p(c,) —         r.     The    shape of the       latter

schedule is derived by observing that

is reversed.

        The two possible patterns of dynamics in the figures reflect

the ambiguity in the sign of p1— 8p/8c. As in the two-period model

of section 2, the sign depends on that of
                                                                           u' —                   Specifically,

formulation does enrich the class of behaviors consistent with the

endogenous time-preference model.

        In either case,               the stationary state A                            is    a    saddlepoint.

Lifetime utility and consumption rise or fall together along the

unique path ss converging to                        this position.                      The       rate     of time

preference      p(c,)           falls    toward             the       discount           rate       9(c)     as    c


increases along ss, and rises toward it in the opposite case; both

rates equal the interest rate r in the long run. Notice that the

181t    is   straightforward            to    establish that                    the           —     0     locus   is

strictly concave, as drawn. Notice also that in the case shown in
figure 2, the            — 0 locus can never intersect the                                         0 locus from
below, a situation that would produce a second stationary point.
The    reason   is       that     the               0       locus         has   a       strictly positive
slope--equal to [u'(c) —                9'(c)]/9(c)--while                      the          —0 locus has a
slope of zero whenever                  — 0   [see equation (36)].

convergence pattern in the figures implies a positive correlation

between anticipated consumption growth                                 and anticipated                     income

growth,     contrary             to      the     simplest        permanent-income                    model       of

consumption. Intertemporally dependent preferences therefore have

the potential              to    rationalize           the     patterns           of     consumption and

income comovement noted by Summers and Carroll (1989).

          How     should           one      interpret          figures        2     and       3,     which       in

themselves provide no way of determining the initial choices (O)

and c(O)? Remember that the dynamics of                                 and c are embedded in a

larger    system            involving          the     stock     of    assets,           a,     which       is    a

predetermined state variable. It is the initial value of assets,

a(O), relative to the long-run value                              =    i/p,       that determines the

initial position. As the next subsection shows figures like 2 and

3   can be thought of as projections of the full,                                             three-variable

system onto the two-dimensional (c,) plane. The stable path in

that     plane        is     just     the       projection        of     a        unique        stable       path

converging to                         in    the full three-dimensional system.

       The critical implication of the full system's block-recursive

structure        is        that,      given      the      parameters          of       the     differential

equations governing                      and c,      system dynamics depend only on the

current values of                  and c. As a result, figures 2 and 3 represent

utility and consumption dynamics in any situation where the                                                   and

t     equations            are      expected         to      remain      constant                  over     time.

Importantly,           such        situations          include        those         in       which        certain

changes are anticipated to occur in the future, provided these

changes do not affect the parameters appearing in (28) or (32).

       Before discussing this feature of the model in detail, I note

the relation between the saddlepoint-stability of the model and

the    assumption that                the      discount        rate     increases with                    current

consumption.             Linear      approximation          of    the   two-variable          system

around point A yields two positive characteristic roots when 0'                                     (c)
< 0.    Since the addition of equation (21) entails one more positive

root,    r,       the full system can have the two-positive, one-negative

root pattern needed for saddlepoint stability only if 9' (c) > 0.



4.2. The System in Three Dimensions

        A complete, three-dimensional view of the system requires the

inclusion of             the    asset      accumulation equation,                (21).     Figure     4

illustrates          the       dynamics       of         convergence       to     this     long-run

equilibrium, which is labeled A and corresponds to the point A in

figures       2    and    3.    The       (c,) plane        in    figure    4    reproduces         the

subsystem dynamics shown in those figures. The                                  — 0 locus in the

(c,a) plane is the line along which c — ra;                                assets rise to the

right of this line and fall to its left, at rates independent of

the value          of .        An    optimal path that converges                   to A from an
initial asset stock of a(0) <                        a,    say,    must entail an initial

consumption level c(0) <                  ra(0),    so that assets are increasing, as

well as an initial lifetime utility level (O) <                                 . The     subsystem

saddlepath ss             is   the    projection onto             the   (c,fl      plane    of    the

full-system saddlepath SS.

        To    see        how    at    least        one     convergent       path     SS     can     be

constructed, let c[t;c(O),c] be a consumption path satisfying the

subsystem consisting of (28) and (32), as well as                                   the boundary

conditions c[O;c(O),c]                —    c(0), lim,c[t;c(O),c] — c.                     In words,

c[t;c(O),1 is just the portion of the stable path in figure 2 or

3 originating at c(0). Then if c(0) in figure 4 is chosen so that

the intertemporal budget constraint fc[t;c(O),]exp(-rt)dt — a0

holds, the path starting at [c(O),(O),a(O)] converges to point A.

       That SS describes optimal plans, given initial asset stocks,

follows from the sufficiency theorem for optimal controls (Arrow

and Kurz 1970,          p. 49). Under assumption (5), the strict concavity

of u(c) ensures that the maximand u(c)exp(-8) in (23) is strictly

concave in c and 8;               at the same time,                 (21)     is linear while the

right-hand side of (24) is strictly concave in c. It follows that

the maximized Hamiltonian (25)                         is    strictly concave in a and 8.

Optimality now follows from the conditions lim(t)exp(rt)                                                0,

1im,-(t)exp(-rt)                             0,        and      lim÷(t)a(t)exp(-rt)                       =

lim÷,,-(t)9(t)exp(-rt)                — 0, which evidently are valid along SS.'9

       Figures      2       and   3   make        it   clear that corresponding                   to    any

initial a(0) is a unique [c(O),(O)] pair placing the economy on a

convergent path to A. If there were another such,                                    ic(O)' ,(O)']

say,   we would have to have (O) —                           (0)'   ,   since there can be at
most     one maximized level                 of utility corresponding                    to   a    given

initial asset stock;                  and this equality implies that c(O)                              must

equal c(0)'      if the consumer's program converges.

       In summary, it has been argued that convergent solutions (i)

exist,    (ii) are optimal, and (iii) are unique. It is assumed from

now on that only convergent solutions are optimal solutions.



4.3. Disturbances that Do Not Affect the                                or    Equations

       Disturbances that do not affect equations (28)                                    or   (32)       are

the    easiest      to       analyze.        Such       disturbances- -whether            permanent,

anticipated,        or       transitory           in    nature- -obviously          do    not          alter

figures    2   or       3    at   all,       and       in particular          do   not    affect         the

19As mentioned in footnote 1, the existence of an optimum for
variable time-preference problems is established by Becker, Boyd,
and Sung (1989) in a general setting. Their results show that the
regularity conditions that I imposed above are considerably
stronger than necessary.


                                                       27
long-run values                   and . Because these types of disturbances must
operate through the accumulation equation (21), the long-run asset

level         does change, as does the relation between asset holdings

and optimal consuniption levels.

         Dynamics are comparatively easy to analyze when (28) and (32)

are autonomous (i.e., time-independent) because in this case, the

system's motion is confined to a two-dimensional submanifold of

Euclidean three-space,                   R3,   and therefore            is    easy to visualize.

These two-dimensional dynamics follow from the block-recursivity

of the        full       system.        Changes   in     c   and        depend only on their
current levels,               and not on the current asset stock                            a.   If   the

equations of motion for c and                            are autonomous, however, then c

and      must always evolve along ss in equilibrium, independently of

the current value of a. But the set of points (c,,a) such that

(c,) E ss            is      a two-dimensional submanifold of R3.                           The upper
                                                                                                      20
shaded area in figure 5 shows a section of this submanifold,

        While c -             and       - 3 along      all trajectories lying on M--and,

conversely,          all such paths lie on ii- -paths other than SS imply

divergent asset stocks. Indeed, the perpendicular joining

E   SS and                    E    ss describes an unstable eigenvector of the
dynamic system "trapped" on ii.

        The       laws       of motion governing              paths      on M        are    simple     to

describe algebraically. Denote the functional relationship between

c and         along ss by



(37)          —   '(c),       "(c) > 0.



20More     formally,              let    P( ):R3         -   R2    be        the    projection        map
                         —   (c,).      Then M — (x E R31          P()(x)          E ss).

The phase portrait               for system described by                   (21)   and    (38)    is

obtained by projecting M onto the (c,a) plane, as figure 5 shows.

This projection can be used to analyze any disturbance that shifts

the asset-accumulation equation alone.2' The image of SS, denoted

aa, is the convergent path of the simplified system.

       As an illustration, let r(t) be a lump-sum tax levied by the

government, so that asset accumulation is given by



(39)         (t)     —   ra(t)   —   c(t)   —   r(t).

Suppose that initially the tax is set at r — 0,                                 but that it is

unexpectedly and permanently raised to                        r'   > 0.      Figure     6,   which

shows dynamics           in   the    (c,a)      plane of figure            5,     indicates     the

adjustment process from an initial long-run equilibrium (point A).

       The    rise       in   taxes     causes          the            0     locus      to   shift

rightward, but it does not affect equation (38), which defines the

21Disturbances that shift (28) or (32) would generally invalidate
the optimality of the relationship    =                       i(c),
                                               and therefore would
invalidate (38) above. An alternative way of reducing the system
consisting of (21), (28), and (32) to one in c and a only is to
use the value function defined in section 3.2. Since        — V(a)
along a convergent path [equation (29fl, this function of a may be
substituted for    in (32) to yield [with (21)] a system in c and
a.  This method is, however, even less versatile than the one
described in the text. The reason is that in many interesting
cases, the value function depends on factors other than a. For
example, an anticipated future income increase clearly makes
calendar time an additional argument of the value function. In
contrast, such a shock does not alter the relation between c and '
described     by ss.

    Figure 6: Permanent and transitory tax increases
     — 0 locus. Long-run consumption is still determined by 0(c) —                                       r;
however,     the    long-run asset stock consistent with                             c   after the

shock    is '      — ( + r' )/r           >   i.     This long-run position can be
reached only if saving rises immediately. Accordingly,                                        figure      6


shows that consumption drops to the level given by point B on the

new saddlepath a'a' converging to A'                       Subsequently c rises back to

its     original      level,       a    result           in    sharp      contrast            to        the

once-and-for-all, permanent drop in consumption predicted by the

constant time-preference model with B —                       r.
        It   is    simple    to   extend this             analysis       to    the       case      of     a

temporary tax increase. Key to this extension is the observation

that consumption will not                 take       a    discontinuous        jump when the
anticipated        fall     in    taxes       is     implemented.          Points         C     and       D

in figure 6 show the initial reactions to temporary tax increases

of     different      duration,        with        point      C    corresponding              to      the

longer- lived increase.

        In both cases, there is an immediate drop in consumption, a

reflection of the fall in lifetime income;                               and in both cases,

consumption subsequently rises as the consumer returns to point A.

The disturbance pushing the individual to point D leads him to run

down his assets while the higher tax is                            on,    as   in models with

constant time preference. The move to point C, however, is caused

by a reduction in lifetime income so large that initially the
consumer's saving rises.               This makes intuitive sense:                       the longer

the duration of the shock, the closer it is to being permanent.

       Clearly, the degree of consumption smoothing predicted by the

endogenous time preference model is lower than that predicted by

traditional        permanent-income           type       models.     Other      things          equal,

the consumers described above prefer stronger initial reactions to
 income shocks,             a response pattern that allows them to return
eventually to habitual consumption levels.



4.4. Interest-Rate Disturbances

           The interest rate enters directly into the dynamic equations

for consumption and lifetime utility, so the mode of analysis used

so far does not automatically apply to all types                         of   interest-rate

disturbance. Permanent, unanticipated interest-rate changes remain

easy to analyze, however, using the preceding framework.

           The long-run relationship between assets                     and the       interest

rate is determined by 9(ra)                      r. While long-run consumption rises
if     r    does,    long-run assets            can rise   or   fall.    If     the    initial

position is          one of long-run equilibrium,               a small increase in r
raises long-run assets if the elasticity e9 exceeds 1, and lowers

them in the opposite case. Figure 7 shows how the economy adjusts

in a case where                 <   1     at the initial equilibrium.           In the case

pictured, consumption falls initially to produce the required rise

in saving (point B); but it is possible, for different parameter

choices, that consumption rises when the disturbance occurs.

           When      > 1,     long-run assets must fall, and consumption must

therefore         rise   on     impact.        Consumption overshoots         its     eventual

level in the short run,                   a result impossible when the subjective

discount rate is relatively inelastic with respect to consumption.

Since the assumption e <                   1   leads to preferences more comparable

with time-additive preferences (e = 0),                     I focus on the inelastic

case        in    discussing        the     effects   of   transitory         interest-rate

movements.

       Transitory changes in interest rates are most easily studied

in a diagram like figure 8. The figure is drawn on the assumption

      Figure 8: A temporary rise in the interest rate
that    consumption       initially        falls        when        the    interest        rises

temporarily to     r'     from r.    A permanent rise in r would shift ss

upward to 5's' ,        producing a new long-run equilibrium (point A')
with higher consumption and higher lifetime utility than at the

original long-run equilibrium (point A). An optimal consumption

plan     necessarily        follows        the      Euler           equations        of      the

high-interest-rate system while the interest rate is high; after

the rate falls, the optimal plan follows ss. Neither consumption

nor future lifetime utility can jump at the moment of transition.

These conditions lead to the path shown.

       Why does figure 8 show *             initially      rising when the economy

moves from point A to point B? If &                is   the initial asset level, it

is feasible for the consumer to raise consumption immediately to

r' and lower it back to r when the interest rate falls.                                     This

plan    raises   lifetime      utility       above ,           and        an    optimal     plan

necessarily does even better.22

       The diagram makes clear why the analysis applied to previous

disturbances, which assumed a time-invariant consumption-utility

relationship of the form             —   *(c),   is now inapplicable. During the

period before the         interest rate reverts                to    its       initial    level,

consumption must evolve along an unstable path of the system in

the (c,) plane. In terms of figure 5, this means that the optimal

program involves points off the submanifold M.                        It is therefore no

longer legitimate to analyze the comovement of consumption and

assets using the two-dimensional projection of M.

       The optimal response to the disturbance calls for an initial
22Let T be the length of the time interval over which the interest
rate is at r' > r. The feasible plan described (which merely holds
saving steady at zero) ha! a utility value of exp[— O(r'a)TJ +
(1 - exp[— O(r')T]) u(r'a) >      — u(ra)
                            O(r'a)                 O(ra)
rise in saving. Saving then declines over time, turning negative by

the time of the anticipated fall in the interest rate. Notice that

over part of the transitional period,                                     is    falling even though

consumption is                rising,     contrary to               the positive correlation of

these variables along a saddlepath. Lifetime utility is falling

despite           rising        current      consumption             because        the       drop     in     the

interest           rate       is    approaching,         and consumption                 is    expected        to

follow a declining path after that event.

         It       is    instructive       to    compare             the   above     scenario with              the

response that would occur were the time-preference rate constant

at   8            r.    Once again,       consumption can rise                      or     fall when the

interest rate temporarily rises Co r'                                 in the case of logarithmic

utility, for example, consumption would remain constant at Oa on

impact.       After           the    initial    instant,             however,       consumption rises

according to                 the equation t         —    (— u'/u")(r'           —    0).      This rising
transitional consumption path agrees with the                                        result shown              in

figure        8        for    variable       time       preference.            There       are       two    main

differences. With a constant                        8,        assets remain at a new, higher
level once              r'    falls back to         r,        rather than returning to their

original level.                (That is,       the shock has hysteretic effects.)                              In

addition,              the constant-U case does not admit the possibility of

initial           consumption         overshooting             or     initial        dissaving             (which

occurs above when                    > 1).



5. Neoclassical Growth in a Closed Economy

         A    final           example     applies             the     above       framework           to      the

neoclassical growth problem of Ramsey (1928),                                        Cass      (1965),        and

Koopmans (1965).                    For this purpose,               the maximization problem is

interpreted as a planning problem, and net output is assumed to be


                                                         33
a function f(k) of the capital stock k. As usual, f(k) is assumed

to be twice continuously differentiable, with f' (k)                                              0 over an

initial range of capital stocks, and f"(k) < 0 everywhere.

        Proceeding as before, one derives the necessary conditions


                                        0' (c)J [p(c,)
(40)
                   [u' (c) -

                   [u"(c) —

(41)           —   f(k)          — c,

and (28).          Notice             that,      provided no parameters are expected to
change,        the dynamic system described by these equations is fully

autonomous. Since the value function V(k) is therefore independent

of     time,       it       is     legitimate           to       eliminate    (28)       by imposing        the

equality                —    V(k) valid along convergent                           paths.      Substitution

transforms (40) into an equation involving c and k only,


                   [u'      (c) - 0' (c)V(k)1 p[c,V(k)]
(42)           -                                        —                     f'   (k)
                   [u"(c) —             O"(c)V(k)]           L




        Figure          9        shows       a    possible         configuration          of     the     system

described by (41) and (42). Given the convergence assumption made

to     obtain           (42),         only        the    convergent          path    aa     has        economic

significance. The steady-state values of consumption and capital

are uniquely determined by the conditions


(43)           —   f(i),
(44)      0(c)              f'(i).


        When       0' (c)         >     0,       optimal         growth has        the    same    essential

characteristics as in the standard model.23 Consumption and capital

6. Concluding Remarks

       This exploration of endogenous                time-preference models has

illustrated       the         straightforward             methods         available      for

understanding the consumption behavior they predict. Models with

variable time-preference rates typically yield the more intuitive

economic implications of constant-rate models, for example,                             that

consumption     should        rise   during    a    period        of     temporarily   high

interest     rates.     The     main     difference        is     that    variable     time-

preference models        imply       a well-defined long-run target wealth

level. This determinacy is not only empirically plausible,                             it is

also an analytical advantage in many cases.

       The assumption of constant time-preference rates has been

useful in some recent models of sustained endogenous growth in per

capita consumption (see Romer 1989 for a survey).                            It should be

noted,     therefore,     that         the   formulation          of     endogenous     time

preference described above is fully consistent with those models.

An assumption that the concave, increasing discount-rate function

0(c)    is bounded from above would be enough in principle to open

the door to unbounded individual consumption growth.

       The stability of this paper's models is closely linked to the

hypothesis that subjective discount rates are increasing functions

of     consumption.     This     hypothesis        does     not     command    widespread

agreement. It appears, however, to yield more reasonable economic

predictions than the alternative view,                     that people become more

willing to defer consumption as consumption possibilities rise.
