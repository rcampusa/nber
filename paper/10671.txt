Large blocks of stock play an important role in many studies of corporate governance and finance.

Despite this important role, there is no standardized data set for these blocks, and the best available

data source, Compact Disclosure, has many mistakes and biases. In this paper, we document these

mistakes and show how to fix them. The mistakes and bias tend to increase with the level of reported

blockholdings: in firms where Compact Disclosure reports that aggregate blockholdings are greater

than 50 percent, these aggregate holdings are incorrect more than half the time and average holdings

for these incorrect firms are overstated by almost 30 percentage points. We also demonstrate that

our fixes are economically and statistically significant in an analysis of the relationship between firm

value and outside blockholders.

I. Introduction

        Large-block shareholders play an important role in corporate governance. For this

reason, the presence of such “blockholders” and the size of their holdings is a common

explanatory variable in financial research. In just the last few years, a representative sample

of such studies includes analyses of the role of blockholders in executive turnover, executive

compensation, firm diversification, discretionary expenses, market liquidity, and corporate

performance.1       Furthermore, blockholder data is a crucial input in the analysis of the

relationship between ownership structure and firm value, where seminal works by Demsetz

and Lehn (1985) and Morck et al. (1988) gave rise to a vast and growing literature.

        Despite the common use of large shareholder data, there does not exist a clean off-

the-shelf database to facilitate research. Many of the papers cited above required their

authors to gather their own data. This time-consuming task is necessary because of several

weaknesses in the available databases.              Of course, decentralized data gathering causes

duplication of effort and lack of standardization across projects. Also, because of the large

time commitment necessary to clean the data for each firm, most researchers have gathered

data for a relatively small number of firms. This paper aims to fill this data gap by

documenting the problems with the currently available data, proposing a consistent set of

solutions to these problems, and making a “clean” database freely available to all

researchers.2 Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of clean (vs. raw) data with a

representative study on the relationship between outside blockholders and firm value.

       The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (SEA) lays out the ownership disclosure

requirements for public corporations in Regulation 14A and Schedule 14A.            Virtually

everything we know about blockholders in the United States comes from these disclosure

requirements, which are described in detail in Appendix A of this paper. The two main types

of data produced by the SEA are for holdings (once per year, reported in the annual proxy

statement), and for transactions by corporate insiders and beneficial owners (updated through

Forms 3, 4 and 5). While the trading data would appear to provide the most current and

comprehensive information, past research has demonstrated that this data is difficult to work

with and cannot be relied upon to infer the holdings of individual blockholders (Anderson

and Lee (1997a and 1997b), Jeng et al. (2003)). Thus, we focus in this paper on the annual

proxy data, which is more reliable and more commonly used by researchers.

       Proxy data is available from many sources, including direct electronic access using

the SEC’s “Edgar” tool for all corporate filings since the mid-1990s. For large-scale data

downloads, however, it is necessary to use a commercial product. The most widely used

product is the Compact Disclosure database of Standard & Poor’s. Anderson and Lee (1997a

and 1997b) focus their analysis on the holdings of corporate officers and directors, and show

that Compact Disclosure accurately reproduces the information in proxy statements for all

firms except those with multiple classes of stock.        While Compact Disclosure also

reproduces data on blockholders from the tables in the proxy statement, there are additional

problems with these data. We discuss these problems and their solutions in Section II, and

summarize the changes for a large sample of firms from 1996 to 2001.

       In Section III, we perform a representative study using both raw Compact Disclosure

data and a “clean” data set where these problems have been fixed.      We find that the raw




                                                                                        4
data is much noisier: in annual regressions of Tobin’s Q on outside blockholder ownership

and other control variables, the clean data set is far more likely to yield statistically

significant point estimates for the ownership variables.                 Section IV summarizes our

conclusions. Two appendices supplement the text. Appendix A provides details on the 1934

SEA and the disclosure requirements it created, and Appendix B provides details on the

construction of our sample.



    II.      Data

          A. Sample Firms

          Our initial sample of firms consists of firms that are covered by the Investor

Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) for both their publication Corporate Takeover

Defenses (Rosenbaum 1995, 1998, 2000) and their director’s database which provides details

on the board of directors for about 1,500 of the largest U.S. companies. The IRRC’s universe

is drawn from the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 as well as the annual lists of the largest

corporations in the publications of Fortune, Forbes, and Businessweek. We use the IRRC

sample as a starting point because a wide range of governance data is available for this group

of companies and our goal is to make this set of data as comprehensive as possible for this

group.3 A special subset of the IRRC companies – less than 10 percent in all years – have

multiple classes of common stock. For these companies, Anderson and Lee (1997a) showed

there are many problems with the Compact Disclosure data, and these problems are very

difficult to fix. In this paper, we eliminate all multiple-class companies from the database and

Gillan et al. (2003).



                                                                                                          5
start with the approximately 1300 firms per year (7,873 firm-years) for the single-classed

companies in the IRRC sample from 1996 to 2001.4

         The initial ownership data comes from the Compact Disclosure CD-ROMs. Based on

the results of Anderson and Lee (1997a, 1997b) we build our sample from the information on

large shareholders that Compact Disclosure derives directly from the proxies and ignore the

insider-trading data that is also available through Compact Disclosure. Appendix B provides

details on the construction of the initial database.

         We next check the initial database by comparing the Compact Disclosure data to the

original proxy statements, which we obtain from Livedgar,5 making changes to the

ownership percentages of large shareholders where appropriate. All firms in the sample were

checked – even those with no reported blockholders in Compact Disclosure. We employ the

following general rules when deciding on share ownership. The SEC defines beneficial

ownership as either voting or investment power, and sometimes companies report both

measures in their proxies. We use voting power as opposed to investment power for our

database when a distinction is made between the two. Also, even if individuals disclaim

beneficial ownership of some portion of their holdings in the proxy, we treat these holdings

as if the individual had the voting power. Under the terms of SEC Rule 13d-3, shares of

common stock that may be acquired within 60 days are deemed outstanding for the purposes

of computing the percentage of common stock owned by a shareholder. We follow this SEC

rule and include these options. In the rare cases of a company having a temporary ownership

structure resulting from a recent merger or acquisition, we remove these companies from our

sample for that year. For 229 (2.9%) sample firms, proxy information could not be obtained,

and these firm-years were removed from our sample. Our final sample consists thus of 7,649

firm-years and covers 1,913 unique firms. Table 1 shows summary statistics of our sample

firms. The table is based on cross-sectional averages of time-series means.

       Many researchers are interested in knowing whether a specific blockholder is an

“insider” or an “outsider” to the firm. The role of large shareholders in corporate governance

is often treated differently depending on the classification of the shareholder. Since our work

required the examination of all blockholders, the marginal cost of coding these classifications

was relatively low, so we did so. The results are summarized in Table 2. The possible

classifications are (1) officer, (2) director, (3) affiliated entity, (4) ESOP, and (5) outside

blockholder. Category (1) includes all officers, even if they are also directors. Category (2)

only includes non-officer directors. Category (3) includes any individual, trust, or company

whose voting outcome is partially influenced, but not completely controlled, by an officer or

director of the company. If the shares are completely controlled by the officer or director,

then these shares would be counted under category (1) or (2), respectively. Category (4) is

the aggregate number shares held by Employee Share Ownership Plans, but does not include

employee shares held through non-ESOP retirement plans (such as non-ESOP 401(k) plans).

Category (5) includes all blockholders not elsewhere classified. This final category makes up

about two-thirds of the aggregate amount of blockholding, and will be examined in the

analysis of Section III.




                                                                                         7
           B. Problems with the Compact Disclosure Data

           Two main biases are introduced if researchers were to work directly with the

benchmark Compact Disclosure database: overlaps and preferred shares. The SEC requires

that all beneficial owners of more than 5% of a company’s common stock be listed in the

proxy, and consequently shares are often double or triple counted under different people or

entities.6 While the SEC requires firms to detail the ownership structure of jointly held block

in the footnotes, Compact Disclosure ignores all of the footnotes detailing joint or cross

ownership of shares and lists every blockholder and ownership percentage exactly as it

appears in the summary table of the proxy section “Security Ownership of Management and

Certain Beneficial Owners.” This leads to the overlap of reported ownership, which might be

either a full overlap or a partial overlap. Examples of these two cases are documented below

in Subsection 1. Second, Compact Disclosure sometimes misrepresents preferred shares as

common equity ownership. This problem is illustrated below in Subsection 2.



                    1. Overlaps

           Full overlaps can arise in two types of situations. In the first scenario, two or more

blockholders are listed in the ownership table with the same shareholdings and the joint

ownership of these shares is disclosed only by the footnotes. In the second scenario, the

proxy separates the beneficial ownership of directors and officers from that of large

shareholders and Compact Disclosure reproduces entries from both tables without cross-

checking identities. Figures 1 and 2 display an example of the latter case. Figure 1 shows the

Compact Disclosure data for Coca Cola Co. from the October 1999 CD, and Figure 2 shows

an excerpt of the proxy statement from March 4th, 1999 on which the data is based. While

    See Appendix A for details of these disclosure requirements.



                                                                                            8
Compact Disclosure’s blockholder data is accurate in a literal sense with respect to the two

tables in the proxy, the vital information of the proxy footnote is ignored. Figure 1 lists

Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett individually as 8.10% owners of the common stock.

Referring to the footnote 4 of Figure 1 (the ownership table from the proxy statement), we

find that all of the shares listed under Warren Buffett are owned indirectly through Berkshire

Hathaway. Tallying the beneficial ownership percentages without referencing the table

footnotes in the proxy would suggest that 22.3% of Coca Cola’s common stock is held by

blockholders when actually 14.2% is the correct figure.

       Overlaps are not always easy to recognize. In the second and more common scenario,

multiple blockholders have joint-ownership of stock but also own shares over which they

have sole voting or investment power. This type of overlap does not result in identical

ownership figures for multiple shareholders. For example, there is no obvious overlap in the

Compact Disclosure listing for Outback Steakhouse, Inc. (Figure 3). However, footnotes 1, 2

and 4 to the proxy beneficial ownership table (Figure 4) reveal that 8,242,125 shares

(16.85%) owned by Multi-Venture Partners, Ltd. are also listed under Chris T. Sullivan,

Robert D. Basham, and J. Timothy Gannon. This means that beneficial owners hold 26.98%

of the common stock, rather than 77.53%, which is the straightforward sum of Compact

Disclosure’s ownership statistics. Note that the Spectrum data does not report the 5%

blockholders correctly. At the bottom of Figure 3, where the Spectrum data is listed after the

delimiter ‘***^’, it is stated that there are five 5% owners who hold an aggregate of 62.06%

of common stock.

       Both of the above examples are relatively easy to spot and correct. However, many

companies have more complex overlaps which translate into more detailed footnotes and




                                                                                        9
longer amounts of time that a researcher must spend examining them.            These types of

overlaps include those among companies, subsidiaries, individuals, and trusts. When the

information in the footnotes is insufficient to determine the ultimate control of these shares,

we follow the rule of assigning these shares to the partial owner who is closest to control of

the company: officers first, then directors, and then outsiders.



               2) Preferred Stock

       There are two ways in which preferred shares can erroneously enter into the

beneficial ownership figures. A company may report ownership of common stock and

preferred stock separately but side by side in the same proxy table. In this case, Compact

Disclosure will pick up all of the percentages in the table without distinguishing between the

two categories of stock, giving us two different ownership figures for shareholders holding

both preferred and common stock. Figure 5 shows one example from the original Compact

Disclosure database, and Figure 6 shows the corresponding proxy statement. Some

companies structure their proxy statements by listing common and preferred ownership side

by side, but also giving an aggregated ownership figure. In these cases, Compact Disclosure

tends to erroneously pick up just the aggregate ownership figure, without doing any

adjustment for the relative voting power between the common and preferred.              In our

corrected data, we include only the common-stock component of voting.



       C. The Corrected Data

       The first four rows of Table 3 show the frequency of the corrections we made by

groups of overall shares held by blockholders. Using a non-parametric Wilcoxon difference




                                                                                        10
test, we show that the corrected and raw percentages of rows three and four are statistically

different for all 6 groups of blockholders at the one percent level. The remainder of Table 3

shows the frequency of each of the problems. It is evident from Table 3 that the overlap

problem becomes more pronounced the higher is the overall share of common stock held by

blockholders.   For companies where the reported ownership in Compact Disclosure is

between five and ten percent, the frequency of errors is 0.4 percent. This error rate rises to

4.5 percent for the 10-15 percent ownership range, 8.5 percent for the 15-25 percent range,

13.5 percent for the 25-50 percent range, and 53.1 percent for the >50% range. The category

with no reported blockholders in Compact Disclosure is a special case: there, the 31.7

percent of errors is caused by either Compact Disclosure erroneously reporting no

blockholder or by the company choosing to omit a blockholder table from the proxy, and

instead putting blockholder information into the text.

       Errors tend to increase with aggregate blockholdings in Compact Disclosure for the

simple reason that the errors themselves tend to increase the aggregates: e.g., an overlap for a

jointly held block of 25 percent will lead to a Compact Disclosure aggregate of 50 percent.

While the errors are rare for low levels of aggregate holdings, they are common at higher

levels and are economically significant. In the most extreme category (>50% in Compact

Disclosure), the average holdings in the raw data for firms with errors fall from over 100

percent (clearly impossible) to under 50 percent.




                                                                                         11
       III.      A Representative Analysis: Outside Blockholders and Firm Value

       In this section, we analyze the relationship between firm value and outside blockholdings

using both raw and cleaned data. Specifically, for each year t, we estimate



       Qit = a + b1OWNit + b2OWN2it + cXit + eit,                                 (1)



where Q is a measure of industry-adjusted Tobin’s Q, OWN and OWN2 are the fraction and

fraction squared held by outside blockholders, X is a vector of control variables, and e is an

iid error term, all measured for firm i at time t. We follow Kaplan and Zingales (1997) and

measure Q as the ratio of the market value of assets to the book value of assets: the market

value is calculated as the sum of the book value of assets and the market value of common

stock less the book value of common stock and deferred taxes. The X vector includes a

Delaware incorporation dummy (Daines, 2001), an S&P 500 inclusion dummy (Morck and

Yang, 2001), the log of sales for the previous fiscal year, and the log of firm age (months

since first public listing).

       We make no claims for any causal relationship here. Any regression of firm value on

ownership will be fraught with endogeneity concerns, a point first made by Demsetz and

Lehn (1985) and followed up by many other authors.7 Rather, we intend only to test whether

all this cleaning effort yields any meaningful differences in coefficient estimates or statistical

significance. To do so, we start with a simple and obvious regression.

              Table 4 summarizes the results of regression (1) estimated separately for each year

from 1996 to 2001, with each regression estimated using both raw and cleaned data. The

results suggest that the raw data is much noisier, as the coefficients on the OWN variables are

    For examples, see Loderer and Martin (1997), Himmelberg et al. (1999), Palia (2001), and Coles et al. (2003).



                                                                                                          12
almost always closer to zero and lower in statistically significance than are the corresponding

coefficients using cleaned data.   Overall, the cleaned data demonstrate a far more robust

relationship between outside block ownership and firm value.            While the economic

interpretation of this result is clouded by endogeneity concerns, the research importance of

using the cleaned data is clear.



IV. Conclusion

       Researchers rely on ownership data for many studies. The lack of a standardized

source of data on large blockholders is an impediment to this work. In this paper, we

document the weaknesses with the commonly used data, show how to fix them, and

demonstrate that these fixes are both quantitatively large and also important for the analysis

of a typical question.




Appendix A – Legal Rules

       The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, rules 13d-1 to 13d-7 (§240.13d) and rules 16a-

1 to 16e-1 (§240.16a-e), contain the legal definitions and filing requirements for what the

corporate finance literature has termed “blockholders”.       While 13D defines beneficial

ownership and describes the disclosure requirements of these shareholders, rules 16a-e detail

the reporting requirements on transactions made by corporate insiders. The company in turn

is required to disclose blockholder information to shareholders via proxies under Regulation

and Schedule 14a (§240.14a), commonly called the “proxy” statement.

       Rule 13d-1(a) sets the threshold for beneficial ownership at 5% or more of a class of

stock. According to Rule 13d-3(a) a beneficial owner “includes any person who, directly or



                                                                                        13
indirectly, through any contract, understanding, relationship, or otherwise, has or shares”

voting or investment power. This rule has been interpreted to include shares that may be

obtained through the exercising of options, warrants, or rights in the next 60 days a part of

the beneficial ownership calculation. Any individual or group that has acquired a beneficial

stake in a class of equity is required to file the form SC 13D [see rule 13d-1(a)]. According to

Rule 13d-3(a), the form SC 13D must be filed within 10 days after the acquisition of the

equity position, and any material change in the position must be promptly filed in an

amended SC 13D [see 13d-1(a)]8. This form contains information about the person’s

relationship with the company and the nature of the holding. A select category of “persons”

such as banks, brokers and dealers, and insurance companies can file an abbreviated form,

the SC 13G. The SC 13G can only be used if the equity securities were acquired in the

ordinary course of business, and without the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the

control of the issuer [see 13d-1(b)].

           Rule 13d-3 details how to determine beneficial ownership. For the purposes of

sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Act, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who,

directly or indirectly has or shares either voting or investment power over the security. Rule

13d-3 also specifies that creating trusts or pooling arrangements are not valid constructs to

avoid filing a form 13D. In fact, rule 13d-3(c) specifies, “all securities of the same class

beneficially owned by a person, regardless of the form which such beneficial ownership

takes, shall be aggregated in calculating the number of shares beneficially owned by such

person”.       Rule 13d-7 regulates the dissemination of form 13D. For our purposes, it is

important that the issuer of the security must be notified of the existence of a large

shareholder at its principal executive office, by registered or certified mail.

    According to rule 13d-2(a), The SEC deems a 1% change in the ownership position as material.



                                                                                                   14
       The second set of laws of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulating filing

requirements for blockholders is detailed in rules 16a-1 to 16e-1 (“Reports of Directors,

Officers, and Principal Shareholders”). Pursuant to this section, a person (“principal

shareholder”) deemed a beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of equity securities

registered under section 12 of the Act (“Registration Requirements for Securities”), as well

as any director or officer of the company needs to file forms 3, 4, and 5. Initial statements of

beneficial ownership of equity securities required by section 16(a) of the Act are filed on

Form 3. Statements of changes in beneficial ownership required by that section are filed on

Form 4, and annual statements are filed on Form 5. While the 13D/G forms are laid out to

disclose the size and nature of the holdings of a large blockholder (who owns more than five

percent, what their purpose is, whether they intend to buy more, their voting power, etc.), the

3,4,5 forms are structured to disclose any transactions made by a company insider. Without

discussing anything about the intent of the shareholder, the 3,4,5 forms list what was bought

or sold and when, making them more transaction oriented than disclosure oriented.

       The laws regulating a company’s disclosure requirements of large blockholder

information to shareholders are detailed in Regulation 14A (“Solicitation of Proxies”) and

Schedule 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (§240.14a). Pursuant to Schedule

14A(6-d) with reference to Item 403 of Regulation S-K (§229.403) entitled “Security

Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management,” a company is required to

disclose two types of tables in proxies: one listing shareholders who own more than 5% of

any class of the company’s equity securities, and another listing any ownership of equity

securities by all directors and officers of the company. The tables can be combined at the

company’s option and should list the number of shares beneficially owned and the




                                                                                         15
percentage of the class owned. Item 403 does specify a tabular format to be used, but it does

not specify the location where this information should appear in the proxy. Item 403 also

explains that a company may rely on the information disclosed in the SC 13D/G forms by

beneficial owners when preparing this information for proxies.

       Item 403 refers to Rule 13d-3 for the determination of beneficial ownership, and it

details specific guidelines for disclosing the nature of the beneficial ownership. Information

in sub-columns or footnotes must be included and reflect the number of shares of which a

beneficial owner has sole or shared voting power as well as sole or shared investment power.

Similarly, the number of shares a beneficial owner has the right to acquire must be listed in a

footnote, as well as any arrangements or pledges that could lead to a change of control of

shares. Item 403 also specifies that a company must use appropriate disclosure to avoid

confusion where more than one beneficial owner is listed for the same securities. When a

beneficial owner owns shares pursuant to a voting trust or agreement, the company must state

in a table or footnote the title of the securities, the amount held or to be held according to the

trust or agreement, and the duration of the agreement. The company must also disclose the

names and addresses of the voting trustees and outline briefly their voting rights and powers

under the trust or agreement.



       Appendix B – Details on the Sample Construction

       In a first step, we matched the IRRC database with data from Compact Disclosure

pertaining to large shareholders and directors and officers. Compact Disclosure stores

company data on CDs that are updated monthly. The month of the update depends on the

company’s fiscal year end, and, for data pertaining to the board of directors, on the




                                                                                           16
company’s proxy meeting date. Since Compact Disclosure often does not keep information

until the next update, but rather removes stale data from the monthly CDs, searching the right

month after the proxy meeting is important. In the earlier sample years, a lag of 6 months

from proxy meeting month to issuance of data CD yielded the most reliable results. Starting

in 2000, Compact Disclosure data are usually updated in the month following the annual

meeting.

         We then sort, for each sample year, all IRRC firms by proxy meeting month. We

download through a ticker merge the large shareholder data (field SH) and information on

directors (field DO) and officers (field NA) from the appropriate monthly Compact

Disclosure CD in the tagged format. Figure 1 shows an example of our raw database. The

search string automatically yields a summary of the insider-trading data compiled by

Spectrum (Form 3, 4, and 5), which we discard.9 Note from Figure 1 that Compact

Disclosure mentions the source and source date of the director and ownership information in

parentheses. We control in the sample construction that all ownership information is taken

from proxy statements. We are able to match 94% of all firm-years with our search strategy

through Compact Disclosure. The remaining firms were looked up directly from the proxies.

         In a next step, we use a SAS program to convert the data of Figure 1 into an easy-to-

use SAS database. The SAS program loops through the information on officers and directors,

provided by Compact Disclosure in the fields NA- and DO-, and identifies a large


9
  Anderson and Lee (1997a) caution that the proxy’s definition of an insider (an officer or director) is not the
same as the definition used for the insider-trading filings (any shareholder of 10% or more) compiled by
Spectrum. When they compare Spectrum data to the benchmark proxy data on management ownership, they
find that 40.7% of their sample has a reporting discrepancy of over 5% (p. 316). They also refute the claim that
the Spectrum data are more current than the most recent proxy data, showing that the filing dates listed in the
Spectrum section of the Compact Disclosure data are sometimes “stale” by two or more years (Anderson and
Lee (1997b), p. 3-4). An additional concern for us is a date mismatch, as the Spectrum data is updated at various
points during the year, while the director’s database stems from the annual proxy statements. Indeed, the
Spectrum data of Figure 1 is incorrect.



                                                                                                         17
shareholder entry as either director or officer if the character string for a blockholder (in the

SH- section of the Compact Disclosure data) matched a character string in the officer or

director sections (NA-, DO-) of the data. Compact Disclosure is extremely accurate and

consistent in the spelling of names across fields, as it takes the names exactly as they appear

in the proxy statements.10

   However, the automated process will not correctly match variations such as “The Smith family trust” with a
director named Peter H. Smith. These corrections are done manually in the data cleaning process.

The table describes summary statistics of key sample firm characteristics. The sample period
is 1996 – 2001. The total sample consists of large publicly listed U.S. firms, a total of 7,649
firm-years and 1,913 unique firms. The table contains cross-sectional means and medians of
firm time-series averages. Firm age is measured as months since first listing. Market value,
total assets, sales, and common equity are taken from Compustat. The book-to-market ratio is
book value of common equity to market value of common equity. Book value of common
equity is the sum of book common equity (Compustat item 60) and deferred taxes (item 74).
The capex-to-sales ratio is capital expenditures (item 128) divided by net sales. Q is the
market value of assets divided by the book value of assets (item 6), where the market value
of assets is computed as book value of assets plus the market value of common stock less the
sum of the book value of common stock (item 60) and balance sheet deferred taxes (item 74).
All book values for fiscal year t (from Compustat) are combined with the market value of
common equity at the calendar end of year t. Return on assets (equity) is calculated as
income before extraordinary items (item 18) divided by item 6 (item 60). G-score is an equal
weighted index that measures the restrictions of shareholder rights, and is provided through
Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS). All director variables are from the director
database of the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC).

The first three rows of this table contain summary statistics for the cleaned sample by
calendar year. The sample construction is explained in Appendix B. The bottom part of the
table shows the frequency of each category of large shareholders. Officers are officers, and
possibly also directors of the firm. Directors are all non-officer directors. Affiliated entities
are individuals, trusts or companies whose voting outcome is at least partially influenced or
outright determined by an officer or director of the company. ESOPs are Employee Stock
Ownership Plans. Outside Blockholders are all individuals or entities that are none of the
above.

     This table reports the occurrence of the four problems associated with using the raw large
     shareholder database available through Compact Disclosure. We classify the firms into six
     different categories based on the sum of the blockholdings. The first row shows the number
     of firms by blockholding category. The second row shows the fraction of entries by category
     that needed to be corrected. The third and fourth row contain the average sum of
     blockholdings by category before and after cleaning, where the categorization is done by the
     sum of blockholdings as they appear in the raw data. The second part of the table describes
     the four situations that required cleaning. The four problems are full overlap, partial overlap,
     the treatment of preferred shares, and other problems. The second and third row of each
     reported problem show how the percentage holdings change given we observe the problem.

This table presents the coefficients of the sum of outside blockholdings and squared outside
blockholdings, before and after our cleaning procedure, from annual cross-sectional
regressions of industry-adjusted Tobin's Q on the blockholdings and control variables. The
control variables include a Delaware dummy, S&P 500 affiliation, the natural logarithm of
firm age in months (measured as months since first listing, obtained from CRSP), and the
natural logarithm of firm sales (obtained from Compustat). For simplicity, the coefficients on
the control variables are omitted from the table. Standard errors are reported in parentheses
and significance at the one-percent and five-percent levels is indicated by ** and *
respectively. Entries in bold demonstrate a difference in statistical significance between the
raw Compact Disclosure and the cleaned data. Q is the ratio of the market value of assets to
the book value of assets: the market value is calculated as the sum of the book value of assets
and the market value of common stock less the book value of common stock and deferred
taxes. The market value of equity is measured at the end of the current calendar year, and the
accounting variables are measured in the current fiscal year. Industry adjustments are made
by subtracting the industry median, where medians are calculated by matching the four-digit
SIC codes from December of each year to the 48 industries designated by Fama and French
[1997].
