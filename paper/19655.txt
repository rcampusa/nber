This Chartbook, which is a companion piece to Carmen M. Reinhart and Takeshi Tashiro (2013) “Crowding
Out Redefined: The Role of Reserve Accumulation,” focuses on nine Asian economies: China, India,
Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Like its predecessor (Reinhart,
2010), it provides a pictorial history, on a country-by-country basis. In addition to public debt, we
trace out the evolution of its composition between domestic and external borrowing. Total external
debt (public and private) and domestic credit are also included through 2013. This combination gives
a broad (but not complete) picture of a country’s indebtedness. It should be ideally supplemented (where
relevant) by indicators and trends in the shadow banking sector, as discussed in Shin (2013). It is also
timeline of a country’s creditworthiness and financial turmoil (including its history, if any, with IMF
programs).

                                Key to Charts and Methodology Notes

    For working definitions of banking, currency, debt, and inflation crises, see the extensive

discussion in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009a and 2010). As to the crises highlighted in the country

profiles, our focus is on primarily external sovereign default (also its less common counterpart--

domestic sovereign default) and banking crises. Many countries have a rich history of recurring

(and often chronic) exchange rate crashes and inflation crises, particularly (but not exclusively) in

post World War II Latin America. We only provide limited information on these recurring follies

in monetary history. 1 We do include, highlight and date all hyperinflation episodes, as these have

been associated with the complete or near complete liquidation (through de facto default) of

domestic currency debts.

Key to charts

    Besides the events discussed above, in a few charts we highlight “near- default” episodes,

which involve some form of international assistance to avoid a default or a restructuring. Their

dates are also listed in the first column of the accompanying table. Some examples of sub-

sovereign defaults (by states or provinces) are also flagged. In a few charts, historic currency

crashes (such as the collapse of an 80-year old peg) are highlighted as well. More mundane

episodes of inflation and currency crises are not shown. However, the full sample incidence

(share of years) in an inflation crisis, is reported in the table below the chart, so as to provide

information on chronic inflation problems. 2 The major output collapses shown in the tables that

accompany the charts and the numerous IMF progams since 1952 (listed as a memorandum item

at the bottom of the table) are not depicted in the figures, to avoid compromising clarity.




1
  In the tables that accompany each country profile, we do provide, as summary statistic on inflation crises,
the share of years with annual inflation above 20 per cent per annum. This inflation performance also gives
a reasonable indication of the incidence of currency crashes,
2
  For evidence on the correlation and overlap between currency crashes and inflation crises, see Reinhart
and Rogoff (2010).

Insets of smaller tables and charts into the figures

        Insets are used throughout to provide complementary information to that shown in the

main figure. For example, for many advanced economies, an inset plots for household credit to

GDP from the mid-1990s to the present to highlight trends in private debts ahead of the 2007-

2008 crisis. In other cases, these insets provide information on the maturity composition of the

debt (public or private, as the case may be) on the eve of a banking crisis be it default or

hyperinflation. The distribution of public and private debt before and after a crisis also provide

documentation of the numerous crisis cases where the government assumed important quantities

of private debts.

Descriptive statistics in the tables to each country

        Descriptive statistics are mostly self-explanatory, but two particulars merit explanation.

The first year of banking crises are listed and those shown in italics indicate that the episode in

question was not deemed to be a systemic crisis. Near default episodes are also shown in italics

and not counted in the tally of default. The last column provides information on the largest annual

output declines, usually the top five, but more or less when relevant. Both the year and the

percent decline (in parentheses) are given. For full output collapse episodes, the interested reader

is referred to Barro and Ursua (2009).

        The bottom portion of the table gives memorandum items on IMF programs with the

country over the period from 1952 to 2012. The first year of the program is listed as well as the

total number of programs. The relevant sources are discussed below.

Debt ratios

    Debt is usually shown as a percent of GDP and in a few cases as a percent of exports. In a

handful of cases we have debt data for the earlier part of the 19th century but no GDP or trade

measure to scale the debt data by. In those few cases, we show changes in debt (often over three

years) to provide an indication of the debt cycle. The nominal GDP data comes from numerous

scholars as well as official statistical sources. For a number of developing countries we have

more data on exports than for GDP (in all cases we have post World War II nominal GDP data).

In these cases the charts show the actual debt/GDP ratio for the period during which GDP data is

available (say post 1920s) and use the debt/exports ratio times the average export to GDP ratio

(for the period during which both series overlap) to back-cast the series.

References and sources

    Most charts list the main source as Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), which has an extensive data

appendices listing sources series-by-series and country-by-country over different subperiods.

Additional sources listed below each graph usually indicate that we came across these sources

subsequent to the publication. The sources for the IMF programs are Bird, Hussain and Joyce

(2004), Mody and Saravia (2009), and the IMF’s Annual Reports for several years to update these

studies through 2012.
