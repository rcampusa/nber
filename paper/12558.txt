                                              ABSTRACT

This paper studies the evolution of income concentration in Japan from 1886 to 2002 by constructing
long-run series of top income shares and top wage income shares, using income tax statistics. We find
that (1) income concentration was extremely high throughout the pre-WWII period during which the
nation underwent rapid industrialization; (2) a drastic de-concentration of income at the top took place
in 1938-1945; (3) income concentration has remained low throughout the post-WWII period despite
the high economic growth; and (4) top income composition in Japan has shifted dramatically from
capital income to employment income over the course of the 20th century. We attribute the precipitous
fall in income concentration during WWII primarily to the collapse of capital income due to wartime
regulations and inflation. We argue that the change in the institutional structure under the occupational
reforms made the one-time income de-concentration difficult to reverse. In contrast to the sharp increase
in wage income inequality observed in the United States since 1970, the top wage income shares in
Japan have remained remarkably stable over the recent decades. We show that the change in technology
or tax policies alone cannot account for the comparative experience of Japan and the United States.
Instead we suggest that institutional factors such as corporate governance and union structure are important
determinants of wage income inequality.

1. Introduction

       Following the seminal work by Kuznets (1955), economists have devoted much
effort to analysing the evolution of income inequality during the process of economic
development. This analysis is also central for the policy debate: The left argues that
concentration of wealth biases the political process in favor of the rich that in turn
perpetuates the inequality, calling for progressive taxation as a necessary counter-
measure. The right views concentration of wealth as a natural if not necessary outcome of
economic growth. Thus, progressive taxation may redistribute income and reduce wealth
concentration, but may also reduce economic growth by depressing entrepreneurship and
capital accumulation incentives.
       To cast better light on the debate, it is critical to understand the empirical
relationship between economic growth and income distribution. To this end, economic
historians have studied changes in income and wealth inequality over centuries in leading
industrial nations such as Britain, the United States, or France (e.g., Soltow (1968, 1969);
Williamson and Lindert (1980); Williamson (1985); Lindert (1986, 2000); Piketty, Postel-
Vinay, and Rosenthal (2006)). Historical studies, however, were often hampered by the
absence of long-run homogeneous series of income and wealth. Recently, a number of
studies have used income tax statistics to generate such series for several European and
Anglo-Saxon countries (see Atkinson and Piketty (2006) and Piketty (2005)). Although
these studies focus on the shares of top income groups due to the nature of the data, they
provide the first consistent series of income inequality measure in these countries that
cover most of the 20th century.
       The objective of this paper is to construct the long-run top income shares series for
Japan and evaluate Japan’s experience from historical and comparative perspectives.
The data for Japan are of particular interest, not only because Japan is the world’s second
largest economy after the United States today, but also because its process of
industrialization was compressed within a very short time period. After the 1868 Meiji
Restoration, modern economic growth in Japan took off in the 1880s, and the nation
underwent three phases of industrial revolution – from textiles, heavy industries, to high-
tech industries – within less than 100 years. To illustrate this point, Figure 1 depicts the
real GDP per capita in Japan, 1820-2004, against that in the United States, 1790-2004.
Japan’s GDP per capita in 1890 was at the level of U.S. GDP per capita in 1790, or about
$1,200 in 2004 dollars which is roughly comparable to the GDP per capita of the poorest
countries in the world today. By 1970, however, Japan caught up with other developed


                                             1
countries, and now has a GDP per capita only slightly lower than the United States. Real
GDP per capita in Japan grew at the annual compound rate of 2.7% in 1886-1940 and at
4.7% in 1948-2002. Because the Japanese government introduced a comprehensive
income tax system in 1887 – a remarkably early date by international standards – we can
trace the evolution of income concentration during the entire process of industrialization
using the Japanese tax statistics.1 As the top income shares series compiled so far for the
Western countries span only part of their industrialization process, the Japanese data
provide us with a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between income
concentration and modern economic growth. To explore the causes of dynamic changes
in income concentration and provide additional evidence, we also compile the series of
top income composition, marginal tax rates, top estates and its composition, and top wage
income shares, all based on tax statistics.
        From our data, three main findings follow. First, income concentration at the top
1% income group in Japan was extremely high throughout the pre-WWII period with some
short-term fluctuations. Top income shares declined abruptly and precipitously during
WWII and remained remarkably low for the rest of the 20th century. Our data thus indicate
that the defining event for the evolution of income concentration in Japan was a historical
accident, namely the Second World War, which accompanied large-scale government
intervention, inflation, and war destruction.
        Second, using income composition data, we show that the dramatic fall in income
concentration at the top was primarily due to the collapse of capital income during WWII.
Evidence from estate tax statistics confirms the drastic decline in top wealth holdings
during and immediately after WWII. We argue that the transformation of the institutional
structure under the postwar occupational reforms, such as the abolishment of
primogeniture, the establishment of progressive tax, and the changes in corporate
governance and union structure, prevented the re-concentration of income. Importantly,
such redistributive government policies, which likely hindered the “natural” process of
capital accumulation, were accompanied by one of the most impressive and sustained
economic growths in modern history.
        Third, according to our wage income data, wage income concentration also fell
sharply during WWII. In sharp contrast to the United States where wage income inequality
has increased dramatically since the 1970s, top wage income shares in Japan have

1
  By contrast, comprehensive income tax was instituted in Prussia in 1891, in the United Kingdom in 1909, in
the United States in 1913, and in France in 1914, times at which the industrial revolution was already well
underway in those countries.


                                                     2
remained remarkably low in the last three decades. As employment income became a
major component of the top income after WWII, in addition to the collapse of capital
income, we identify the fall in wage income inequality as an important reason for the
permanent decline in income concentration. Comparing the Japanese and U.S. data in
more detail, we find that technological progress (i.e., skill-biased technological change) or
tax incentives (i.e., the reduction in marginal income tax rates) alone cannot account for
the divergent experience of the two countries. Instead we suggest institutional factors,
most notably corporate governance and internal labor markets, as important determinants
of wage inequality.
        We draw two broader lessons from Japan’s experience. First, our data indicate
that Japan achieved two “economic miracles” before and after WWII under very different
socio-economic conditions, casting immediate doubts on any theory that predicts simple
correlations between economic growth and income inequality. 2 Second, it was the
exogenous shock of WWII, rather than endogenous economic or political process, that
transformed Japan into more equitable society. Consistent with the experience in many
developing countries today, it underscores the difficulty of undertaking drastic
redistributive policies in the absence of major impetus.
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the preceding
literature on income inequality in Japan. Section 3 describes the data and estimation
methods. Section 4 presents our findings from the top income shares series, 1886-2002.
Section 5 investigates the causes of the observed changes in income concentration, using
the top income composition and top estates series. Section 6 presents the top wage
income shares series, 1929-2002. Section 7 provides comparative perspectives and
concludes. The detail description of our data and methods, as well as a complete set of
results, are presented in Appendix.


2. Literature Review

        By international standards, modern Japan has been widely perceived as a society
of relatively low income inequality (e.g., Sawyer (1976)). Although comparing income
statistics across nations is notoriously difficult and must be interpreted with caution, recent
OECD reports (Atkinson et al. (1995); Burniaux et al. (1998)) and Japanese government

2
  Our findings lend further support to the view that emphasizes the distinctiveness of the post-WWII economic
systems in Japan (Okazaki and Okuno-Fijiwara (1993); Noguchi (1995); Teranishi (2005)). In stark contrast to
the pre-WWII system that operated much like a neo-classical market economy, the post-WWII system seems
to have facilitated high economic growth and low income inequality.


                                                     3
studies (Nishizaki et al. (1998); Kokumin Seikatsukyoku (1999)) together offer a better
comparative picture. As Panel A of Table 1 shows, in the mid 1980s, Japan’s Gini
coefficient of the distribution of household income before tax and government transfers
was one of the lowest among major industrial nations. When we consider the distribution
of income after tax and government transfers, as one may expect, Northern European
welfare states ranked below Japan (see Panel B). Even though the income inequality in
Japan rose somewhat during the asset price appreciation in the late 1980s, Japan’s
ranking among the OECD countries remained approximately the same in the 1990s
(Burniaux et al. (1998)). In other words, one of the distinct characteristics of Japan today
is its low income inequality in the absence of government redistribution. When did Japan
become a nation of low income inequality? Or has Japan always been the so-called
“equal society”?
        There is an extensive body of empirical work – albeit published mostly in Japanese
– examining Japan’s income distributions during the 20th century.3 The lack of household
survey data has been a major obstacle in estimating the income distribution before WWII,
however. In the absence of such data, some scholars used income tax statistics.4 Most
notably, Shiomi (1933) and Hayakawa (1951) combined national income tax statistics and
local income tax records to estimate the income distributions of all households in selected
cities and years. Using similar methods and compiling comprehensive local income tax
data, Minami (1995, 1998) has recently provided the estimates of the income distribution
of all Japanese households in selected years. By contrast, Ono and Watanabe (1976)
studied the long-run changes in income inequality during the pre-WWII period, using
several indirect measures such as urban-rural and intra-industry wage differentials. They
also estimated the Pareto coefficients of the income distributions of high-income earners
based on national income tax data and found that the time trends in these coefficients
coincided with those indicated by the indirect measures. Otsuki and Takamatsu (1978)
calculated the Pareto coefficients from 1887 to 1940 using the average and minimum
household incomes based on the Long-term Economic Statistics (Ohkawa et al. (1974)).
        For the post-WWII period, several types of survey data became available. Wada
(1975) estimated the income distribution in the 1950s combining the Employment Status
Survey and the Farm Household Economics Survey. Mizoguchi and Takayama (1984)

and Mizoguchi and Terasaki (1995) used the People’s Living Conditions Survey to
examine the changes in income inequality from 1962 to 1990. The income distribution of
Japanese households can be also estimated from the Family Income and Expenditure
Survey (e.g., Ohtake (2005)) and the Income Redistribution Survey (e.g., Tachibanaki
(2000)). Because these surveys employ disparate sampling methods and income
definitions, the resulting estimates of income inequality can differ considerably.
         Figure 2 summarizes the long-run changes in income inequality based on the
above studies (for simplicity, we use the Gini coefficients to represent their findings). 5
Although the Gini coefficients in a given year differ across studies, they display coherent
time trends. First, the income inequality in Japan rose sharply from 1890 to 1940. Second,
after WWII, income inequality peaked around 1960, declined in the 1960s, and stabilized
in the 1970s. Third, the income inequality has been on the rise since 1980, although
scholars have disagreed over the extent of the increase. For example, in his recent study,
Tachibanaki (1998) has declared Japan as an equal society a “myth,” generating much
discussion among scholars, government officials, and the rest of population.6
         It is important to note that there is no data between 1940 and 1955. In addition, the
Gini coefficients before 1940 and after 1955 in Figure 2 cannot be compared due to major
data discontinuity. Nevertheless, general consensus among scholars based on indirect
evidence is that the income inequality dropped substantially between 1940 and 1955,
presumably due to WWII and post-war occupational reforms (Mizoguchi and Terasaki
(1995), p.61). One of the objectives of this study, therefore, is to compile new data that
enable us for the first time to compare the level of inequality between the pre- and post-
WWII periods and shed better light on the process of the alleged fall in income inequality.
Note also that most of the pre-WWII studies provide the estimates only for a handful of
years that may or may not be representative data points. Furthermore, since most of the
existing studies concern with the income distribution of entire population, we know
relatively little about high-income groups. 7 In particular, due to the problem of small
sample and top coding, household surveys cannot be used for a study of high income
earners.
         To fill these gaps, we construct continuous and homogeneous series of the top
income shares, i.e., the shares of total income accruing to the upper groups of the income
distribution, from 1886 to 2002. Although top income shares are not necessarily an ideal

measure of income inequality – as it does not reflect the shape of the bottom 95% of the
income distribution – they nonetheless provide valuable information about the degree of
income     concentration    that   likely   affects   entrepreneurial    incentives   and    capital
accumulation in a capitalist economy. Finally, because we employ the same methodology
used in the recent high income studies presented in Atkinson and Piketty (2006), we can
compare our data with that of other industrial nations and offer a comparative historical
analysis of income concentration.



3. Data and Methodology

         In this section, we describe briefly the nature of data and the methods of
estimation. A complete description can be found in Appendix at the end of the paper. Our
estimates of top income shares are based on income tax return statistics published
annually by the Japanese tax administration since the introduction of national income tax
in 1887.8 We define “fiscal year” as the year in which tax returns were processed and tax
collected, in contrast to “actual year” in which the income subject to taxation was earned.
We identify the correspondence between actual years and fiscal years based on income
tax laws and Japan National Tax Administration (1988), which is reported in columns (1)
and (2) in Table A0 in Appendix. Typically, the statistics present the number of taxpayers,
the amount of income reported by taxpayers, the amount of income tax paid, and the
composition of the reported income, all by income brackets.
         Income, in our definition, is a gross income before deductions of direct and payroll
taxes paid by individuals, but after employers’ payroll taxes and corporate income taxes. It
includes all income components reported in tax returns, namely, salaries and wages,
unincorporated business income, farm income, self-employment income, dividends,
interest, rents, royalties, and other small items. Realized capital gains, however, is
excluded from our definition of income for two reasons. First, realized capital gains were
not taxable before 1947 in Japan and thus missing from the income tax statistics. Second,
in general, realized capital gains form a volatile component of income with large
fluctuations and not a steady source of annual income. Thus, in this study, we focus on
the series that exclude capital gains.9

  We present results including capital gains in Appendix (see Section A.4.3 and Figure A1).


                                                  6
         Before 1950, the tax unit was “family” defined as a married couple (or a single
household head) with cohabitating dependents. Incomes of family dependents in a single
household were aggregated for tax purposes. Starting in 1950, the tax unit became
“individual,” whereby spouses were taxed separately on their incomes. To produce
homogeneous series over the entire period, we estimate top income shares using the
individual tax unit. Thus, our top income groups are defined relative to the total number of
adults, defined as age 20 and above, in Japan in each year based on official population
statistics (reported in column (4) in Table A0). Because of high exemption points, only a
small fraction of individuals filed income tax returns before 1947 (reported in column (6) in
Table A0). For this reason, our analysis is necessarily restricted to the high end of the
income distribution. That is, we can estimate the income share for the entire period of
1886-2002 only within the top 1% income group, while we also provide estimate of the top
5% income share for sub-periods.
         As the top tail of the income distribution is well approximated by a Pareto
distribution, we estimate the Pareto coefficient for each year using the tabulations of
taxpayers by income brackets. We then use simple parametric interpolation methods to
estimate the thresholds and average income levels of top income groups. As Table 2
shows, in 2002, the threshold income levels for the top 1% and 0.01% income groups in
Japan were $110,000 and $264,000, respectively. The top 0.01% income group in the
same year consisted of roughly 10,000 individuals who earned more than $649,000, and
their average income was $1.2 million.
         We estimate a top income share by dividing the amount of income accruing to a
top income group by total personal income computed from National Accounts for 1930-
2002 and from Long-Term Economic Statistics (Ohkawa et al. (1974)) for 1886-1929.10
The total and average real incomes per adult from 1886 to 2002 are reported in columns
(7) and (8) in Table A0. We convert current income to real income in 2002 yen, using the
CPI deflator from Long-Term Economic Statistics (Ohkawa et al. (1967)). Our top income
shares estimates are reported in Table A1 in Appendix.
         We estimate the composition of income accrued to the top 1% group, using
income composition statistics. For years in which composition data are reported by
income brackets, we use a Pareto interpolation method to obtain the top 1% estimates.
For years in which only aggregate composition data are published, we use these data.

10
  Note that estimates for total personal income before 1930 are less reliable than after 1930, introducing
potentially biases in our estimates. See the Appendix Section A.2 for a discussion and a sensitivity analysis.


                                                      7
Our top income composition series are reported in Table A2. We also estimate marginal
tax rates for the average individual in the top income groups from 1886 to 2002. The
estimates are made for an individual with a non-working spouse and two dependent
children and include standard deductions but exclude local taxes. The series are reported
in Table A3.
         Next, we construct top estates series using estate tax return statistics published
annually by the tax administration since 1905. Top estate groups are defined relative to
the total number of adult deaths in Japan in each year obtained from official population
statistics. Due to the difficulty in estimating total assets in Japan, the top estate series are
expressed in the level (as opposed to the share) in 2002 yen using the CPI deflator. Our
top estates estimates are reported in Table B1 in Appendix.11 We also provide estate
composition series, 1926-2002, using aggregate estate composition data, which are
presented in Table B2. Because estate compositions are not available by estate brackets,
we cannot produce homogenous top estate composition series.
         Finally, we compute top wage income shares using the similar methodology. For
the post-WWII period, wage income data are compiled from the Survey on Private Wages
and Salaries published by the tax administration annually since 1951.12 The survey covers
virtually all employees in the private sector but excludes government employees. Wage
income in our definition includes wages, salaries, bonuses, and allowances, but exclude
non-cash compensation and retirement benefits. Top groups are defined relative to the
total number of regular employees in the private sector in Japan. Our estimates of the
total wage income denominator are based on total salaries from National Accounts. For
the pre-WWII period, we use salary and bonus data reported in the income tax statistics
for the fiscal years 1930-1945. Top groups are defined relative to the total number of
regular employees in Japan. The total wage income denominators are based on total
salaries and wages from National Accounts.13 Table C1 in Appendix presents the number
of wage income earners and total wage income from 1929 to 2002. Our estimates for top
wage income shares for 1929-2002 are reported in Table C2, and marginal tax rates for
top wage income earners for 1951-2002 are presented in Table C3 in Appendix.
         Over the 116 years of our sample period, there are at least three major tax
reforms, in addition to numerous revisions in income and estate tax laws. These changes
11
   Due to the difficulty in reconstructing estate statistics for actual years, our top estates for 1905-57 are
imprecisely estimated. See Appendix Section B for a detailed discussion.

   Due to the limited data, our estimates for 1929-1944 are based on restrictive assumptions. See Appendix
Section C for a detailed discussion.

potentially affect the comparability of our data across years. Therefore, to construct
homogeneous series, we make a number of careful adjustments to the original data (see
Appendix for a complete description). There are two major challenges in constructing the
top income shares series that call for special attention.
       First, after the introduction of an extensive withholding system (gensen choshu
seido) in 1949, most individuals with only employment or pension income were no longer
required to file self-assessed income tax returns. As a result, even though most income
earners pay income taxes in Japan, only a minority of taxpayers is required to file a self-
assessed tax return. Fortunately, as mentioned above, the Japanese tax administration
publishes the wage income statistics from the withholding system that include virtually all
wage earners in the private sector. We thus use these data to complement the self-
assessed income tax statistics and produce top income shares series.
       The second and perhaps more serious issue is tax erosion and evasion, that is,
lawful and unlawful under-reporting of income by taxpayers. Because the self-assessed
income tax statistics are by definition based on reported income, there is a concern that
our data might reflect trends in tax avoidance and evasion rather than true changes in
income inequality. For example, compared to wage income that is captured at source,
farm income and business income in general are said to be subject to a higher degree of
tax evasion. In effort to avoid tax, employers often shift their compensation from cash to
perquisites. Most important, in the post-WWII period, all or part of interest and dividend
incomes are taxed separately at flat rates and withheld at source (gensen bunri kazei) and
missing from comprehensive income tax base. We discuss these problems associated
with tax avoidance and evasion in Section 5 and provide sensitivity analysis.


4. Top Income Shares in Japan, 1886-2002

4.1 Historical Background

       During the early Meiji period, Japan was predominantly a rural society based on
agriculture and handicraft industry. After the fiscal reform that resulted in the Matsukata
deflation in 1881-84, the Japanese economy began to modernize and grow rapidly (see
Figure 1). Large-scale corporations in modern industries, such as railroads and textiles,
were formed for the first time in the late 1880s. As a result, most historians regard 1886 as
the starting year of the industrial revolution in Japan (Minami (1981); Miyamoto et al.
(1995), Chapter 6). The proportion of employment in agriculture declined from 78% in

1876 to 65% in 1900; and fell further to 51% in 1920, and 42% in 1940 (NRUS (1959).
After WWII, it declined even faster from 44% in 1950, to 16% in 1973, and 7.3% in 1995.
       To provide an overview of our sample period, Figure 3 depicts the average real
income per adult and the CPI in Japan from 1886 to 2002. The average real income more
than quadrupled from 1886 to 1938, the peak year in the pre-WWII period. It grew
particularly fast from 1887 to the end of Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), during WWI
(1914-18), and during the period of military expansion (1932-38). Then the average
income declined sharply towards the end of WWII (1939-45) that destroyed much of the
nation’s physical and human capital. The two World Wars were accompanied by high
inflation. In particular, Japan experienced hyperinflation in 1944-48 during which
consumer prices rose by 5,300%. After the postwar U.S. Occupation (1945-52), the
average real income recovered quickly, surpassing the 1938 level by 1959. During the so-
called high-growth period of 1955-73, real average incomes increased by a factor of six,
achieving one of the fastest sustained economic growths in modern history. After the 1973
Oil Crisis, the income grew at a slower pace in 1975-90. Since the collapse of the asset
bubble in 1991, the average real income has declined for a decade. Except for the brief
period during the Oil Crises, the inflation rate has been stable throughout the post-1950
period in Japan.


4.2 Trends in Top Income Shares

       Figure 4 reports our estimates of the top 1% income share from 1886 to 2002 and
the next 4% (denoted as “top 5-1%”) income share for 1907-24, 1937-38, and 1947-2002.
We first focus on the top 1% income share series. Between 1886 and 1938, the top 1%
adult population in Japan received as much as 14 to 20% of total personal income. The
share, however, fell abruptly and precipitously from 1938 to 1945 from 20% to 6.4%, and
remained relatively stable at around 8% throughout the post-WWII period. There are fairly
large fluctuations in the top 1% income share before WWII: after a steep fall in 1886-91, it
declined temporarily during the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the Russo-Japanese War
(1904-05), WWI (1914-18), and the Great Depression (1929-31), each time followed by an
immediate recovery. In terms of the long-run trend, the top 1% income share was high
throughout the initial stage of industrialization in 1886-1913 with no clear positive trend.
Similarly, the extraordinary economic growth from 1950 to 1973 was accompanied by little
change in the top 1% income share. Finally, despite the recent concerns over rising




                                            10
income inequality, we observe only a modest increase in the top 1% income share in
Japan during the last ten years.
       The next 4% income share series displays a substantially different pattern. During
the pre-WWII period, although estimates are not available for some years, the share was
consistently smaller than the top 1% income share, where the next 4% population
received on average about 12% of total income. By contrast, after 1947 it has been
consistently and substantially larger than that of the top 1% and rose from 12% to 16%
between 1970 and 2000, becoming almost twice as large as the top 1% income share.
The most striking difference is that WWII did not have much impact on the next 4%
income share. Figure 4 thus suggests that the income de-concentration phenomenon that
took place during WWII was limited to within the top 1% income groups.
       Figure 5 demonstrates this point further by decomposing the top percentile into
three subgroups: the top 0.1%, the next 0.4% (“top 0.5-0.1%”), and the bottom half of the
top 1% (“top 1-0.5%”). Although the three series exhibit similar overall patterns, the higher
income group experienced the faster and larger fall in their share during WWII. While the
share of the top 1-0.5% group declined by 50% (from 4.0% to 2.0%) in 1941-45, for the
next 0.4% group it fell by more than 60% (from 6.7% to 2.5%) in 1938-45, and for the top
0.1% group it fell by 80% (from 9.2% to 1.9%) in 1938-45. Our series shows that the fall
for the top 0.01% income share is even more dramatic: it collapsed from 3.8% to 0.6% in
1938-45 and has remained around the same level for the rest of the 20th century (see
Table A1 in Appendix and Figure 9). Note also that, for the top 0.1% and 0.01% income
groups, their shares show a positive trend before WWII, indicating gradual concentration
of income at the very top.
       Finally, to provide a comparative perspective, Figure 6 plots the top 0.1% income
share series in Japan with that in the United States and France, estimated respectively by
Piketty and Saez (2003) and Piketty (2003) using the same methodology. The data
indicate that the top 0.1% income share in Japan was higher than in the United States or
Fance during the interwar period. Recall that the United States in the 1920s, in particular,
was the world’s technological leader with giant corporations in capital-intensive industries
that generated enormous fortunes (Chandler (1962)). Therefore, it is perhaps surprising to
observe that Japan, whose major exports were textiles and light machinery during the
same period, exhibited the similar level of income concentration. The top 0.1% income
share in the United States and France declined roughly in three stages, first during WWI,
then during the Great Depression, and finally during WWII. Interestingly, by the 1960s, the


                                             11
shares in all three countries had converged to 2%. The figure illustrates a sharp contrast
in the evolution of income concentration between the United States, on one hand, and
Japan and France, on the other hand, since 1980. While the top income shares in Japan
and France have remained low, the share in the United States has tripled in the last two
decades, returning to the pre-WWII level. In Section 6, we explore the divergent
experience of Japan and the United States using wage income tax statistics.


4.3 Trends in Top Income Composition

       To better understand the mechanisms that led to the drastic and permanent
decline in the top 1% income share during WWII in Japan, we use composition data from
the income tax statistics. In Figure 7, we decompose the top 1% income share into the
five categories: (a) employment income (wages, salaries, bonuses, allowances, and
pensions,   excluding    benefits-in-kind),   and   (b)   business   income   (profits   from
unincorporated businesses, farm income, and self-employment income), and (c) rental
income (from land and buildings, excluding imputed rents), and (d) interest income (from
bonds, deposits, and savings accounts, excluding returns on insurance policies), and (e)
dividends (from privately held and publicly traded stocks). Immediate caveats are in order.
       First, for 1886-1945, our estimates are based on the composition of total income
reported in the income tax statistics. During this period, the series are not homogenous as
the fractions of adults filing tax returns fluctuated between 1% and 4% (see Table A2 in
Appendix). Second, because most interest income has been either tax exempted or taxed
separately at source since 1947, and so were large part of dividends since 1965, these
components were missing from the income tax statistics (Iwamoto et al. 1995). Namely,
the disappearance of interest income and the low share of dividends after WWII in the top
1% income in our estimates can be due to the data limitation. Third, the introduction of the
withholding system in 1949 might have reduced tax evasion of wage earners. By contrast,
in the absence of such withholding system, a potentially large portion of business income
is said to be missing from the income tax statistics.
       With these caveats in mind, we make the following observations from the top
income composition data. First, throughout the 1886-1937 period, approximately 50% of
the top 1% income consisted of capital income (i.e., rents, interest, and dividends). Within
capital income, dividends steadily gained its share, while the share of interest income
declined. Although not shown in the figure, within rental income, farm rents were a major
component in the earlier years, but its share declined after 1915. Initially, the share of


                                              12
business income in the top 1% income was higher than the share of employment income,
but by 1930 the order was reversed. The decline of farm rents and the rise of employment
income likely reflect the gradual shift from an agrarian economy with concentrated land
ownership to an industrial economy with professional managers. Second, from 1937 to
1947, both the capital income and employment income components fell dramatically: right
after WWII, the top 1% income was almost entirely composed of business income. Third,
since 1950, the share of employment income in the top 1% income has increased steadily
at the expense of business income. This trend is likely due to the further shift towards a
highly industrialized economy with large corporations. Unlike the United States in the
similar stage of economic development, however, this shift was accompanied by little
increase in income concentration in Japan. Finally, after WWII, capital income has
become a less important component in the top 1% income.
           To assess the robustness of the above findings, we provide three additional
analyses. First, in Figure A3 in Appendix, we present the average composition of total
personal income in Japan from 1930 to 2002 based on National Accounts (in Panel A)
and compare with the top 1% income composition (in Panel B). It shows that the share of
capital income component in total personal income recovered from the collapse in WWII
only gradually: not until the 1980s the shares of dividends and interest came close to their
prewar peaks, and the share of rents has remained well below its prewar peak. As in the
top 1% income, the share of business income in total personal income also declined
monotonically and dramatically in the post-WWII period. 14 Second, we estimate top
income composition using an alternative source, a household wealth survey, which
includes the capital income components missing from the tax statistics. As we show in
Section 5.5, our findings are robust to the inclusion of the missing components. Third, we
examine the changes in wealth distribution using estate tax statistics, which we report in
next section.


4.4 Evidence from Top Estates

           Our income composition series suggest that capital income accrued to the top 1%
income group fell dramatically during WWII, never returned to the pre-WWII level, and
was replaced by employment income. Total capital income in the economy, however, did
recover albeit gradually. Then the fall in the top capital income must have been caused by

                                                       13
a permanent decline in wealth concentration. In order to test this hypothesis, we turn to
estate tax return statistics published annually since the introduction of estate tax in 1905.15
         Figure 8 plots the average sizes (in real 2002 yen) of the top 0.01% estates and
the bottom half of top 1% estates (“top 1-0.5%”) from 1905 to 2002 in logarithmic scale.
The top 0.01% estates, namely, the “very top” wealth holdings, correspond to the roughly
top 100 decedents in 2002, whose average was about 5 billion yen or $40 million.16 By
contrast, the average of the bottom half of top 1% estates, namely, the “moderately high”
wealth holdings, was about 310 million yen or $2.5 million in the same year.17 According
to the figure, both the top 0.01% and 1-0.5% estates increased substantially from 1905 to
1936. The top 0.01% estates then declined precipitously by a factor of 140 from 1936 to
1949, and the top 1-0.5% estates declined by a factor of 18 during the same period. In
contrast to top incomes, top estates not only fell dramatically in 1941-45 but also
continued to fall during the initial four years of the postwar occupational reforms. Both
estate levels grew rapidly during the high economic growth period of 1955-73, but they
have been on decline since the burst of the asset bubble in 1991. While the level of the
top 1-0.5% estates surpassed the pre-WWII peak by 1970, the level of top 0.01% estates
in 2002 is still smaller (in real terms) than in 1936 in spite of a ten-fold increase in GDP
per capita.
         When we compare the two series, the top 0.01% estates were initially about 50
times larger than the bottom half of top 1% estates, and by the 1930s, about 100 times
larger. Because of the differential impact of WWII and the postwar reforms on the two
estate levels, however, by 1949 the former were only about 20 times larger than the latter.
Moreover, this ratio has remained fairly constant from 1950 to 2002 despite the changes
in macro economic conditions during these years. In other words, there was a permanent
decline in the level of the top wealth relative to the moderately high wealth after 1950.
         Table 3 presents estate compositions for selected years, 1935, 1950, and 1987,
for which the fraction of adult decedents filing estate tax returns are constant at about




15
   Due to the data limitation, our top estates series are less precisely estimated than top income share series.
See Appendix Section B and Table B1 for complete results and a detailed discussion.
16
   Due to the small sample size (50 to 100), year-to-year estimates of the top 0.01% estates can be sensitive
to the presence of a single extremely large wealth holder.
17
   Although $2.5 million may still seem large, given the high real estate prices in Japan, an upper-middle
income class family owning a large apartment in Tokyo could leave an estate of that size. Studies suggest that
the average household assets are considerably higher in Japan than in the United States (see Takayama
(1992), Chapter 1).

9%.18 Estates are decomposed into: (1) land (both farm and residential), (2) houses and
structures, (3) business assets (unincorporated business assets and farm assets), (4)
stocks, (5) fixed claim assets (bonds, cash, deposits, and savings accounts), and (6) other
assets (including household properties, pensions, and life insurances). The figure shows
that the largest component of the top 9% estates shifted from financial assets (stocks and
fixed claim assets) in 1935 to movable properties (business assets, houses and
structures, and household properties) in 1950, to real estate (predominantly residential
land) in 1987. The share of stocks and fixed claims assets in the top estates declined
sharply from 49% in 1935 to 15% in 1950, and then rose to 22% in 1987. Namely, the
share of financial assets in large estates in the midst of the bubble period was still less
than half of that in 1935. Thus the top estate composition data provide additional evidence
for our claim that the shares of dividends and interest in the top income collapsed during
WWII and have not returned to the pre-WWII level to date.
        To summarize, our top estates series suggest that a permanent reduction in the
level of the top wealth relative to the moderately high wealth took place during and
immediately after WWII. This dramatic fall in wealth concentration at the top is not only
consistent with our findings from the top income shares series, but also provides better
insights as to why the precipitous decline in top income shares was concentrated within
the top 1% income group. WWII and the occupational reforms had a very large impact on
the high end of the wealth distribution, destroying much of the source of capital income.
Because in general the share of capital income in total income increases with the size of
income, top income earners likely suffered a disproportionately large loss of their income.
In other words, our data suggest that WWII and the subsequent reforms had an
irreversible effect in wiping out high-income rentiers.



5. Understanding the Evolution of Income Concentration

        Using the income and estate tax statistics, we have documented that (1) income
concentration in Japan was extremely high during 1886-1940 by both historical and
international standards; (2) the drastic de-concentration of income at the top took place in
1938-45; (3) income concentration has remained low throughout the post-WWII period; (4)
the size of top wealth relative to moderately high wealth declined sharply in 1936-49 and
stayed low, and (5) top income composition has shifted dramatically from capital and

B.2 for details.


                                                 15
business incomes toward employment income over the course of the 20th century. In this
section, we explore the causes of the evolution of income concentration.


5.1 High Income Concentration in pre-WWII Japan

         One of the merits of our data is that they allow a quantitative comparison of
income concentration before and after WWII. Our findings strongly confirm the received
view based largely on qualitative evidence that there was high concentration of income
and wealth among the elite class in prewar Japan. 19 Preceding studies suggest three
major constituencies of the very rich: landlords, shareholders, and corporate executives.
         First, there was a concentration of land ownership to a small number of “absentee
landlords” (fuzai jinushi) mostly in rural areas whose lands were cultivated by tenant
farmers. Especially in the earlier years, landowners enjoyed social and economic
privileges over their tenants. After WWI, however, both the commercialization of
agriculture and the rise of tenant unions led to lower rents and stronger tenant rights
(Waswo and Nishida (2003), pp.14-7). As a result, large landowners began to diversify
their assets and invest in financial and industrial assets. These observations are
consistent with the substantive farmland rents component in the top 1% income during
1886-1915 and its gradual decline thereafter in our income composition data.
         Second, before WWII, large firms raised its capital primarily from stock markets,
and business ownership was heavily concentrated on a small number of individual (as
opposed to institutional) shareholders. For example, Okazaki (2000) finds that, in 1935, at
ten largest zaibatsu firms, top 10 shareholders held as much as 66% of total stocks
(pp.103-5). In addition, prewar firms paid out high dividends to their shareholders.
According to the study by Miyamoto et al. (1995) based on corporate charters of fifty
companies in the 1880s, on average 70% of profit was distributed to shareholders as
dividends (p.276). Okazaki (1993) also finds that, in the 1930s the average dividend to
profit ratio at leading manufacturing firms was close to 70%, while it was less than 50% in
the 1950s (p.184).



19
   According to our data, the top income shares stayed relatively flat or increased only modestly from 1890 to
1940. By contrast, as Figure 2 shows, concerning the income distribution of all households, the preceding
studies find a sharp increase in income inequality during the same period. Our findings are not necessarily
contradictory to these results, if the increase was driven by the changes in the lower end of the income
distribution. In fact, Mizoguchi and Terasaki (1995) and Minami (1995) attribute the rising income inequality in
1890-1940 primarily to the widening rural and urban income gap and the increasing intra-industry wage
differentials.


                                                      16
        Third, during the interwar period, top management at large corporations received
extremely high compensation. In addition to high monthly salary, they were rewarded
large year-end bonuses. According to Miyamoto and Abe (1995), the same fifty corporate
charters stipulated that 10% of profit be distributed as executive bonuses (p.276). At
leading manufacturing firms, directors on average received 6% of profit in the form of
bonus in the 1930s, compared to 2% in the 1960s (Okazaki (1993), p.184). At five leading
electric power companies, executive bonus was 28 times larger than the average income
per capita in 1936, while in 1955 it was only 1.5 times larger (Minami (1995), p.123). By
contrast, paying bonus for rank-and-file employees was an exception rather than a norm
in prewar firms. Moreover, large shareholders themselves were often corporate directors
in prewar firms, exacerbating the income concentration. For example, Okazaki (2000)
finds that, at twenty leading manufacturing firms, top ten shareholders held 23% of the
director positions in 1935, while they held none after 1947 (pp.103-5).
        In a unique study using individual-level data, Yazawa (1992) compares the 5,000
highest income taxpayers in 1936 and 1982 based on Who’s Who that published their
names, income tax paid, addresses, and occupational titles. He finds that, out of the top
5,000 income earners in 1936 – which corresponds roughly to the top 0.01% income
group in our study – 31% were in retail business, 22% were in manufacturing, 22% were
in finance, and 7% had no occupation (pp.155-9). He also shows that they were
concentrated in metropolitan areas, such as Tokyo (45%) and Osaka (25%).20 Only 2.2%
of them, however, were the members of aristocracy and only 3.0% were affiliated with
zaibatsu holding companies, which indicates that the importance of aristocrats and
zaibatsu families among the elite class should not be overstated (pp.160-6).
        Last but not least, the legal system in prewar Japan proved favorable to the
affluent class. Initially, both the 1886 income tax law and the 1905 estate tax law set
extremely low tax rates in which the highest possible rates were 3% and 1.8%,
respectively. Although the rates were increased subsequently, until the 1937 temporary
tax increase law, the effective marginal tax rates for top income and estates groups had
remained low (see Table A3 in Appendix). In addition, the prewar estate tax law endorsed
primogeniture and allowed the first-born son (or a designated legal heir) to inherit entire
family estates as a family head under preferential tax rates and high exemption points. In

rural prefectures (p.149).


                                                    17
other words, with the minimum government intervention, rich families could accumulate
their wealth over several generations before WWII.


5.2 Mechanisms of Income De-concentration in 1938-1945

       Our   data   indicate   that   the   top   income   shares   fell   precipitously   and
disproportionately during WWII, but not at all during the occupational reforms. We explore
the two key questions in turn: how did WWII reduce the income concentration in such a
short period of time, and why did the occupational reforms have such little impact?
       WWII likely caused the drastic income de-concentration through three main
channels: wartime regulations, inflation, and war destruction. First of all, after the 1937
China Incident and the promulgation of the 1938 National General Mobilization Act, the
military government implemented a set of regulations affecting landlord rights, shareholder
rights, and executive compensation (Hoshi (1998), Hoshi and Kashyap (2001), Chapter 3;
Okazaki (1993)). With respect to landlords, the government facilitated the redistribution of
farmland from landlords to tenants in 1938 and 1943, regulated rents and land prices
starting in 1939, introduced a two-tier price system for rice production in 1941 under which
the government paid much higher prices to owner- and tenant-farmers than to landlords,
and revised land and house lease laws in 1941 to augment tenant rights (Waswo and
Nishida (2003), pp.22-3). Although their primary goal was to stimulate food production, all
of these measures reduced both land value and rental income for landlords.
       With respect to shareholders, the government regulated dividends starting in 1939,
and capped a dividend-to-equity ratio at 8% in 1940 and at 5% in 1945. As the ratio at
major companies before WWII often exceeded 10%, the regulation considerably lowered
the returns on stocks. Moreover, the pressure on shareholders led to the decline in the
number of shareholders in director positions at major companies after 1940 (Okazaki
(2000), p.108). The government also regulated interest rates for private bonds in order to
encourage the absorption of government bonds, reducing the returns on corporate bonds.
With respect to executives, the government controlled wages and salaries starting in 1939
and placed a ceiling on executive bonuses in 1940. The 1938 law mandated the
establishment of works councils, aiming at productivity increase through employee
empowerment. These measures likely compressed not only inter-firm but also within-firm
pay differentials during WWII. As shown in Figure 7, the changes in the different
components of the top 1% income coincide well with the timing of the corresponding
wartime regulations, indicating their importance in reducing income concentration.


                                             18
         Moreover, despite the stringent controls, the price level began to surge after 1938
and rose dramatically towards the end of WWII (see Figure 3). The inflation likely played
a key role in reducing the top estates, as it diminished the real value of fixed claim assets
(e.g., bonds and deposits). It also likely played a role in the collapse of the top capital
income, because it reduced not only interest income but also rental income as the 1941
lease laws made it difficult for landlords to increase rents. Furthermore, to finance the
rapid military expansion, the government increased individual and corporate income taxes
in 1937, 1938, 1940, 1942, 1944, and 1945 (Japan National Tax Administration (1988)).
The sharp increase in corporate tax rates mechanically reduced dividend distributions
from corporations to shareholders.21
         Finally, WWII led to large-scale destruction of physical and human capital that
claimed 25% of physical assets and 668,000 civilian casualties by the end (Keizai Antei
Honbu (1947)). In particular, repeated air raids of major cities by the U.S. air force starting
in March 1945 likely had a devastating effect on the high income earners who were
concentrated in the metropolitan areas (Yazawa and Minami (1993), p.366). Note,
however, that the late timing of the bombing implies that it could not have been a major
reason for the income de-concentration that had started in 1938. In summary, WWII can
be seen as a one-time shock that reduced income and wealth inequality in Japan through
the combination of government regulations, inflation, and war destruction.


5.3 Impact of U.S. Occupational Reforms in 1945-1952

         Upon Japan’s surrender in August 1945, the nation was placed under the indirect
governance of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers until 1952. As preceding
studies have emphasized, the postwar occupational reforms could potentially have a large
effect in equalizing the income distribution (Yazawa and Minami (1993); Minami (1995)).
Three particularly powerfully redistributive measures were implemented during this period.
         First, the land reform in 1947-1950 mandated landlords to sell their farmland to ex-
tenants, eliminating virtually all large- and medium-sized landowners. As a result, the
percentage of land cultivated by tenants declined sharply from 46% in 1941 to 9% in
1955. Due to hyperinflation, compensation paid to landowners in real terms was a mere
fraction of the land value. Second, to finance its large deficits, the government imposed


21
  At the same time, one may suspect that the higher marginal tax rates would have invited a higher degree of
tax avoidance and evasion. Although we cannot deny this possibility, as discussed later, it was also true that
the government intensified their effort to collect taxes during WWII.


                                                     19
extremely heavy and highly progressive property tax (zaisan zei) from 1946 to 1951. The
property tax affected approximately 13% of all households in Japan in the initial year, and
taxed away on average 33% of their properties. For the top 5,000 households, more than
70% of their properties were transferred to the government.
        Third, under the dissolution of zaibatsu in 1946-48, not only ex- and current
directors of zaibatsu firms were expelled, but also their stocks were confiscated and
redistributed to a large number of employees and other investors at a market price.
Consequently, these three measures transferred a significant amount of assets (i.e., land,
stocks, and other household properties) from the high to the lower end of distribution. In
addition, the hyperinflation in 1944-48 hit hard high-income rentiers. By contrast, farmers
and small business owners who sold their products in underground markets were said to
have earned substantive income in the immediate postwar years, explaining the surge of
business income component in the top 1% income in Figure 7.
        Despite the emphasis placed on the importance of the occupational reforms in
reducing income inequality in the literature, our data indicate that, although they affected
the top estate levels, they had practically no impact on the top income shares. Namely, we
find WWII, rather than the occupational reforms, as the single most important event in
reducing income concentration. Our finding may seem surprising at first, but the following
observations indicate otherwise. First, our finding is consistent with the view that the
occupational reforms were in many ways a continuation of the wartime policies (Okazaki
and Okuno (1993); Noguchi (1995); Teranishi (2005)). That is, the restrictions on landlord
and shareholder rights, the adoption of progressive taxation, and the check on executive
compensation had already begun during WWII, which likely had set off the process of
income de-concentration well before the postwar democratization and demilitarization. As
such, there was little room left for the occupational reforms in further reducing top
incomes.22 By contrast, our top estates series indicate that the reforms did have a large
effect in reducing wealth concentration, whose implications will be discussed in next
section.
        Second, our finding is also consistent with the comparative evidence that indicates
a universal role of WWII in reducing income concentration in such diverse countries as the


22
  It is also likely that some redistributive measures equalized income at the lower end of the distribution
without changing the mean. For example, the land reform redistributed land primarily from middle-sized
landowners to tenants, creating a large number of small-sized farmers. In such cases, we may not observe
much change in the top 1% income share.




                                                    20
United Kingdom, France, the United States, and Canada (Atkinson and Piketty, 2006).
Note that none of these countries was occupied after WWII and some did not even
experienced major war destruction in their homelands. But, without exception, the war
was accompanied by large-scale government intervention and inflation in these countries.
In short, in the absence of quantitative evidence, the preceding studies have likely
overstated the effect of the occupational reforms in equalizing income in Japan.


5.4 Low Income Concentration in Post-WWII Japan

       Perhaps the more challenging question is why the top income shares did not
recover from the profound yet temporary shock of WWII in the decades that followed. Why
has the degree of income concentration in Japan remained at the historic low reached in
the late 1940s? We argue that it was in this context that the occupational reforms played a
critical role. Most simply, by redistributing assets and reducing wealth (as opposed to
income) concentration, they equalized the distribution of capital income in subsequent
years. More importantly, deriving their origins from the wartime policies, the postwar
reforms transformed the one-time measures into lasting ones, facilitating a structural
change in the Japanese economy that likely prevented re-concentration of income in
subsequent decades.
       First, the fiscal reforms in 1950 made progressive taxation a permanent feature of
the Japanese tax system. Recall that the enormous fortunes that generated the high top
1% income share in the pre-WWII period had been accumulated at the time when
progressive income tax hardly existed and capitalists could reinvest almost all of their
incomes for further capital accumulation. The fiscal environment faced by capitalists after
WWII was vastly different. As Figure 9 shows, after a spike in 1945-50 caused by
temporary tax increases and hyperinflation, the marginal tax rate for the top 0.01% income
group stayed high at around 60% from 1950 until the tax reform in the late 1980s. Tax
rates on corporate income show similar trends. With respect to estate tax, the 1947 law
abolished primogeniture and mandated the division of estate among surviving spouse and
children, and the 1950 law instituted highly progressive estate and gift taxes with top rates
in excess of 70%. As a result, inter-generational transfers of large wealth became much
more difficult after WWII. Progressive taxation likely hindered the re-accumulation of large
wealth, resulting in more equal distribution of capital income.
       Second, the permanent decline in the share of capital income in the top income
can be further attributed to measures specific to each capital income component. Since


                                             21
the introduction of the land and house lease laws in 1941 until their repeal in 1992, the
government had heavily protected tenant rights, which depressed the supply of rental
housing. As a result of both high home ownership rate and more equal land distribution,
rental income became a less significant source of income for top income earners in the
postwar period. As for interest income, the government expanded tax-exempted saving
instruments for small asset holders since the 1960s until they were abolished in 1988.
These measures had likely promoted wealth accumulation among the middle class,
equalizing the distribution of interest income. With respect to dividend income, a new
corporate governance system characterized by bank-centered debt finance and cross-
shareholdings among affiliated companies likely resulted in stable institutional
shareholders and low dividend rates (Fukao (1995); Teranishi (2000)). As a result,
dividends too became less concentrated among top income groups in postwar Japan.
       Third, the changes in human resource management and union structure in Japan
likely compressed wage distributions within firms. As the so-called “lifetime employment”
became a hallmark of human resource management at large firms in the 1960s, most if
not all management positions were filled by long-term employees promoted from within
(Okazaki (2000)). Moreover, after violent confrontations in 1945-1955, most large firms in
Japan were organized by single enterprise unions that represented both white- and blue-
collar employees of the firms. By the 1970s, management regularly consulted with unions
over personnel matters including wages and promotions (Morishima (1991); Moriguchi
(2000); Kato and Morishima (2002)). These changes likely resulted in less wage
differentials between white- and blue-collar employees as well as more equitable
executive compensation. We will turn to wage income statistics to examine these
hypotheses more closely in Section 6.


5.5 The Effects of Tax Evasion and Avoidance

       In the above analysis, we provided historical explanations for the evolution of the
top income shares estimated from the income tax statistics. As discussed briefly in
Section 3, however, the incomes reported by individuals for tax purposes are subject to
lawful and unlawful under-reporting, and hence may not reflect their true economic
incomes. In this section, we discuss what is known about the extent of tax evasion and
avoidance in Japan, and provide sensitivity analysis to show whether our findings can be
explained away by these phenomena.




                                           22
        The precipitous and permanent drop in income concentration after WWII could be
explained by tax evasion only if the evasion among top income groups relative to the rest
of the population increased dramatically during WWII and remained high ever since. One
may assume that tax evasion must have been rampant during WWII when labor and
material shortages disrupted normal functioning of any administration. Yet, seeking
additional sources for war finance, the government not only imposed various temporary
taxes but also tightened the monitoring over tax collection during the war. For instance,
both the numbers of local tax offices and their personnel rose during WWII (Japan
National Tax Administration (1988)). Second, it is unlikely that tax evasion was lower in
the prewar period when the tax administration was smaller and when most businesses did
not compile systematic accounting records. By contrast, after WWII, both the enforcement
power and technology available for the tax administration were considerably expanded,
and most economic transactions took place within large corporations or financial
institutions that used accounting methods leaving records that the tax administration could
examine. For instance, it is widely believed that there is little tax evasion in Japan today
concerning employment, dividend, and interest incomes, precisely because the
sophisticated withholding system captures these incomes at source with the cooperation
from corporate employers and financial institutions.
        By contrast, tax evasion is considered to be substantially higher for business and
farm incomes for which the withholding system does not apply. 23 According to the
estimate by Hayashi (1987), while nearly 100% of employment incomes were captured,
only 50% of business income and 10% of farm income were reported to the tax
administration. However, both business and farm income components in the top income
are so small in recent years that it would require rates of evasion an order of magnitude
higher than these estimated rates to generate the top income shares as high as in the pre-
WWII period. For example, if we assume that only 10% of farm income and 50% of
business income are reported in 1999, then our estimate of the top 1% income share
would increase modestly from 7.8% to 8.5%. 24 In short, it is difficult to argue that the
apparent permanent decline in income concentration was due to tax evasion or unlawful
under-reporting of income.


23
   Most advanced countries face similar problems. For example, in the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service also
estimates that most income tax evasion takes place among small business owners.
24
   In 1999, business income and farm income represent 8.3% and 0.1% of reported incomes in the top1%
income group. With no evasion, they would represent 16.6% and 1%, respectively, and the top 1% income
share would be approximately 9% larger than our estimate.


                                                     23
         In addition to tax evasion, individuals may shift their income using legal means and
instruments to reduce tax payments. One such example is the usage of non-cash
compensation instead of wages, which will be discussed in Section 6.2. Another way is to
take advantage of special exemptions. As stated earlier, during the post-WWII period,
various special treatments had been given to different components of capital income,
most notably, interest, dividends, and realized capital gains (Iwamoto et al. (1995)). These
treatments effectively allowed taxpayers to pay tax separately at source (gensen bunri
kazei), instead of aggregating these components to other incomes and face progressive
income tax schedule. As a result, the self-assessed income tax statistics do not include
these capital income components. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the impact of the
missing capital income components on our estimates of the top income shares.
         The best available source for estimating the distribution of capital income by
income group is the comprehensive household survey, National Survey of Family Income
and Expenditure (NSFIE). 25 In particular, the NSFIE in 1999 reports the holdings of
various financial assets per household tabulated by the size of household head’s income.
We combine these asset distribution data and National Accounts data to estimate the
shares of three capital income components missing from the tax statistics (i.e., interest,
dividends, and the returns on life and other insurance policies) in total income for various
top income groups. In Table 4, we compare our estimates from the income tax statistics in
1999 (in Panel B) with the estimates from the NSFIE in the same year (in Panel C). Three
observations follow.
         First, the estimated average incomes from the NSFIE coincide well with those from
the tax statistics up to the top 1% income group. For the top 0.5% income group, the two
estimates differ significantly, however. Because the NSFIE uses a representative sample
(about 50,000 households) that contains few observations at the high end of income
distribution, it is difficult to provide precise estimates for the top 0.5% income group and
above using NSFIE data. It is important to note that we find no systematic downward bias
in estimating the average incomes using tax statistics compared to the NSFIE. The claim
that the tax statistics are useless due to systematic under-reporting is thus not necessarily
valid.
         Second, according to Iwamoto et al. (1995), in recent decades, because of tax
exemptions and separate taxation at source, approximately 80% of dividend income, over

25
  Statistics Bureau of Japan, National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (Zenkoku Shohi Jittai
Chosa). See Appendix Section D for a detailed discussion.


                                                24
99% of interest income, and 100% of the returns on insurance savings are not subject to
the progressive income tax and not included in the self-assessed income tax statistics.
The NSFIE estimates indicate that, compared to the national average, the higher income
group receives larger portions of their income as dividends but smaller portions of their
income as interest or the returns on insurance policies. Furthermore, even in the NSFIE
data, the three capital income components make up very small portion of total income for
the top income groups. For example, they respectively constitute 1.9%, 2.2%, and 4.5% of
total income for the bottom half of the top 1% income group (the column “top 1-0.5%” in
Panel C). Taken together, the table suggests that these components are not particularly
concentrated at the top of the income distribution in today’s Japan.
       Third, Panel A shows that interest and dividends constitute only a small share
(2.8%) of total personal income in Japan. Even if we make the extreme assumption that
all dividends and interest income go to the top 1% income group, it would increase the top
1% income share by 2.8 percentage point from 7.8% to 10.6%. Observe that this upper
bound estimate is still substantially smaller than the pre-WWII share of 16%.
       We provide similar sensitivity analysis for 1979-1999, using the NSFIE data. Our
results are reported in Table D1 in Appendix. Consistent with the estimates from the
income tax statistics, the table shows that there is only a very modest increase in the top
top 5% income shares during this period. The share of the three capital income
components in total income for the top 5% group was only moderately higher than the
national average in 1979 and 1984, and was actually lower than the national average in
1989, 1994, and 1999. Therefore, fully incorporating the missing components would have
only small effects (a slight increase in the 1980s and a slight decrease in the 1990s) on
our estimates for the top income shares. In summary, adding back the missing capital
income components would not change our main conclusion that the degree of income
concentration fell drastically in Japan from the pre-WWII to post-WWII period.



6. Top Wage Income Shares in Japan, 1929-2002

6.1 Trends in Wage Income Concentration

       In this section, we present our estimates of top wage income shares in Japan to
investigate the role of employment income in the evolution of income concentration. Wage
income in our definition includes wages, salaries, bonuses, and pecuniary benefits, but
excludes non-cash compensation and retirement benefits. For the pre-WWII period, we


                                             25
use salary and bonus data reported in annual income tax statistics for fiscal years 1930-
45 (corresponding to actual years 1929-44). For the post-WWII period, we use wage
income statistics in the Survey on Private Wages and Salaries published annually by the
tax administration since 1951. Our estimates of the top 5% and 1% wage income shares
series in Japan are shown in Figures 10 and 11.
       First, during 1929-1935, Japan exhibited a high degree of wage income
concentration where the top 5% received more than 20% of total wage income and the top
1% received about 8% of total wage income. As one might expect, the degree of wage
income concentration is smaller than that of income concentration during the same period
(8% versus 16% for the top 1% group). High wage income inequality in Japan during the
interwar period can be explained by large intra- and inter-firm wage differentials. As
discussed above, wages and bonuses paid to top management, white-collar employees,
production workers, and unskilled laborers within the same firm were widely dispersed
before WWII, resulting in high within-firm wage inequality (Showa Dojinkai (1960), p.269
and p.263). In addition, with the growth of heavy industries with high capital intensity,
productivity gap by industry as well as by firm size had widened since the First World War,
resulting in substantial inter-firm wage differentials (Yasuba (1976)).
       Second, we observe a sharp decline in wage income concentration from 1935 to
1944, as the top 5% wage income share fell from 23% to 9% and the top 1% share from
8.9% to 3.2%. This 64% decline in the top 1% wage income share in 1935-44 is
comparable to the 68% decline in the top 1% income share in 1938-45. According to our
income composition data in Figure 7, the share of employment income in the top 1%
income remained fairly stable until 1940 and then dropped sharply in 1940-47. Therefore,
we attribute the initial decline in wage income concentration in 1935-40 to the tightening of
labor markets due to military expansion that compressed the wage distribution from
below. The further decline in 1940-44 is likely due to the wartime regulations that capped
executive bonus and standardized wages across firms. Although the decline in income
concentration was largely a capital income phenomenon, the data indicate that
employment income also played an important role.
       Third, in the post-WWII period, top wage income shares rose substantially from
1951 to 1961, and then declined gradually over the next two decades. This initial increase
is consistent with our income composition data that show the recovery of the employment
income component in the top 1% income after WWII. It is worth noting that the trends in
the top wage income shares parallel the trends in the income inequality of all households


                                              26
documented by the preceding studies (see Figure 2). Minami (1995b) attributes the rise in
income inequality in the 1950s and its decline in the 1960s to the Japan’s transition from
the chronic labor surplus before 1960 to the chronic labor shortage after 1960.
Considering the top wage income shares, their decline in the 1960s and 1970s can be
further attributed to the diffusion of the so-called “Japanese-style” management, including
lifetime employment, enterprise unionism, and joint labor-management consultation that
tended to compress within-firm wage dispersion (Gordon (1985); Aoki (1988)). For
example, by the end of the 1960s, executives at large firms were entirely promoted from
within (Okazaki 2000). In sharp contrast to the pre-WWII period, bonuses were no longer
paid disproportionately to top executives but distributed more equally among regular
employees. In fact, recent studies indicate that the average ratio of bonus to total
compensation in Japan is 20 to 30% for both corporate executives and rank-and-file
employee (Hart and Kawasaki (1999); Kubo (2004)).
        Finally, despite the concern about the rising income inequality in Japan over the
last two decades (Tachibanaki (1995, 2005)), we find only a slight increase in the top 5%
and 1% wage income shares. This is consistent with Ohtake (2005) who finds a relatively
modest increase in income inequality due largely to demographic changes, such as the
rise in single-person and old-age households in Japan.


6.2 Comparative Analysis of Japan and the United States

        To facilitate international comparison, we also plot the top wage income shares in
the United States, estimated by Piketty and Saez (2003), in Figures 10 and 11. In
addition to wages, salaries, bonuses, and pecuniary benefits, U.S. wage income includes
stock options. In Japan, stock option became legal only after 1997, and its usage has
been limited both in the number of firms and the amount of stocks granted.26 As a result,
inclusion of stock options would not change our Japanese estimates.
        The figures indicate that the top wage income shares were roughly comparable in
the two countries during 1929-35. Then wage income concentration in both countries fell
sharply by the end of WWII. In contrast to Japan, however, U.S. top wage income shares
had remained low in the 1950s and 1960s. As a result, Japan and the United States
exhibited the similar degree of wage income concentration at the end of the 1960s. The
pattern of wage income concentration has sharply diverged between the two countries

26
  Naito and Fujiwara (2004). pp.255-60. Various restrictions on stock options remained until the further
revision of the commercial law in 2002.


                                                  27
since the 1970s, however. While the top 1% wage income share in Japan has been nearly
constant at around 5% from 1970 to 2000, the share in the United States has risen
exponentially from 5% to 12% during the same period. Consequently, today, the United
States exhibits a much higher degree of wage income concentration than in Japan.
        One may question that the wage income concentration in Japan is seriously
underestimated because Japanese companies make extensive use of non-cash
compensation, such as company housing and expense account. According to Abowd and
Kaplan (1999), the inclusion of in-kind benefits and perquisites to the sum of salary,
bonus, and stock options would raise total compensation for Japanese CEOs in 1988-96
by 32% and for American CEOs by 10%. Taking an extreme case where the top 1% wage
income earners receive all perquisites,27 this would increase the Japanese share in 1992
from 4.8% to 6.4% and the U.S. share from 9.6% to 10.6%. In other words, although the
inclusion of non-cash compensation would certainly reduce the difference, the top 1%
wage income share would have been substantially higher in the United States than in
Japan by the early 1980s.
        What explains the diverging trends in wage income concentration between the two
countries then? Note that, by 1980, Japan had virtually caught up with the United States in
both the level of income per capita and the stage of industrialization, as both countries
entered the third industrial revolution characterized by high technology industries.
Therefore, on the contrary to what recent skill-biased technological progress theories have
posited (see Acemoglu (2002) for a survey), the comparative experience of the United
State and Japan suggests that technology alone cannot account for the change in wage
inequality. At the very least, elements other than technology – demographic changes,
government policies, and institutional factors (e.g., labor markets, social norms regarding
pay inequality) – have to be taken into consideration. Although understanding the relative
contributions of those elements is beyond the scope of this paper, below we briefly
examine the effect of income tax policies on wage inequality.
        To assess the impact of income tax rates on wage income distribution, Figure 12
presents the top 0.1% wage income share and the effective marginal income tax rates
faced by this group in Japan (in Panel A) and the United States (in Panel B) from 1960 to
2002. In the United States, a number of influential studies, such as Lindsey (1987) and
Feldstein (1995), have argued that the reductions in the top marginal tax rates since the

27
   We assume so to provide an upper bound for the Japanese estimate, as perquisites are most likely
distributed more equally among all employees in Japan than in the United States.


                                                28
1970s – especially the sharp reduction in the late 1980s – were the key factor that drove
up high wage incomes. According to their view, referred to as supply-side theory, lower
income tax rates would increase reported incomes through higher labor supply and/or a
shift from tax-exempted forms of compensation to taxable cash compensation. Their
conclusions have been challenged by subsequent studies and remain controversial (see
Saez (2004) for an extensive survey). It is in this context that Japan’s experience may
offer a new insight. As shown in Panel A, the marginal tax rate faced by the top 0.1%
wage income earners in Japan has also declined by 2% between 1980 and 2000, the
magnitude roughly comparable to that in the United States between 1970 and 1987.
These reductions, however, have failed to generate any supply-side effects in Japan. The
comparative experience of Japan and the United States thus also rules out tax incentives
as the primary determinant of wage inequality. In case of Japan, highly developed internal
labor markets and the resulting absence of competitive markets for corporate executives
might have played a key role in preventing the rise in wage inequality. By contrast, as
Frydman (2005) documents, the inter-firm mobility of U.S. executives have been
increasing since the 1970s, indicating the presence of active labor markets for top
managers in recent decades.



7. Concluding Remarks

       In this paper, we have compiled the long-run series of top income shares and
wage income shares and explored the dynamic evolution of income concentration in
Japan over the last 116 years. To conclude our study, we review Japan’s experience from
a comparative perspective.
       According to our data, Japan was a nation of high income concentration
throughout the pre-WWII period. Although the degree of income concentration in Japan
was extremely high during the early part of the 20th century by historical standards, it was
roughly comparable to that of other industrial nations, such as Britain, the United States,
France, and Germany, during the same period (Atkinson (2006); Piketty and Saez (2003);
Piketty (2003); Dell (2004)). These countries experienced a substantial decline in income
concentration during the interwar period, due largely to the Great Depression and the
subsequent government intervention that imposed progressive taxation. By contrast, the
impact of the Great Depression on the Japanese economy was far milder (Moriguchi
(2003)), and as we have shown, income and estate taxes remained low in Japan until the



                                            29
late 1930s. As a result, even by international standards, Japan exhibited a high degree of
income concentration at the eve of WWII. For example, as late as in 1939, the top 1%
income earners received almost 20% of total income in Japan, whereas the share was
about 15% in France, the United States, and Germany.
       As in the other countries, the top income shares in Japan fell abruptly and
dramatically during WWII. Analysing the series of income composition, top estates, and
top wage income shares, we show that this sharp reduction in income concentration was
due to the collapse of capital income and the compression of wage income caused by
wartime regulations and inflation. Due to the higher level of income concentration prior to
WWII, the impact of WWII in reducing income concentration was much more pronounced
in Japan than in the United States, or even Britain, France, and Germany.
       Our data show that this one-time income de-concentration process had a long
lasting impact in Japan. We argue that the structural change of the economy that had
taken place after WWII transformed the temporary effect into a permanent one. In
particular, we suggest that the fundamental changes in the tax system, corporate
governance, and human resource management likely have prevented the re-concentration
of income in Japan. Interestingly, Japan achieved the most impressive and sustained
economic growth under the environment unfavourable to capital accumulation and without
significant increase in income concentration. Our findings thus raise some doubt on the
view that free accumulation and transfer of wealth is a necessary condition for macro
economic growth.
        According to our wage income series, the degree of wage income concentration in
pre-WWII Japan was high and roughly comparable to that in the United States during the
same period. Top wage income shares fell sharply in the late 1930s and during WWII due
to tight labor markets and wartime regulations. Wage income inequality rose initially in the
1950s but declined in the subsequent two decades, and has increased slightly since the
1980s. This recent increase in Japan, however, is very small compared to the recent
surge in wage income concentration in Anglo-Saxon countries. Based on our comparative
analysis, we argue that neither technology nor tax policy alone can explain the change in
wage income inequality. Instead we emphasize the importance of understanding the
interactions between technology, government policies, and institutional factors governing
corporate compensation policies.

A. Top Income Shares

A.1. Definition of Income

Our primary data source is individual income tax return statistics published in Annual
Statistical Report (Zeimu Tokei Nenposho) from 1887 by the Tax Bureau of Japan Ministry
of Finance (Shuzeikyoku), renamed the National Tax Administration (Kokuzeicho) after
1947.28 Among other information, it publishes a table with the number of taxpayers, the
amount of reported income, and the amount of income tax, by income brackets, which can
be used to estimate top income shares.
         We define income as a gross income before deductions and payroll taxes paid by
individuals, but after payroll taxes by employers and corporate income taxes. It includes
employment income, business income, farm income, self-employment income, and capital
income, but excludes realized capital gains as discussed below.
         We refer to the year of the annual report (the year when income tax returns were
processed and tax was paid) as “fiscal year” which may be different from “actual year” in
which the income subject to taxation was earned. Because tax laws affect the nature and
definition of the reported income in the income tax statistics, we first summarize the
evolution of income tax laws in Japan. Following description is based on Japan National
Tax Administration (1988), which provides detailed history of Japanese income tax system
from 1887 to 1987.

A.1.1. Income Tax Laws, 1887-2002

National-level individual income tax was first introduced in 1887 in Japan. During our
sample period, there were three major income tax reforms in 1899, 1940, and 1947, and
numerous minor revisions.
        Under the 1887 income tax law, income was defined comprehensively to include
capital income (interest, rents, and dividends), employment income (salaries, bonuses,
benefits, and pensions), business and farm income, and other property income. It set a
high exemption point (300 yen) and extremely low marginal tax rates (1.0-3.0%) defined
over 5 income brackets.
        The 1899 law established income tax on three classes of income: corporate
income, interest income, and individual income not included in the first two classes.
Individual income tax during fiscal years 1899-1939 is thus often called “Class III income
tax.” It maintained the same exemption point (300 yen) and moderate tax rates (1.0-
5.5%) defined over 12 income brackets. Over the next two decades, income tax became
increasingly progressive, with the highest marginal tax rate reaching 36% by 1920. The
tax rates were raised further by the temporary tax increase law in 1937 and the revised
temporary tax increase law in 1938. Under the 1899 law, dividends and bonuses paid by
corporations to individuals became non-taxable. From fiscal year 1920, however, 60% of
dividends and bonuses became taxable, and 80% from 1937. We thus correct for missing
dividends and bonuses, for the fiscal years 1899-1939 (see Section A.3.4).
        The 1940 tax reform, in preparation for the wartime economy, established
separate taxes on corporate income and individual income. Individual income was subject
to both schedule tax and comprehensive tax. Under the schedule tax, income was taxed
at different (flat) rates by income source (i.e., real estate, dividend and interest, self-

28
     The tax bureau’s jurisdictional area was Japan proper, not including colonies.


                                                         31
employment, wage, forestry, and retirement incomes). In addition, comprehensive income
tax was imposed on individuals’ aggregate income above 5,000 yen with progressive tax
rates that increased from 10% to 65% over 12 income brackets. We use the
comprehensive income tax statistics in estimating top income shares for the fiscal years
1940-1946.
        The 1947 income tax reform, under the influence of U.S. occupational authority,
abolished the schedule tax and established a unified comprehensive income tax. Realized
capital gains became taxable for the first time in 1947 (see Section A.3.2 for details). The
1947 law also introduced an extensive withholding system (gensen choshu seido) for
wage earners. As a result, for most wage earners, income tax was withheld at source, and
they were no longer required to file a self-assessed tax return (see Section A.3.1 for
details). The unified comprehensive income tax, culminated in the 1950 tax law, however,
was soon replaced by the hybrid of comprehensive taxation, separate taxation at source
(gensen bunri kazei), and special exemptions in subsequent years. Under the hybrid
system, instead of aggregating all incomes earned by an individual to apply a progressive
tax rate, some incomes were taxed at flat rates separately from other incomes and some
were tax-exempted entirely. Most important, separate taxation was introduced for interest
income in 1953, for dividends in 1965, for part of real estate capital gains in 1969. Capital
gains from stocks had been tax exempted since 1953, and so had interest income from
certain personal savings in 1963, until most of these exemptions were abolished under the
1988 tax reform (see Section A.4.3 for details).

A.1.2. Correspondence between Fiscal Years and Actual Years

In estimating top income shares series, it is important to know when the income reported
in the tax statistics was actually earned. We first describe what the formal laws stipulated
and then present our preferred specification based on how the laws were implemented.
The following information is based on the tax codes reprinted in Japan Ministry of
Finance, Tax Bureau (1988).
        For fiscal years 1887-1898, the income tax law defined the income for tax
purposes in year t as: for rents, farm income, and business income, the average of the
incomes earned in previous 3 years (i.e., years t-1, t-2, t-3), and for interest, dividends,
and employment income, projected income earned in the same year t. For fiscal years
1899-1925, all income except for farm income (which continued to be the average of
previous 3 years) was defined as projected income earned in the same year. For fiscal
years 1926-1946, the law stated that the income reported for tax purposes should be
based on the income earned in previous year t-1. Starting in fiscal year 1947, with the
introduction of the withholding system for wage earners, income tax became a pay-as-
you-earn system, and income tax paid in year t was based on the income earned in the
same year.
        In summary, according to the legal definition, (1) for fiscal years 1887-1898,
reported income in fiscal year t corresponds to a weighted average of incomes earned in
years t, t-1, t-2, and t-3; (2) for 1899-1925, reported income in fiscal year t corresponds
primarily to income earned in year t; (3) for 1926-1946, fiscal year t corresponds to actual
year t-1; and (4) for 1947-2002, fiscal year t coincides with actual year t.
        In reality, however, we believe that it was difficult for the tax authority to obtain an
accurate estimate of projected income in the absence of any withholding system during
fiscal years 1887-1925. In addition, not all taxpayers filed an income tax return during this
period. According to the laws, taxpayers were required to file a return and report the
amount of income in April each year. A locally-elected committee then examined
individuals they deemed responsible for paying income tax, including those who did not


                                              32
file a return. The committee then determined the amount of income tax based both on the
tax returns and their own inquiry. In fact, a large fraction of the people who paid income
tax did not file a return (it was 48-78% during 1903-1925, the years for which data are
available). Given this and the subsequent change in the 1926 law, we postulate that the
committee was likely to rely on previous year’s income as the best available estimate for
projected income even before 1926, especially for those who did not file income tax
returns. Thus, as our preferred specification, we assume that (1) for fiscal years 1887-
1946, fiscal year t corresponds to actual year t-1; and (2) for 1947-2002, fiscal year t
coincides with actual year t. Note that, due to the 1947 reform that adopted the pay-as-
you-earn system, income earned in 1946 was not subject to progressive comprehensive
income tax (it was subject to special tax), and hence we do not have data for 1946. The
correspondence between fiscal years (in which tax was paid) and actual years (in which
income was earned) is summarized in columns (1) and (2) of Table A0.
         To see if our estimates are sensitive to the specification of years, we also estimate
top income shares series using the legal definitions. In doing so, based on income
composition data, for fiscal years 1887-1898, we place 50% weight on income in year t
and 50% weight on the simple average of incomes in years t-1, t-2, t-3. For fiscal years
1899-1925, we place 100% weight on income t, as farm income constituted relatively
small portion of total income. Figure A4 plots the top 0.1% income share series using the
legal definitions (“formal law” series), along with our series (“preferred specification”).
Except for years 1916-1922, two series exhibit fairly similar levels and trends.

A.1.3. Tax Units

For fiscal years 1887-1949, the unit of income tax was “family” defined as a married
couple with dependents (e.g., children and old parents) or a single head of household with
dependents. Incomes of cohabitating family members in a single household were
aggregated for income tax purposes. Starting in fiscal year 1950, the unit of income tax
became “individual” whereby spouses are taxed separately on their incomes. The income
tax statistics in 1950-2002 do not allow us to reconstruct household income. To produce
homogeneous series over the entire period, we choose the individual as the tax unit.
Fortunately, in fiscal years 1903-1938 and 1949, the statistics provide a breakdown of
total income into the income of household head and the income of dependents, by income
brackets. According to these data, the latter is very small relative to the former (less than
5% of the former in general). Hence, we substitute household income for household
head’s income, which leads to slight upward bias in our estimates.
         Our top income groups are defined relative to the total number of adults, defined
as 20 years old and above, in Japan (not including colonies). The total adult population,
reported in Table A0, is estimated as follows. First, we take the total population from
Japan Statistical Yearbook (2003), p. 32. Based on census data, the yearbook reports the
estimated total population as of January 1 for years 1886-1919 and as of October 1 for
years 1920-2002. Then we take the estimated population of people younger than 20 years
old for years 1885-1920 from Ohkawa et al. (1974), Volume 2, pp.166-171. Starting in
1920, Japanese census, conducted every ten years, reports population by age. 29 We
estimate the population of people younger than 20 years old in between census years by
assuming its ratio to the total population changes linearly between census years. We
define our total adult population series as the total population minus the population
younger than 20 years old.

        For the 1887-1949 period, we also computed top income shares using “household”
as the tax unit (the total number of households in Japan is obtained from Otsuki and
Takamatsu (1982), Table 1, p.340). The results are not reported in the paper, but
available upon request. We found that the pattern of household top income shares is very
similar to the pattern of individual top income shares, as the ratio of adults to households
remained stable during 1885-1950 (which fluctuated between 2.65 and 2.95 with no
trend).

A.2. Total Income Denominator

In order to obtain top income shares, we need to estimate the total income in Japan to be
used as the denominator. This denominator should ideally be total personal income
reported on tax returns had everybody been required to file an income tax return. As only
a small fraction of households filed income tax returns before 1947, the income tax
statistics cannot be used to estimate the denominator, and we must rely on National
Accounts data.

A.2.1. System of National Accounts, 1930-2002

The System of National Accounts (SNA) in Japan has provided comprehensive estimates
of national income since 1930. There are three partially overlapping series: (1) the old
SNA, 1930-1976, reported in Historical Statistics of Japan, Volume 3, Section 13-5, (2) the
68SNA, 1955-1998, reported in Historical Statistics of Japan, Table 3.6,30 (3) the 93SNA,
1980-2002, reported in Historical Statistics of Japan, Table 3.24.31 The SNAs are fairly
detailed and provide the breakdown of personal income into the main components: wages
and salaries, social contributions of employers and employees, personal capital income
(dividends, net interest income, rents received), unincorporated business income
(agricultural income, imputed rents of homeowners, and other business income).
         Social contributions of employers and imputed rents are not part of the taxable
individual income. Hence we define our personal income denominator as the sum of
wages and salaries, employees’ social security contributions, personal capital income,
and unincorporated business income (excluding imputed rents). The old SNA does not
report imputed rents separately from received rents for 1946-1976. We have estimated
imputed rents for the old SNA using the 68SNA, assuming that the fraction of imputed
rents in total rents for 1946-1955 is equal to the fraction from 68SNA in 1955, the first year
the 68SNA becomes available. Similarly, the old SNA does not report a breakdown of
social contributions between employees and employers. We assume that social
contributions from 1930 to 1954 are divided as in year 1955. Social contributions were
very small during that period, and therefore this imputation has a very small effect on our
total income denominator.
         The 93SNA reports the returns on insurance funds separately, but this item was
included in personal capital income in the old SNA and the 68SNA. We added back the
returns on insurance funds to personal capital income for the 93SNA years to obtain
consistent series even though the returns on insurance funds are not part of the taxable
income.
         Our personal income denominator is obtained from the 93SNA for the 1999-2002
period, the 68SNA for the 1955-1998 period, and from the old SNA for the 1930-1954
period, and then spliced together. The 93SNA and 68SNA personal income denominators

are extremely close in 1998 (less than 1% difference) so we do not make any correction to
connect the 68SNA and 93SNA in 1998. The old SNA personal income denominator in
1955 is 4.4% higher than the 68SNA in 1955. Therefore, in order to obtain homogeneous
series, we have reduced old SNA personal income by 4.4% so that the old SNA matches
the 68SNA exactly in 1955. The old SNA does not provide estimates for 1945. Therefore,
we have assumed, as in Maddison (1995), that real income in 1945 is one half of real
income in 1944, based on other estimates from other authors.

A.2.2. Personal Income Denominator, 1886-1930

We estimate the personal income denominator for the years 1886-1930 based on the
series of personal disposable income in Japan proper in Ohkawa et al. (1974), Volume 1,
Table 8, column (9). Personal disposable income in 1930 is 11.5% higher than the
personal income denominator in the same year estimated above from the old SNA.
Therefore, to obtain homogeneous series, we have reduced personal disposable income
from 1886 to 1929 by 11.5%.
        It is important to note that total income estimates before 1930 are much less
reliable than those after 1930, as no elaborate system of national accounts had existed.
Although the estimates by Ohkawa et al. (1974) are considered most definite and reliable,
there are three other national income estimates (reported in Historical Statistics of Japan,
Volume 3, Table 13-3, pp. 344-349).
        Yamada estimates from 1875 to 1948 are about 10 to 15% percent higher than
Ohkawa et al. estimates before 1900, comparable during the 1900-1915 period, and about
10 to 20% lower during the 1915-1930 period. Using Yamada estimates would have
produced a more markedly increasing pattern of top income shares during the period
1885 to 1930 but would not have changed the conclusion that top incomes shares were
much higher in the pre-WWII period than in the post-WWII period.
        Hijikata estimates from 1900 to 1937 are substantially (40 to 50%) lower than
Ohkawa et al. estimates during the 1900-1920 period and somewhat (about 20%) lower
from 1920 to 1937. Thus Hijikata estimates would have lead to even higher top income
shares in the 1900-1937 period and more declining pattern of top income shares over the
1900-1937 period.
        Finally, the Cabinet Bureau of Statistics series from 1887 to 1935 report
substantially (about 40%) higher estimates than Ohkawa et al. estimates in the 1887-1895
period and then much (about 30%) lower estimates in the period 1900-1935. Those
estimates are obtained directly from taxable income, however, and therefore the least
appropriate as an independent denominator in our study.

A.2.3. Consumer Price Index, 1886-2002

We use a consumer price index (CPI) to deflate our nominal income series. Our CPI
estimates for years 1886-1938 and 1946-1950 are from Ohkawa et al. (1967), Long-Term
Economic Statistics of Japan since 1868, Vol. 8, p.135, column (1). Estimates for 1938-
1946 are obtained from taking the ratios of real National Income to nominal National
Income from Historical Statistics of Japanese Economy, p. 7 and pasted to the Okhawa
estimates. For the 1950-2002 period, our CPI estimates are from Japan Statistical
Yearbook. Then the pre- and post-1950 series are spliced together. The price index (with
base 100 in 2002) is reported in Table A0, column (9). The total real personal income
denominator and average personal income per adult are reported in columns (7) and (8)
in Table A0.



                                            35
A.3. Top Income Numerator

For the numerator, we estimate the income accrued to top income groups (e.g., top
0.01%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1% etc.), defined relative to the total adult population, as follows.
Because the top tail of the income distribution is well approximated by a Pareto
distribution, we estimate the Pareto coefficient for each year using the distribution tables
in the income tax statistics. We then employ a simple parametric interpolation method, as
in Piketty and Saez (2003), to estimate threshold income levels for the top income groups.
We obtain the top income numerators for the respective top income groups simply by
aggregating all incomes above the thresholds. To produce homogenous series, the
income definition in the statistics has to be consistent across years. Below, we discuss
major corrections we made to the original data to ensure consistency.

A.3.1. Combining Self-assessed Income Statistics and Wage Income Statistics,
1951-2002

Due to the extensive and sophisticated withholding system, most individuals in Japan with
only employment or pension income are not required to file self-assessed income tax
returns. Typically, at the end of the year, there is an adjustment in the last amount
withheld so that total tax withheld coincides exactly with total income tax due. As a result,
although most income earners in Japan paid income taxes in 1951-2002, only 10-15% of
all adults filed a self-assessed tax return each year. That is to say, a large number of
income earners are missing from the self-assessed income tax statistics.
         Fortunately, the Japanese tax administration also publishes wage income tax
statistics that cover most private wage earners regardless of whether they filed a self-
assessed tax return. We use these statistics to complement the self-assessed income tax
statistics. The wage income statistics has been summarized in Annual Statistical Report
and published in more detail in Survey on Private Wages and Salaries since 1952. The
data include the distribution (by wage income brackets) of annual wage income (the sum
of wages or salaries, cash benefits, and bonuses) for all employees in the private sector,
but excludes employees in the public sector, daily-hired employees, and retirees. We
inflate the survey distribution by a uniform 10 percent factor in order to account for the
people not included in the wage income survey. This is equivalent to assuming that their
income distribution is the same as that of private sector employees, which probably
introduces a slight upward bias in our estimates.
         We then combine the self-assessed income tax statistics and the wage income
statistics to obtain a complete income distribution. The key difficulty is that those wage
earners (1) who have income larger than 200,000 yen from other sources, (3) whose
employment income exceeds 20 million yen, and (3) who receive wages from two or more
employers during the year, are required to file self-assessed tax returns. Thus, before
combining the wage income statistics and the self-assessed statistics, we have to subtract
wage earners filing self-assessed returns from the wage income survey. We use the
income composition data from the self-assessed income tax statistics to do so.
         Starting in 1963, the composition tables present the number of wage earners
(defined as taxpayers with any wage income) and the reported wage income, by income
bracket. From those statistics, we estimate a distribution of wage income earners (by
wage income brackets) for those self-assessed wage income earners. We obtain such a
distribution by assuming that the ranking by total income and the ranking by wage income
are the same. For example, in 2002, the self-assessed tax return statistics report that
there are 40,035 tax filers in the top income bracket of incomes above 50 million yen.
Those filers report on average 94.260 million yen. Among those 40,035 filers, 29,916


                                             36
report some wage income, and the total wage income reported in the top bracket by those
29,916 wage earners is 1,227 billion yen. We assume that the top bracket of the wage
income distribution contains 29,916 wage earners reporting on average 41.021 million yen
(1,227 billion divided by 29,916) of wage income. We repeat this procedure for each
bracket. We then need to estimate the wage income thresholds corresponding to those
brackets. We proceed as follows. We first estimate the wage share in each bracket as the
ratio of the average wage income in the bracket (41.021 million yen in the example given
above) divided by the average total income in the bracket (94.260 million yen in the
example given above). We then estimate the wage income thresholds corresponding to
those brackets as the threshold for total income (50 million yen in the example given)
times the mean of the wage share in the corresponding bracket and the bracket just below
(in the example given above, these are the brackets 50 million and above, and 20 to 50
million yen respectively).
         The above procedure generates a distribution of wage income by brackets for
wage earners filing the self-assessed tax returns. We then subtract out this distribution
from the wage income distribution based on the wage income statistics. This subtraction is
done by assuming that the two distributions are Pareto distributed bracket by bracket. The
resulting net distribution represents all wage income earners who did not file a self-
assessed income tax return. Finally, we add the net distribution to the original self-
assessed income distribution (using the same Pareto interpolation method) to obtain the
final wage income distribution.
         The key assumption underlying this method is that, among the self-assessed tax
return filers with positive wage income, the ranking by total income is identical to the
ranking by wage income. If this assumption is not met, then our method would overstate
the number of high wage filers in the final distribution and hence create small upward bias
in our top income share estimates. For the analysis of income inequality, it would be
extremely valuable if the tax administration produces aggregated tables that show the
distribution of income earners regardless of whether a self-assessed income tax return
was filed.32
         For years 1951-1962, the self-assessed income tax statistics did not report wage
income or the number of wage income earners by income brackets, but only in the
aggregate. As a result, for these years, we first estimate top income shares by adding
wage income earners from the wage survey to the self-assessed tax statistics (without
making the correction described above). We then correct top income share estimates for
years 1951-1962 by the ratio of estimates for 1963 with the correction applied to estimates
for 1963 where the correction is not applied.

A.3.2. Removing Capital Gains, 1947-2002

For fiscal years 1887-1946, although never explicitly stated in the income tax laws, from
the fact that no capital gains were reported in the composition data, we conclude that
capital gains were not subject to individual income tax during this period. Since 1947,
realized capital gains have become taxable, but with special tax rates and special
exemptions that changed over time (see Ishi (2001), pp.143-44). To obtain consistent
estimates, we remove capital gains from our data for the 1947-2002 period as follows.
        We first compute the share of realized capital gains in each top income groups
using the income composition data by brackets and simple linear interpolation (as in
Piketty and Saez, 2003). Second, we subtract 80% of the realized capital gain component
from our top income share estimates. For example, if the top 1% income share with

32
     Currently, the administration does not compile such data even for internal purposes.


                                                       37
capital gains is 6%, and the share of capital gains is 50%, we estimate the top 1% income
share as 6*(1-0.5*0.8)=3.6%. Removing 100% of the capital gain component would bias
the income shares downwards, as the ranking of taxpayers by income excluding capital
gains is not necessarily equal to the ranking including capital gains. This issue also arises
in the U.S. study by Piketty and Saez (2003) and the Canadian study by Saez and Veall
(2005). Using micro-data where it is possible to estimate income shares with and without
capital gains, Saez and Veall (2005) conclude that the 80% rule generates fairly accurate
estimates.
         Although we do not know if the 80% rule applies also to the case of Japan, the
following observation provides some assurance. If the correction factor is too large (such
as excluding 100% of realized gains), then when capital gains surge, the series excluding
capital gains should dip. If the correction factor is too small, then when capital gains
surge, the series excluding capital gains should rise. In Figure A1, we present the top
0.1% income share series with and without realized capital gains for the post-1947 period.
It shows that the series without capital gains are fairly stable during the two periods of
asset appreciation, first in the early 1970s and then in the late 1980s. This suggests that
the 80% rule for correcting capital gains is fairly adequate. To further improve our
methodology, it would be necessary to have an access to individual micro-data in Japan.
         According to Figure A1, the realized capital gains in fact had a large impact on the
top 0.1% income share during the two episodes of asset appreciation. It should be noted
that only part of realized capital gains were taxable and thus included in the income tax
statistics.33 Due to the complex and time varying exemption rules for capital gains, it is
difficult to correct for unreported capital gains with the available data. As a result, the
series including full capital gains (as opposed to taxable capital gains) would display even
larger spikes in the early 1970s and late 1980s. Nevertheless, the figure indicates that the
impact of capital gains on the top shares tends to be short-lived, as capital gains in
general are realized in a lumpy manner and do not constitute a source of steady annual
income. We thus believe that the inclusion of capital gains would not change the long-run
trends in the top income shares series. Furthermore, although we suspect that realized
capital gains from land and stocks are much higher in the postwar period than in the
prewar period, it must be noted that the distributions of land and stocks were probably
much more equal after WWII than before. Thus the inclusion of capital gains would not
change our main finding that income concentration fell drastically from the prewar period
to the postwar period.

A.3.3. Erosion of Comprehensive Income Tax Base, 1950-2002

Soon after the introduction of the unified comprehensive income tax system in 1947-1950,
the Japanese government began to give special tax measures to various components of
income (see Ishi (2001), Chapter 8; Iwamoto et al. (1995)). As a result, the erosion of
comprehensive income tax base poses a potentially serious problem for us when using
the income tax statistics.
        These special measures are: (1) a full exemption of certain income from taxation,
(2) an option for taxpayer to choose separate taxation at a flat rate for certain income
(instead of a progressive tax rate applied to aggregate income), and (3) separate taxation
for certain income with its tax entirely withheld at source. If one exercised an option to
choose a separate taxation for certain income (sentaku bunri kazei), then it is reported in

33
  Capital gains (joto shotoku) reported in the self-assessed income tax statistics are the taxable amount after
exemptions and deductions as opposed to the full value (the information based on phone conversation with a
Japan Tax Administration officer on May 5, 2006).


                                                      38
the self-assessed income tax statistics. By contrast, any income exempted from tax
(hikazei) or for which tax is 100% withheld at source (gensen bunri kazei) does not appear
in the statistics.
        According to the estimates by Iwamoto et al. (1995), before the 1988 reform, 70-
80% of total interest income was tax exempted under the tax privilege given to small-sized
personal savings, 20% was taxed separately and withheld at source, and only 0.3% was
subject to progressive comprehensive income tax. After the 1988 reform, only 20% of total
interest income was tax exempted, but almost 80% was taxed separately and withheld at
source, leaving less than 0.1% under the comprehensive tax. For dividend income, about
70% was taxed separately and withheld at source, and 30% was subject to
comprehensive taxation throughout 1980-2002.
        Consequently, virtually all interest income and about 70% of dividend income are
missing from the income tax statistics in recent decades. Ishi (1979, 2001) has attempted
to compute a comprehensive income base in order to assess the effect of tax erosion on
taxes collected, using unpublished data obtained from the fiscal administration. In our
paper, we do not try to incorporate missing interest and dividend income directly in our
estimates but rather assess the sensitivity of our estimates to those missing components
using a wealth survey as described in Section D.

A.3.4. Imputing Missing Capital Income, 1898-1938

During fiscal years 1887-1898, the income tax base was comprehensive, fully including
dividends, interest, and bonuses. During fiscal years 1899-1920, dividend, bonuses, and
part of interest income were excluded from Class III income and hence disappeared from
the statistics. From August of 1920 to 1936, 60% of dividends and bonuses were included
in Class II income, 80% from 1937 to 1939, and 100% after 1940. Interest income was
fully included again starting only in fiscal year 1940. These changes potentially create
discontinuities in our data, especially for top income groups to which capital income
constituted a large share.
         First, for fiscal years 1921-1939, we can recover missing dividends and bonuses
from total reported dividends and bonuses in the Class III income tax statistics, because
we know that a fixed percentage of dividends and bonuses are taxed (60% in 1921-1936
and 80% in 1937-1939). For fiscal years 1899-1920, no dividends or bonuses are
reported, and therefore we have to rely on an alternative source to estimate dividends and
bonuses. From fiscal years 1899-1939, corporate income was taxed separately as Class I
income tax (we assume that for corporate income, fiscal year t corresponds to actual year
t-1). For 1921-1939, we can thus estimate corporate profits, using Class I income tax
statistics, and total dividends and bonuses paid out to individuals, using Class III income
tax statistics. During 1921-1935, about 50% of corporate profits were paid out as
dividends and about 20% of corporate profits were paid out as bonuses. For 1936-1938,
corporate profits were very high (around 12-15% of the total personal income
denominator), but dividends did not exceed 5% of the total personal income. Therefore,
we assume that 50% of corporate profits were paid out as dividends in 1899-1920, up to
5% of total personal income (the 5% rule was binding during the high profit years 1915-
1918). We also assume that 20% of corporate profits were paid out as bonuses in 1899-
1920, up to 2% of total personal income.
         Second, we assume that 75% of those missing dividends and bonuses go to the
top 1% income earners, 68% to the top 0.5%, 52% to the top 0.1%, 43% to the top 0.05%,
and 27% to the top 0.01%. Those percentages are based on the relative composition of
dividend income in top groups in the United States in 1916 in the analysis of Piketty and
Saez (2003). We reluctantly use this assumption in the absence of the equivalent income


                                            39
composition data for Japan before 1947. Figure A2 presents top 0.1% income share
series before and after the corrections for actual years 1898-1938. As the figure shows,
our method smoothes most of the discontinuities in the raw data due to the capital income
exclusions and seems therefore acceptable.
        We have not made any correction for exempted interest income for fiscal years
1899-1939. From 1899 to 1919, only a small fraction of interest income (interest income
from public bonds only) was excluded from Class III income tax. It was taxed separately at
source (regardless of one’s income level) as Class II income, and represented less than
1% of the total personal income denominator. Starting in August of 1920, in addition to
public bond interest, interest from bank deposits was also excluded from Class III income
and moved to Class II income. As a result, the ratio of Class II income to the total personal
income denominator jumped from less than 1% to about 5% in 1921. The total interest
income reported in Class III income tax statistics, however, show no break, implying that
the top income earners did not have much bank deposit interest. Therefore, we assume
that no correction is necessary for these interest income exclusions. In addition, for fiscal
years 1913-1939, for income less than certain amounts, 10 to 20% of employment income
was tax exempted and excluded from the Class III income statistics. Again, we do not
correct for this exemption, as it was not a significant amount for top income earners.

A.4. Top Income Composition, 1886-2002

The composition of reported income by income source is published in the income tax
statistics at the aggregate level for fiscal years 1887, 1901-1946, and 1951-1962, and by
income brackets for fiscal years 1947-1950 and 1963-2002. Using these data, we
estimate the composition of the income accrued to the top 1% income group. Although a
finer decomposition can be done, we use five income categories: (1) employment income
(wages, salaries, bonuses, and pensions), (2) business income (unincorporated business
profits, farm income, and self-employment income), (3) rental income (rents from
farmland, residential land, residential buildings, and business buildings), (4) interest
income, and (5) dividends. Table A2 reports the fraction of the people filing income tax
returns and the composition of the top 1% income.
         For fiscal years 1887-1946, aggregate composition data are available in 1887 and
1901-1946 (thus there is no estimate for actual years 1887-1899 and 1946). The
categories of income composition changed over the years. For fiscal years 1887 and
1901-1939, the income from “farmland (tahata)” includes both farm income from selling
crops from the land (labelled “owner cultivator (jisaku)”) and rental income from leasing
the land to tenants (labelled “tenant (kosaku)”).34 For 1917-1939, the breakdown of the
farmland income is reported in the statistics. For 1887 and 1901-1916, because no such
breakdown is given, we estimate the amount of rental income included in the farmland
income, using the ratio of rental income to the farmland income in 1917 (the first year for
which the breakdown is available). For fiscal years 1901-1939, we use the imputed value
of dividends and bonuses (see Section A.3.4) in computing the income composition.
         As the composition data by income brackets are not available before 1947, our
estimate for the top 1% income composition in 1886-1945 is simply the composition of the
total income reported in the income tax statistics. Because the fraction of population filing
income tax returns fluctuated from year to year depending on exemption points and the
conditions of the economy, our top income composition series are not consistent over
these years. In particular, between 1906 and 1925, relatively high fractions of adults (2.5%
to 4.6%) filed income tax returns. If we assume that the share of capital income increases

34
     These definitions are explicitly stated for the first time in Annual Statistical Report (1938), p.36, note 3-a.


                                                           40
with income, our estimates for these years likely understate the share of capital income in
the top 1% income compared to other years.
        For fiscal years 1947-1950 and 1963-2002, the composition of the top 1% income
is estimated from composition data by income brackets, using a linear Interpolation
method as in Piketty and Saez (2003). (We provide no estimates for 1951-1962. For
1963-2002, we provide estimates only twice a decade.) Realized capital gains are
removed as described in Section A3.2. It is important to note that, as explained in Section
A3.3, almost all interest income after 1947 and large part of dividends after 1965 are
taxed separately at source and thus missing from the income composition. In addition, the
introduction of the withholding system for wage earners in 1949 likely reduced the degree
of tax evasion in wage income, contributing to a sudden increase in the share of
employment income in 1947-1950. In order to assess these issues, we compare the
composition of the top income based on the tax statistics with the composition of the total
personal income based on National Accounts.
        In Figure A3, Panel A shows the composition of the top 1% income, and Panel B
shows the composition of the total personal income denominator estimated from National
Accounts (see Section A.2.1), from 1930 to 2002. It is important to keep in mind that (1)
imputed rents are excluded from the total personal income because they are not included
in the income tax statistics; but (2) returns on insurance funds (which are not taxable and
not included in income tax statistics) are included and distributed among the dividend and
interest incomes in the total personal income. As mentioned in A.2.1, We cannot separate
the returns from insurance funds from dividends and interest except for recent years with
the SNA98 series. The SNA98 data show that over half of dividends are actually earned
through insurance funds. As a result, the total personal income estimated from National
Accounts would show a larger fraction of capital income than the total income in income
tax returns had everybody been required to file a tax return.
        Comparing Panels A and B is nevertheless instructive. In 1930, the top 1% income
group received a far larger share of their income as dividends (33%) than the national
average (3%), but they received smaller shares of income as interest income (2%) and
employment income (30%) than the national averages (15% and 45%, respectively). Note
that, as in the top 1% income, the capital income component in total personal income
declined sharply during 1937-1947 from 20% to less than 1%. The dividend component in
the total personal income had recovered to its pre-WWII share by 1980, but the shares of
interest and rental income components have remained relatively low. Finally, the
employment income component in total personal income fell sharply in 1944-1946 and
then increased substantially from 1947 to 2002 at the expense of the business income
component. But its rise during 1948-1950 was much smaller than that in the top 1%
income share, indicating that the sudden increase in the latter is likely due to the
introduction of the withholding system.

A.5. Marginal Tax Rates, 1886-2002

We estimate marginal tax rates faced by the average taxpayers in top income groups
reported in Table A3 as follows. First, we estimate marginal tax rates (MTRs) at the
income thresholds for the top 0.1% and 0.01% groups, respectively (denoted as MTR at
P99.9 and P99.99 and reported in columns (2) and (3)). For each group, we have already
estimated the threshold income level (see Section A.3). We assume that the taxpayer at
each threshold income is married with two dependents (e.g., a married couple with two
children under 18). To obtain net taxable income, we subtract the married exemption and
two dependent exemptions from the threshold income. We further subtract the average
amount of standard deductions (for earned income, medical expense, insurance


                                            41
premiums and so on) at the corresponding top income group. We then use a standard tax
schedule (that presents increasing marginal tax rates by income brackets) to obtain tax
liability, from which MTR for a given taxable income level can be easily inferred. Top MTR
(presented in column (4) in Table A3) is simply the highest possible marginal tax rate
according to the tax schedule. The marginal tax rates do not include local income taxes
(prefectural and municipal) and social insurance contributions
          Second, we estimate the income-weighted marginal tax rates for the top 0.1% and
0.01% groups, respectively (reported in columns (5) and (6) in Table A3) as follows. The
top 0.01% MTR is computed as: MTR Top 0.01% = (MTR at P99.99+Top MTR)/2, where
we use a simple average as an approximation of the MTR for this group. The top 0.1%
MTR is then computed as: {Income Share of P99.9-99.99 * (MTR at P99.9+MTR at
P99.99)/2 + Income Share of P99.99-100 * MTR Top 0.01%} / (Income Share of P99.9-
100). This amounts to estimating the Top 0.1% MTR as the average (weighted by income)
of the MTRs for top 0.01% group and the bottom 99% of the top 1% group (denoted as
P99.9-99.99) where the MTR for P99.9-99.99 is estimated as (MTR at P99.9+MTR at
P99.99)/2.

B. Top Estates

B.1. Definition of Estate

We compile top estate series, using estate tax return statistics published in Annual
Statistical Report (Zeimu Tokei Nenposho) from 1905 to 2002. Except for 1943, the
statistics include a distribution table with the number of decedents who paid estate tax, the
amount of estate, and the amount of tax, by estate brackets. The aggregate estate
composition is also available starting in 1926, except for years 1942-43, but not by estate
brackets.
         In the tax statistics, estates are defined as the sum of all properties (real estate,
houses, household properties, unincorporated business assets, farm assets, stocks,
bonds, cash, deposits, tenant rights, intellectual property rights, pension rights, etc.) net of
all debts and liabilities. As virtually all components of transferable wealth are included in
the definition of estates for tax purposes, the statistics provide an accurate estimate of the
value of net worth held by decedents.
         Below, we refer to the year of the annual report (the year when estate tax returns
were processed) as “fiscal year” which may be different from “actual year” in which the
estate subject to taxation was transferred from an ancestor to heirs due to the ancestor’s
death. We first summarize the evolution of estate tax laws in Japan, based on the tax
codes reprinted at the end of the annual reports in 1931 and 1950 as well as Ishi (2001),
Chapter 12, which summarizes post-WWII developments.

B.1.1. Estate Tax Laws, 1905-2002

The first estate tax law in Japan was promulgated in January 1905 and enforced in April
1905. During our sample period, there were three major reforms in estate tax laws in
1947, 1950, and 1958, and many minor revisions.
        For fiscal years 1905-1946, the Japanese estate tax law was based on a “family
system (ie seido)” defined by the old Civil Code. To maintain the family system, the law
distinguished the inheritance of family estate (katoku sozoku), which we refer to as “family
inheritance,” from ordinary inheritance (isan sozoku). Under family inheritance, a single
heir succeeded entire family estate as a new familyhead (koshu) after the death or
retirement (at age sixty or older) of the former familyhead. Commonly it was the first son


                                              42
who became a new family head, while if there was no son, a family head named a legal
heir. By contrast, under ordinary inheritance, estate was transferred to heirs when a non-
family head died or decided to give his or her estate to their heirs while alive. The estate
was divided equally among children. If there were no children, then it went to a spouse. If
there were no surviving children or spouse, then lineal ascendants inherited the estate.
         The 1905 law set the exemption point of 1,000 yen for family inheritance and 500
yen for ordinary inheritance with progressive but extremely low marginal tax rates (i.e.,
0.05%-1.3% for family inheritance and 0.1%-1.8% for ordinary inheritance) defined over
20 estate brackets. Gifts given to heirs within one year prior to the inheritance were
aggregated to estates for tax purposes. Military personnel who died in war were exempted
from estate tax. In 1926, the exemption point for family inheritance was increased to 5,000
yen and for ordinary inheritance to 1,000 yen.
         Under the 1905 law, the inheritance tax statistics in fiscal years 1905-1947 report
the two forms of inheritance in separate tabulations. In estimating top estates, we
aggregate the distributions of family inheritance and ordinary inheritance. The former is by
far the dominant form of inheritance at the top of the estate distribution because non-
family heads rarely owned large assets. We consider all forms of inheritance (not only
those from deaths), because family inheritance due to retirement should be considered as
an inter-generational transfer of wealth, and excluding it would lead us to underestimate
the number of estates. We also include all ordinary inheritance cases, although excluding
the cases not due to death would not change our series by much.
         The 1905 law was superseded by the 1937 temporary tax increase law and the
1938 revised temporary tax increase law, both of which imposed additional tax on estates
to increase wartime revenue. The 1940 estate tax law established highly progressive tax
rates, while keeping the preferential treatment for family inheritance. As of 1946, the
exemption point was 20,000 yen for family inheritance with marginal tax rates of 1.5%-
55% defined over 19 brackets. For ordinary inheritance, the exemption point was set
lower (5,000 yen) and the tax rates higher (5.5%-70%).35
         As part of the postwar democratization, the 1947 estate tax law abolished the
distinction between family and ordinary inheritance and established a modern system of
separate estate and gift taxes. It set the exemption point of 20,000 yen for estate tax with
low marginal tax rates of 1.0-6.0%. 36 The estate tax statistics continue to present
tabulations by the size of estate under the 1947 law.
         Under the 1950 estate tax law, following the recommendations by the Shoup
Commission, Japan adopted inheritance tax based on cumulative amount of inheritance
and gifts received by an heir (also known as “accession tax”). As a result, for fiscal years
1950-1957, distribution tables are based on the size of inheritances as opposed to
estates. To provide homogenous series, we convert inheritance statistics to estate
statistics (see B.1.3). The 1950 law also changed fiscal year from accounting year
(starting in April) to calendar year (starting in January). It set the exemption point of
200,000 yen and highly progressive tax rates of 25%-90% defined over 11 brackets.37
         Finally, with the 1958 reform, Japan adopted a hybrid system of estate tax and
inheritance tax. It initially set the very high exemption point of 1.8 million yen, resulting in
the much smaller number of people filing estate tax returns. The statistics for fiscal years
1958-2002 are presented by the size of estates and hence are directly comparable to the
statistics for 1905-1949.

B.1.2. Correspondence between Fiscal Years and Actual Years

Estate tax statistics reported in fiscal year t are the estate tax returns processed in year t,
and do not necessarily coincide with the returns filed for the deaths that took place in year
t. In fact, due to delays in both filing and processing, before WWII, majority of the tax
returns filed for the deaths in year t were likely processed in year t+1, and some in even
later years.38 Thus, strictly speaking, the statistics in fiscal year t correspond to a weighted
sum of the estate distributions in actual years t, t-1, t-2 etc.39 Because the statistics in
1905-1949 do not break down processed returns by the year of death but instead pool
them in one distribution table, it is difficult to reconstruct the estate distribution
corresponding to an actual year.
        By contrast, starting in 1950, the distribution table in fiscal year t covers only the
deaths taking place in the same year t, and separate aggregate statistics are reported for
the tax returns processed in year t but filed in previous years. Furthermore, when there is
a revision in estate tax laws in 1937, 1938, 1940, and 1947, annual reports in subsequent
years publish separate estate distribution tables according to which version of law applies.
For example, the 1937 statistics have two distribution tables, one for the “1905 law”
estates (which reports the returns filed before 1937 but processed in 1937) and the other
for the “1937 law” estates (which reports the returns filed and processed in 1937). In this
case, we know for sure that the “1937 law” estates include only the deaths in 1937, while
the “1905 law” estates consist primarily of the deaths in 1936 and 1935.
        In the world of constant price, using the statistics in year t to estimate top estates
in year t would result in smoother time series, as it amounts to taking a moving average
over several years. During a period of high inflation, however, by placing a higher weight
on current year than actually is, it would lead to a large upward bias in our estimates.
Therefore, it is important to reconstruct an estate distribution for a given actual year as
much as possible, exploiting the information based on legal changes. We determine the
correspondence between actual and fiscal years as follows.
        For actual years 1905-1935, in the absence of better information, we assume that
estate tax returns reported in fiscal year t+1 correspond to the deaths in year t (which is a
median year among t-1, t, t+1). We thus ignore the small number of returns reported in
fiscal year 1905 and use only the 1906 statistics to estimate the 1905 distribution.
        For actual year 1936, we add the distribution tables of the “1905 law” estates
reported in fiscal years 1937-1939. For actual year 1937, we add the “1937 law” estates
reported in fiscal years 1937-1940. For actual year 1938, we add the “1938 law” estates
reported in fiscal year 1938 and 60% of the “1938 law” estates reported in fiscal year
1939. For actual year 1939, we add 40% of the “1938 law” estates reported in fiscal year
1939 and the “1938 law” estates reported in fiscal year 1940. The fractions 60% and 40%
are chosen so that the total numbers of estates in 1938 and 1939 are approximately
equal. Note that 1937 is the only year for which we can recover all and only deaths in
1937. Thus our 1937 estimate is most precise among all. By contrast, our respective
estimates for 1938 and 1939 are imprecise, but the average of the 1948 and 1949
estimates should be fairly accurate.
        For actual years 1940-1945, we assume that the “1940 law” estates reported in
fiscal year t+1 correspond the deaths in year t-1. We thus ignore very small number of the

38
   This statement is based on tables in the annual reports in 1905-1936 that provides the number of returns
pending from previous fiscal years.
39
   As the law stipulates that estate tax is based on the value of estate at the time of deaths, we assume that
the statistics sum up nominal estates across years without correcting for inflation. Late returns are subject to
penalty or adjustment, which is imposed in addition to estate tax.


                                                       44
“1940 law” estates reported in 1940 in estimating the 1940 distribution. The distribution
table is not available in fiscal year 1943, so we have no estimate for 1942.
         For 1946, we add the “1940 law” estates reported in 1947-1949. This may result in
an overestimate, because we pool the statistics from three annual reports that include
virtually all the 1946 deaths as well as some deaths in 1944 and 1945. Given the
hyperinflation in 1944-46, however, the effect of the extra returns from 1944 and 1945 on
our 1946 estimate should be small.
         For actual years 1947-1949, we assume that “1947 law” estates reported in 1947-
1948 correspond to the deaths in 1947, that 70% of the “1947 law” estates reported in
1949 correspond to the deaths in 1948, and that 30% of the “1947 law” estates reported in
1949 and all the “1947 law” estates reported in 1950 and 1951 correspond to the deaths
in 1949. We then inflate the numbers for 1949 by a factor 12/9 to adjust for the fact that
the “1947 law” applied to only 9 months during fiscal year 1949 (from April to December
1949) as the new law took effect in January 1950 and thereafter followed the calendar-
year schedule. The 70%-30% split of the 1949 statistics between 1948 and 1949 is
chosen so that the total numbers of estates in 1948 and 1949 are roughly equal. Although
our respective estimates for 1948 and 1949 are imprecise, their average is fairly accurate.
         For actual years 1950-1957, the statistics in year t report the estates for deaths in
year t that are processed by March of year t+1. As a result, approximately 80% of the
deaths in year t are included in the statistics in year t. The remaining portion is reported,
only at the aggregate level and not by brackets, in the statistics in the subsequent fiscal
years. We assume that the distribution of estates reported in later fiscal years is the same
as the distribution reported in fiscal year t, and we inflate the distribution in year t
accordingly.
         For fiscal years 1958-2002, with the introduction of the new hybrid system, the
statistics in year t report the deaths in year t processed by June of year t+1. Because the
number of deaths in year t reported in later years becomes small (less than 10%), we
make no corrections.

B.1.3. Correcting for Deductions, 1905-1952

For fiscal years 1905-1952, distribution tables are presented by the “taxable value” of
estate (or inheritance for 1950-1952), namely the size of estate (or inheritance) net of
debts and after deductions. By contrast, for fiscal years 1953-2002, tables are presented
by the size of estate (or inheritance) net of debt and before deductions. For fiscal years
1953-57, both the amounts of inheritance before and after deductions are reported. To
obtain the true value of estates, we need to add back deductions for fiscal years 1905-
1952. Below, we describe deductions and our methods of correction.
        For fiscal years 1905-1914, there was no major deduction (only for funeral
expenses), and we make no corrections. For fiscal years 1915-1925, the deduction for
family inheritance, called “Section 3-2 deduction,” was introduced. It allowed 1,000 yen
deduction for estates below 3,000 yen and 500 yen deduction for estates below 5,000
yen. The statistics in these years are presented by the size of estate after the deduction.
Therefore, we add back the Section 3-2 deduction for family inheritance, using the
aggregate amount of Section 3-2 deductions. We then add together the distributions of
family and ordinary inheritances using a standard Pareto interpolation method.
The 1940 law introduced 1,000 yen deduction per dependent family member. In 1942, the
amount of dependent deduction was increased. For fiscal years 1940-1946, the statistics
report only the aggregate amount of dependent deductions. We compute the average
deduction per estate from the aggregate data and add it back to the original tabulations.



                                             45
        The 1947 law abolished dependent family deductions and introduced a basic
deduction of 50,000 yen per estate for estate tax purposes as well as per gift for gift tax
purposes. We add back 50,000 yen per estate and gift to the original tabulations.
        The 1950 law introduced four types of deductions: basic deduction (150,000 yen
per heir), small amount deduction (30,000 yen per heir for inheritance smaller than certain
size), spouse deduction (50% deduction from the amount inherited), and minor deduction
(small deduction for minors younger than 18 year old). The basic deduction was increased
to 300,000 yen in 1952. We add back deductions of 180,000 yen per heir for years 1950
and 1951 and 330,000 yen per heir for 1952, which are the sum of the basic deduction
and the small amount deduction for the respective years. We do not correct for the spouse
and minor deductions because they are relatively small relative to the two other
deductions according to the aggregate statistics.
        For fiscal years 1953-2002, we make no corrections as tabulations are presented
in estates net of debts before deductions.

B.1.4. Converting Inheritance Statistics to Estate Statistics, 1950-1957

For all fiscal years except 1950-1957, the unit of observation in the tax statistics is “estate”
defined as the properties owned by the decedent. For fiscal years 1950-1957, the unit of
observation switches to “inheritance” defined as the properties received by an heir. As a
result, tax statistics in 1950-57 report the number of heirs and the amount of inheritances
ranked by brackets of inherited wealth. As the estate of a decedent is typically divided
among multiple heirs, the inheritance statistics are not directly comparable to the estate
statistics. In this study, we estimate series based on the estate unit.
         To convert inheritance distributions to estate distributions, we simply assume that
each decedent has 2.5 heirs and that estates are divided equally among heirs. The
number, 2.5, is taken from the average ratio of estate to inheritance in the 1958 statistics
which simultaneously report the number of estates (decedents) and the number of
inheritances (heirs) for the first time. From the inheritance statistics, we estimate estate
distributions by multiplying the brackets by 2.5 (for example, the bracket 200,000 to
500,000 yen becomes the bracket 500,000 to 1,250,000 yen), and by dividing by 2.5 the
number of inheritances in each bracket to obtain the number of estates.
         Note that our estimates for 1950-1957 are based on strong assumptions and have
a larger margin of errors than in other years. Nevertheless, these estimates provide
important evidence for the years immediately after the WWII.

B.2. Construction of Top Estate Series, 1905-2002

We define top groups (e.g., top 1%, top 0.1%) relative to the total number of adult
decedents in each year. The series of adult decedents in Japan is taken from the number
of deaths by age groups published in Japan Statistical Yearbook for years 1985-2002 and
in Historical Statistics of Japan, pp.218-219, for years 1905-1985. These series are
reported in column (1) in Table B1. The number of estate tax returns (after the
adjustments described in Section B.1.2) is reported on column (2). As column (3)
indicates, the fraction of adult decedents filing the estate tax returns varies across years
depending on exemption points and economic conditions, ranging from the high of 31% in
1942 to the low of 1% in 1958.
        We estimate the average size of estate for various upper groups of the estate
distribution, using a standard Pareto interpolation method. We convert the nominal value
of estates to the real value, expressed in 2002 yen, using the CPI deflator (see Section
A.2.3). Table B1 displays our estimates of top estates series from 1905 to 2002. Unlike


                                              46
our top income shares, we do not attempt to estimate the shares of estates left by top
decedents, because there is no simple way to compute the total amount of estates left by
all decedents in each year, including those who did not file estate tax returns.

B.3. Estate Composition, 1925-2002

Estate composition data are available only at the aggregate level for fiscal years 1926-
2002, except for years 1942-43. Because composition data by brackets are not reported,
it is not possible to create homogenous top estate composition series. In Table B2 and
Figure B1, we present the decomposition of aggregate estates into eight categories: (1)
agricultural land (i.e., farm land, forest land, and tenant right), (2) residential land (i.e.,
housing land and leasehold), (3) houses and structures, (4) business assets of (i.e.,
machinery, goods, raw materials, intellectual property rights, account receivable,
agricultural equipment, and farm products), (5) stocks (for both privately-held and publicly-
traded companies), (6) fixed claim assets (i.e., public and corporate bonds, cash,
deposits, savings accounts, and other claims), (7) other assets (which includes household
properties, life insurance, pensions, and standing timber), and (8) debts (i.e., private debts
and public obligation). Note that the sum of the first seven categories may exceed 100%
in Figure B1, as we define estates net of debts to be 100%. The composition estimates
are based directly on the aggregate estates composition published in the annual reports.
For simplicity, we assume that fiscal year t corresponds to actual year t-1 for fiscal years
1926-1946 and to actual year t for fiscal years 1947-2002 (because composition data are
reported only for the returns filed under the new law after 1947). In other words, we do not
use the complex specification of years we used for top estate series described in Section
B.1.2.
         Column (1) in Table B2 reports the fraction of adult decedents filing estate tax
returns (these numbers are different from those column (1) in Table B1 due to the
different specification of years). Because the estate composition is sensitive to the fraction
filing returns, and the fraction fluctuates substantially from year to year, it is difficult to see
trends in estate composition from these series. For example, the fraction drops from
26.1% in 1957 to 0.9% in 1958 (due to the high exemption level under the 1958 law),
which likely caused a sharp fall in the share of agricultural land, on one hand, and a large
increase in the share of stocks.
         To facilitate better comparison, Table 3 presents top estate compositions for
selected years, 1935, 1950, and 1987, for which the fractions of adult decedents filing
returns are comparable at around 9% (9.0% in 1935, 8.8% in 1950, and 8.0% in 1987).
Estates before subtracting debts are defined to be 100%. It shows that the largest
component of top estates in Japan shifted from financial assets (stocks and fixed claim
assets) in 1935 to movable property (business assets, houses and structures, and
household properties) in 1950, to real estate (agricultural and residential land) in 1987.
Thus the top estate composition data provide additional support for our finding based on
the top income shares series that, top capital income collapsed during WWII and has not
returned to the pre-WWII level to date, despite the high economic growth in the post-WWII
period.

C. Top Wage Income Shares

In estimating top wage income shares, we use two different sets of statistics for the pre-
and post-1950 period, as discussed below. As a result, note that our estimates for 1929-
1944 are less precise than and not fully homogenous with the 1951-2002 estimates.



                                                47
C.1. Top Wage Income Shares, 1951-2002

The National Tax Administration has annually published the statistics on wages and
salaries in the Survey on Private Wages and Salaries (Minkan Kyuyo no Jittai) since
1951.40 The survey covers all employees (except for daily-paid employees) in the private
sector but excludes government employees and retirees. Because the survey is based on
the data filed by employers who are legally responsible for withholding tax at source for
their employees, it provides accurate and detailed information on wages and salaries,
often by firm size, industry, tenure, and sex. The statistics include a distribution table that
reports the number of wage earners and the amount of annual wage income by wage
income brackets, which we use to estimate top wage income shares.
         Our definition of wage income includes wages, salaries, overtime pay, bonuses,
and various allowances, but excludes non-cash compensation (such as company housing,
expense account, stock options) and retirement benefits. It is before subtracting
employee’s social security contributions and before including employer’s social security
contributions. 41 Thanks to of the sophisticated withholding system with end-of-year
adjustments, the tax statistics in fiscal year t report wages and salaries earned in the
same year t. Therefore, fiscal year and actual year coincide for the wage income tax
statistics in 1951-2002.
         We again use a standard Pareto Interpolation method to estimate top wage
income shares. We define top groups (top 5% and 1%) relative to the total number of
regular employees, which excludes temporary workers as well as daily employees, in the
private sector in Japan. The series for regular employees for 1951-2002 are obtained from
Historical statistics of Japan, Table 19-7,42 and are reported in column (2) in Tables C1.
The number of employees in the wage income survey is reported in column (3). As shown
in column (4), from 1951 to 2002, the coverage of the survey has rose from 55% to 97%
of regular employees in the private sector.
         To obtain top wage income shares, we divide the amounts of wages and salaries
accruing to top wage income groups by 90% of total wages and salaries from National
Accounts. The denominator is reported in column (7) in Tables C1, under the label, “total
wage income.” To be consistent with our definition of wage income, total wages and
salaries from National Accounts include employees’ social security contributions and
exclude employers’ social security contributions. In recent years, where the coverage of
the survey is almost complete for regular employees in the private sector, total wage
reported in the survey are approximately 90% of wages and salaries from National
Accounts. Thus, we use the factor 90% to correct for the exclusion of daily employees and
government employees in the wage income survey. We present all values in real 2002
yen, using CPI. Our estimates for top 1% and 5% wage income shares for 1951-2002 are
reported in Table C2 and Figures 10 and 11.

C.2. Top Wage Income Shares, 1929-1944

For fiscal years 1930-1945, the annual reports publish the data on salaries and bonuses
as part of the composition tables in income tax statistics. The data include the numbers of
taxpayers who received salaries and bonuses, respectively, and the amounts of salaries

40
   The first survey was conducted in 1949, but its sample differs from the subsequent surveys and its results
were never published (National Tax Administration (1980), Minkan Kyuuyo Jittai Chosa Sanjunen no Ayumi).
We cannot locate the original 1950 and 1951 surveys. The data for 1951 are found in Takahashi (1959).
41
   The information is based on phone conversation with a Japan Tax Administration officer on May 5, 2006).

                                                     48
and bonuses they earned. The income tax statistics in fiscal years 1920-1929 also report
the amounts of salaries and bonuses but not the numbers of salary and bonus earners.
We thus cannot use the data before 1929 to estimate top wage income shares. We
assume that fiscal years 1930-1945 correspond to actual years 1929-1944 for the reasons
described in Section A.1.2.
         For the denominator, we take the total salaries (excluding employers’ social
security contributions) from the old SNA for 1930-1944. For 1929, we extrapolate total
salaries assuming that the fraction of salaries in total personal income is the same as in
1930.
         We define top groups relative to the total number of regular employees. Although
the tax statistics during this period do not exclude temporary workers, we use regular
employees to be consistent with the 1951-2002 estimates. Moreover, naturally, most if not
all top wage earners are regular employees. The total number of regular employees in
Japan is estimated as follows. The total number of employees is reported in Historical
Statistics of Japan, Volume 1, Table 3-6, for years 1930, 1940, and 1947. For 1930,
employees and family workers are not reported separately, thus we assume that the
fraction of family workers to total employees in 1930 is the same as in 1940. We then
estimate the total number of employees for years between 1930, 1940, and 1947, simply
by linear interpolation. Finally, we estimate the number of regular employees for 1929-
1944, using the fraction of regular employees to total employees in 1953, the first year in
which such information is available. These assumptions are restrictive, but our estimates
are not very sensitive to these assumptions.
         We make the following adjustments to the salaries and bonuses reported in the
income tax statistics to recover the full value. For fiscal years 1930-1939, the earned
income credit allowed taxpayers to deduct 20% of wage income for those with total
income under 6,000 yen and 10% for those with total income between 6,000 and 12,000
yen. We therefore assume that the average deduction was 15% and inflate the reported
amount of salaries by a factor 1/0.85. For fiscal years 1940-1945, the earned income
credit is 10% of wage income for those with total income below 10,000 yen. We assume
that the average deduction is 8% and inflate the reported salaries by a factor 1/0.92.
Because, for fiscal years 1930-1936, only 60% of bonuses are taxable and reported in the
statistics, we inflate bonuses by a factor 1/0.6. Similarly, for fiscal years 1937-1939, as
only 80% of bonuses are reported in the statistics, we inflate bonuses by a factor 1/0.8.
For fiscal years 1940-1945, as 100% of bonuses are reported, we make no adjustment.
         The number of bonus earners in the income tax statistics is always smaller than
the number of salary earners. We assume that all bonus earners also have some wage
income, so that we can attribute all bonuses to all the taxpayers reporting positive
salaries. Furthermore, we assume that those reporting salaries and bonuses on income
tax returns represent the top wage income earners. This assumption does not necessarily
hold, as individuals with large non-wage income and modest wage income also file tax
returns, and may bias our estimates of top wage income shares downward.
         Thus, from the aggregate statistics, we can compute the share of total wage
income accruing to the tax return filers with positive wage income. To obtain the shares of
wage income accruing to fixed fractions of wage earners (e.g., top 1% and 5% groups)
using a standard Pareto interpolation method, however, we need at least two observations
on the share of income and the fraction of employees per year. Because we have only
one such observation per year, we proceed as follows.
         For years 1929-1944, on average about 3% of regular employees filed income tax
returns. This fraction changes over time. In particular, it falls sharply from 6.72% in 1938
(fiscal year 1939) to 0.76% in 1939 (fiscal year 1940), because of the large increase in the
exemption level for comprehensive income tax under the 1940 law. We assume that the


                                            49
distribution of wage income did not change significantly from 1938 to 1939 and that the
Pareto coefficient remained the same. Then we estimate the Pareto coefficient using the
standard formula: (1-1/a)= {log(share of wage income in 1938)-log(share of wage income
in 1939)}/{log(fraction of wage income filers in 1938)-log(fraction of wage income filers in
1939)}. The estimated coefficient is a=2.76. Assuming that the Pareto coefficient is
constant for 1929-1944, we compute the top 1% and top 5% income share for each year
(which are reported in Table C2). Because we use 1938 and 1939 to estimate the Pareto
coefficient, by definition our top wage income shares in 1938 and 1939 are identical.
Therefore, we exclude the 1938 estimates from Table C2.
        The assumption that the Pareto coefficient is constant across years 1929-1944 is
certainly restrictive. Our finding, a sharp decline in top wage income shares during this
period, however, should be robust. The raw data clearly indicate that there was a large
decline in wage income concentration during 1929-1944: in the early 1930s, when 2 to 3%
of wage earners filed income tax returns, their wage income was more than 15% of the
total salaries from National Accounts; by contrast, in 1944, almost 5% of wage earners
filed income tax returns but their wage income was only about 9% of all wages and
salaries.

C.3 Marginal Tax Rates, 1951-2002

Marginal tax rates for top wage income earners for 1951-2002 are computed using a
method similar to the marginal tax rates for top income groups described in Section A.5.
Marginal tax rates (MTRs) are estimated for an individual with non-working spouse and
two dependent children, assuming that all income is employment income. The estimates
take into account the exemptions and graduated employment income deduction, based on
the information from Japan Ministry of Finance, Tax Bureau (1988), Ishi (2001), p.82, and
OECD (1998-2002), Taxing Wages. The marginal tax rates do not include local income
taxes (prefectural and municipal) and social insurance contributions. In Table C3, we
present our estimates for MTRs at the income thresholds for the top 10%, 5%, 1%, 0.1%,
and 0.01% groups (denoted as MTR at P90, P95, P99, P99.9, and P99.99, respectively).

D. Sensitivity Analysis Using the NSFIE Data

The best available source for estimating the distribution of capital income by income group
is the National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (NSFIE).43 NSFIE is conducted
once in every five years and covers over 50,000 households, one of the largest and most
comprehensive household surveys in Japan. Starting in 1979, the survey has reported the
holdings of various financial assets per household by income class in its savings and
liabilities section.44 We compute top income shares and their income composition using
NSFIE data, and compare these estimates with the income tax statistics estimates to
evaluate the impact of the capital income erosion on our top income shares series.

D.1 Individual-unit Estimates for 1999

In 1999, the NSFIE statistics report tabulations by the size of the household head’s
income (in addition to tabulations by the size of total household income).45 We use these
43
   Statistics Bureau of Japan, National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (Zenkoku Shohi Jittai
Chosa). For the reliability of NSFIE compared to other household surveys, see Takayama et al. (1989).
44
   We cannot use 1969 and 1974 NSIFE data, because the sample in these years excludes households with
professionals and managers.
45
   Table 24, available online at http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/zensho/1999/menu.htm.


                                                 50
data to estimate top income shares and the composition of capital income, using
individual as the unit of observation as in our series based on the income tax statistics.
The NSFIE statistics present, by the size of household head’s income, the average
income of the household head and the average amount of financial assets owned by all
household members by asset types, such as demand deposits, time deposits, insurance
savings, securities (stocks, trust funds, public and corporate bonds), and liabilities. In our
analysis, we divide the assets into three groups: (1) stocks, (2) returns on insurance
policies, and (3) fixed claim assets net of liabilities (containing all financial assets except
stocks and insurance savings).
        We convert the assets holdings into capital income, using total capital income from
personal income reported in National Accounts. 46 For example, to estimate dividend
income, we take total dividends accrued to individuals from National Accounts and
allocate them across households in proportion to the distribution of stocks by income class
reported in the NSFIE. We then compute the share of each component in total income for
top income groups. In doing so, we assume that the NSFIE represents all Japanese
households and that all household assets reported in the survey belong to the household
head. We make these extreme assumptions to generate an upper bound on our
estimates.
        In Table 4, we compare our income tax statistics results (in Panel B) with the
estimates from the NSFIE (in Panel C) for the year 1999. Unlike income tax statistics,
because NSFIE uses a representative sample, it contains few observations at the very
high end of income distribution. As a result, we cannot provide accurate estimates for the
top 0.1% group and above with the 1999 NSFIE data.

D.2 Household-unit Estimates for 1979, 1984, 1989, 1994, and 1999

From 1979 to 1999, the NSFIE statistics present tabulations by the size of the total
household income (as oppose to household head’s income). We use these data to
compute top income shares and capital income composition, using household as the unit
of observation. Note that, because the income shares are no longer based on the
individual unit, the levels of the NSFIE estimates and the income tax statistics estimates
are not directly comparable.47 Instead, we can compare NSFIE estimates across years,
using the 1999 NSFIE estimates as a benchmark. We compute the share of three capital
income components in total income for top 5% and 10% income groups, using the same
methodology as described in Section D.1. Because the brackets of the NSFIE tabulations
in earlier years are not as finely defined, the top bracket contains 2% to 6% of all
households. Due to small sample and top coding, we cannot provide accurate estimates
above the top 5% groups with these data. The results are reported in Table D1.




46
   As Hayashi et al. (1988) demonstrate, capital income in the NSFIE is seriously underreported and cannot
be used. We thus use the asset holdings data to estimate capital income. According to Takayama et al.
(1989), NSFIE data on assets, including stocks and bonds, are fairly accurate.

Source: See Appendix Section A.3.3. and Section D.1.
Notes: Table compares the composition of capital income by income group based on three independent sources.
National average in Panel A is based on the total personal income from National Accounts.
Estimates in Panel B are based on self-assessed income tax return statistics for year 1999.
Income is defined as annual gross income reported in the tax returns, excluding capital gains.
All returns on insurance policies, almost all income, and large part of dividends are not subject to comprehensive income tax
and not reported in the self-assessed income tax returns.
Estimates in Panel C are based on the National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure for year 1999.
Net interest income is estimated based on the holdings of bonds, deposits, and loan trusts, net of liabilities.
Dividend income is estimated based on stock holdings.
Returns on insurance policies are based on life and other insurance holdings.
Due to small sample size, estimates for the top 0.5% are imprecise and estimates for the top 0.1% are not available.

Notes: Computations by authors: See Appendix Section A for details.
Year refers to "actual year" in Table A0.
Income is defined comprehensively to include employment income, business income, farm income, and capital income, but capital gains are excluded.
Top groups are defined relative to adult population (age 20 and above) in Japan.
The total income demonimator is defined as total personal income in Japan from National Accounts.
"Top 5-1%" refers to the bottom 4% of the top 5% income group.
Top 5% and 5-1% income share series are not estimated for those years in which the fractions of adults filing tax returns are too small.
Series are adjusted upward for years 1898-1938 to correct for non-taxable capital income components (see Appendix Section A.3.4 and Figure A2).

Notes: Computations by authors based on tax return statistics. See Appendix Section A.4 for details.
Business income includes unincorporated business profits, farm income, and self-employment income.
Employment income includes wages, salaries, bonuses, and pensions.
Rental income includes rents from farm land, residential land, housing, and buildings.
For 1886 and 1900-1945, composition estimates are based on aggregate income composition and thus imprecisely estimated.
In particular, for 1906-1925, relatively high fractions of adults (2.5% to 4.6%) filed income tax returns.
For 1947-1950 and 1963-2002, composition estimates are based on composition data by income brackets.
For 1951-1962, no estimates are provided because only aggregate composision data are available.
Virtually all interest income after 1947 and large part of dividends after 1965 are missing from the income tax statistics.

Notes: Computations by authors based on estate tax return statistics. See Appendix Section B for details.
Top groups are defined relative to the total number of adult decedents (age 20 and above).
Estates are defined as all properties owned by decedents before deductions net of debts.
The average size (as opposed to share) of estate for each top group is reported in 2002 thousand yen (in 2002, 1,000 yen = $8).
For the correspondence between actual and fiscal years, see Appendic Section B.1.2.
Due to the difficulty in reconstructing estate statistics for actual years, our estimate for each year is imprecise, but their moving average are more accurate.
For 1950-1957, inheritance statistcs are converted to estate statistics; see Appendix Section B.1.4 for details.

Notes: Computations by authors based on aggregate estate tax return statistics. See Appendix Section B.2 for details.
Estates net of debts are defined to be 100%.
Business assets include assets of unincorproate business and farm assets.
Fixed claim assets include bonds, cash, deposits, savings accounts, and other claims.
Other assets include household properties, pensions, life insurance, and other items.
Because the fraction of decedents filing estate tax returns fluctulates from year to year,
estate compositions may not be directly comprable across years.

Wage income is defined as wages, salaries, allowances, and bonuses, excluding non-cash benefits and retirement benefits.
Top wage income groups are defined relative to all regular employees for 1929-1944 and regular employees in the private sector for 1951-2002.
Estimates are based on income tax statistics for 1929-1944 and Survey on Private Wages and Salaries for 1951-2002
The 1929-1944 estimates are less precise than the 1951-2002 estimates and not fully comparable to the 1951-2002 estimates.

Notes: Computations are by authors; see Appendix Section D.2 for details.
Estimates are based on the National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure, 1979-1999.
In contrast to Table 3, Panel C, these NSFIE estimates are based on the household unit and not the individual unit.
Net interest income is estimated based on the holdings of bonds, deposits, and loan trusts, net of liabilities.
Dividend income is estimated based on stock holdings.
Returns on insurance policies are based on the holdings of life and other insurance savings.
Estimates for above the top 5% groups are not available due to the problem of small sample and top coding.

                                       Composition of Top 1% Income in Japan, 1886-2002
Source: Table A2.
Notes: Computations by authors based on income tax return statistics. See Appendix Section A.4 for details.
Business income includes unincorporated business profits, farm income, and self-employment income.
Employment income includes wages, salaries, bonuses, and pensions.
Rental income includes rents from farm land, residential land, housing, and buildings, but excludes imputed rents.
For 1886-1945, composition estimates are based on aggregate income composition and thus imprecisely estimated.
In particular, for 1906-1925, relatively high fractions of adults (2.5% to 4.6%) filed income tax returns.
For 1947-2002, top 1% income composition estimates are based on composition data by income brackets.
For 1887-1899, 1946, and 1951-1962, no estimates are provided because data are not available.
For 1963-2002, estimates are provided only twice a decade.
Virtually all interest income after 1947 and large part of dividends after 1965 are missing from the income tax statistics.

    Compositions of Total Personal Income & Top 1% Income, 1930-2002

Notes: Panel A presents the composition of total personal income denominator based on National Accounts.
Imputed rents are excluded from rents because they are not included in the income tax statistics.
Returns on insurance funds are included in dividends and interest, but not included in income tax statistics.
Panel B presents the composition of top 1% income from Table A2.
All returns on insurance funds after 1947, almost all interest income after 1947 and large part of dividends
after 1965 are missing from income tax statistics.

                          Composition of Aggregate Estates in Japan, 1925-2002
Source: Table B2.
Notes: Estimates are based on aggregate estate compositions in estate tax statistics.
Total exceeds 100% because estates net of debts are defined to be 100%.
Business assets include assets of unincorporated business and farm assets.
Fixed claim assets include bonds, cash, deposits, savings accounts, and other claims.
Other assets include household assets, pensions, life insurance, and other items.
Because of changes in the fractions of decedents filing estate tax returns, compositions are not comprable across years.
See Appendix Section B.3 for details.
