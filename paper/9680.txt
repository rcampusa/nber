                                            ABSTRACT

On numerous occasions, rival firms seek to market goods together, particularly in high-technology
industries. This paper empirically examines one such institution: the patent pool. The analysis
highlights five findings consistent with the theoretical predictions: (a) pools involving substitute
patents are unlikely to allow pool members to license patents independently, consistent with our
earlier theoretical work; (b) independent licensing is more frequently allowed when the number of
members in the pool grows, which may reflect the increasing challenges that reconciling users?
differing technological agendas pose in large pools; (c) larger pools are more likely to have
centralized control of litigation, which may reflect either the fact that the incentives for individual
enforcement in large pools are smaller or that large pools are more likely to include small players
with limited enforcement capabilities; (d) third party licensing is more common in larger pools,
consistent with suggestions that such pools were established primarily to resolve the bargaining
difficulties posed by overlapping patent holdings; and (e) during the most recent era, when an
intense awareness of antitrust concerns precluded many competition-harming patent pools, more
important patents were selected for pools and patents selected for pools were subsequently more
intensively referenced by others.

1. Introduction

       On numerous occasions, rival firms seek to market goods together. In some

cases, they seek to offer complementary products, such as when a toothpaste

manufacturer offers a promotion with a toothbrush maker. Yet on other occasions, the

goods are closer to substitutes, or at least somewhere in between substitutes and

complements. Examples include airlines entering into code-sharing agreements, rival

newspapers offering package advertising rates, and record companies allowing users to

assemble customized collections of songs from multiple labels. One arena where joint

marketing is particularly prevalent is in high-technology industries. Firms frequently

commit to jointly make their intellectual property available, for instance through

commitments to a standard-setting organization or an open source body.



       These interactions have attracted relatively little scrutiny from economists. This

paper seeks to address this neglect, empirically examining one knowledge-sharing

institution: the patent pool.    Patent pools can be defined as formal or informal

organizations where for-profit firms share patent rights with each other and third parties.1

A companion paper examines these bodies from a theoretical perspective.



       Patent pools are particularly interesting for two reasons. First, the determinants of

organizational structure have been a major concern in the industrial organization

literature for many decades. While certain hybrids between arm’s length contracting and


1
 More formally, we define these as cases where either (a) two or more firms combine to
license patents to third parties (which we term “open” pools) or (b) three or more firms
come together to license patents to share the patents among themselves ("closed" pools).
full integration—e.g., joint ventures—have been extensively scrutinized, patent pools

represent a little studied organizational structure that may shed light on contracting

challenges. The second motivation is a more practical one. The United States over the

past two decades has seen an explosion of patent awards, and a dramatic increase in the

volume of patent litigation between rivals. Numerous commentators have suggested that

the proliferation of these awards has had socially detrimental consequences: overlapping

intellectual property rights may make it difficult for inventors to commercialize new

innovations. (Gallini [2002] reviews this literature.) Patent pools have been proposed by

Merges [1999], Shapiro [2000], and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (Clark, et al.

[2001]) as a way in which firms can address these “patent thicket” problems. Indeed,

patent pools are already an economically significant institution: a recent estimate

(Clarkson [2003]) suggests that sales in 2001 of devices based in whole or in part on

poked patents were at least $100 billion. Were these suggestions to be adopted, their role

might approach that seen in the early days of 20th century, when many (if not most)

important manufacturing industries had a patent pooling arrangement.



       After briefly summarizing the history of patent pools, we review the theoretical

predictions concerning the structure of these pools, some of which are based on the

framework in Lerner and Tirole [2002]. We then describe the construction of the sample

of 63 pools established between 1895 and 2001. The analysis highlights five findings

consistent with the theoretical predictions:

   •   First, pools involving substitute patents are unlikely to allow pool members to
       license patents independently, consistent with our earlier theoretical work.




                                               2
   •   Second, independent licensing is more frequently allowed when the number of
       members in the pool grows, which may reflect the increasing challenges that
       reconciling users’ differing technological agendas pose in large pools.

   •   Third, larger pools are more likely to have centralized control of litigation. This
       may reflect either the fact that the incentives for individual enforcement in large
       pools are smaller (i.e., because free riding is more intense) or the fact that large
       pools are more likely to include small players with limited enforcement
       capabilities.

   •   Fourth, third party licensing is more common in larger pools, consistent with
       suggestions that such pools were established primarily to resolve the bargaining
       difficulties posed by overlapping patent holdings.

   •   Finally, during the most recent era, when an intense awareness of antitrust
       concerns precluded many competition-harming patent pools, (a) more important
       patents were selected for pools and (b) patents selected for pools were
       subsequently more intensively referenced by others.

We conclude with a clinical study of a particular patent pool, which in part corroborates

the large-sample study and in part raises additional questions.



       As noted above, there is a very limited amount of related literature. Priest [1977]

and Shapiro [2000] represent pioneering attempts to model the rationales for patent pools.

Bittlingmayer [1988] and Cassady [1959] present clinical studies of single patent pools.

Gilbert [2002] provides a historical overview of these pools. Legal scholars, however,

have written the bulk of the literature on these institutions: Carlson [1999] and Merges

[1999] are examples.

2. A Brief History of Patent Pools2

          The first patent pool is widely agreed to have been established by sewing machine

manufacturers in 1856. By the 1890s, pooling agreements had become commonplace in

the United States. Interest in patent pools stemmed in part from the desire to avoid the

restrictions on anti-competitive activities that had been enacted as part of the Sherman

Act of 1890. Patent pools were seen as exempt from regulatory scrutiny, a perception

that was buttressed in 1902 when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to invalidate a patent

pool, noting “the general rule is absolute freedom in the use or sale of patent rights under

the patent laws of the United States. The very object of these laws is monopoly….”3



           Soon thereafter, however, the tide began to shift. The Supreme Court struck

down the bathtub enameling patent pool in 1912 in the Standard Sanitary decision.

Private antitrust litigation regarding pools increased sharply thereafter. Government

efforts to investigate and break up pools accelerated after well-publicized hearings on

patent pools in the late 1930s. (This period also saw a more general increase in antitrust

enforcement, as discussed in Ghosal and Gallo [2001].) The Supreme Court decision in

the Hartford-Empire case, in which Justice Hugo Black pronounced “the history of this

country has perhaps never witnessed a more completely successful economic tyranny

over any field of industry than that accomplished by [the pool members],”4 was widely

seen as ushering in an era of regulatory intolerance for these arrangements.           As a

consequence, the number of new patent pools formed in the United States dwindled away

to almost nothing after World War II.



          In recent years, however, there has been a cautious revival.   In 1995, the U.S.

Department of Justice and U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued its “Antitrust

Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property,” which explicitly noted, “cross-

licensing and pooling arrangements may provide pro-competitive benefits.”5 Shortly

thereafter, Justice’s Antitrust Division issued a favorable review letter concerning the

MPEG-2 Video patent pool.           The result has been a modest resurgence of these

arrangements. Numerous steps have been taken by the designers of these pools to avoid

antitrust scrutiny, including in many cases the submission of the pooling agreement to the

Antitrust Division for advance approval.



3. Theoretical Perspectives

          In the companion work to this one (Lerner and Tirole [2002]), we present a

theoretical treatment of rationales for and consequences of patent pooling agreements.6

This section is not intended to duplicate that paper. Rather, it seeks to highlight several

key insights based on that framework regarding the structure of patent pools.




5
    http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/guidelines/ipguide.htm (accessed March 19, 2002).
6
 The focus of the theory paper is on normative issues relating to antitrust policy.
Nonetheless, the framework leads to a number of positive insights. In this paper, we
complement the earlier analysis with some additional theoretical points.


                                              5
       We focus here on four characteristics of the patent pools. The first of these is

whether the pool allows its members to engage in independent licensing (i.e., not as part

of the pool). Lerner and Tirole [2002] show that the requirement that independent

licenses be offered is a perfect screening device when—as is often the case—the antitrust

authorities are poorly informed as to whether the patents in the pool are substitutes or

complements. For welfare-decreasing pools (which we will refer to as “pools with

substitute patents” for short7), the requirement that independent licenses be offered

returns the outcome to what it would have been in the absence of a pool. For welfare-

increasing pools (“pools with complementary patents”), the requirement that independent

licensing be permitted has no impact. The theory thus predicts that in the absence of

strong antitrust enforcement, patent pools should allow independent licensing precisely

when it is innocuous, that is, when patents are complements. (All things being equal, we

believe that firms would allow independent licensing, since it would help assuage the

concerns of antitrust authorities, particularly in the most recent years.) Pools between

substitutes would be likely to prohibit such licensing, due to its negative impact on pool

and member profits.



       We also expect that independent licensing will be more common in large pools,

though the strength of our conclusions must be tempered. If a large number of patents

are included in the pool, licensors are only likely to be interested in a subset of the

patents. Independent licensing allows this problem to be addressed. To be sure, pools do


7
 We use this terminology, even though the change in the sign of the welfare impact does
not coincide with the switch from “complements” to “substitutes” (using the definitions
standard in demand theory). It is correct to say, though, that the more substitutable the
patents in the pool are, the more likely it is that the pool will reduce welfare.

                                            6
not need to allow independent licensing in order to let licensors select which patents meet

their needs. Alternatively, they could offer “menus,” or subsets of patents to license.

One of the surprises we encountered in the data collection phase was how few pools

(11% of the entire sample) offered menus. As the case study discussed in Section 6

highlights, transaction costs, disagreements over how to price items on the menu, and

disputes over the sharing of licensing fees all served to discourage the use of menus.

Such potential disagreements may make independent licensing an attractive substitute for

menus.



         The second characteristic of the pools we consider is whether control of litigation

is centralized. Initially, it might be thought that it would always make sense to assign

control over enforcement activities to the original patent-owners: after all, they should be

better informed about their patents than anyone else. But the choice as to whether to

control litigation centrally is driven by two considerations: capabilities and externalities.



         On the capabilities front, the abilities of firms to detect infringements and manage

patent litigation cases are likely to vary drastically. In particular, small firms without

large patent portfolios are unlikely to have experienced lawyers specializing in

intellectual property issues. These limited capabilities mean that centralized enforcement

is advantageous. Pools with many members may be more likely to have firms without

the capacity to litigate.




                                              7
       The choice of whether to centralize the control of litigation is also driven by the

presence of externalities among the members.         Each member, under decentralized

enforcement, considers its own welfare, but not that of other participants. In the absence

of independent licensing, each firm only receives 1/nth of the pool’s proceeds from its

expenditures on enforcement.     We would expect this “free-rider problem,” and the

consequent reduced investment in enforcement, to be most severe when there are many

firms in the patent pool.



       Independent licensing reduces this free-rider rider problem, as royalties on

individual patents are then only partially shared. Thus, independent licensing should

work against centralization. Note, though, that although this effect is clear, its strength

may be limited if—as theory predicts and will be verified empirically—independent

licensing is mainly present when patents are complements. Thus, the use of independent

licensing will be limited, and it will only be able to partially mitigate the free-rider

problem.



       We should note that pool members’ attitudes towards the reduced litigation

resulting from decentralized control might vary. Suppose, for instance, that members are

allowed to license their patents independently. If patents are substitutes (an unlikely

case, as we argued above), then the under-investment in litigation leads to negative

consequences for the pool. When the patents are complements, however, the absence of

litigation may actually help the other pool members: the lower price that a pool member




                                            8
who fails to litigate his patents or his infringer charges may lead to increased demand for

the other, independently licensed patents.



           Pools are more likely to grant licenses to third parties if the latter are downstream

suppliers of products not offered by the pool members or (even better) complements to

the pool’s products. Unfortunately, we do not observe the extent to which the pool

members have a presence in the downstream product markets.



           It is also difficult for us to predict whether pools consisting of patents that are

substitutes or complements with each other are more likely to offer licenses to third

parties.      Owners of intellectual property can enter into patent pools for a number of

reasons. These different motivations are likely to lead to very different choices. One

rationale for entering into a patent pool is to facilitate collusion. Firms may enter into

such agreements to reduce the degree of competition with their peers. In product market

cartels, the pool may serve as a mechanism to extract greater profits from the downstream

market. By combining patents that are substitutes and licensing them as a package, firms

may be able to charge higher royalties for the usage of the technology. A more benign

alternative is that firms enter into patent pools to solve the “patent thicket” problem: the

presence of overlapping intellectual property holdings that make it difficult for third

parties to license patent holdings and develop new technologies. Such pools, unlike the

ones discussed above, have the potential to enhance social welfare.




                                                9
       Similarly, it is difficult for us to anticipate the impact of pool size.       One

conjecture is that small pools may lack the capability for downstream production, while

larger pools have such a capability. Larger pools may thus be less likely to grant licenses

to third parties. As we’ll see once we turn to the data, however, fully 98% of the pool

members have the option to make use of the patents included in the pool, so the

conjectured effect is unlikely to be a strong one.8 Alternatively, it may be possible that

the motivation for forming the larger pools is that key patents are more widely distributed

across firms. If the motivation for such pools is to address “patent thicket” problems,

then third party licensing may be more common in these settings.



        Finally, we examine the innovation friendliness of the pools: the extent to which

features of the pool encourage or deter future innovation by the pool members. Pools

encourage innovation by their members by allowing them to keep the rights to the

intellectual property that they discover after the pool is formed.9 By requiring these

awards to be assigned to the patent pool, the incentive to innovate is dulled. It should be

noted that however undesirable the reduced incentives to innovate are from a social

perspective, this consequence may not be worrisome for pool members: firms may seek

to boost their profits by “softening” their competition in the R&D market in this manner.

But innovation unfriendly terms also play a more benign role. By adopting such a clause,

the pool members protect themselves from hold-up problems by one of their



8
 It is not clear that that the firms exercised this option in every case; this term’s
prevalence may reflect the very low cost of adding such a provision to an agreement.
9
 See Lerner and Tirole [2002] for a more general analysis of the determinants of
innovation friendliness.

                                            10
opportunistic peers. By requiring automatic licensing, the potential problem that a pool

member may make an essential discovery and then demand an extraordinary sum from

the other members for access to the technology is defused.



       The impact of the rate of technological progress on the decision to make a pool

innovation friendly is ambiguous.      If rapid technological progress characterizes an

industry, the possibility of a radical innovation that would make opportunistic behavior

possible is greater. This concern argues for the adoption of provisions that require the

assignment of future patents, even if they reduce the incentives to innovate. At the same

time, the dangers associated with the reduced incentives to innovate may be the greatest

here: another firm outside the pool may be more likely to make a discovery that

“leapfrogs” (obsoletes) the technology of the pool members. Thus, a faster rate of

innovation in the industry increases both the costs and benefits of innovation friendliness.



       The consequences of being leapfrogged are particularly severe if the main aim of

the pool is to license its technology to third parties. (By way of contrast, pool members

combining patents for their own use may welcome some external competition.) Hence,

we would expect innovation friendliness to be positively associated with licensing to

third parties, particularly when the patents included in the pool are complements.



       Another set of predictions relate to the recent set of pools, almost all of which

have been extensively scrutinized by the U.S. Department of Justice for possible

detrimental impacts on competition. Even in the recent pools not submitted to the



                                            11
Department for review, pool members—seeking to deter antitrust scrutiny—have

typically hired outside experts to ascertain that the patents are truly essential (that is,

complementary). It might be thought that in these pools, we would see two effects at

work:

    •   The quality of the patents included in the pools would be higher, reflecting the
        screening of potential patents.

    •   Since in these cases, the pools are especially likely to enhance usage of the
        patents by third parties, the patents included in these pools should be more heavily
        employed by others.

We will test these suggestions using the various measures of patent quality found in the

earlier literature (e.g., using patent citations as a proxy for utilization).



4. Constructing the Sample

        The literature on patent pools to date—which, as noted above, has been largely

confined to law reviews—focuses on the reported judicial decisions on these

arrangements. While the decisions discuss aspects of the pools’ structure, they do not

provide sufficient details to allow a systematic analysis of the features of the pools. In

order to test the theory delineated above, we needed the actual agreements governing the

patent pools. This section describes the procedure we employed to construct the patent

pool sample, as well as the supplemental data used in the analysis.



A. Identifying the Pools

        The first question was one of definition.          Our definition of patent pools in

footnote 1 excludes several other types of arrangements:




                                               12
   •   Simple cross-license arrangements between two firms, where there was no clearly
       stated intention of engaging in future licensing transactions.

   •   New operating companies that were established to manufacture products based on
       intellectual property of a number of firms (e.g., Radio Corporation of America).

   •   Firms that acquired large amounts of patents and then licensed them to other
       concerns (e.g., American Steel and Wire Company, American Tobacco Company,
       and other “patent consolidators”).

   •   Pools that are dominated by non-profit entities (e.g., universities), where profit-
       maximizing considerations may not be paramount.


       We then compiled a list of all identifiable patent pools. The primary sources for

these identifications were Carlson [1999], Commerce Clearing House [various years],

Kaysen and Turner [1959], Merges [1999], Vaughn [1925, 1956], and “War and Peace”

[1942], though many other sources were used as well.             In total, we identified

approximately 125 patent pools, dating between 1856 and 2001. (In some cases, we were

unsure based on the information that we could collect whether the arrangement satisfied

our definition of a pool.)



       These pools appear not to have been disclosed by firms in filings with the U.S.

Securities and Exchange Commission. Instead, we obtained the pooling agreements in

five ways:

   •   Congressional hearings during the 1930s and 1940s scrutinized a number of
       patent pools (especially U.S. Congress [1938-1940], U.S. House [1935], U.S.
       Senate [1942]). In many cases, the pooling agreements were either published in
       the records of the hearings or else retained as unpublished exhibits (which are
       preserved in the committees’ files in the National Archives in Washington, D.C.)

   •   Many of the pools were subjects of private or federal antitrust litigation. In the
       course of the trials, frequently the patent pooling agreements were entered as
       exhibits. The dockets of these cases are preserved in the various regional
       depositories of the National Archives. In order to limit costs, we focused on those


                                           13
         depositories with the greatest concentration of cases: Boston (which has records
         from federal district cases in the first judicial circuit), Chicago (which includes
         much of the sixth and seventh circuits, as well as some of the ninth circuit),
         Kansas City (which has records from parts of the eighth and tenth circuits, as well
         as older records from parts of the second and third circuit), and New York City
         (which has more recent records from parts of the second and third circuits).

     •   The Antitrust Division of U.S. Department of Justice investigated a number of
         patent pools, some of which were litigated against and others were not. Since the
         time these files were used by Hay and Kelley [1974], the records have been
         transferred to the National Archives’ Suitland, Maryland facility. These files
         were located with the assistance of Johnson [1981]. As part of the investigations,
         the patent pooling agreements were sometimes gathered and preserved.

     •   The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission have
         scrutinized a number of the recent pools. In these cases, we obtained the key
         documents through Freedom of Information Act requests.

     •   In the case of recent pools that had not been the subject of federal scrutiny, we
         requested the documents from the pool administrators.

In all, we were able to collect the documentation on 63 patent pools.10 We then identified

and coded the key characteristics of the agreements. We focused on the initial agreement

establishing the pool, rather than the many amendments that frequently characterize these

agreements.



         Given the lack of a systematized database of patent pools, it is difficult to assess

the comprehensiveness of our sample.         At the same time, it is reassuring that the

distribution of the 63 pools, summarized in Table 1 and 2, reflects the patterns discussed

in Section 2. We believe it is likely that the sample underrepresents the very oldest

pools: the federal government was far less active in antitrust enforcement during this


10
  We have not identified any non-U.S. government sources for patent pool agreements
(though our sample does include some agreements exclusively between firms outside the
United States). Antitrust authorities outside the U.S. historically do not appear to have
systematically reviewed or litigated patent pooling arrangements until recent years.

                                             14
period, and many of district court files from this period are lost or unusable. In addition,

it may be that pools involving German firms are disproportionately represented, since ties

between German and American firms were a particular focus of the Bone Committee’s

hearings in 1942.



B. Supplemental Information

       We next collected a variety of information on each of these pools. One important

variable in our analysis was patenting activity in the industry of the patent pool in the five

years prior to the establishment of the pool.        To undertake this analysis, we first

determined which patent subclasses using today’s classification scheme the patent pool

covered. (The patent classification scheme is periodically updated as new technologies

emerge.) These subclasses were identified in two ways. First, we examined the U.S.

Patent and Trademark Office’s (USPTO) Manual of Classification (available at

http://www.uspto.gov/go/classification/uspcindex/indextouspc.htm), which details the

U.S. patent classification scheme. Second, we determined the patents that were included

in the pool from the pooling agreements. These were determined from the agreements

themselves and USPTO indexes. We ascertained the subclasses into which the patents

are assigned today using the database available at http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/search-

adv.html. We then determined how many patents were assigned to these subclasses

(whether included in the pool or not) in the years before the establishment of the pool

using the latter database. We also computed two alternative measures: the overall growth

in patenting by pool members and the patenting by members in the subclass covered by

the patent pool. A detailed index to U.S. patent awards by firm is available in electronic



                                             15
format only after the early 1970s. To identify patenting by firms for the older pools, we

used the USPTO’s annual Index of Patents Issued by the Commissioner of Patents and its

predecessor publications.



         We also collected several other measures, which we used in supplemental

regressions not reported in the paper:

     •   The revenues of pool members in the five years prior to the establishment of the
         pool. For recent pools, we employed the data in Compustat and WorldScope
         databases. For older pools, we relied on information in the Moody’s Industrial
         Manuals, which list both U.S. and major foreign firms, and various non-U.S.
         national corporate directories. In some cases, we were able to determine from the
         publication another measure of financial performance (e.g., the firm’s operating
         profits or net income), but not the firm’s revenues. In these cases, we used the
         median ratio between this measure and the revenues for other firms in the industry
         during the same year (also determined from the Moody’s manual) to impute the
         revenue. We were not able to determine any financial information, however, for
         approximately one-third of the firms.

     •   The median book-to-market ratio for firms in the industry of the patent pool in the
         year prior to the establishment of the pool. This ratio, which is frequently used as
         a proxy for growth prospects, was determined for recent pools using the
         Compustat and the Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) databases.
         For the pools established prior to the 1970s, we employed market value data from
         the CRSP database and the book value data collected from Moody’s manuals by
         Davis, Fama, and French [2000]. Because valuation levels shift dramatically over
         this period, we adjust the median industry book-to-market ratio by subtracting
         from it the median ratio for all firms in that year.11




 This data set only extends as far back as 1926, so we do not have this measure for
11

earlier patent pools.


                                             16
C. Additional Data for the Most Recent Pools

         As noted above, we intensively study five patent pools12 formed in 1995 and after.

We elected to focus on recent pools for two reasons. First, as noted above, there was a

strong rationale for believing that these pools would be consistently innovation and

efficiency enhancing, as opposed to those from earlier periods, where considerable

diversity characterized the population of pools.13 Second, the U.S. patents in these pools

could be analyzed using the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Patent

Citations Data File constructed by Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg [2001].          (Detailed

information about U.S. patents awarded before the 1970s are not available in any

electronic database.)



         Upon identifying the pooled patents, we proceeded to form two sets of matching

patents:

     •   The first of these matching sets included the patents awarded to the same firms
         that were most proximate to the pooled patent. (We defined the most proximate
         patent as the one with the closest award number.)14

     •   The second of these matching patents was the most proximate patents awarded to
         the same type of assignee as the pooled patents and within the same USPTO

 The pools whose patents were analyzed included the two DVD, MPEG-2, 1394, and
12

DVB-T associations. Though we had the pooling agreements for two additional recent
patent pools, the Bluetooth and 3G organizations, these documents did not include data
on which patents had been assigned to these pools. Thus, we could not use these two
pools in the patent analysis.

 While antitrust officials are unlikely to always know whether the patents in the pools are
13

substitutes or complements, the use of external reviewers to determine essential patents
and (as we argue in Lerner and Tirole [2002]) the presence of independent licensing
requirements help insure that these recent pools are innovation and efficiency enhancing.

 We were not able to assign a matching patent based on this criterion for one pooled
14

patent because the assignee did not own any patents other than the patents included in the
pool.

                                             17
       technology class. We relied upon the assignee type field in the NBER patent
       database to determine whether each patent was assigned to a government, non-
       government organization (mostly corporations), or an individual, and whether the
       patent was assigned to a U.S. or non-U.S. entity.

When the matching patent coincided with a patent that was included in a pool or with a

patent that was already selected as a matching patent, then the next most proximate patent

was selected as the matching patent. In cases where the matching patent for a given

pooled patent based on the same-firm criteria was the same as the matching patent based

on the same-class criteria, we found a new same-class match for the patent, choosing the

second most proximate award.



       In the majority of cases, the award date of the matching patents was the same as

the award date of the pooled patent. The mean of the absolute number of days between

the pooled patent and the matched patent based on the same-firm criteria was 37.3 days

and the median was 0.0. The mean absolute number of days between the pooled patent

and the matched patent based on the same-class criteria was 2.5 days and the median was

0.0.



5. Analysis

       We proceed in two parts. First, using the patent pools established before 1995,

we examine the determinants of the characteristics of these agreements. We then focus

on the most recent pools, and exploit our more detailed data on these organizations.




                                           18
A. Analyses of Pool Characteristics

       Our first approach is to examine the univariate relationships. Table 3 presents an

initial tabulation of the four dependent variables we will examine, as well as the three

independent variables discussed above.



       While such an analysis can only scratch the surface—we do not consider the

relationships between the dependent variables or the interaction effects discussed

above—a few patterns stand out.          First, a secular trend appears to be at work.

Independent licensing provisions are more common in later pools, while the centralized

control over litigation has become less so. Second, pool size appears to matter. Larger

pools are associated with a greater probability of independent licensing, consistent with

theoretical suggestions above.



       We then seek to estimate a formal model. Following the discussion in Section 3

above, we hypothesize the following relationships:

       indivlic = a + b×firmcount + c×substitute + ε1

       litigcentral = d + e×firmcount + f×firmcount×licto3rd×(1-indivlic) + g×indivlic +
                      h×substitute×indivlic + ε2

       licto3rd = i + j×firmcount + k×substitute + ε3

       innovfr = l + m×licto3rd + n×(1-substitute)×licto3rd + o×growth + ε4

These equations had three sets of variables, which we will discuss in turn.



       There were four limited dependent variables. Indivlic, licto3rd, and innovfr take

on value one if the pool allows independent licensing by pool members, allows licensing


                                            19
to third parties, and does not require pool members to automatically assign discoveries to

the pool. Litigcentral takes on the value of one if litigation is controlled by each firm

acting on its own; three if the pool is in control of the litigation with no provision for opt-

out; and two in the intermediate cases. Simultaneous estimation is necessary because

some limited dependent variables appear on the right-hand side of the equations.



       The exogenous independent variables included the count of the number of parties

in the pool (firmcount) and the growth of patenting in the industry segment of the pool in

the five years prior to the pool’s formation (growth). Because we believe that there will

be substantial non-linearities with firm size (e.g., the coordination challenges may be

very different in a pool with two members and one with six members, but not differ

appreciably between ones with ten and thirty members), we winsorize the firm count

variable. Firmcount is top-coded at six. In robustness checks discussed below, we use

alternative measures for the count of the firm members and for growth.



       The variable substitute takes on the value one if the patents in the pool are pure

substitutes, zero if they are entirely complements, or else takes on an intermediate value

in this range. Because we do not observe the degree of substitutability, we estimate this

as a latent variable, using the following fifth equation:

       substitute = p + q×y45bef + r×royaltyfreemem×(1-licto3rd) + s×notgilbertcase +
                    ε5

The independent variables are measures that we expect will be associated with the degree

of substitutability or complementarity of the patents in the pool. Y45bef indicates pools

formed before the Hartford-Empire decision of 1945; royaltyfreemem denotes pools


                                              20
where the members used the patents in the pool on a royalty free basis; and

notgilbertcase denotes pools other than those identified by Gilbert [2002] as ones where

the courts identified the pool as anti-competitive in intent. Only the rationale for the

second item probably needs discussion. We hypothesized that in cases where pool

members were free to use patents on a royalty free basis and the pool did not license them

to third parties, it was less likely that the decision to establish the pool was driven by

anticompetitive motivations (and the patents were less likely to be substitutes).



       The five equations are estimated simultaneously following the approaches

delineated in the discrete choice literature. Heckman [1978] discusses the issues of

identification and estimation in this setting. Schmidt [1981] provides the necessary and

sufficient conditions for simultaneous equations with limited dependent variables to be

internally consistent.



       More specifically, each limited dependent variable, y, is associated with a latent

variable, y*, that follows a normal distribution:

       Prob(y = i) = Prob(zi-1 < y* < zi)

The set of parameters includes {a,…, o, q,…, r} and the threshold parameters {zi}. The

scaling constant p is used to enforce the constraint that the latent variable substitute falls

between 0 and 1. As a result, p is not a well-identified parameter to be estimated in the

analysis. The estimates are obtained by numerically maximizing the log likelihood

function. The standard errors of the estimates are calculated from the inverse of the




                                             21
Fisher information matrix. The numerical second derivative of the log likelihood function

is used as in Hamilton [1994].



       The intensive reviews of the draft patent pool agreements by U.S. Department of

Justice officials in 1995 and thereafter may have resulted in fundamentally different

dynamics behind these agreements. Reflecting this concern, our analysis is restricted to

pools established prior to 1995.



       The results from this analysis are presented in Table 4. The following results

stood out from the analyses:

   •   Pools involving substitute patents are unlikely to allow pool a member to license
       patents independently, consistent with our earlier theoretical work.

   •   Independent licensing is more frequently allowed when the number of members
       in the pool grows, which may reflect the increasing challenges associated with
       reconciling users’ differing technological agendas in large pools.

   •   Larger pools are more likely to have centralized control of litigation. As noted
       above, this may reflect either the fact that the incentives for individual
       enforcement in large pools are smaller (i.e., because free riding is more intense) or
       the fact that large pools are more likely to include small players with limited
       enforcement capability. The former hypothesis had suggested that the interaction
       between the count of firms in the pool and the absence of independent licensing
       would have particular explanatory power, but this coefficient proves to be
       insignificant and of the opposite sign.

   •   Suggestive, though statistically insignificant, results emerge from the relationship
       between the centralized control of litigation and independent licensing. As
       predicted above, independent licensing is associated with a lower probability of
       centralized control of litigation.

   •   We had few unambiguous predictions regarding the determinants of patents being
       licensed to third parties. We find that third party licensing is more common in
       larger pools, which is consistent with suggestions that such pools were established
       primarily to resolve the bargaining difficulties posed by overlapping patent
       holdings.


                                            22
   •   Again, the analysis of innovation friendliness produces suggestive, if statistically
       insignificant results. Innovation friendly terms are associated with pools where
       there is licensing to third parties, particularly of complementary patents.

   •   The estimated latent variable regressions generate one statistically significant
       result consistent with our priors: pools identified by Gilbert [2002] as particularly
       problematic are more likely to contain substitutes. The greater probability of
       pools formed prior to 1945 having substitute patents, while statistically
       insignificant, is also consistent with our priors.


       While our ability to examine the robustness of the results was limited by the small

sample size and the modest number of details on the pool members that we were able to

ascertain, in unreported regressions we undertook a variety of supplemental analyses.

We employ alternative dependent and independent variables (for instance, coding

litigcentral as a binary measure like the others and no longer winsorizing firmcount). We

substitute the alternative variables measuring growth (growth in pool members’ sales and

patenting) for growth in overall industry patenting. The results delineated above continue

to come through, though the significance of the firmcount measure is frequently lower

when the full measure is used, due to the heavy influence of a few very large pools.



       Another set of robustness checks examined the possibility of selection biases. As

acknowledged above, our sample was not a random one: the pools included in the

analysis were disproportionately likely to have been litigated.        These pools might

reasonably be thought to have characteristics (e.g., anti-competitive provisions) not

shared by the others. To address this concern, we examined the subset of historical pools

that were identified through means other than litigation records: those revealed in the

course of congressional hearings.     The criteria used to select pools for scrutiny by



                                            23
Congress were quite different: for instance, a number of hearings systematically

examined all active pools in certain industries (e.g., dyestuffs, petroleum, and precious

metals) or involving firms of a given nation (Germany).



         We repeated the above analyses, using this sub-sample. Because of the smaller

sample size, we did not estimate the full set of equations, but rather single equations or

sets of two equations. The magnitude of the effects continued to be similar, though the

statistical significance was more modest in some cases (reflecting the smaller sample

size).



         A third concern related to the presence of omitted variable biases. We were

worried that our results could stem from the fact that variables such as firmcount might

be correlated with important omitted measures, such as the degree to which the members

of the pool dominated the upstream or downstream product markets. While we could not

thoroughly address this concern, we did explore the robustness of the results to

specifications with additional independent variables.      These results were generally

consistent, though significance levels did vary.



B. Analysis of Pool Performance

         We then examined the relative importance of the patents that were included in the

recent pools, as well as the effects of selection into these pools on the usage of these

patents. We focus our analysis on the most recent period when, as noted above, patent

pools were subject to extensive antitrust scrutiny. Consistent with theoretical suggestions



                                            24
above, pools appear to have higher-quality patents and the inclusion in the pool seemed

to trigger more utilization.



       Table 5 provides a look at the differences between pooled patents and their

counterparts. In Panel A, we focus upon a measure of the importance: patent citations

received. A patent that receives more citations is generally viewed as being more

important than a patent with fewer citations (see, for instance, Jaffe and Trajtenberg

[2002]). We divided the number of citations to each patent into two components: the

citations received before the pool was formed and those received afterwards.



       In order to count the number of citations a patent received before and after the

pool was formed, we used the NBER Patent Citation Data File. We were able to identify

all of the patents that cited patents in our sample through the end of 1999. Once we

identified these patents, we used the grant date of each citing patent to determine if it was

awarded before or after the formation of a given pool. For the matching patents, we

similarly examined the number of citations prior to and after the formation of the pool in

which the corresponding pooled patent was included.



       The number of citations received before the pool was formed served as a measure

of the importance of a patent that can reasonably be assumed to be unaffected by its

inclusion in a pool. The number of citations received after the pool was formed reflects

factors such as the intrinsic significance of the patent, the increased attention received

due to its inclusion in the pool, and potentially the decreased concerns about blocking



                                             25
patent issues that arise in follow-on innovations. In Panel A of Table 5, we compare the

average annual number of citations before and after the pools’ formation. Tests of the

equality of means and medians reveal that the number of citations received before and

after pool formation are both significantly higher for pooled patents relative to the

matching patents. These results suggest that the patents included in the pools were

relatively more important.



       Figure 1 and 2 provide a graphical look at the number of citations received by

year. In the first graph, we present the annual citation rate relative to the year of the

award: e.g., we depict the citations per patent in the sample in the year after the award.

Consistently, those patents that are included in the pools are more intensively cited. In

the second, the citations are presented relative to the year of pool formation. The figure

reveals that while patents in the pool are more intensively cited than their peers, the

difference is confined to the years immediately before the pools’ formation and the years

subsequent to the pools’ establishment.



       In Panel B and Panel C of Table 5, we look at differences in “originality” and

“generality” respectively between patents included in pools and the matching sets. We

use the measures of originality and generality employed by Jaffe and Trajtenberg [2002],

where generality/originality is defined as one minus the sum of the squared percentage of

citations received/made from each patent class. Originality is a proxy for the

innovativeness of patents because patents citing patents from a more diverse set of

classes can be thought of as linking innovations from a broader set of domains. Panel B



                                           26
indicates that the originality of the pooled patents is not significantly different from the

originality of the matching sets.



       Generality is also related to the economic value of a patent. Patents cited by

patents from a wider set of classes tend to be more valuable because they form the basis

for follow-on innovations in a larger set of fields. Panel C reveals that the generality of

the pooled patents is significantly higher than the generality of the matching patents. This

suggests that either the patents being included in pools have the potential to be leveraged

in a wider variety of domains or the effect of being included in the pools results in their

broader utilization.



       In Panel D, we utilize the number of claims made by a patent as a proxy for the

scope of a patent. Patents that make more claims tend to be broader and therefore more

valuable. For both matching sets in Panel D, the Wilcoxon median test yields a smaller p-

value than the t-test. This difference can be attributed to the skewness in the distribution

of the number of claims made by patents. The results of the Wilcoxon median test are

probably more relevant because of the weaker distributional assumptions made by this

test.15 Employing the set of matching patents by class and by firm, the Wilcoxon median

test indicates that the number of claims made by pooled patents is significantly higher

than non-pooled patents at the 10% level of significance. Restricting the set of matching

patents to matches by firm yields similar results.



15
  The Wilcoxon median test simply assumes that the two sets come from populations with
the same distribution without imposing restrictions on what this shape may be.


                                             27
        We then seek to perform similar analyses of the characteristics of pooled patents in

a multivariate framework. We employed the same sets of matching patents as above to

construct our sample. The dependent variables we used in these analyses are the same

measures of patent characteristics as used above: citations received, originality, generality,

and claims made.



        In Table 6, we explore the importance of patents as measured by citations received.

We use as the dependent variable the number of citations received in each year after the

award. As in the univariate analysis, we employed this strategy to address the concern that

once a patent is included in a pool, it will receive more citations due its exposure and its

availability on established licensing terms. We employ several specifications, in the style

of Furman and Stern [2002].           First, we simply estimated ordinary least squares

regressions, with dummy variables controlling for the year of the patent award, the vintage

of the patent (that is, the number of years between the award and the observation), and

each matched set of patents (the pooled patent and the two matching ones). The patents in

the pool are more frequently cited in general, but particularly after the establishment of the

pool.



        Due to the discrete nature of the number of citations received, we also ran a set of

regressions using a negative binomial specification.       We again employed a dummy

variable for each group of patents, and also estimated the equation with a distinct dummy

variable for each patent. Once again, patents included in pools were more frequently cited



                                            28
in general, and especially after their inclusion in a pool (an effect that was particularly

strong in the latter specification).16



        We employed only one observation for each patent in the regressions analyzing

originality, generality, and the number of claims reported in Table 7. As control variables,

we employed dummy variables for the year in which a patent was granted, the pool in

which the patent was included (the pool of the corresponding pooled patent in the case of

matching patents), and the category of the patent as defined in the NBER patent database.17

The results are also consistent with the univariate comparisons in Table 5. Across the

specifications, generality is highly significant while originality is not. These regressions

suggest that pooled patents tend to have a broader range of applications but do not

integrate a broader set of innovations. The last regression reveals that the number of

claims made by pooled patents is not significantly greater than the number of claims made

by non-pooled patents.




16
  We repeat the regression analyses, adding a dummy variable for patents that would be
added to a pool in the next one-to-three years (as well as an interaction term as above).
This interaction term is also positive and significant across the regressions. Even after
we control for the greater propensity to cite both patents that are already in pools and
those that are soon to be added to pools, the coefficient on the variable denoting patents
that are included in pools is consistently positive and significant. In other words, the
tendency to cite pooled patents more frequently is not confined to the periods
immediately before and after they are included in a pool.

 These categories are Chemical (excluding drugs), Computers and Communications,
17

Drugs and Medical, Electrical and Electronics, Mechanical, and Other.


                                           29
6. Field Research

       To gain a richer understanding of the forces shaping patent pooling agreements,

we supplemented our theoretical and large-sample research with a case study of the

MPEG-2 patent pool.18       MPEG-2 is a digital video compression standard used in

products including DVD and high definition television. The standard was developed by

the International Organization for Standardisation (ISO) under the leadership of Leonardo

Chiariglione, along with scientists and engineers from many universities and

corporations. The standard setting effort began in the July 1990 and the final MPEG-2

standard was approved in November 1994. During the completion of the standard setting

process, intellectual property issues became a paramount concern. While all participants

in the standard setting process signed a letter of assurance of fair, reasonable, and

nondiscriminatory (RAND) licensing, concerns lingered due to the large number of

patents required to implement the standard. Even if each individual patentholder licensed

their patents on reasonable terms, Chiariglione and other participants were concerned that

the sum of all such licenses might not be reasonable.19




18
  This section is based on interviews with current and former employees from five
different organizations that participated in or negotiated with the pool. In addition, we
spoke with Leonardo Chiariglione, Vice President, Multimedia at Telecom Italia Lab, the
research center of Telecom Italia. Finally, we spoke with a representative from MPEG
LA, the corporate entity formed to administrate the pool.
19
  It should be noted that considerable ambiguity surrounds the definition of what
constitutes RAND licensing. A number of standard-setting bodies we talked to were
unable to provide a precise definition of what constituted a reasonable royalty. For
instance, one group indicated that they used 5% as an upper bound, but did not
distinguish between cases where the rate applied to the individual component and the
entire system.

                                            30
       The MPEG Intellectual Property Rights Working Group was thus formed in 1993

to develop a unified approach to MPEG-2 licensing. As the standard materialized, this

task was led by CableLabs, an R&D consortium for the cable industry formed in the late

1980s when there was little compatibility among cable systems in the U.S. CableLabs

was an active participant in the MPEG-2 standard setting process with the goal of making

sure that the resulting standard was consistent with their needs. Baryn Futa, executive

vice president and COO of CableLabs, gained the trust of participants by chairing the

MPEG intellectual property working group. Solutions other than a patent pool were

considered, such as a trade association that would function as a clearinghouse. But patent

holders wanted to ensure that their intellectual property would be aggressively marketed

and thus rejected such an association. As a result, CableLabs and other licensors injected

$3 million to found a corporation, MPEG LA, which handled licensing MPEG-2 patents.



       Forming the MPEG-2 patent pool and convincing companies to join the pool was

complicated due to the different incentives among pool members. These heterogeneous

incentives, as well as antitrust considerations, shaped the critical features of the pool.



       The most debated issue was the licensing rate that MPEG LA would charge

licensees. The primary motive for certain companies was not to maximize licensing

revenues, but rather to accelerate the adoption of the standard. For instance, while Sony

is both a licensor and licensee of MPEG-2 patents, Sony focuses on maximizing sales of

its electronics products and pursues patents as a “defensive mechanism” to protect its

intellectually property.



                                              31
       By way of contrast, other organizations such as Lucent and Columbia University

wanted to maximize the licensing revenues they received from their MPEG-2 patents.

Columbia was particularly motivated to see the pool succeed due to its fears that if a pool

were not formed, then MPEG-2 patents would largely be shared via royalty-free cross-

licensing agreements. Since the university did not stand to gain by being offered a license

to another firm’s technology, in the absence of a pool Columbia would be put in the

unenviable position of demanding license payments in an environment where no other

cash payments were being made for MPEG-2 licenses. Thus, Columbia’s ability to

demand a relatively high royalty rate was balanced by its need to ensure that a patent pool

emerged.



       On the other hand, Lucent’s bargaining position with the MPEG-2 pool was quite

different. Lucent had a large internal licensing department with sufficient resources to

conduct its own MPEG-2 licensing activities. Moreover, Lucent believed that two of its

patents were most critical to the MPEG standard. Lucent felt that the licensing rate

established by MPEG LA was lower than it could have been and decided not to join the

pool.20 Lucent estimated that the higher royalty rates it would be able to charge by not

joining the pool would more than offset the decreased fraction of the MPEG-2 market

that would license its technology if it pursued its own licensing activities.21


 Lucent was also constrained by licensing policies that were established as part of a 1956
20

consent decree settling federal antitrust litigation against Western Electric.

 So far, this has not been the case, as MPEG-2 licensees generally have been willing to
21

pay Lucent no more than the per-patent rate charged by MPEG LA for licenses under
Lucent’s MPEG-2 patents. The failure of Lucent to reap attractive returns from its “hold

                                              32
       The final licensing rate set by the pool was $4 per decoder for each MPEG-2

system. This “one size fits all” strategy led to problems in some markets. In some cases,

licensees already had licenses to some of the MPEG-2 patents based on broad licensing

agreements they had with MPEG LA member firms. In such cases, the licensees have

demanded that the rates they are charged be reduced. MPEG LA has handled such

situations by telling these firms to negotiate concessions with the individual firms

involved in the previous licensing agreements rather than altering the standard MPEG LA

licensing terms. A bigger problem has occurred in using the same terms for firms in

different industries. Computer companies have been reluctant to pay these rates, due to

the computer industry norm of not paying royalties and due to the number of features

embodied in computers that do not relate to MPEG-2. This led seven MPEG LA pool

members to initiate infringement litigation against Compaq and Dell.



       Additional clauses in the MPEG LA license agreement were designed to make

MPEG-2 licensees comfortable in adopting the technology. The MPEG LA license grants

licenses under the future MPEG-2 essential patents of pool members at no additional

charge. This provision was viewed as a way to allay the fears of potential licensees that

they would be subject to a hold-up problem if and when new MPEG-2 patents surfaced.

The MPEG LA license also commits to not raising the royalty rate unless extreme


out” strategy may appear initially puzzling. The seller of a complementary good should
be able to charge more when other firms cut their prices. Industry observers, however,
argued that substantial uncertainty surrounded the determination of the proper royalty
rate for patents. MPEG LA’s decision to set a low rate may have been seen as a signal of
the patents’ value, leading to a reduced willingness to license Lucent’s complementary
patents at a high rate.

                                           33
conditions arise. This clause is also intended to make potential licensees comfortable with

committing to use MPEG-2 in their products without the worry of being charged

excessively high licensing rates in the future.22



       The commitment not to raise royalty rates, however, also impacts the ability of

the pool to attract new licensors. When a new licensor enters the pool, as any essential

MPEG-2 patent holder may do, each existing licensor is diluted: the formula used by the

pool for royalty distribution calls for each licensor to receive a pro rata share of the

licensing revenues (based on the number of essential patents it owns) while the rate

charged to licensees remains constant. This formula was seen as the only feasible

formula to avoid controversies regarding assigning value to each individual patent.



       The influence of antitrust concerns necessitated that (a) licensors would not be

precluded from offering licenses under their individual patents, (b) pool membership

would be open to any firm with essential MPEG-2 patents, and (c) only “essential”

patents (as determined by outside counsel) would be included.           In other respects,

however, the pool was somewhat user unfriendly. For instance, licensees were required

to grant back the patents on any innovations that are essential to MPEG-2. One possible

rationale was that while pool members made important concessions to the Department of

Justice, in other areas they felt free to even the balance.




 In point of fact, the royalty rate has subsequently been lowered to $2.50, even as the
22

number of patent families covered by the pool has expanded from 25 to 118.

7. Conclusions

       This paper empirically examines the structure and impact of patent pools. These

complex organizations have been little studied, despite their inherent interest on both

theoretical and practical grounds.    We suggest that the changing features of these

arrangements over time and across different circumstances—as well as the performance

of recent pools—are in many respects consistent with theory.



       At the same time, the final section, which examined a particular pool in detail, has

highlighted some issues that we did not address here. For instance, the importance of

insuring equitable treatment across pool members and the apparent signaling role that the

terms of the MPEG license played are not issues addressed in our theoretical framework.

These questions would certainly deserve further exploration.



       Another set of unexplored issues relate to the generality of the patterns seen here.

As noted in the first paragraph of this paper, joint marketing arrangements are seen in

many industries, and many of these arrangements are similar to those posed here.23

Exploring the nature of and rationales for these arrangements appears to be a promising

area for future researchers.




 The mapping is, of course, not exact. For instance, in airline code-sharing
23

arrangements, an analogy to “innovation friendliness” is the extent to which the
agreement encourages the introduction of new routes. An analogy to “centralized control
of litigation” is the degree to which decisions over key assets are jointly managed.

Table 3: The prevalence of terms of patent pools. The table presents four critical terms that that affect the workings of patent pools: the stipulations that pool
members can offer licenses independent of those offered by the pool, that the control of the litigation process is centralized, that licenses are granted to third
parties, and that pool members need not assign to the pool all future related patents. In each case, the characteristics of the pools are presented for pools that did
or did not have this requirement. The characteristics examined are whether the agreement is signed before 1945, whether the agreement is signed in 1995 or
after, the count of firms originally in the patent pool, and the growth of patenting in the industry segment of the pool in the five years prior to the formation of the
pool. In each case, the first line presents the mean of each measure and the t-test of the null hypothesis that these two populations are identical; and the second
line, the median and the associated Wilcoxon test. (For the univariate values, a Pearson χ2-statistic is presented.) Asterisks denote cases where the differences
are statistically significant. The final row presents the mean frequency of the term in the sample.

Table 4: Regression analysis of the determinants of patent pool structure. The table presents a generalized method of moments estimation of a system of
equations. The sample consists of 56 patent pools formed between 1895 and 1994. The dependent variables are as follows: qualitative variables denoting
whether the pool allowed independent licenses, whether the control of litigation was centralized, whether patents were licensed by the pool to third parties, and
whether the terms of the pool were innovation friendly, and a latent variable measuring whether the patents in the pool were substitutes (constrained to fall
between zero and one, with one denoting cases where they were substitutes). The independent variables include the count of firms originally in the patent pool
(top-coded as 6), the growth of patenting in the industry segment of the pool in the five years prior to the formation of the pool, dummy variables denoting pools
formed before 1945, where members use the patents on a royalty-free basis, and not among those identified by Gilbert [2002] as displaying anti-competitive
behavior, and various dependent variables. Standard errors reported in brackets.

 Table 5: Comparison of patents included in recent pools with matching patents. The sample consists of 174 patents that were included in five patent pools
formed in 1995 and after along with 347 matching patents. The patents are compared according to several measures of technological and economic significance
that Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg [2001] refer to as patent importance, originality, generality, and scope. The first four columns present means of the various
measures [medians in brackets] for the set of patents that were included in pools and for two sets of matching patents. The first of these sets labeled “Matching
Patents by Firm and Class” contains two matching patents for each pooled patent. The first of these matching patents was chosen as the most proximate patent
awarded to the same firm. The second of these matching patents was chosen as the most proximate patent awarded within the same main USPTO technology
class and to the same type of assignee. The matching set used in the third and fourth column consists of the two sub-sets of matching patents. p-values from t-
tests and Wilcoxon tests of the null hypotheses that the two samples have the same means and medians are presented in the fifth and sixth columns respectively.

Table 6: Regression analysis of citations to patents included in recent patent pools. The sample consists of 174
patents that were included in five patent pools formed in 1995 and after along with 347 matching patents that were
selected based on grant date and belonging to the same USPTO patent class and being assigned to the same firm as
the pooled patents. The dependent variables consist of the number of patent citations in each year, whether before or
after the award. In Panel A, the sample includes the pooled patents, as well as the full set of 347 matching patents
that were chosen based on assignee and class. Panel B includes the pooled patents as well as the matching set of
patents selected based on assignee. Panel C includes the pooled patents as well as the matching set of patents
selected based on patent class. Independent variables include a dummy variable indicating whether the patent was
included in a pool, whether the observation was after the formation of the pool, the year the patent was awarded, the
years since the award of the patent, and either the patent grouping (including the patent and its matches) or the
individual patent. (Only the first two dummies are reported.) In each panel, the first regression employs an ordinary
least squares (OLS) specification, the second two, a negative binomial specification. Standard errors are reported in
brackets.

Table 7: Ordinary least squares regression analysis of patent significance for patents included in recent
patent pools. The sample consists of 174 patents that were included in five patent pools formed in 1995 and after
along with 347 matching patents that were selected based on grant date and belonging to the same USPTO patent
class and being assigned to the same firm as the pooled patents. The dependent variables consist of several
measures of technological and economic value which Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg [2001] refer to as patent
originality, generality, and scope. In Panel A, the sample includes the pooled patents, as well as the full set of 347
matching patents that were chosen based on assignee and class. Panel B includes the pooled patents as well as the
matching set of patents selected based on assignee. Panel C includes the pooled patents as well as the matching set
of patents selected based on patent class. Independent variables include a dummy variable indicating whether the
patent was included in a pool, as well as dummy variables (not reported) that control for the year the patent was
awarded, the pool to which the patent belongs (in the case of matching patents, this is the pool of the corresponding
patent that was included in a pool), and the patent category as defined by Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg [2001]. All
regressions employ an ordinary least squares specification. Standard errors are reported in brackets.
