                     The Reaction of Stock Prices to
                      Unanticipated Changes in Money

                                 ABSTRACT

      This paper investigates the short—run effect of unexpected changes in

the weekly money stock on common stock prices. Survey data on money market

participants' forecasts of money changes are employed to construct the

measure of unanticipated movements in the money stock. The results indicate

that an unexpected increase in money depresses stock prices and, consistent

with the efficient markets hypothesis, only the unexpected part of the weekly

money announcement causes stock price fluctuations. The October 1979 change

in Federal Reserve operating procedures appears to have made stock prices

somewhat more sensitive to large money surprises.

                        THE REACTION OF STOCK PRICES
                     TO UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN MONEY


      Much of the past work on the money—stock market relationship centered

on the question of whether money is a leading indicator of stock prices.

Studies by Sprinkel [23], Homa and Jaffee [11], and Hamburger and Kochin [9]

supported the view that past increases in money lead to increases in equity

prices.   The implication   of this work was that investors could earn above
normal profits by using a trading strategy based on the observed behavior
of the money stock. This contradicts the efficient markets hypothesis which
asserts   that current asset prices reflect all available information so that

no such trading strategy can exist. Subsequent research by Cooper [31,

Pesando [18], Rozeff [22], and Rogalski and Vinso [20] has shown that past

money changes do not contain predictive information on stock prices, upholding

the efficient markets view.

      This paper investigates whether the response of common stock prices

to weekly money announcements is consistent with the prediction of the

efficient markets hypothesis. Unlike the above research, therefore, the

focus is on the very short—run response of stock prices to both anticipated

and unanticipated announced changes in money. Recent work by Berkman [1],

Grossman [8], Urich and Wachtel 1261, and Roley [21] indicates that short—

term interest rates respond only to the unexpected component of the announce-

ment, with short—term rates rising when the announced change in money exceeds
                    1/
the expected change.—                       .
                       Berkman also examined the reaction of stock prices,

finding that an unanticipated increase in the money supply depressed share

prices. Lynge [13] found that positive money announcements lowered stock
                                     —2—




prices, but since he did not distinguish expected from unexpected money
growth,   his results do not bear directly on the efficient markets issue.

      In investigating the response of stock prices to weekly money announce-

ments, survey data on market participants' forecasts of the announced

weekly change are used to distinguish expected from actual changes in money.

Using these data, the usual representation of the efficient markets model

is generalized by allowing the possibility that responses to unanticipated

money are both nonlinear and asymmetric. Three further questions are then

considered: has the reaction of stock prices changed since the Federal

Reserve altered its monetary control procedures in October 1979; does the

impact of unexpected money on stock prices extend beyond the opening quotes;

and do stock prices move in anticipation of the money announcement.

      The paper is organized as follows. In the first section, the theo-

retical framework linking money and stock prices is reviewed. The data on

money announcements, the survey measure of expected money changes, and changes

in stock prices are described in the second section. In the third and fourth

sections, the empirical results are presented, while the final section

summarizes the main conclusions.

                         I. Theoretical Framework

      At least two explanations are consistent with the notion that stock

prices are negatively related to unanticipated announced weekly changes in

money. One explanation is that when money rises faster than expected, agents

revise upward their expectations of future inflation. In turn, higher

expected inflation is thought to depress stock prices through a number of

channels. Feldstein [6] argues that inflation decreases real after—tax

profits because of the nonindexation of inventory and depreciation charges.

Lower expected profits require equity prices to drop in order for stock to

provide a competitive return. Empirical support for this view is reported

by Summers [25] in an analysis of firm data. Increased expected inflation

would also depress stock prices if it raises the expected return on an

alternative asset such as owner—occupied housing. Hendershott and Hu [101

and Summers [24] provide evidence that this effect was significant in the

1970g. Finally, higher anticipated inflation would cause stock prices to

fall if, as Modigliani and Cohn 115] contend, investors mistakenly compare

the nominal return on bonds, swelled by inflation, to the earnings—price

ratios of stocks (a real rate of return).--"

      An alternative interpretation is that the response of stock prices to

unexpected money reflects agents' expectations of the reaction of the Federal

Reserve to the surprise. In particular, market participants may believe

that the Federal Reserve will move rapidly to offset a surge in money with

the consequence of higher short—term interest rates. Moreover, with lagged

reserve accounting, short—term rates may rise even in the absence of overt

Federal Reserve actions if market participants increase their assessment of
                                       -.4—




the excess demand for reserves in the current statement week.-' Through

either of these channels, the anticipation of higher rates in the very near

future prompts sales of short—term securities immediately after the announce-

ment, forcing rates to rise. Since the stock market closes before the

announcement but the money market resumes trading after the announcement,

stock market participants will have already observed the rise in short—term

rates associated with the money surprise when planning their activity for

the next business day. If some holders of stock view short—term securities

as substitutes in their portfolios, the higher short—term yields will cause

these agents to place sell orders, and opening stock prices will likely fall

below the closing prices of the day before. Since this theory hinges on

market participants guessing the future actions of the Federal Reserve,

asymmetries in response or changes in response due to different Federal

Reserve operating procedures would not be unlikely.

        As a first step in investigating the reaction of stock prices to

announced weekly changes in money, the usual linear model is employed.

This model may be represented as


              SP =    a ÷   b(M—iM) + e                                    (1)



where         LSP = change in stock prices observed after the money
                      announcement

                  = announced change in the money stock

                  =   expected change in the money stock
                et = random error term.

The basic proposition of the efficient markets theory is that only the
                                    —5—



unexpected change in money should influence stock prices so that the data

should not reject the restriction that the coefficients on    and     sum

to zero. The hypothesized behavior of security market participants outlined

above further stipulates that b should be negative.

                                     II.   The Data

        The weekly data used in this paper begin on September 29, 1977,

and end on January 29, 1982. Specific details about the data on announced

changes in money, expected money, and stock prices follow.

A. Changes in the Money Stock

        The money stock data consist of announced weekly changes in the

narrowly defined money stock, in billions of dollars, as reported in the

Federal Reserve's H.6 release. Both a revised estimate of the previous

week's announced level and the change in money for the statement week ending

on Wednesday of the previous calendar week are reported. Until January 31,

1980, the data used here correspond to announced changes in "old Ml" on

Thursdays at 4:10 p.m. Since then, the announcements have been made on

Fridays at 4:10 p.m. For this period, the data employed are those for Ml—B,

and more recently, Ml, where the definition of this latter aggregate is

equivalent to that of M1—B.-" Over the entire sample period, money announce-

ments were made after the stock market closed.

B. Expected Changes in the Money Stock

        The   measure of the expected change in the money stock is the median
forecast of about     60 money   market participants who are surveyed each week
by Money Market Services, Inc.' When the money announcement was made on
Thursdays, this firm solicited forecasts of the change in Ml on both Tuesdays

and Thursdays. The Thursday median prediction is used here       as the measure
of   the expected change during this period. Since February 8, 1980 (when the

Federal Reserve switched to Friday announcements), the survey has been

conducted only on Tuesdays, and the aggregate predicted until the beginning
                                        —7—



of 1982 was Mi—B, and since then, Ml. The median of these anticipated

changes is used as the measure of the market's expected change for this
         6/
period.—

        Based on the results of other studies, the survey expectations

measure appears to be rational. Grossman [8] examined the survey data

for the pre—October 1979 period, and found that they were efficient and

outperformed a simple autoregressive model in predicting weekly money
           7/
changes.—        For the post—October 1979 period, Roley [21] found that the

null hypotheses of unbiasedness and efficiency could not be rejected at

the 5 percent level of significance, and that the survey data again outper-

formed an autoregressive forecasting equation.

C. Stock Prices

        Since the efficient markets theory asserts that current stock prices

reflect all available information, the change in stock prices should be from

just before the announcement to the first observation of prices after the

announcement. For stock prices, this amounts to subtracting the closing

prices on the day of the announcement from the opening prices on the first

business      day following the announcement. Since market participants have
overnight (or over the weekend for the latter part of the sample) to plan
their   response to the new information in the announcement, their reactions

should be reflected in the buy and sell orders given to the specialists for

each stock before the market opens. Hence, the specialists' opening prices,

which attempt to balance supply and demand for each stock, should embody

all the effects of the money surprises.' The possibility that the effect

of unanticipated money persists is, however, explored in section IV. The
                                   —8--




particular stock index employed is the Dow Jones Industrial Average

(DJIA).2-" Thus, the dependent variable is the Friday opening value of

the DJLk less its Thursday close for the period up to January 31, 1980,

and the Monday opening less the Friday close for the remainder of the

sample period)21

                         III. Estimation Results

      In this section, the effects of anticipated and unanticipated announced

changes in money are examined using the basic linear model of equation (1).

The robustness of the results from this model is then checked by testing for

reactions to announced revisions of the money stock and for nonlinear responses.

      All models are estimated and tested over three subsamples. The first

period begins on September 29, 1977, when the money survey was initiated,

and ends on October 4, 1979, two days before the Federal Reserve announced

the switch in its operating procedures. Period two covers the weeks after

the policy change when the money announcement was still made on Thursdays.

Period three starts on February 7, 1980, when the money announcement was

shifted to Friday, and runs to January 29, 1982. Observations were dropped

if the money announcement was not made on the usual day or if a holiday inter-

vened between the announcement day and the next business day)-"

A. Basic Model

      Table I presents the estimates of the simple linear—response model (1)

for each of the subsamples. Dummy variables were added to the model to allow

for the possible effects of changes in the Federal Reserve's discount rate

announced after the stock market closed)-' The reported F—statistics test

the hypothesis that the coefficients on     and iM sum to zero so that only

unanticipated changes in money affect stock prices. As these test statistics

indicate, this implication of the efficient markets hypothesis cannot be

rejected at conventional significance levels.

      The results from Table I also support the theories, given in section I,

which predict that unexpected changes in the money stock have a negative impact

on   stock prices. In particular, an unanticipated increase in money of $1

billion is associated with a subsequent fall in the DJIA of about .7 points.

Moreover, the coefficients on unanticipated money are statistically less

than zero at the 1 percent level except for the middle period which has

only 14 observations.

B. More Generalized Models

        The model used above imposes several implicit constraints which, if not

appropriate, might bias the estimated effects of anticipated and unanticipated

money. This section relaxes two such constraints and reestimates the effects.

        One constraint involves the reaction of stock prices to revisions in

the previous week's announced level of the money stock. The basic model (1)

assumes that stock prices react only to unanticipated changes in money,

although new information about the level is also announced. If this infor-

mation also affects stock prices the model becomes


                      =   a.   + b(itM—iM) + c(M1—M1) + d7D. + e                   (2)


where          Mr
                t—l
                      =   revised     estimate of N
                                                   t—l
                                                       announced at time t

               Ma1 = level of the money stock announced at time t—l
                      = dummy variable associated with a change in the

                          discount rate at time t.

Furthermore,   an equal response to both the unexpected change and the announced

revision, i.e., b =            c,   means that agents respond to the errors in predicting

by the data implying that equation (3) is preferred.—
        The response to anticipated money is therefore reexamined by estimating

equation (3) and testing the constraint that the coefficients on             and M

sum to zero. Panel A of Table II presents these results. The reported F—

statistics are for the hypothesis that only a surprise in the level of money

matters—as opposed to the expected level—and this hypothesis cannot be

rejected at high significance levels. Thus, this specification also supports

the efficient markets hypothesis.

        The other constraint which is considered is that the response of stock

prices is linear. This restriction can be relaxed by specifying a quadratic

functional form


              SP       =   a + (bi+b2lUMLl)tJNL    + (c1+c2Me)Me +      +e          (4)



where

                       = Ma —   M.
Equation   (4) allows both the unexpected and expected money levels to affect

stock prices nonlinearly. If only the unanticipated level matters, the

coefficients on M, c1 and c2, should be jointly equal to zero.

        Panel B of Table II presents the estimates of equation C4)         for   each

subsample, with the restriction imposed that c1 and c2 are zero. The reported

F—statistics indicate that this hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 5 percent

significance level. The estimated model for the first period strongly supports

the nonlinear specification and implies that the stock price response

           IV.     A Further Examination of the Stock Price Response

      Three aspects of the response of stock prices of money surprises are

considered in this section. First, the evidence concerning any change in

the response as a result of the Federal Reserve's adoption of a reserve—

aggregate monetary control procedure is reviewed. Second, the question of

whether the stock price response is complete within one day is examined.

Finally, the behavior of stock prices prior to the weekly money announcement

is investigated.

A. Did the Response Change in the Post—October 1979 Period?

      As a result of the Federal Reserve's adoption of new monetary control

procedures in October 1979, Roley 1211 finds that 3—month Treasury bill

yields have become much more responsive. Thus, if stocks and money market

instruments are close substitutes, stock prices may be more responsive

as a result. HOwever, if investors are more concerned about the inflation

consequences of an unanticipated change in money, the reaction of stock

prices may be the same, or even less, than before. In particular, if the

new procedures correspond to a greater commitment by the Federal Reserve

to reduce inflation, any given surprise may contain less information about

future inflation since it may be offset in the near future. Thus, it is

not possible, a priori, to predict whether the reaction of stock prices

should increase in the post—October 1979 period.

      The equality of stock price responses in the pre— and post—October

1979 periods was tested for both the basic model (1) and the nonlinear model.

In the case of the basic model, the hypothesis that the response was the

same in the one pre—October 1979 period and the two post—October 1979 periods
                                          —14—




 cannot be rejected even at the 50 percent significance level)1 For the

 nonlinear specification, however, this hypothesis is rejected at the 10

 percent level, and the hypothesis that the response in the first and          third
periods is the same is rejected at the 5 percent level.--' As is apparent

 in panel B of Table II, stock prices appear to have reacted less sharply to

small surprises and more sharply to large surprises after the Federal Reserve

began employing the reserve—aggregate approach to monetary          control.
         To further investigate the effect of monetary policy, money surprises

were disaggregated according to the relation of money growth to the Federal

Reserve's long—run ranges)1' Following Urich and Wachtel [26], surprises

were divided into three groups: positive surprises when money was above its

target range, negative surprises when money was below the range, and all other

surprises. Both the basic model (1) and the nonlinear model were estimated

with these additional terms. In each case, the results indicated that the

coefficients on the disaggregated surprises are not significantly different..121

Since Urich and Wachtel [26) and Roley [21] found significantly different

Treasury bill yield responses when money was outside Federal Reserve policy

ranges, the lack of such differences for stock prices appears to provide some
support for the expected inflation channel. Nevertheless, the tests across
periods      using the nonlinear model did suggest that the response differed in
the pre— and post—October     1979 periods.   Thus, it   appears   that no clear choice
between the policy expectations and expected inflation channels can be made.
B. Is the Stock Price Response Complete Within One Day?

        In   order to investigate whether the effect of unanticipated money on
stock   prices   persists beyond the opening prices of the day after the
                                          —15—



announcement, the linear and nonlinear models were reestimated using two

alternative dependent variables. The first, iSPl, is the change in the

DJIA from the opening quotes to 11:00 a.m. EST, one hour after the market

opens. The second, SP2, is the change in the DJIA from the opening to the

close for the day after the announcement.

        Panel A of Table III presents the estimated nonlinear models for each

subsample. As these results indicate, the only evidence of persistence

occurs in the third period when the dependent variable is SPl, and the

estimated response is substantially smaller than the initial reaction (compare

equation 3.5 with equation 2.6).---" Thus, these results generally support

the view that the response of stock prices to money surprises is immediate.

C. Do Stock Prices Move in Anticipation of Money Announcements?

        The final area examined here concerns the movement of stock prices to

money announcements. If the stock market is efficient, and if investors view

money announcements as a source of significant information, then stock prices

may respond to any new information related to the forthcoming announcement.'

        To investigate this aspect of stock price behavior, it is assumed that

equilibrium stock prices at the close of day i may be represented as


                                   +
             Spi =   .E(Ma1)                                             (5)

Thus, the effect of new information on equilibrium stock prices from

Tuesday—the day of the money survey in the third period—to just before

the money announcement on Friday may be expressed as


              SPF - SPT =      a.[E(F)_Me]         + [E(XF)_E(XIT)]             (6)

                               survey measure.

Also, if expectations are rational, then


             Ma =                + CF                                           (7)
                    E(MalF)

where        CF = random error uncorrelated with any information in

A consistent estimate of the effect of new information concerning the money

announcement on stock prices may therefore be obtained by combining equations
                                 22/
(6) and (7) and estimating—


             Ma — Me =                         —                                (8)

To implement this specification empirically, the additional assumption is

made that changes in the expectations of other relevant variables may be

represented solely by the change in the 3—month Treasury bill yield from

Tuesday to Friday; i.e.,


             Ma — Ma = a + b•(SPF—SPT) + c*(RF_RT) + eF                         (8)

where          RT,Rp = 3—month Treasury bill yield at 3:30 p.m.

                         on Tuesday and Friday, respectively,

and   the   coefficient definitions follow from (8).

       The estimation results for equation (8) are reported in panel B of

Table III. The results indicate that the movement in stock prices prior

to the announcement is not significantly related to the unexpected part of

the money announcement, unlike the movement in interest rates. This result

could follow either if stock prices do not reflect new information concerning

the announced level of money which became available during the week or if

stock prices move in response to new information about a variety of other

relevant factors, thereby causing a low correlation between money surprises

and stock prices.

                           IV. Summary and Conclusions
         This paper has examined the short—run reaction of stock prices to
weekly    money announcements. The results of this analysis can be summarized

as follows: (1) stock prices respond only to the unexpected change in the

money stock as predicted by the efficient markets theory; (2) an unexpected

increase in money depresses stock prices; (3) stock market participants take

into account the revisions in the level of the money stock as well as

unexpected changes; (4) the stock price response is symmetric with respect

to the sign of the money surprise and does not depend on the relationship

of money to the long—run   target ranges of the Federal Reserve; (.5) the stock
price   response appears to be nonlinear and has changed since the Federal
Reserve   switched to a reserve—aggregate approach to monetary control in

October 1979; and (6) the stock price response is essentially complete early

in the subsequent trading day.

        The absence of any asymmetrical or policy range effects contrasts

with the results of studies on the interest rate response to money surprises.

While these effects were not evident, the results nevertheless indicate

that the October 1979 change in policy regimes has affected the response

of stock prices to money surprises. In particular, large money surprises

since October 1979 have been associated with larger changes in stock prices.

 1. Using the same survey data as those used here, Urich and Wachtel [23]

obtain this result in tests over individual years, but not over the entire

period corresponding to the availability of the survey data. Using a different

time interval to measure changes in short—term interest rates, Grossman [8]

and Roley [21] find that anticipated announced changes in money as represented

by the survey data are not statistically significant over the same sample

period.

 2. A number of empirical studies have found a negative relationship between

inflation and stock prices, including those by Bodie [2J, Jaf fee and Mandelker

fl2], Nelson [17], and Faina and Schwert {5J. The results in these studies are

in sharp contrast to the traditional view that stock prices are either unaffected

by or perhaps positively related to expected inflation. See, for example,

Williams [27].

 3. See Grossman [8] and Roley [21] for more detailed descriptions of these

arguments.
 4. Announced    changes in Mi—B are analyzed here because of   the   emphasis
placed on   Mi—B by the Federal Reserve policymakers and market participants.

It   should also be noted that the Mi—B data for 1981 are not the shift—
adjusted   Mi—B figures which reflect the introduction of nationwide NOW

accounts. While the Federal Reserve's target range was in terms of shif t

adjusted Mi—B, weekly announced changes were not shift adjusted.

 5. We are grateful to Mr. Raul A. Nicho of Money Market Services, Inc.,

for supplying the survey data.

 6. An alternative measure was also used for this latter era which adjusted

the Tuesday forecast to take account of relevant information which became

available between Tuesday and the Friday announcement. Following Roley [21],

this new information was assumed to be reflected by the change in the 3—month

Treasury bill yield from 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday to 3:30 p.m. on Friday. To

capture this new information, the announced money change was regressed on

the median predicted change and the change in the Treasury bill yield. The

fitted values from this regression formed the "revised" expectations of

weekly changes in money. However, despite the difference between estimation

results using the survey and revised expectations measures for the Treasury

bill market found by Roley [21], the two expectations measures yielded

virtually the same results for the stock market. Thus, only empirical results

using the survey measure are reported in what follows. For a further dis-

cussion of the rationale for using a revised expectations measure, see the

related discussion in section IV.C.

 7. The basic notion behind the efficiency test is that if weekly changes

in money are generated by an autoregressive process, the market's expectation
should be generated by the same process. See, for example, Modigliani and

Shiller [15] and Pesando [181. While Grossman [8] could not reject efficiency,

unbiasedness could be rejected. However, the rejection resulted from a

statistically significant constant term. This measure could therefore be

adjusted by adding the estimated bias to the survey measure. However, the

response of stock prices estimated in this paper would be unaffected since

a constant term is always included in the specifications.

 8.   For evidence that opening prices are as representative of equilibrium

prices as subsequent intra—day transactions prices, see Garbade and Sekaran [7].

9. The DJIA was used because opening prices of broader stock price indices,

such as the Standard and Poor's 500, are not publicly available. Since

opening prices are calculated by specialists in each stock, the use of the

DJIA may also be preferable given the large trading volumes of the stocks

included in this index.

10. We are grateful to Morgan Lynge, Jr., for the DJIA data through 1979.

The observations for 1980—82 are from Barron's.

11. Four observations were dropped in the first time period, three in the

second, and 13 in the third.

12. The discount rate dummy variables are defined as follows:

        D1 = 1 when discount rate raised 1/4 point

             = 0 otherwise

             = 1 when discount rate raised 1/2 point
        D2
             = 0 otherwise

        D3 = 1 when surcharge raised 3 points

             = 0 otherwise
       D4 = 1 when discount rate lowered 1 point

             = 0 otherwise

             = 1 when surcharge lowered 1 point
       D5
             = 0 otherwise

       D6 = 1 when discount rate lowered 1 point and surcharge lowered 1 point
             = 0 otherwise.

The estimated coefficients on changes in the discount rate—in cases where

they are statistically significant—imply that an increase in the discount

rate depresses stock prices, and vice versa. For example, the lowering of

both the discount rate and the surcharge by 1 percentage point on October 30,

1981, is estimated to have raised the DJIA by over 11 points.

13. The equivalence of equation (2) and       equation   (3), under the assumption

that b = cS', can be seen by noting that

                                  =      —




and, under the assumption that agents expect no revision in the previous
week's announced level,


                                  = Me   —
                                             M1.
14. The relevant F—statistics for the three periods are F (1,97) =         .97,
F (1,11) =   .17, and F (1,81) = .39, with marginal significance levels of
.325, .686, and .544, respectively.

15. Note that in each period the nonlinear term reduces the magnitude of

the response per dollar of money surprise as the surprise becomes larger.

This behavior is consistent with the notion that, due to seasonal or other
factors, large surprises are sometimes offset in subsequent weeks.

16. The F—statistic is equal to 0.643 with (2,192) degrees of freedom. As

is the case for all tests across the three subsamples reported in this paper,

the estimated equation for the pooled sample was corrected for heteroscedas—

ticity by weighting the observations in each subperiod by the reciprocal

of the estimated standard error from the subperiod regression.

17. The F—statistic for the hypothesis that both linear and nonlinear

coefficients are constant over time is 2.048 with (4,189) degrees of freedom,

which has a marginal significance level of 0.088. The F—statistic for the

hypothesis that the first and third periods had the same coefficients is

3.758 with (2,189) degrees of freedom, which has a marginal significance

level of 0.025.

18. While Urich and Wachtel [26J employ short—run ranges, the Federal

Reserve's long—run ranges are used here. Long—run ranges are used for two

reasons. First, market participants probably made more accurate assessments

of    the long—run ranges. Second, the short—run ranges (and later, paths)
were, in principle, set to be consistent with eventually obtaining money
growth   within the long—run ranges.

19.    For the linear model (1), the relevant F—statistics for the three sub—
samples   are .878 (2,96), .583 (1,11), and 2.506 (2,80) with marginal significance

levels of .422, .461, and .086, respectively. For the nonlinear model, the

relevant F—statistics were .815 (4,93) and 1.047 (4,77) for the first and

third periods with marginal significance levels of .521 and .389, respectively.

The second period was too short for a meaningful test.

20. The linear model yielded identical conclusions. As in the nonlinear case,
the only significant response occurred in the third period for the LxSP1

measure. The point estimate in this case was —. 345 with a t—statistic of

—3.714. This response is roughly half of the initial response and, again,

disappears over the entire trading day.

21. Because only the data for the third subsample is particularly well

suited to investigate this aspect of stock price behavior, the other two

subsamples will not be considered further. In particular, the time interval

between the market survey and the money announcement must be of sufficient

length to allow two stock price observations. Since the exact time of

the day that the market survey is taken is somewhat uncertain, the Thursday

survey and announcement data used here for the first two periods do not

lend themselves to this analysis.

22. Note that the methodology employed here is similar to that used, for

example, by Fama [4] and Mishkin [14] in investigating real interest rates.

23. There are at least two possible rationales for including the observed

change in the Treasury bill yield in equation (.8). First, since a Treasury

bill is an alternative asset, the expected bill yield may be relevant in the

determination of stock prices. If this is the case, and if the bill yield

follows a random walk, then the observed change in the bill yield represents

the relevant change in the expected bill yield. Second, following Fama [4],

the change in the bill yield may represent a change in expected inflation.
