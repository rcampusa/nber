                                              ABSTRACT

Understanding the sensitivity of gasoline demand to changes in prices and income has important implications
for policies related to climate change, optimal taxation and national security, to name only a few. While
the short-run price and income elasticities of gasoline demand in the United States have been studied
extensively, the vast majority of these studies focus on consumer behavior in the 1970s and 1980s.
There are a number of reasons to believe that current demand elasticities differ from these previous
periods, as transportation analysts have hypothesized that behavioral and structural factors over the
past several decades have changed the responsiveness of U.S. consumers to changes in gasoline prices.
 In this paper, we compare the price and income elasticities of gasoline demand in two periods of similarly
high prices from 1975 to 1980 and 2001 to 2006. The short-run price elasticities differ considerably:
and range from -0.034 to -0.077 during 2001 to 2006, versus -0.21 to -0.34 for 1975 to 1980. The
estimated short-run income elasticities range from 0.21 to 0.75 and when estimated with the same
models are not significantly different between the two periods.

1. INTRODUCTION

The short-run price and income elasticities of gasoline demand have been studied extensively in

the literature. Dahl and Sterner (1991) and more recently, Espey (1998) provide thorough

reviews based on hundreds of gasoline demand studies. However, past research has been

primarily focused on the 1970s and early 1980s. Since that time, a number of structural and

behavioral changes have occurred in the U.S. gasoline market. Transportation analysts have

hypothesized that factors such as changing land-use patterns, implementation of the Corporate

Average Fuel Economy program (CAFE), growth of multiple income households and per capita

disposable income as well as a decrease in the availability of non-auto modes such as transit,

have changed the responsiveness of U.S. consumers to changes in gasoline price. For example, a

recent analysis of household data suggests that suburban households drive 31 to 35 percent more

than their urban counterparts, Kahn (2000). In another study, Polzin and Chu (2005) find that

the share of transit passenger miles traveled relative to other modes has steadily decreased over

the past thirty years suggesting that U.S. consumers may be more dependent on automobiles than

in previous decades.
       Given recent interest in decreasing U.S. gasoline consumption and transportation related

greenhouse gas emissions, there is a renewed interest in price-based policies such as gasoline or

carbon taxes. In this context, it is especially important to consider whether gasoline demand

elasticities have changed. This paper focuses on the short-run price and income elasticities of

gasoline demand. Historically, estimates of gasoline demand elasticities have proven to be fairly

robust. In their survey, Dahl and Sterner (1991) determine an average short-run price elasticity

of gasoline demand of -0.26 and an average short-run income elasticity of gasoline demand of

0.48. Based on over 300 prior estimates for the U.S. and other developed countries, Espey

(1998) finds a median short-run price elasticity of -0.23 and a median short-run income elasticity
of 0.39. However, the studies surveyed in each paper are limited to the gasoline market of

several decades past. 1

           Several authors have investigated U.S. demand for gasoline in more recent years. Puller

and Greening (1999) and Nicol (2003) study the household demand for gasoline using data from

the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey. Schmalensee and Stoker (1999) investigate the role of

household characteristics on gasoline demand using data from the Residential Transportation

Energy Consumption Survey. Kayser (2000) conducts a similar study using data from the Panel

Study of Income Dynamics and includes adjustments in household vehicle stock. However,

none of these studies allow for a direct comparison of short-run price and income elasticities

between earlier time periods and today.
           In this paper we estimate and compare the price and income elasticities of gasoline

demand in two periods, from November 1975 through November 1980 and from March 2001

through March 2006. The periods chosen reflect a quasi-experimental design to control for the

magnitude and rate of increase of real prices during two periods of high gasoline prices.

Because elasticity estimates vary according to data type and empirical model specification

(Espey, 1998), we use a consistent set of data and models between the two periods. Average

U.S. per capita gasoline consumption and personal disposable income data are used in addition

to average U.S. retail prices. Elasticities are estimated using several simple econometric models

similar in form to those used in previous studies of gasoline demand. Our estimates of the short-

run price elasticity of gasoline demand for the period from 1975 to 1980 range between -0.21

and -0.34 and are consistent with previous results from the literature. For the period from 2001

to 2006 our estimates of price elasticity range from -0.034 to -0.077. The estimated short-run

income elasticities range from 0.21 to 0.75 and when estimated with the same models are not

significantly different between the two periods.




1
    The most recent study surveyed by Espey (1998) contains data from 1993.
           We conclude that the short-run price elasticity of gasoline demand is significantly more

inelastic today than in previous decades. In the short-run, consumers appear significantly less

responsive to gasoline price increases. We discuss a number of possible explanations for this

result in terms of shifts in land-use and social or vehicle characteristics during the past several

decades. Finally, we explore policy implications in light of future efforts to reduce U.S. gasoline

consumption.


2. BASIC MODEL AND DATA


2.1 Basic Model

The econometric models used in this paper reflect previous studies of gasoline demand. Our

base model specifies the log of gasoline consumption as a function of the log of price and

income. Specifically, we estimate: 2

                                    ln G jt = β o + β 1 ln Pjt + β 2 ln Y jt + ε j + ε jt             (1)


where Gjt is per capita gasoline consumption in gallons in month j and year t, Pjt is the real retail

price of gasoline in month j and year t, Yjt is real per capita disposable income in month j and

year t, εj represents unobserved demand factors that vary at the month level and εjt is a mean zero

error term. Both Yjt and Pjt are in constant 2000 dollars. We model the εj’s as fixed month
effects to capture the seasonality present in gasoline consumption.

           Although some, including Hsing (1990), have rejected the double-log functional form, it

is a common specification used in a large number of previous studies. It is adopted here as it

provides a good fit to the data and allows for direct comparison with previous results from the

literature. Regardless, we also present results for linear and semi-log specifications.




2
    For example see Dahl (1979) or Houthakker et. al. (1974).
2.2 Basic Model Data

The data used in the analysis are U.S. aggregate monthly data reported by several U.S.

government agencies for the period from January 1974 to March 2006. Aggregate data are used

due to the lack of data at the regional or state level for all independent variables in the

appropriate time period. Gasoline consumption is approximated as monthly “product supplied”

reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (2006), which is calculated as domestic

production plus imports, less exports and changes to stocks. Real gasoline prices are U.S. city

average prices for unleaded regular fuel from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2006), CPI-

Average Price Data. 3 Personal disposable income is from the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis (2006), National Economic Accounts. Prices and income are converted to constant

2000 dollars using GDP implicit price deflators from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (2006).

           Figure 1 below shows per capita monthly gasoline consumption and real prices for the

period from January 1974 to March 2006. In order to compare gasoline demand elasticities

today with those of previous decades, two 5-year periods were selected for analysis, November

1975 through November 1980 and March 2001 through March 2006. Figure 2 below shows the

monthly real retail price of gasoline for each period. The peak price in each case is

approximately $2.50 per gallon with a slightly higher price in the more recent period. The peak

price in both cases represents an increase of approximately $1.00 relative to the price at the

beginning of the period. In addition, the average monthly per capita gasoline consumption is

roughly equivalent between the two periods with mean 40.4 gal/month and 39.2 gal/month and

standard deviation of 2.8 gal/month and 1.7 gal/month for the 1975-1980 and 2001-2006 periods,

respectively.

           The choice of these two periods represents a quasi-experimental design where we attempt

to control for the magnitude of real price, consumption and the duration of price changes by

selecting periods with similar real price and consumption characteristics. This enables a direct

comparison of the elasticity estimates for each period. Given the nature of real economic data, it

is impossible to construct a perfect controlled experiment. The potential impact on the estimated

elasticities is difficult to predict. Because the peak price is higher and the price spikes are

sharper in the 2001 to 2006 data, one might expect the price elasticity to be more elastic during

this period. Alternatively, the period from 1975 to 1980 is characterized by a longer period of

elevated prices which might tend to increase elasticity by allowing consumers more time to

adjust to elevated prices. All in all, the real price data is remarkably similar between the two

periods providing for a suitable comparison of elasticity estimates.

2.3 Basic Model Results

The empirical models described in Section 2.1 were estimated for each period using ordinary

least squares (OLS). In all estimates, we report Newey-West standard errors to control for

heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. 4 Table 1 provides a summary of the estimated

parameters for the basic double-log model in the periods from 1975 to 1980 and from 2001 to

2006. The model provides a good fit to the data with adjusted R-squareds of 0.85 and 0.94 in the

early and more recent periods, respectively. The monthly fixed effects illustrate the strong

seasonality effects present in the demand for gasoline. Signs are consistent with the expectation

that gasoline demand is high during the summer months and lower during the winter. The

magnitudes of seasonal effects are similar between the two periods although the winter effect is

somewhat smaller today than in the period from 1975 to 1980.

        In Table 2, we present the results from two alternative functional forms alongside the

double-log functional form. The monthly dummy variables have been excluded to simplify

presentation of the results. The coefficients on price and income are significant (p < 0.01) for

the basic model irrespective of functional form. Table 3 summarizes the average elasticities for

the three models; estimates of the price elasticity of gasoline demand range from -0.31 to -0.34

month lag order.
in the period from 1975 to 1980 and from -0.041 to -0.043 in the period from 2001 to 2006.

Assuming that the samples from each period are independent, we perform a Student’s t-test on

the elasticity estimates for each model and in all cases reject the null hypothesis that the price

elasticities are the same in the two periods. 5 The income elasticity of gasoline demand ranges

from 0.47 to 0.49 for the period from 1975 to 1980 and from 0.53 to 0.54 in the period from

2001 to 2006. In this case, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the income elasticities are

different in the two periods.


3. ALTERNATIVE SPECIFICATIONS AND RESULTS

In order to test the robustness of the price and income elasticity estimates produced by the basic

model, we employ a number of alternate model specifications in an attempt to decrease the early

period elasticity or increase the recent period elasticity. Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 outline

alternate model specifications.

3.1 Recession and Estimation with Macroeconomic Variables

In this section we investigate the possibility that the early period elasticity estimates are biased

upward because of omitted variables. The period of high gasoline prices from 1975 to 1980

coincided with an economic recession in the United States. To the extent that factors such as

high unemployment and inflation contributed to changes in gasoline consumption during this

period, it is important to account for historical macroeconomic conditions in our elasticity

estimates. Using the basic double-log model we estimate price and income elasticities using as

explanatory variables unemployment rate (UE), interest rate 6 (BR) and inflation rate (INR) in

addition to real price, income and fixed month effects. If the economic recession contributed to

a decrease in gasoline consumption during the period from 1975 to 1980, failure to account for

this effect would artificially inflate the estimated price elasticity.

        Results for the basic double-log model incorporating macroeconomic variables are

presented in Table 4. Results using 1-year and 10-year bond interest rates are shown. The

macroeconomic variables are jointly significant with F-statistics of 12.48 and 12.66 for the 1-

year and 10-year interest rate models, respectively. The coefficients on unemployment rate and

inflation rate are independently significant in each model (p < 0.05). As expected, accounting

for the effect of the recession during the period from 1975 to 1980 produces more inelastic price

elasticity estimates of -0.22 and -0.21 for the 1-year and 10-year interest rate models,

respectively. 7 The estimated income elasticities are also more inelastic at 0.33 and 0.38.

3.2 Simultaneous Equations Models

A well known problem in estimating demand equations occurs when price and quantity are

jointly determined through shifts in both supply and demand resulting in biased and inconsistent

parameter estimates. This problem is especially important when attempting to compare elasticity

estimates between two periods. One potential explanation for the estimated elasticity differences

is that the high prices of 1975 to 1980 were largely supply driven, while the high prices of 2001

to 2006 were demand driven; the endogeneity of prices and quantities would result in more

elastic elasticity estimates in the 1970s and 1980s and less elastic estimates in the 2000s.

        To address this concern, we instrument for price in the late period. An ideal instrumental

variable for determining gasoline demand is one that is highly correlated with the price of

gasoline (the endogenous variable) but not with unobserved shocks to gasoline demand. With

respect to selection of instrumental variables, Ramsey, et al. (1975) and Dahl (1979) have used

the relative prices of refinery products such as kerosene and residual fuel oil as instrumental

variables. The problem with this approach is that the relative prices of other refinery outputs are


7
  Using the same models with macroeconomic data results in an estimated price elasticity of approximately -0.03 for
the period from 2001 to 2006.
likely to be correlated with gasoline demand shocks. Since gasoline demand and oil price are

correlated, gasoline demand is likely correlated with the prices of other refinery outputs via the

price of oil.

         As it turns out, identifying appropriate instrumental variables for gasoline demand is

difficult. In this paper we experiment with two types of instrumental variables: crude oil quality

and crude oil production disruptions. Here we define crude oil input quality by sulfur content

(Sjt) and American Petroleum Institute specific gravity (APIjt). Since environmental regulations

require the removal of sulfur from gasoline, higher sulfur content crude oil presumably increases

the cost of manufacturing gasoline due to higher sulfur removal costs. Heavier crude oils are

characterized by lower API specific gravity and require more “cracking” to produce gasoline

than do lighter crude oil inputs. Therefore, one would expect gasoline price to be positively

correlated with sulfur content and negatively correlated with API gravity. Crude oil production

disruptions are represented for three countries, Venezuela (VZjt), Iraq (IQjt) and the United States
(USjt). These three countries were selected because each has had its production of crude oil

affected by external shocks that are unlikely to be related to gasoline demand shocks. In

Venezuela, a strike by oil workers beginning in December 2002 cut production to near zero and

has significantly affected output for several years. In Iraq, an international embargo and, more

recently, war have caused major disruptions to oil operations. In the United States, production

has been in steady decline since the 1970s due to declining resources. In 2005, hurricanes

Katrina and Rita resulted in the temporary loss of several hundred thousand barrels of production

in the Gulf of Mexico.

         For each country, crude oil production disruptions are defined by the difference between

actual production and a production forecast, 8 for example VZjt = production - forecast. 9 The

start of each disruption is defined by a specific event leading to a loss in production. In


8
  For forecasted oil production in each country, we employ a simple double-log model using only a time trend and
fixed month effects as explanatory variables.
9
  In unreported results, we instead used a set of indicator variables representing the supply shocks. The results were
qualitatively similar.
Venezuela, the disruption start corresponds with the oil worker strike beginning in December of

2002 as reported by Banerjee (2002). In Iraq we use the beginning of the second Gulf War in

March of 2003 as reported by Tyler (2003). Finally, in the U.S., hurricane Katrina marks the

beginning of the disruption reported by Mouawad and Bajaj (2005) in September 2005. The end

of each disruption is defined as the month in which actual production reaches the forecasted

production level. In the U.S., the forecast and production do not converge, but because

production follows a highly seasonal pattern, the disruption end date is defined by the winter

production peak marking the return to “normal” operations. Based on these definitions, the

disruption periods are, December 2002 through March 2003 (VZ), March 2003 through

November 2003 (IQ) and September 2005 through January 2006 (USA).
        Using these instruments, we estimate Equation (1) via two-stage least squares (2SLS).

Unfortunately, data on several instrumental variables are not available for the entire study

period. This prevents analysis of gasoline demand in the period from 1975 to 1980 using the

instrumental variable approach. However, our goal is to determine if the elasticity differences

we estimate are due to a bias in the later period estimates.

        To gauge the strength of the instruments, Table 5 summarizes the coefficient estimates

when we regress the log of real gasoline price on each of the sets of instruments. Crude oil

quality does not prove to be an appropriate instrumental variable, as the coefficients on sulfur

content (S) and specific gravity (API) are not significant. U.S. crude oil production disruption

(USA) is found to be significant (p < 0.01), however the coefficients on production disruptions in

Venezuela and Iraq are not significant (p = 0.13 and p = 0.22, respectively). Given these results,

we also report the results when using only disruptions in U.S. production.

        Table 6 compares the 2SLS estimates. Crude oil quality does not produce a significant

result, as foreshadowed by the first stage results. Crude oil production disruptions appear to be

the best set of instruments. 10 In both the three-country and USA-only cases the price and income

10
  We attempted a 2SLS regression using U.S. production disruptions together with crude oil quality as instruments,
however the coefficients on the crude oil quality variables were not significant in the first stage regression.
coefficients are significant (p < 0.01). The estimated price elasticities are -0.060 and -0.077 for

the three-country and USA-only cases, respectively. In the case of the USA-only model, the

price elasticity estimate for the period from 2001 to 2006 is more elastic and significantly

different from the basic model estimate for the same period. However, the price elasticity is still

small relative to the price elasticity estimates for the period from 1975 to 1980. While we cannot

rule out the effects of simultaneity, the instrumental variable results are encouraging and suggest

that these effects may be small relative to other factors affecting price elasticity.

3.3 Price Income Interaction Parameter Model

In order to study the interaction between the price elasticity of demand and income, we utilize a

simple interaction model of the form of Equation 2 below. The interaction term, lnPjtlnYjt

captures the extent to which the responsiveness of consumers to price changes increases or

decreases as income changes. 11 In this specification, the price elasticity of gasoline demand is

equal to Ep = β1 + β3lnYjt. Since the price elasticity is less than zero, a positive coefficient β3 on

the interaction term indicates a decrease in the price response as income rises.

                          ln G jt = β o + β 1 ln Pjt + β 2 ln Y jt + β 3 ln Pjt ln Y jt + ε j + ε jt               (2)


         Results from OLS estimation of the price-income interaction model and partial
adjustment models are presented in Table 7 below. In the case of the price-income interaction
model, the coefficients on price, income and the interaction term are significant for the period
from 1975 to 1980 (p < 0.05) and for the period from 2001 to 2006 (p < 0.01).

3.4 Partial Adjustment Models

Another common approach to modeling gasoline demand is through the use of a partial

adjustment model. 12 For example, see Houthakker, et al. (1974). The partial adjustment (PA)
11
   We also investigated the possibility of quadratic relation between price elasticity and income using an interaction
term of the form lnPjt(lnYjt)2. However, colinearity between lnYjt and (lnYjt)2 made this analysis impossible.
12
   Recently, a number of authors have used alternate dynamic models of gasoline demand based on cointegration
techniques. For example, see Alves and Bueno (2003), Bentzen (1994), Eltony and Almutairi (1995), and
Ramanathan (1999). We also investigated this approach. Tests for cointegration provided mixed results. In
augmented Dickey-Fuller tests we failed to reject the unit root hypothesis for the residuals of the cointegrating
model is a dynamic model that includes a lagged dependent variable. The rationale is that

frictions in the market prevent reaching the appropriate equilibrium level and as a result, only a

fraction of the desired change in consumption between periods is realized. In this paper, we

estimate models with both 1-month (t - 1) and 12-month (t - 12) lags with and without fixed

month effects. Here we use ln Gjt* in Equation 3 to represent the log of the equilibrium level of

gasoline consumption. The realized consumption in month j and year t, lnGjt is given by

consumption in the previous period, lnGjt-1 plus a fraction λ (adjustment coefficient) of the

difference between lnGjt* and lnGjt-1 as shown in Equation 4 below.

                                 ln G jt * = β o + β 1 ln Pjt + β 2 ln Y jt                                    (3)

                                 ln G jt = G jt −1 + λ (G jt * −G jt −1 ) + ε jt , 0 < λ < 1                   (4)


        Substituting for lnGjt* in Equation 4 yields Equation 5 below which is estimated by OLS.

The short-run price and income elasticities are given by the coefficients ξ 2 and ξ 3 , respectively.

The fully adjusted coefficients on the price and income terms, ξ 2,3 λ = ξ 2,3 (1 − ξ1 ) are

generally interpreted as long-run elasticities. However, the interpretation is not as clear when

monthly data are used. If the speed of adjustment (1/λ) is relatively short, on the order of several

months, the fully adjusted elasticities may also be interpreted as short-run. In Section 3.5, both

the short-run and fully adjusted coefficients are reported for comparison.

                                 ln G jt = ξ o + ξ1G jt −1 + ξ 2 ln Pjt + ξ 3 ln Y jt + ε jt                   (5)


        The partial adjustment models provide mixed results. In the partial adjustment models

without monthly dummy variables, the lnGt-1 lag model does not fit the empirical data. For the

12-month lag, the coefficient on income is not significant in either period. Therefore, we

exclude the results of these models from the elasticity comparison. Incorporating fixed month



regressions, I(12). However, the Durbin-Watson statistics for the cointegrating regressions suggested the presence
of cointegration, I(12). When we applied an error correction model similar to Alves and Bueno (2003) we obtained
elasticity estimates consistent with results from our other models.
effects improves the fit somewhat. For the period from 2001 to 2006, the coefficients on price,

income and the lagged dependent variable are significant (p < 0.01) for both lag structures. For

the period from 1975 to 1980, however, the coefficients on the lagged dependent variable and on

income are not significant in the 1-month and 12-month lag models, respectively. Therefore, we

also exclude the results for this period from the comparison of gasoline elasticities. With respect

to the 2001 to 2006 results, the speed of adjustment is approximately 1.5 and 9.4 months for the

1-month and 12-month models, respectively. This suggests that the fully adjusted elasticity

estimates may be interpreted as short-run estimates and are included below for comparison.

3.5 Summary of Alternative Specifications Results
The estimated price and income elasticities of gasoline demand for alternate model specifications
are summarized in Table 8 below. Based on the price income interaction, simultaneous
equations and recession data models, the estimated price elasticity of gasoline demand is
between -0.21 and -0.22 in the period from 1975 to 1980 and between -0.034 and -0.077 in the
period from 2001 to 2006. While the partial adjustment models do not provide a basis for
comparison between the two periods, the estimated price and income elasticities in the period
from 2001 to 2006 are consistent with other model specifications. A student’s t-test of the
simultaneous equations and recession data model results shows that the estimated price
elasticities in the two periods are significantly different (t = 3.15) even in the most conservative
case.


4. DISCUSSION

The results presented here strongly support the existence of a structural change in the demand for

gasoline. Estimates of the short-run price elasticity of gasoline demand for the period from 1975

to 1980 range from -0.21 and -0.34 and are consistent with estimates from the literature that use

comparable data. However, estimates of the price elasticity for the more recent period are

significantly more inelastic ranging from -0.034 to -0.077. This result has important policy

implications.
       The short-run price elasticity is a measure of the change in driving behavior as a result of

a change in the price of gasoline. A driver’s response to higher prices is largely composed of a

reduction in the amount of driving (vehicle miles traveled) and an increase in the fuel efficiency

of driving. The fuel efficiency of driving can be increased through for example, improved

vehicle maintenance or changes in driving behavior such as slower acceleration or reduced

vehicle speed. In addition, shifts in household vehicle stock utilization may contribute to short-

run elasticity. The short-run elasticity may also include more permanent changes in the vehicle

stock (e.g., the purchase of more fuel efficient vehicles), though vehicle purchase decisions are

typically regarded as more long-run in nature. The results presented here suggest that on

average, U.S. drivers appear less responsive in adjusting to gasoline price increases than in

previous decades.
       It may be the case today that U.S. consumers are more dependent on automobiles for

daily transportation than during the 1970’s and 1980’s and as a result, are less able to reduce

vehicle miles traveled in response to higher prices. One hypothesis is that an increase in

suburban development has led to larger distances between travel destinations. This could mean

that drivers have less ability to respond to price changes because greater distances decrease the

viability of non-motorized modes such as walking or biking. In addition, when development

patterns increase the distance between home and non-discretionary destinations such as the

workplace, a greater share of the total vehicle miles traveled are fixed. An increase in multiple

income households would further decrease flexibility if a greater share of the population requires

a daily work commute. Finally, these effects are compounded if the availability of public transit

is less than in earlier decades.

       Another hypothesis is that as incomes have grown, the budget share represented by

gasoline consumption has decreased making consumers less sensitive to price increases. The

price income interaction model presented here provides insight into this hypothesis. If

increasing income results in a decrease in the consumer response to gasoline price changes, one

would expect the coefficient on the interaction term of the model to have a positive sign.
However, in both periods we find that the coefficient on the interaction term is negative

suggesting that on average, gasoline consumption is more sensitive to price changes as income

rises. This somewhat counterintuitive result is supported by the household gasoline demand

analysis conducted by Kayser (2000) who also finds a negative coefficient on the price income

interaction term. The hypothesis proposed by Kayser is that as incomes rise, a greater proportion

of automobile trips are discretionary. Alternatively, at lower income levels, the amount of travel

has already been reduced to the minimum leaving little room for adjustment to higher prices.

Another possible explanation is that the number of vehicles per household increases with

income. When the number of household vehicles exceeds the number of drivers, there is the

possibility for drivers to shift to more fuel efficient vehicles within the household stock as

gasoline prices rise. Whatever the explanation, the overall decrease in price elasticity despite

growth in incomes suggests that these effects are relatively minor compared to other factors

affecting gasoline demand.
       Finally, the overall improvement in U.S. fleet average fuel economy since the late 1970’s

and early 1980’s may have also contributed to a decrease in the responsiveness of consumers to

gasoline price increases. Largely a result of the U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)

and market penetration of fuel efficient foreign vehicles during the period, the U.S. fleet average

fuel economy improved from approximately 15 miles per gallon in 1980 to approximately 20

miles per gallon in 2000 according to National Research Council (2002). Because the vehicle

fleet has become more fuel efficient, a decrease in miles traveled today has a smaller impact on

gasoline consumption. That is to say if for example discretionary travel is reduced, the resulting

reduction in gasoline consumption today is less than in 1980 because today’s vehicles consume

less fuel per mile driven.

       To some degree, the short-run price elasticity during the 1970’s and 1980’s may also

reflect the large difference in fuel economy between old and new vehicles that existed during the

transition to higher fuel economy standards. As more fuel efficient vehicles came to market, it

was possible for consumers to realize a large improvement in fuel economy by trading in older
vehicles for newer models. Today however, there is little difference in fuel economy between

old and new vehicles. This is largely a result of CAFE standards that have not been significantly

increased since the 1980’s. As a result, today’s new vehicle market forces consumer to choose

between smaller vehicle classes or more expensive hybrid models when considering options for

improving vehicle fuel economy. The inelastic price elasticities observed in the more recent

period of this study may be a continuation of a trend identified by Espey (1998) who observed

that short-run price elasticities appeared to decrease in magnitude over time. Espey argues that

as prices rose during the 1970’s and people initially changed driving habits and bought more fuel

efficient vehicles there were fewer short-run options to respond to increasing prices in the future.
       Whatever the cause, the results presented here suggest that today’s consumers have not

significantly altered their driving behavior in response to higher gasoline prices. It is important

to note that these results measure consumers’ reactions to short run changes in gasoline prices.

However, it is the long-run response that is the most important in determining which polices are

most appropriate for reducing gasoline consumption. As it turns out, it is relatively difficult to

measure long-run gasoline elasticities in practice due to factors such as the cyclical nature of

gasoline prices. In this paper, we are also limited to currently available data and the relatively

short history of high gasoline prices during the past several years.

       Analysis of the short-run price elasticity does however provide some insight into long-run

behavior. The long-run response to gasoline price increases is the sum of short-run changes

(miles driven) and long-run changes (fuel economy of the vehicle fleet). The short-run results

suggest that consumers today are less responsive in adjusting miles driven to increases in

gasoline price. This component seems unlikely to change significantly for long-run behavior.

This is because factors that may contribute to inelastic short-run price elasticities such as land

use, employment patterns and transit infrastructure typically evolve on timescales greater than

those considered in long-run decisions.

       In terms of vehicle fuel economy, consumers may respond to higher gasoline prices in the

long-run by purchasing more fuel efficient vehicles. However, if consumers in the period from
2001 to 2006 were purchasing more fuel efficient vehicles in response to higher gasoline prices,

one would expect to see at least a portion of this effect in the short-run elasticity. While our

results do not preclude a significant shift to more fuel efficient vehicles in the long-run response,

the highly inelastic values that we observe suggest that the vehicle fuel economy component is

small. If the long-run price elasticity is in fact more inelastic than in previous decades, smaller

reductions in gasoline consumption will occur for any given gasoline tax level. As a result, a tax

would need to be significantly larger today in order to achieve an equivalent reduction in

gasoline consumption. In the U.S., gasoline taxes have been politically difficult to implement.

Higher required tax levels pose an addition hurdle. This may make tax policies impossible to

implement in practice. In this case, alternate measures such as increases in the CAFE standard

may be required to achieve desired reductions in gasoline consumption.


5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we estimate the average per capita demand for gasoline in the U.S. for the period

from 1974 to 2006. We investigate two periods of similar gasoline price increases in order to

compare the demand elasticities in the 1970’s and 1980’s with today. We find that the short-run

price elasticity of U.S. gasoline demand is significantly more inelastic today than in previous

decades. This result is robust and consistent across several empirical models and functional

forms. The observed change provides evidence of a structural change in the U.S. market for

transportation fuel and may reflect shifts in land-use, social or vehicle characteristics during the

past several decades. These results suggest that technologies and policies for improving vehicle

fuel economy may be increasingly important in reducing U.S. gasoline consumption.
