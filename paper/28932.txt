Spatial-SIR with Network Structure and Behavior: Lockdown Rules and the Lucas Critique

JEL No. I18,R10

                                          ABSTRACT

We introduce a model of the diffusion of an epidemic with demographically heterogeneous
agents interacting socially on a spatially structured network. Contagion-risk averse agents
respond behaviorally to the diffusion of the infections by limiting their social interactions. Firms
also respond by allowing employees to work remotely, depending on their productivity. The
spatial structure induces local herd immunities along sociodemographic dimensions, which
significantly affect the dynamics of infections. We study several non-pharmaceutical
interventions; e.g., i) lockdown rules, which set thresholds on the spread of the infection for the
closing and reopening of economic activities; and ii) selective lockdowns, which restrict social
interactions by location (in the network) and by the demographic characteristics of the agents.
Substantiating a "Lucas critique" argument, we assess the cost of naive discretionary policies
ignoring agents and firms' behavioral responses.

1    Introduction
In this paper, we develop and study a diffusion model of infection to study the effectiveness
of different public health policies on contagion dynamics. More specifically, we extend the
Spatial-SIR model introduced in Bisin and Moro (2020a) allowing for a demographic and a
network structure of the social interactions driving the diffusion process. We also account
for agents' and firms' behavioral responses to the diffusion of the epidemics and to policy
interventions.
    More specifically, agents belong to three demographic types: Young (students/workers),
Not employed, Old. Each day, the types potentially visit different locations in a struc-
tured network: the City, School/Work locations, and Home, which differ by contact density.
Consequently, the model displays heterogeneous rates of diffusion of the epidemic by demo-
graphic type and across the network of locations. Furthermore, depending on the spread of
the epidemic, contagion-risk averse agents may reduce their social interactions, and firms
may instruct their workers to operate remotely. We calibrate the model to reproduce several
stylized facts about the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. We calibrate agent types and
family compositions to match the U.S. demographics, particularly the family size distribu-
tion by age. Next, we simulate the calibrated model.
    The model simulation identifies several important factors relevant to understanding the
heterogeneous rates of diffusion of the epidemic, highlighting that local herd immunities may
form not only geographically (the focus in Bisin and Moro (2020a)) but also along socio-
demographic dimensions depending on the network structure. For instance, the City orig-
inates more infections than School/Work and School/Work more than Home, even though
Home is the densest location and the City is the least dense. This result occurs because
the ranking of the locations in terms of density is opposite to the ranking in terms of size,
therefore herd immunity is achieved earlier at Home and School/Work than in the City.
Similarly, the epidemic is primarily concentrated on the Young because they are exposed
at School/Work, where there are more contacts than at Home. These effects, which we say
arise from local herd immunity are akin to a selection effect, whereby the epidemic spreads
selectively by location and demographic structure.
    Our analysis also illustrates the relevance of the indirect effects induced by agents'
and firms' behavioral responses across locations and demographic types. For instance, the
Youngs' behavioral responses, preventing exposure in School/Work locations, have a sizable
substantial effect on the Old in the City, where most of the Old get infected.
    We use this model to study the effects of several public health policy interventions. Sim-
ulations allow us to evaluate the outcomes of these interventions with respect to, e.g., the
peaks of the first and second waves of infection and the spread of the infection by demo-
graphic structure. Specifically, we emphasize public health policy rules, that is, articulated
interventions on an epidemic's whole course possibly developing over various waves. We
study, e.g., lockdown rules, where the public health authorities set thresholds levels of ac-
tive infection cases determining when social interactions are restricted and when they are


                                              2
allowed. Lockdown rules interact in rather subtle ways with the dynamics of herd immunity.
When the lockdown is placed too early with respect to the spread of the epidemic, the frac-
tion of infected is too small, herd immunity is too far out, and a second wave of infections
at reopening reaches a peak higher than the first one. If reopening is delayed to occur at
a lower fraction of active cases than the one that triggered the lockdown, a strategy we
labeled cautious reopening, herd behavior is more advanced upon reopening, substantially
dampening the second wave.
    The model's network and demographic structure also allow us to study various selective
lockdown policies, where lockdowns are imposed by the location of social interactions and/or
by the agents' demographic characteristics. We concentrate on two such policies. In the first
one, we limit the lockdown to the City, and we let firms/schools decide whether to operate
remotely. In the second one, we limit the lockdown to the Old, a policy aiming at reducing
total fatalities while bearing limited economic costs (the Old are not economically active but
suffer a higher fatality rate than other demographic groups). Both these policies have the
important property that they are much less costly economically because workers/students
remain active. This benefit is traded-off with health-outcome costs at the steady-state or
at the peak (relevant when there is a health care resource constraint, such as hospital/ICU
beds). While these selective lockdowns have positive direct effects in terms of economic costs,
indirect effects across locations and/or demographic types could, in principle, substantially
limit their advantage over general lockdowns. This outcome does not appear to occur in our
simulations. The City-Only lockdown does not induce a much larger fraction of infected at
steady-state than the general lockdown, while the Old-Only lockdown is very successful in
limiting Old agents' deaths.
    Last but not least, we illustrate the implications of what economists refer to as the Lucas
Critique in the context of epidemiological models. Policy evaluations and interventions
disregarding that agents' and firms' "decision rules vary systematically with changes in
the structure of series relevant to the decision-maker" (Lucas (1976)) might lead to policy
decisions that are very costly in terms of their effects on the epidemic dynamics. The
costs of disregarding behavioral responses are clearer if we consider that the lockdown and
opening thresholds are calibrated to flatten the infection curve to avoid hitting a constraint
on the available health care resources. In this case, our simulations imply under-utilization
of health care resources after lockdown (that is, the lockdown will turn out to be stricter
than necessary) and possibly an over-run of these resources after reopening.


2    Epidemic by Spatial, Demographic, Network, and Behavior
     Characteristics
We introduce a model of the dynamics of an epidemic which, while stylized, contains several
important components needed to analyze the effects of different forms of lockdowns. Our goal
is to maintain a parsimonious structure while replicating the features of general epidemics


                                              3
that are relevant for policy analysis, to produce relatively robust qualitative results.1
    We build on the Spatial-SIR model we have introduced in Bisin and Moro (2020a). In the
Spatial-SIR, agents are located and move in a two-dimensional space. With some probability,
they become infected when they get close to an infected agent.2 In this paper, we introduce
heterogeneity in agents' type (by age and occupation status) and in the characteristics of
the social spaces where they interact so that they interact in distinct networks.3
    We model agents responding to the dynamics of the epidemic, by choosing to limit their
social contacts, and we assume that some schools/firms adopt behavioral responses similar
to the agents', that is, they choose to shut down operations or to allow workers to work
remotely, to limit infections in the school/workplace.4

2.1     State transitions
Let S = {S, A, Y, R, D} denote the individual state-space, indicating Susceptibles, Asymp-
tomatic, sYmptomatic, Recovered, and Dead.5 We assume the following transitions: i) a
Susceptible agent in a location within distance p from the location of an Asymptomatic
    1
      Frontier research in epidemiology has proposed models of contagion, extending the classic SIR model in
many directions, including detailed descriptions of the geographic or network characteristics of the agents'
social interactions - see, e.g., Eubank et al. (2004) and the research at GLEAM project, mobs-lab, and the
Imperial's college MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis. While these are large-scale models
fundamentally aimed at forecasting with accuracy and precision, their complexity makes it difficult to uncover
the main driving forces of the epidemics and policy interventions' effects.
    2
      Several recent contributions to the study of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in economics have restricted
their epidemiology component to the SIR model, without modeling the spatial dimension of the epidemics;
see e.g., Fernandez-Villaverde and Jones (2020), Atkeson (2020), Eichenbaum et al. (2020), Giannitsarou et
al. (2020), Keppo et al. (2020), Rowthorn and Toxvaerd (2012) Weitz et al. (2020). As exceptions, Antràs
et al. (2020), Brotherhood et al. (2020b), Cun    ~ at and Zymek (2020), and Glaeser et al. (2020) introduce
connections between different geographical units.
    3
      Along these lines, Acemoglu et al. (2020), Alfaro et al. (2020), Babajanyan and Cheong (2020), Baqaee
et al. (2020a), Baqaee et al. (2020b), Bognanni et al. (2020), Brotherhood et al. (2020a), Fischer (2020),
Giagheddu and Papetti (2020), Gollier (2020) add a demographic structure like we do; and Azzimonti et
al. (2020) adds a network structure. Ellison (2020) allow for heterogeneity of the contact process between
subpopulations.
    4
      Models of rational agents limiting contacts to reduce the risk of infection include Fenichel (2013) Weitz
et al. (2020) in epidemiology (see also Funk et al. (2010) and Verelst et al. (2016) for surveys); and Geoffard
and Philipson (1996), Goenka and Liu (2012), Acemoglu et al. (2020), Aguirregabiria et al. (2020), Argente
et al. (2020), Bethune and Korinek (2020), Farboodi et al. (2020), Fernandez-Villaverde and Jones (2020),
Greenwood et al. (2019), Keppo et al. (2020), Toxvaerd (2020) (as well as several of the papers cited in
Footnote 2, modeling spatial extensions of SIR) in economics. Empirically, several papers use cellular
phone data to document how fear of contagion has affected mobility or show that the economy deteriorated
substantially even before or independently of lockdown orders. See, for example, Alfaro et al. (2020), Aum
et al. (2020), Barrios et al. (2020), Bartik et al. (2020), Cicala et al. (2020), Coibion et al. (2020), Goolsbee
and Syverson (2020), Gupta et al. (2020), Kahn et al. (2020), Rojas et al. (2020).

      There is no accepted denomination for the form of compartmental model we adopt in this paper. Alterna-
tive denominations would include A-SIRD and Stochastic Symptom-Response SIRD, following, respectively,
Gaeta (2020); Leung et al. (2018).

ture period, can become sYmptomatic with probability  , or can Recover with probability
; iii) a sYmptomatic agent can Recover or Die at any period with probabilities  and  ,
respectively; iv) Dead and Recovered agents never leave these states.

2.2    Demographic and network structure
There are three types of locations: the City at large, a set of School/Work locations shared
by subsets of agents, and Home locations shared by family members. Agents differ by age
and occupation in their access to these three types of locations.
    There are three demographic types of agents:7 the Young, the Not employed, and the
Old. The Young represent students/workers who spend part of their day in School/Work,
that is, in a location where they interact daily with the same individuals. The Not employed
represent adult individuals The demographic structure interacts with the location structure
in that the Old do not visit School/Work locations.

2.3    Social interactions
Each day is divided into three periods dedicated to the location where agents interact:
Period 1 is devoted to visiting the City, Period 2 to visiting the School/Work location and
Period 3 to stay at Home. However, agents might choose or be structurally restricted from
visiting the City and/or School/Work and hence stay Home, depending on their demographic
and/or health state.8 SYmptomatic agents must stay at Home in all three periods. If
not sYmptomatic, all agents visit the City in Period 1, and all Young agents visit the
School/Work location in Period 2, when the other agents stay Home. Table 1 summarizes
the locations visited by agents by the time of day.
    Agents move randomly in the City: Every day t = [0, T ], agents travel distance µ
toward a random direction of d  U [0, 2 ] radians. By doing so, they potentially meet
new individuals every day; therefore, µ models the speed at which agents find new contacts,
potentially in a different state than their previous neighbors. Each Young is randomly
assigned to a School/Work location and does not move within it. School/Work locations
are far from each other (there is no possibility of contagion across School/Work locations).
Finally, agents are assigned to families located in Homes that are far from each other and
far from School/Work locations.
    The distinction we introduce across the three locations abstractly captures different
relative densities in agents' social interactions. The School/Work location represents a non-
random location that is visited every day by the same set of people and is denser than the
   6
     We assume sYmptomatic agents are isolated at home or in the hospital, therefore not contagious.
   7
     The age structure of the population has specific relevance for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic because the
case-fatality rate is very skewed, higher for older agents.
   8
     Agents might be restricted to visit some location also as a policy choice. We discuss these restrictions
in the next section.

City (see the next section for details on how location density is calibrated). Home represents
the location with the tightest interactions: agents from the same family have identical Home
locations; that is, they are necessarily in contact with each other. On the other hand, at
School/Work and in the City, the contagion may occur only if people are close in space.

2.4    Behavior
In this section, we model agents responding to the epidemic dynamics by choosing to limit
their contacts. Following Keppo et al. (2020), we introduce a reduced-form behavioral
response, represented by a function 0  (It )  1, representing the fraction of agents who
are choosing not to interact in the City as a function of the number of infected in the
population It :9
                                            
                                             1            if It  I
                                 (It ) =         I 1-                  .                             (1)
                                            
                                                 It       if It > I

    We rank the agents (and School/Work locations) by contagion-risk aversion. Agents
choosing not to interact in the City (and School/Firms leaving agents at Home) are the most
contagion-risk averse. We also assume some firms and schools adopt behavioral responses
similar to the agents' according to (1), that is, they choose to shut down operations or to
allow workers to work remotely, to limit infections at school or work.
   9
    In our simulations, we assume the behavioral response depends on the fraction of Asymptomatics be-
cause the sYmptomatics are isolated at Home. Since the fraction of Asymptomatics is not observable, the
behavioral response could only depend on the number of sYmptomatics, as a proxy; with Rational Expec-
tations, however, the agents know (rationally infer) the equilibrium map from Y to A, say A(Y ), possibly
with noise; see Bisin and Moro (2020b) or Gans (2020).

3        Calibration and simulation
We use data from the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) to classify agents by type
and allocate them to households replicating the size and age distribution of American house-
holds. We calibrate the three locations' relative density to match the data on the distribution
of contacts reported by Mossong et al. (2008). Transition probabilities between states match
various SARS-CoV-2 parameters from epidemiological studies, notably, e.g., Ferguson et al.
(2020). We calibrate contagion rates and the agents' movement speed in the City to fit the
epidemic's initial growth rate, proxied by the growth rates of deaths in Lombardy. Finally,
behavioral response parameters are calibrated following Keppo et al. (2020).10 Appendix B

    We acknowledge the uncertainty in the literature concerning many epidemiological parameters pertaining
to this epidemic. Our approach is less damaging when aiming at understanding mechanisms and orders-of-

                   Results from the simulation of the benchmark model are illustrated in Figure 1; Figure

               state outcomes.11 , including the locations of infection by agent type and the percent of the
               population in three different states at the steady-state.
                   Generally, our simulation of the model demonstrates that local herd immunity - which in
               Bisin and Moro (2020a) we argue explains the dependence of the dynamics of the epidemic
               from geographical characteristics - also explains the dependence of the epidemic from loca-
               tion and demographic characteristics. With respect to location, the City originates more
               infections, 46 percent (vs. 21 percent in School/Work location, and 33 percent at Home)
               even though Homes and School/Work locations are denser because more contacts with dif-
               ferent people are generated in the City. Herd immunity is achieved locally earlier at Home
               and at School/Work than in the City. The infection dynamics by location shows a larger
               fraction of infections at Home than at School/Work and in the City after about ten days,
               when the City relative infection rate starts to pick up.12
                   More Young are infected because of their exposure to more contacts at School/Work
               magnitude rather than at precise forecasts.
                11
                   All results are obtained averaging over 20 replications of the simulation.
                12
                   We set the location of infection at t = 0 in the City.

than at Home. Old and the Not employed are hit differently because of family structure:
the latter live in households with relatively more young individuals that are infected at
School/Work locations. These effects are akin to a selection effect, whereby the epidemic
spreads selectively by location and demographic structure.13
    It is interesting to compare the simulation of the benchmark model to a model simulated
without behavioral responses (see the orange lines in Figure 1(a) and Table 3(b)). The total
fraction of Recovered and Dead at the Steady-state is 0.77 in the benchmark model but would
have been .88 without the behavioral response. The fraction of infections occurring at Home
is almost ten percentage points lower without behavioral response. The symmetric opposite
effect is mostly concentrated at School/Work rather than in the City, whose fractions of
infection increase, respectively, by 9 and 1 percentage points. The total rise in infections at
School/Work affects mostly the Young, who get infected less at Home (from 31 to 20 percent)
and more at School/Work (from 30 to 43 percent). At the steady-state, the proportion of
Young Recovered or Dead increases from 82 percent to 94 percent.

    The most important implication resulting from this simulation is the indirect effect of
the behavioral response across locations and demographic types. Specifically, the behavioral
responses of (mostly) the Young, (mostly) in the School/Work location have a sizable impor-
tant effect on the Old in the City (the Old get infected mostly in the City, over 70 percent,
with or without behavioral response). Notably, the compensating effect of higher infections
at Home with the behavioral response is of reduced importance for the Old because of family
composition (the Old tend to live with other Old). At the steady-state, the proportion of
Old Recovered or Dead increases from 63 percent to 73 percent.14 The impact of behavioral
response on the Not employed is instead moderate Old because their family composition
induces them to be infected more at Home.


4        Lockdown policies
This section explores the effects of various non-pharmaceutical interventions along the lines
of those proposed and implemented by various administrations during the COVID-19 out-
break. Our goal is to exploit the spatial nature of the model, the structure of the network of
interactions, and the (distinction by) demographic characteristics of the agents to analyze
the different impact of these policies both in the aggregate and across types.
    We study general lockdown rules, that is, interventions where the lockdown and reopen-
ing rules depend on the spread of the infections. We also study selective lockdowns, where
only the City is locked down, or only Old individuals are restricted in movement across
locations (either confined either at Home or in quarantine facilities of different sizes). In all
the cases we study, policies overlap with the behavioral response; that is, they are applied to
the population of agents and firms randomly, not accounting for their behavioral response.
In other word, lockdown policies may apply to agents (resp. firms) that would have chosen
to self-isolate (resp. shut down) even in the absence of the policy.15

4.1      A general lockdown of the City and School/Workplace
We study the effects of a generalized lockdown of the City and 50 percent of Work/School
locations. We consider policies where the lockdown is applied when the fraction of active
cases, A + Y , reaches a given fraction of the population. We report results regarding dif-
ferent policies regarding when to reopen the City and the School/Work locations operating
remotely. The results reveal the trade-off between flattening the the curve of active cases
and delaying the reaching of global herd immunity.
    14
      A simulation - which we do not report in the text - where we only allow for a behavioral response by
firms, has a much smaller effect on the Old, suggesting that the main impact on the Old goes through the
reduction of infections in the City.
   15
      This analysis is, to our knowledge, the first example of an application of Lucas Critique argument in
this context; see Section 5 for a more articulated discussion and interesting examples.

Note: The figure illustrates the dynamics of active cases (A+Y) as a fraction of the total population under
different lockdown policies. The dashed lines indicate the proportion of infected triggering a lockdown. The
table reports the infection location and outcomes at steady-state.



4.1.1    Reopen forever after active cases return to the fraction which triggered
         the lockdown
We start by studying the case in which both City and School/Work reopen forever after active
infections return to the fraction which triggered the lockdown (10, 5, and 3.5 percent). In
this case, because the lockdown may have delayed the population reaching herd immunity,
infections may increase again after reopening.
    The results are displayed in Figure 2. We notice that the flattening of the infection curve
is substantial. In all cases, the peak of active cases with lockdown is less than half than
without lockdown. The reduction of Dead and Recovered at the steady-state is substantial.
Importantly, the lockdown has rather large effects on the Old (not reported in the table).
The fraction of Dead and Recovered decreases under all policies by about ten percentage

points for the Old and only about half as much for the Young (and Not employed). While
either lockdown reduces the fraction of Dead at the steady-state of only one-tenth of 1
percent, this reduction is four to five times as big for the Old.
    Notably, the lockdown strategy interacts in rather subtle ways with the dynamics of herd
immunity. When the lockdown occurs too early (5 percent in our simulation), the fraction
of infected is too small, herd immunity is too far out, and at reopening a second wave of
infections reaches a peak higher than the first one.

4.1.2    Cautious reopening
We study rules in which reopening is set more cautiously: a 5 percent reopening threshold
for the 10 percent lockdown and a 2 percent reopening threshold for the 5 percent lockdown.
This is an interesting health policy strategy because, as we have seen in the previous sections,


                                                                                 12
the lockdown strategy interacts with herd immunity dynamics, and an early reopening can
induce a high second wave of infections.
    Results are in Figure 3 . Relative to the case in which reopening occurs at the same
threshold as the lockdown, herd behavior is more advanced at reopening, and the second
wave is substantially dampened. The peaks of the second wave occur at about 8 percent as
opposed to 13 percent of the population, for the 10 percent lockdown. The result is even
more striking for the 5 percent lockdown. In this case, with reopening at 5 percent, the
second wave was higher than the first (15 percent). With cautious reopening at 2 percent,
instead, the second wave is dampened to 5 percent. Interestingly, however this triggers
another lockdown and hence a third wave whose peak is below 5 percent. Relatedly, the
fraction of Dead and Recovered at steady-state is lower with cautious reopening, about 3
and 8 percentage points, respectively, for the 10 and the 5 percent lockdowns. Cautious
reopening, we conclude, is particularly effective for the 5 percent lockdown, where reopening
at 5 percent induced a large second wave and a fraction of Dead and Recovered at steady-
state larger than with a less restrive lockdown at 10 percent (with reopening at 10 percent).

4.2     Selective Lockdowns
This section presents two selective lockdown policies. In the first one, we limit the lockdown
to the City, and we let firms/schools decide whether to operate remotely. In the second one,
we limit the lockdown to the Old, a policy aiming at reducing total fatalities while bearing
limited economic costs (the Old are not economically active but suffer a higher fatality
rate than other demographic groups). Both these lockdown policies have the important
property that they are much less costly, economically, as worker/students remain active.
This consideration needs to be traded-off with additional costs in terms of health outcomes at
the steady-state or at the peak, e.g. if the society has a constraint with respect to health care
resources like hospital/ICU beds. Furthermore, while these selective lockdowns have positive
direct effects in terms of economic costs, indirect effects across locations and/or demographic
types could, in principle, substantially limit their advantage over general lockdowns.

4.2.1    City-Only lockdown
Results for the City-Only lockdown are reported in Figure 4, with respect to a 10 percent
lockdown with cautious reopening at 5 percent. Interestingly, in this case, with respect to the
general lockdown, the first peak in A + Y is higher (18.6 percent rather than 15.8), but there
is no significant second wave. Furthermore, the total fraction of Dead and Recovered at the
steady-state is two percentage points lower. This is striking, as the City-Only lockdown is
much less costly, economically, than the general lockdown. According to these simulations,
the City-Only lockdown has extra health costs inasmuch as the first wave might be too
high with respect to a possible constraint in terms of health care resources. In other words,
indirect effects, e.g., from City to Home, do not appear to limit the advantages of the

City-Only lockdown in our simulations.16

4.2.2     Old-Only lockdown
Results for the Old-Only lockdown are reported in Figure 5(a), simulating a 5 percent
lockdown rule with a period of intermittent reopening and lockdown at 5 percent to avoid
a second wave of infections. Olds are isolated in their Homes, where they are in contact
with their families. Comparing it with the case in which the lockdown is general (that is,
includes the Young and the Not Employed as well), it is remarkable that the number of
stationary Dead between the Old is more than halved, from over 2 percent to less that 1

   As we repeatedly noted, we do not aspire to quantitatively precise prediction because the calibrated
model we simulate is very stylized.

percent. The peak of active cases remains rather high, as the Young and the Not Employed
keep interacting in the City and the Young also at School/Work. This high peak does not
necessarily affect possible constraints on health care resources if the Old use them relatively
more intensely. As for the City-Only lockdown, our simulations of the Old-Only lockdown
suggest that indirect effects, e.g., from Young to Old or from School/Work to Home, do not
substantially limit its advantage.

report D + R at steady-state for different simulations where the Old are locked-down in
nursing homes of different sizes (the dot is the case where the Old are locked-down at their
Home). It is noteworthy that the number of Dead increases steeply with the size of the
nursing homes, reaching 2 percent for homes with 50-agents each. It is also interesting the
lockdown of the Old at Home is equivalent in terms of infection and fatality rates to one
where the Old are locked-down in nursing homes of about size 10. This is a consequence of
the indirect interactions across locations hurting the more susceptible demographic group.


5         An Exercise in the Lucas Critique
This section illustrates the implications of what economists refer to as the Lucas Critique,
in the context of epidemiological models.17 We have already shown, in the previous section,
that the behavioral response of agents and firms to the dynamics of an epidemic is bound to
have important effects on the dynamics themselves. We now discuss how policy evaluations
and interventions disregarding that agents' and firms' "decision rules vary systematically
with changes in the structure of series relevant to the decision-maker" might lead to policy
decisions that are very costly in terms of their effects on the dynamics of the epidemic.

5.1         Policymaker error
We simulate the prediction error of a policymaker evaluating different lockdown policies
while not anticipating the behavioral response of agents and firms to the dynamics of the
epidemic. We interpret the dynamics without behavioral response as the policymaker's
prediction of the effect of the lockdown and the case with response as the actual outcome of
the lockdown.
    We report the case of a lockdown at 10 percent with reopening at 5 and a lockdown
at 5 percent with reopening at 2; respectively in Figure 6(a) and 6(b) (we do not report
tables for these simulations). In both cases, the policymaker predicts a higher peak than it
actually occurs. On the other hand, he/she will face an earlier and higher than predicted
second wave.
    17
         From Lucas (1976). In its original formulation, the Critique is summarized as follows:
               "Given that the structure of an econometric model consists of optimal decision rules of eco-
           nomic agents and that optimal decision rules vary systematically with changes in the structure
           of series relevant to the decision-maker, it follows that any change in policy will systematically
           alter the structure of econometric models."

5.2                             Policymaker error when recalibrating the reopening policy
In this section we postulate a more articulate procedure to evaluate different lockdown
policies on the part of a policymaker who does not anticipate the behavioral response of
agents and firms. Consider a policymaker who evaluates lockdown interventions assuming
no behavioral responses, but chooses the reopening threshold as a consequence of a policy
re-valuation after the lockdown, still disregarding the behavioral response. More specifically,
consider the case where, at the re-evaluation stage, the policymaker naively attributes the
lower-than-predicted peak of infections to the effect of fewer people visiting the City and
School/Work locations, generating lower contact rates and slower diffusion of the epidemics.
The policymaker, however, continues to disregard the fact that behavioral responses are a
function of the number of cases and re-evaluates the reopening policy assuming that people
visiting the City and School/Work locations remain at the (lower) level observed at the
re-evaluation.
    The adverse effects and the costs of this procedure are clearly seen in the case in which
a policymaker sets up a 3.5 percent lockdown rule with the goal of not experiencing a peak
active cases over about 13 percent, as predicted by the model without behavioral response
(see Figure 7(a)). When reaching the peak, which occurs at about 8 percent, the policymaker
re-evaluates its reopening policy, re-calibrates its model and computes a new reopening rule.
The recalibration and the new reopening rule are computed postulating still no behavioral

response upon reopening. In our simulations, we run the model to find the reopening rule
that would generate 13 percent active cases at the peak in the policymaker's recalibrated
model.
    The error induced by the policymaker recalibrating the reopening policy is clearly appar-
ent in the Figure. Since there is not enough herd immunity at the first peak, the policymaker
delays reopening until the fraction of active cases is about 1 percent. Nonetheless, the recal-
ibration misses the behavioral response of agents and firms, who increase the contact rate
in both the City and the Work/School due to the low infection rates. As a consequence, the
second wave is much higher than the first and ends up actually reaching a peak of about
15 percent, substantially higher than the government's original target of 13 percent. Con-
sidering that the lockdown and opening threshold are calibrated to flatten the curve of the
infections so has to avoid hitting a constraint on the available health care resources, this
simulation implies that health care resources will be under-utilized after lockdown (that is,
the lockdown will turn out to be stricter than necessary) and they will instead be over-run
after reopening, with potentially high human costs.
    Interestingly, the costs associated with this policy-making procedure disregarding be-
havioral responses are less apparent in the case of a lockdown at 5 percent so as to avoid a


                                                                                      18
peak higher than about 15 percent of active cases (see Figure 7(b)). It is still the case that,
after observing a smaller than expected first peak, the policymaker, expects a low infection
rate for the future, induced by (what she expects to be a constantly) lower contact rate. She
then decides to reopen too soon, when cases are low, and hence the behavioral response of
agents and firms increases the contact rate. As a consequence, the epidemic picks up, giving
rise to an unexpected second wave of infection as agents and firms. However, in this case,
the second peak after recalibration is higher than the first, but near the 15 percent target,
not higher as in the previous case. Interestingly, while the recalibration misses the behav-
ioral response, leading agents and firms to increase the contact rate after the first peak, it
also misses the herd immunity generated by this behavior. The effect of herd immunity is
larger because initial lockdown is set at 5 percent rather than at 3.5 percent, because of the
relatively higher first peak of infections, and because, after the government re-evaluation,
while active cases are declining more people than the government expects visit the City and
get infected.


6        Conclusions
In this paper, we developed a parsimonious stylized model which, in our objectives, adds sev-
eral dimensions of interest to the standard epidemiological components of general economic
models in which the policy trade-off between economic activity and epidemic diffusion is
evaluated, as, e.g., in Atkeson (2020), Alvarez et al. (2020), Jarosch et al. (2020), Kaplan et
al. (2020). Both the geographic and the network dimension appear very relevant in several
empirical analyses of the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, which tend to concentrate on
economic activity granular level.18 The model is designed to qualitatively and quantitatively
identify the role of the interactions between several fundamental "forces" driving the dynam-
ics of an epidemic, like (global and local) herd immunity, network, and demographic het-
erogeneity, behavioral responses of agents and firms to infections, and Non-Pharmaceutical
policy interventions. In this respect, we stress that the role of Lucas Critique arguments,
which identify the adverse effects and the costs of policy interventions disregarding behav-
ioral responses, is potentially first order, qualitatively and quantitatively, depending on the
calibration.

A      Appendix: Theoretical Structure of SIR and Spatial-SIR
We refer to Appendix A in Bisin and Moro (2020a) for a formalization of the Spatial-SIR we
extend in this paper. The extension we adopt in this paper adds demographic and network
structure as described but does not alter the mechanics of the epidemic state transitions.


B      Appendix: Calibration
We calibrate the parameters of Spatial-SIR to the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
We acknowledge the substantial uncertainty in the literature with respect to even the main
epidemiological parameters pertaining to this epidemic. As we noted in the introduction,
this is less problematic when aiming at understanding mechanisms and orders-of-magnitude
rather than at precise forecasts. The parameters we choose in the calibration of the aggregate
model are summarily reported in Table 2.

Geography
The City is a square of area equal to 1. We choose N = 25600 so that our simulations
converge in a reasonable time (see Bisin and Moro (2020a) for a description of how the model
scales in size). People are located in the City by randomly drawing their x and y coordinates
indipendently from a Uniform distribution  U [0, 1]. At all t > 0, individuals are relocated
at distance µ from their location at t - 1, in a direction drawn randomly from a Uniform
distribution  U [0, 2 ]. School/Work locations are are squares of size calibrated as described
below. The location of individuals within School/Work locations is randomly drawn as in
the City, but does not change over time. Homes have no dimension. All School/Work and
Home locations are far from each other and far from the City to prevent contagion across
different location types, across different schools/workplaces and across different homes.
    We calibrate the relative density of the three locations to match the data on the distribu-
tion of contacts reported by Mossong et al. (2008).19 In this data, on average, people make
13.5 contacts per day. Furthermore, the total number of contacts is distributed as follows:
34 percent at work or at school, 34 percent in other locations besides home.20 Assuming
that interactions at Home necessarily induce contacts between family members, and with
an average family size of 3.3 from the ACS data, this implies 2.3 contacts at home.21 Of the
remaining 11.2 contacts, according to the data in Mossong et al. (2008), about half occur
at Work and School and half in what we have categorized as the City. Because a fraction of
the population is structurally restricted not to visit the School/Work location (the Old and
  19
     They survey mixing patterns on a sample of the population in eight European countries. We do not
exploit cross-country heterogeneity in this section and consider averages.
  20
     We ignore the 7 percent of contacts occurring in "multiple" locations.
  21
     This is lower than implied by Mossong et al. (2008), but it's an upper bound for the size distribution of
families form ACS we use.



                                                     20
the Not employed), we need to rescale the number of contacts per day in each location. In
the ACS this fraction is 15 percent and therefore we calibrate that a young and occupied
agent (a schoolchild or a worker) receives 17.6 percent (100/85 percent) more contacts that
anyone in other locations. We allocate therefore the 11.2 contacts per day not occurring
at Home proportionally, 6 at School/Work and 5.2 in the City. We therefore calibrate the
contagion radius to match 5.2 contacts on average in the City, given its population. We
keep the same contagion radius in the School/Work locations, and calibrate the size of such
locations so as to generate 6 contacts, on average.22

Agent types and family composition
We use data from the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) to classify agents by type
and allocate them to households replicating the size and age distribution of American house-
holds. Specifically, we calculate from the ACS the distribution of family compositions by
Young/Old age of respondents not leaving in Group Quarters, and construct households of
sizes and Young/Old compositions replicating this distribution. The age cutoff for being
classified as Old is 65. We then create households of size 50 containing either only Young
or only Old individuals to replicate the fraction of Young and Old ACS respondents living
in group quarters (2.9 percent of Old and 2.4 percent of Young). In the 2018 ACS, ap-
proximately 16 percent of individuals are above 65 years of age. We divide the remaining
population to reflect the proportion of the population that are young and either employed
or in school, 65 percent, and define the rest, 19 percent, as Not employed. We randomly
assign all Young to a number of School/Work locations such that their average size is 100
individuals.

Infection and contact rates
We calibrate the contagion rate  and the mean travel distance µ to match the daily growth
rates of the dynamics of infections, gt , observed in the first 35 days of epidemics in Lombardy,
Italy; see Figure 8, left panel.23 We assume that contagion rates are twice as large at Home
locations than elsewhere and that Symptomatic individuals remain contagious at Home but
are not contagious elsewhere.
    We calibrate the daily fatality rates by type imposing that the Old have 10 times higher
fatality rates than the Young and scale their average so that the aggregate infection fatality
rate (IFR) is 1 percent, consistently with, e.g., Ferguson et al. (2020).
  22
     With a population of 26,600 individuals on a square of unit side, the contagion radius we obtain is
0.00805. With 100 agents at each School/Work location on a square, the side we obtain is 0.0547.
  23
     Since the number of infections is not observed, we match the growth rates of infection in the model
with the growth rate of deaths in the data. This is justified when, as we assumed, the case fatality rate is
constant and Death follows infection after a constant lag on average.

Figure 8: Growth rates of infections in simulation, fatalities in Lombardy, Italy


Transitions away and between the infected states, A, Y, D, R.
The probability to transition away from the Asymptomatic state A, is  +  . We assumed
agents are infective only in state A (we assumed that all sYmptomatic agents reduce to zero
                                                                                1
social contacts). The average time an agents stays in state A is then Tinf = +     . We set
 +  to match a theoretical moment which holds exactly at the initial condition in the basic
SIR model. Recall R0 denotes the number of agents a single infected agent at t = 0 infects,
on average. Let g0 denote the growth rate of the number of infected agents at t = 0. Then,
in SIR,
                                        (R0 - 1)
                                                 = g0 .                                 (2)
                                          Tinf
For the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, R0 is reasonably estimated between 2.5 and 3.5.24
The daily rate of growth of the infection g is estimated = .35 by Kaplan et al. (2020).25
This implies, from Equation (2), that Tinf is between 4 and 7 days (respectively for R0
between 2.5 and 3.5). Ferguson et al. (2020) use 6.5 days. We set  +  = .14, so that
           1       26 Furthermore, the average time from infection to death or recovery is
Tinf = +      = 7.
reasonably estimated to be 20 days; see e.g., Ferguson et al. (2020). Therefore we set  = .05
so that 1 = 20. This implies  = .09.
    The case-fatality rate, the probability of death if infected, is estimated between .005 and
.01; see e.g., Ferguson et al. (2020). Since agents remain sYmptomatic in the model, before
                          1
Recovering, on average      = 11 days, we set the probability of Death for a sYmptomatic,  ,
to be 0.001.  27

    We thank Gianluca Violante for suggesting this calibration strategy.

    We assume fatalities cannot occur to an agent less than 3 days before she becomes sYmptomatic and

Behavioral responses
We set  = 0.88 as estimated by Keppo et al. (2020) using Swine flu data, and assume people
start responding to the spread of the contagion very soon by setting I = 0.01. The fraction
of firms that choose to let workers work remotely is calibrated using the same functional
form (eqn. 1). We use the same calibration for  = 0.88, but we calibrate I so that the
fraction of school/workplaces that choose to shut down is 50 percent when the fraction of
Asymptomatics is 20 percent (close to the peak of the Asymptomatics curve in most of
our simulations28 ). We believe 50 percent to be a reasonable guess for the peak given that
24 percent of the population is reported by the 2018 ACS to be in school and that Alon
et al. (2020) compute from ATUS data that about 25 percent of workers work in highly
telecommutable jobs; see also Dingel and Neiman (2020), who report that the share of jobs
that can be done at home goes from 50 percent to 30 percent, across metropolitan areas in
the U.S.

Initial conditions
At time t = 0 we set 30 individuals in Asymptomatic state; all others are Susceptibles. the
Asymptomatics at t = 0 are those initially located in a position closest to City location
[x = 0.25, y = 0.25]. We assume they have been infected in the City. All others are
Susceptibles.




that every infected individual recovers with certainty after 100 days.
  28
     Solving (x/0.20)0.12 = 0.5 gives x = 0.00062, therefore we use this value
