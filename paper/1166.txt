          This paper illustrates the role for macroeconomic

policy coordination when interdependent economies are pur-

suing disinflationary policies. Under flexible exchange

rates, policy makers have an incentive to reduce inflation

by pursuing contractionary policies that yield a currency

appreciation. In a Nash, perfect foresight equilibrium,

policy authorities in the model pursue contractionary poli-

cies to achieve currency appreciation, but these attempts

cancel out, with the result that all countries end up pur-

suing excessively contractionary policies (relative to a

symmetric Pareto optimum). The paper presents these results

in a two—country, infinite—horizon difference game.

Introduction

          One of the major considerations in the original design of the

Bretton Woods system was the control of "beggarthyneIghbor" exchange rate

policies. As the post World War I gold—exchange standard disintegrated In

the 1930s under the weight of world deflation, several countries pursued

exchange rate devaluations in the hope of gaining competitive advantages

vIs——vis their trading partners. In the eyes of the Bretton Woods archi-

tects, these "competitive devaluations" contributed to the financial turbu-

lence of the 1930s and the breakdown of the world trading system. Henceforth,

countries' exchange rate policies were to be subject to international sur-

veillance, in part to prevent countries from gaining undue economic benefits

at the expence of others. This international control was enshrined In

Article IV of the International Monetary Fund Articles of Agreement.

          With the breakdown of the Bretton Woods par—value system in the

early 1970s, the problem of "beggar—thy—neighbor" exchange rate policies

have again come to the fore. But now there is a new twist. As concern

shifted from fighting unemployment to fighting Inflation, countries have

often pursued a policy of exchange rate appreciation as an anti—inflation

weapon. A rising exchange rate reduces import prices and hence domestic

inflation, with particularly large effects if domestic wages and prices

slow down in response to reduced import prices. Just as a competitive de-

preciation may work in part by exporting unemployment, a "competitive appre-

ciation" may work in part by exporting inflation, thus hindering inflation

control in other countries.

           The possibility of beggar—thy—neighbor exchange rate policy is not,

in itself, evidence of a structural problem in the world monetary system.         It

may be true for example that when one country's beggar—thy—neighbor policies

are counteracted by another's, both countries are left better of f than they
                                           1/
would be in the absence of the policy moves.— But as we know from tariff

wars, it is possible that both countries are left worse off, even when they

each react optimally to the other's policies.' A system of rules (or

"code of conduct") may well raise welfare in both countries above the levels

reached when each country acts in its narrow self—interest, taking the

others' policies as given. In technical terms, the cooperative outcome

may be Pareto superior to the Nash equilibrium in policies.

           The basic result has been known since the important work of Johnson

(1953) on tariff wars and Hamada (1974, 1976, and 1979) on monetary policy

under fixed exchange rates.       Johansen (1982) and Canzoneri and Gray (1982)

have applied the argument to the current policy environment, in which supply

shocks have worsened inflation and current account balances simultaneously

in many economies, causing many countries to pursue beggar_thy_neighbor

policies to reduce external deficits and Inflation.

               This note seeks to add two aspects to the Johansen and Canzoneri—

Gray papers: (1) a particular channel through which policy inefficiencies

may   arise;    and (2) an intertemporal illustration of the coordination problem.

On the first point, I stress the aim of policy makers in seeking a strong

exchange rate as an anti—inflation device. Each country pursues contrac—

tionary policies to strengthen the exchange rate.       The policies counteract
                                     —3—



each other; both countries end up with a contraction, but neither succeeds

in currency appreciation. The argument is used to illustrate why the supply

shocks of 1973 and 1979 in the environment of flexible rates have led to

excessive world contraction.

          On the second point, almost all illustrations of the problems of

exchange rate interaction and coordination have been static, or repeated one—

period games.   (In a very useful recent paper, Miller and Salmon (1983)

provide the general solution of the N—player infinite—horizon linear—quadra-

tic differential game, but they must resort to numerical simulation to solve

their example. I offer an analytical solution in this paper.) I show here

that the arguments about "competitive appreciationt' readily extend to a dyna-

mic context. This is a little bit surprising since Buiter and Miller (1982)

have pointed out that the inflation gains achieved by a real appreciation must

be "given back" at a later date, when the real appreciation unwinds. How-

ever, with utility quadratic in inflation and output, policy makers will

still choose to take a real appreciation early on when they are trying to

reduce a high initial rate of inflation.

          Section I presents a static model of competitive appreciation, and

Section II considers the dynamic extension. The models are highly stylized

to illustrate clearly the issues at hand; no attempt at generality is made.

Some extensions are suggested at the end of the paper.



I. A Static Model

          Consider two completely symmetrical economics. Each produces a
                                                     —4—



single final good that is an imperfect substitute for the other in final de-

mand. Let Q and Q* be total output in the home and foreign economies (with

"*"    signifying        foreign), and P and P* be output prices in national currencies.

E is the exchange rate, assumed to be floating, (and measured as the domestic

currency price of a unit of foreign exchange). For all variables, the lower-

case form will represent the logarithm of the upper—case counterpart (e.g.

q =   ln    Q ,    p =   in   P); and ""      will   signify change between periods (e.g.

      =      —



                  The basic assumption of the model is that domestic growth in ex-




                                              tt
cess of foreign growth leads to real exchange rate depreciation:


      (1)
                                      =              -       -    '>      °


Under this assumption, not only high levels of demand, but demand expansion
                                                                                           in
relative to one's trading partner, will have inflationary consequences

the short run. Equation (1) may be justified in several ways, as the basic

property is consistent with several models of international macroeconomics.

Most simply, we might suppose that the proportion of total world, demand spent

on domestic goods is a negative function of the relative price p_e_p* ,
                                                                        so

that (q_q*) =            D(*)        ,   where           is an elasticity of demand. Taking

first differences, we arrive at (1).                      It is possible, however, that domestic

fiscal policy (f) can shift the distribution of world demand, say towards

the home good, so that (1) would be modified to be


                                 *        D              *         *
                              (q—q ) —        (p—e—p      ) + f—f ).
                                                      —5—



Implicitly, (1) is more accurate for models in which variations in output

depend on monetary policy rather than fiscal policy.

               We will assume that each country produces its final output with

value added (price P) and a traded intermediate input (price n' such

that


   (2)                    =       a        + (l_a)


                       j3 =       a*       + (l_a)*


We will further assume that                    is a fixed markup over the wage, so that


   (3)                        =




The price of the intermediate input (e.g. oil) is assumed to be fixed in

terms    of   a basket of Q and Q*,            with   weights 0.5 each and real price s:


                              =        +
                                           0.5 + 0.5(+)

Also, since the intermediate input is a pure tradeable good,                     =    —



               The wage is assumed to be fully indexed to consumer prices

though with a one—period lag, and to respond as well to the level of demand

(as measured by q):


                          =
                              ci           +
                                                           —6—



Finally, consumer prices are taken to be a weighted average of home and

foreign final good prices:


    (6)
                                   =
                                                             t
                                                + (l—y) (* + at)

                                   =            +          (_a)
When (2) through (6) are combined, we arrive at an "inertial" Phillips

curve equation for each country:


     (7)
                           =             + iq       -
                                                         + [(l-a)/a] -   [(l-y)   + 0.5(1-a) /a]i



                           =             + iqt + [(l-a)/a]a +t [(1-1) + O.5(l_a)/a}lTt
                     c c1
             —        P
where      it =   p — e — p    .       We   see that a real appreciation at home (1T > 0) re-

duces inflation by reducing import prices of foreign final goods and the

intermediate input. The real appreciation raises foreign inflation, however,

to the extent that it lowers domestic inflation.

                  By substituting (1) in (7) we may rewrite (7) as



                           =
                               ci           +           + (i—)q1   —     + [(1_a)Ia]st


                           =                +           + (—)q_1 —       + [(l_a)/a]t
                       t           t—l


where =a[(l—y) + O.5(l—a)/aI. We will see that                              is a good measure of the

                                                                 When    = 0 there are no problems
 degree of interdependence in this model.

                                                         increases, coordination becomes more and
 of policy coordination, and as

 more important.
                                                    —7—



             Consider, now, the one—period model in which home and foreign

policy makers react to a supply shock,                      >   0.   We will assume that the goal

of policy is to minimize quadratic loss functions 2 in                         and


    (8)
                     2 =:             +q
                          =           +
                                           q2
In the symmetric cooperative outcome, q and q* are chosen to minimize the

simple average of         and 1*: 0.5(1 +           1*).     The solution to this problem will

be Pareto optimal. In the Nash, non—cooperative outcome q is chosen to

minimize Q, taking q* as given; and q* is chosen to minimize ,                       taking   q

as given. In general, the Nash non—cooperative outcome will not be Pareto

optimal.

             Assume that the shock occurs during a period of initial equili—

briuin,   with p      = p         =           = _1
                                                * = 0.
                   Ct1 c1
In that case we see from (7) that


                               [(l_a)/a] — [(1—i) + O.5(l_a)/a}Tr.


Domestic policy makers can reduce inflation in the period of the shock only

by inducing a real appreciation (7r >                0).     Similarly, foreign policy makers

can reduce         only by inducing             <   0.     Thus, a decrease in home inflation

comes at the expense of foreign inflation, and vice versa. By adding the

inflation equations we see clearly this negative tradeoff:


                     A        = — A*       + 2(1—a)/a As
                         Ct            t
                                                  —8—



           Because the only anti—inflation policy available in this one—period

model is beggar—thy—neighbor, the optimal cooperative policy is obvious.

Both countries should accept                  =   (l—a)/a    , and   fully accomodate the sup-

ply shock so that             =
                                   q = O.CtThe welfare loss in each country is then
held to    =        = fa/(l—a)
           If the policy—makers follow Nash, non—cooperative strategies, how-

ever, both countries will end up with lower levels of social welfare. They

will have the same inflation rate ex post, but accompanied by a loss in out-

put. The reason is clear. If the foreign country sets q = 0, the home

country has an incentive to set                   <   0,   thereby Inducing a real appreciation

and exporting inflation.

           To show this rigorously, we simply show that at the cooperative

equilibrium, dcI/dq >             0 (for q held fixed). In that case the home country
has a unilateral incentive to deviate from the cooperative solution.                       Note

that for a given q, domestic authorities know that a small reduction In

output,        <   0,   leads to a fall in domestic Inflation given by (7'):


                         d
The welfare effect of such a policy Is


                            d2 =
                                   (2c t ) d t + (2q)d =            (2c t +    2q)dq


Clearly,   for          >    0 and      =   0, d/dq > 0.
                                                                                 =   0.
            The Nash equilibrium is found when dQ/dq =                   d*/dq            Since the

countries are symmetric, both countries will arrive at the same choice of
                                            —9-.,




output, and if   will    equal zero. At the non—cooperative equilibrium, there-

           =
fore,
         c c = (1—a)/a              From the formula for dQ, we see that


   (9)              qflC
                           = — [(l—a)/a         <   °

                    q*nc     —   [(l—a)/a

           The conclusion is straightforward. In a static model in which in-

flation is reduced only by exporting it abroad, the cooperative solution is

to live with inflation and to stabilize output. If countries act unilaterally,

they will each try to export some of the inflation resulting from a supply

shock. Output will be reduced in both countries and the attempt to export

inflation will cancel out. Thus the Nash equilibrium leaves lower output and

unchanged inflation.

           Five remarks are in order. First, starting from a point of zero

                                                                     0 will lead to
inflation and        =
                         q1 = 0,    a negative supply shock      <


over—expansion and competitive depreciation, as each country tries to stabi-

lize a falling price level.

           Second, it is not important that the countries recognize the gaming

aspects of policy to arrive at the suboptitnal Nash equilibrium. The countries

need not be conscious of trying to reduce output relative to their counter-

part. What is required is that their "reduced—form estimates" of the infla-

tion unemployment tradeoff yield dPc /dq =

           Third,   the policy authorities need not see themselves as intention-

ally reducing q in order to raise if.        They may, more likely, see themselves
                                      — 10 —




                                                        contraction, with the
as operating directly on the exchange rate, via a money
"unfortunate" side—effect of a reduction in demand and output. The policy

actions under discussion are likely to be viewed as "exchange—rate policies"

rather than "output—policies."

            Fourth, if the economies were operating under a fixed exchange—rate

regime, they would likely not have the same freedom of action to pursue the

policies under discussion. For example, under a "dollar—standard", in which

the home country is free to set M, and the other country intervenes in the

foreign exchange market until M* is consistent with M and with the par value

of the exchange rate, we would have the case that when q is set, q* must be

set close to q.      It is easy to specify a model in which fixed exchange rates

force q =   q*,   so that the home monetary authority is led to select the co-

operative equilibrium.
            Finally, even if the authorities are more clever than Nash players,

                                                           is set according to the
and recognize that output growth in the other country
                                               sub—optiinallty of the non-
choice of output growth domestically, the

cooperative outcome will be maintained. Specifically, suppose that each

policy authority makes a conjecture of his counterpart's action. The home
                                                                         =
authority assumes q =             and the foreign authority assumes          p(q),
with p' < 1.      Then, the output equilibrium will be given as:

                         =   - [(l-a)/a ](l- p') <    0

The conjectural equilibrium leads to an output loss that is less than the

pure Nash case (qnc), but Is sub—optimal nonetheless. Bresnahan (1981) has

shown in the quadratic case that the conjectures can be made "rational" in

the sense that p' actually equals dq/dq, where the latter is the slope of

the foreign country's reaction function.




II. The Dynamic Model

          In this section 1 verify that the sub—optimality of the Nash

equilibrium carries over to a dynamic context. The dynamic model adds two

major points of realism. Most important, it allows for a lagged effect of

domestic output on home Inflation, that is Independent of the terms of trade

effect. There will now be two ways to reduce inflation: low domestic out-

put, and terms—of—trade improvement. Second, it makes explicit the fact

that the terms—of—trade effect represents a temporary gain that is reversed

along a complete adjustment path. A country that engineers a terms—of—trade

improvement is merely trading off an inflation gain today for an inflation

loss in the future, as the terms of trade return to original level. None-

theless, when faced with high initial rates of inflation (e.g. Inherited

from a supply shock), a country will want to make that inter—temporal trade—

of f. And for that reason, the non—cooperative equilibrium will still be

Pareto inefficient.

          Let us turn to the dynamic model. The price dynamics are still

given by (7'), as derived earlier. The social welfare functions are now
                                              — 12 —




written      as discounted sums of quadratic loss functions in q and             :
      (11)             U =       E(1+)       [()2 + q]

                             =       E(l+)   [(*)2 + qq*2]


               Pareto—optimal policies are given by pairs of sequences q } i—O,...,co
                                                                            —
                                                                                        i
and                     that minimize a weighted average of U and


                      mm             wU + (l_)U*       0 < w .. 1

                    {q} {q}

Given the symmetry of the model, we will continue to define the cooperative

equilibrium as the policy sequences that minimize O.5U + 0.5U*. In view of

the concavity of U and U* in q and q*, and in view of the symmetry of the

model, the cooperative equilibrium is characterized by q
                                                                         =
                                                                             q       for all t,

a fact which greatly simplifies our analysis.

               In the Nash, non—cooperative equilibrium, we suppose that the home

authority chooses {qnc} to miniml:e U, taking {q'} as given; while the

foreign policy maker chooses {q1 }             to   minimize U ,    taking   {q1 }    as given.

When we turn to the analytical solution to this problem we will find that

an equilibrium might not exist, if spillover effects (measured by )
                                                                                            are   too

large. We will restrict our attention to cases where an eqiilibrium in fact

exists.

               Let us turn first to the cooperative case. In light of the model's

symmetry (making q =             q) we see from (7') that:
                                 =        + t-l + [(1_a)/a1t
                                       — 13 —




Minimizing   O.5(U + U*) Is tantamount to minimizing U, subject to this infla—

tion equation. Details of the optimization are shown in Table 1. At time

zero, the entire future planned path of output is selected conditional on

c—l and the entire anticipated path of future             (For example, an anti-

cipation of a future supply shock causes output to be reduced today, so that

inherited inflation is low when the supply shock eventually occurs).

            The first order conditions lead to a 2 X 2 linear difference—

equation system in Pt and X, where        is the shadow welfare loss associated

with a one—percentage point increase In inherited inflation      (i.e. It

may be written as:

It   is easy to verify that this equation system is saddlepoint stable, since

there is exactly one elgenvalue of the transition matrix with absolute value

greater than l.0.-' Let the characteristic roots to the matrix in (12) be

Note that current inflation is a function of discounted values of future,

antIcIpated supply shocks, as well as lagged inflation.

               To take a simple case, suppose that a one—time rise in S occurs at

t=O, so that p          >   0, and that                 is equal to zero for all t>O. From (13)
                   CO
we see that the expression for inflation simplifies to:


                                      =
                                           v()C                 Vt ..   .
That   is, the optimal policy is to reduce inflation at a geometric rate,

given by v . Output is given by:

                                 =   -(l/)    (l-v)
                                                            ct)c
                                             — 16 —




Thus, output may be described as "leaning against the wind.t
          The calculation of the non—cooperative equilibrium is shown in

Table 2. As in the cooperative equilibrium, symmetry of the model ensures

that q= q*flC , and          =   0.    But while in the cooperative case the con-

straint Tr = 0 was substituted into the inflation equation before the con-

strained optimization was performed, in the Nash equilibrium each policy—

maker acts as if he can influence iT, even though Irt = 0 will result in

equilibrium. Once again the optimization problem yeilds a 2 X 2 linear—

difference—equation system, this time of the form:


   (14)                          l+iJi(i—)/                             [(l—a)/a}

             xt+l




                    with urn (l+o)t A = 0



Note that when      =   0, (14) reduces to the cooperative case in (12).
          For low values of ,          the   system in (14) displays saddlepoint stabil-

ity, with 0 < v < 1, and v > 1. The stable root is positive. For inter—

mediate values of 1, we again find saddlepoint stability, but now with

—l < flC < 0, and v > 1. For high values of , the system is globally

unstable, with nc < —1.               The unstable case, and the case —l < v < 0,

are not realistic or economically interesting (for v < 0, the economies

oscillate period to period between negative and positive inflation rates) so

where:


 nc    =   [2+(-)/]/2                  -                                               4$I]1I2/2

                  Once again, consider the case when                              = 0 for all t >             0,   and   >   0.
In Nash equilibrium, policy makers again reduce inflation at a constant geo-

metric rate, given now by v. Output is again "leaning against the wind"

than   in the non—cooperative case.       Once again, when countries act inde-

pendently, they race to be the first to contract when they have inherited a

high initial rate of inflation. It Is easy to show that v —
                                                                   v
precisely upon the potential gain from a terms—of—trade improvement, as
                                                                       depends



measured by 3. When this measure equals zero, v =
            c    nc
                                                         v   ; as this measure

increases, V1 — v1 increases.

             Since q =
                          —(l/iIJ)(l—v) c tand pct =   V Ct—1
we have that (for         = 0)



     (16)            q =     _(l/)(l_v)(v)t
Similarly,


     (17)            qnc =
                             _(l/)(l_v)(v)t            t.o
It   is easy to see that there exists a period T, such that for 0 < t < T,

O > q > q ; and for t> T, 0 > qnc > C Also, Jim qnc =
                                                                  q=   0.

             Thus, the non—cooperative policy involves larger output losses in

the adjustment process, and smaller output losses later on. The total loss

of output, measured as            is exactly the same in both cases.

            By construction, the cooperative solution is Pareto optimal, and

Pareto dominates the non—cooperative solution. By substituting the equations

III.   Conclusions


             We have illustrated in this paper that non—cooperative policy

making in a two—country model with flexible exchange rates is likely to

result in Pareto inefficient equilibria. In the specific, stylized model

under investigation here, the source of inefficiency is that each country

attempts to manipulate the exchange rate to its own advantage in fighting

inflation, though in equilibrium these attempts cancel Out and prove self—

defeating.

             Other papers, cited in the introduction, have investigated other

possible courses of inefficiency. One novelty of this paper is the exten-

sion of the policy game to an intertemporal environment.

             There are several extensions of this model that should prove

worthwhile. First, using equations (13) and (15), we could discuss the

possible inefficiencies in response to anticipated future changes in the

global environment. Second, we might usefully extend the model to non—

symmetrical cases, and consider the effects on equilibrium If one country

acts as a Stackelberg leader vis——vis the other. Third, we should spell

out the macroeconomic model with more care, to see whether the Introduction

of several policy instruments In each country could alter the basic effects

observed here. Fourth, we might imbed the two countries in a specific and

detailed institutional environment with respect to exchange rate rules, to

see how changes in global rules affects the efficiency of equilibrium (e.g.

compare a gold standard, dollar—exchange standard, and freely floating ex-

change regime). Finally, we might usefully introduce a stochastic structure
                                    — 22 —




to   see how the relative prevalence of various types of disturbances affects

the desirability of alternative "rules of the game."

1. In the Great Depression, for example, a series of "competitive devaluations"
in all countries could have raised the world money stock to the advantage of
all of the countries.

2. See the seminal contribution of H. Johnson (1953).

3. Let 0.    v. —   1, where v is a characteristic root of (12). According to
the characteristic equation for (12), 0. is a root of the equation:

                        -     +                        = o


By Descartes' law of signs, there are two values of 0., one positive and one
negative. Also, it is clear that the negative value of 0. must be —1 <     < 0,
                                                                                          0
since the equation may be rewritten as

                        -       -    (1   + 0.)        = 0


for which the LHS is always the positive for 0 < —1.                   Thus, since vi =
                                                                                          01
                                                                                               + 1,
there is one root v1 that is 0 <
                                           v < 1 (corresponding to —1 < 0 < 0) and
one root v. that is v1 > 1 (corresponding to Oi >                0).
4. The conditions on are derived as in footnote 3. Again, let 0 =                      v.     —1.

Then, 04 is a root of the equation


                        -[ +         -)/]0. -                +          =

Again, there is one change of sign, so that one value of 0 is positive and
the other is negative. The negative root is greater than —1 if and only if
  <      which we assume. The negative root is between —1 and —2 (inclusive)
if and only if /i .. 13 1 (4           2&         2),(2      3). Once we assume 13 <

then the v. corresponding to the negative 01 is between 0 and 1, and the v
corresponding to the positive O is greater than 1. We write:

                    0 <
                            nc <    1 <

5. From the definitions of v in (12) and v in (15), we see that v =

                                                                                     0 while             =
                                                                                                             v0.
when     =   0.   It is also true (see below) that                               <

Thus, for positive ,
    To show that v/t3 < 0,
                             v > v.first
                                      Also, it follows that (v —
                                         define
                                                                 v5/                                 >       0.



                       E =   [{ + [()/                     ]}2 +      42/ + 4/}1/2
so that v = [2 ++ p(p—)/]/2 — E/2

Then, by direct computation:

                                =
                                    —(ip/24)       1 +        [S —     pp—)/4I/      E}.


It is easy to show that [5 —            —)/]2/E2 <                    1,   so that             must be

negative.

6. In both the nc and c cases, an initial level of Inflation                                     is reduced

                                                 0).                   = 0 and       =
to zero over time (with lim
                        t-o
                                             =             For
                                                                                         q,   the inflation

rate is governed by




                        c+i
                              =I    t
                                         q.+           C



so that
                        t
                        E
                       i=0
                             =l/(c+i —                       Co
                                                                  )


Taking    limits of both sides,

                        CO

                               = .- /ijj.
                                        c0


Thus, the total amount of foregone output is set by the initial inflation rate.
The nc path and the c path entail an identical level of total output loss.
