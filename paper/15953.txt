Binge Drinking and Risky Sex among College Students

                                              ABSTRACT

This study examines the relationship between binge drinking and sexual behavior in nationally representative
data on age 18–24 four-year college students. For having sex, overall or without condoms, large and
significant positive associations are eliminated upon holding constant proxies for time-invariant sexual
activity and drinking preferences. However, strong relationships persist for sex with multiple recent
partners, overall and without condoms, even controlling for substance use, risk aversion, mental health,
sports participation, and sexual activity frequency. Promiscuity is unrelated with non-binge drinking
but even more strongly related with binge drinking on multiple occasions. Results from a rudimentary
instrumental variables strategy and accounting for whether sex is immediately preceded by alcohol
use suggest that binge drinking directly leads to risky sex. Some binge drinking-induced promiscuity
seems to occur among students, especially males, involved in long-term relationships. Effects are
concentrated among non-Hispanic whites and are not apparent for students in two-year schools.

1. Introduction

       This paper examines the relationship between sexual activity and binge drinking, defined

as having five or more drinks of alcohol consecutively or within a few hours. Anecdotal

evidence of complementarity between alcohol and sex, particularly between individuals who are

not long-term partners, is overwhelming. For instance, in the extract of the 1995 National

College Health Risk Behavior Survey (NCHRBS) analyzed here, 23% of four-year college

students who ever had sex admitted using alcohol or drugs before their last episode of sexual

intercourse. Given that past month use is reported by 71% of respondents for alcohol compared

with only 17% for marijuana, by far the most popular illegal drug, and some students separately

report using drugs in combination with drinking, it is likely that most of the reported pre-sex

substance use involves alcohol.

       Explanations abound for why alcohol consumption is associated with sexual encounters

that are unplanned and not accompanied by protection against pregnancy or sexually transmitted

disease (STD). Some who hope to find a sex partner might attend parties that serve alcohol, and

then partake, in order to mingle with those having similar preferences. Others might become

inebriated specifically to lose inhibitions and make themselves accessible for social interactions

potentially leading to sex. Or, certain types of people might simply be more likely to engage in

all sorts of risky behaviors, including both drunkenness and sex that is either outside of an

existing relationship or without normally-used protection against disease or pregnancy.

       This study investigates whether, alternatively, there is a direct pathway from alcohol

consumption to sex, which could plausibly occur via pharmacological effects of intoxication.

Because of compromised judgment or lowered inhibition, individuals under the influence of

alcohol might engage in sex that would not otherwise occur, or fail to use condoms or other birth




                                                 1
control. Information on whether drinking facilitates such “risky” sexual interactions is relevant

for alcohol policy. If drunkenness causes unplanned sexual encounters, an exogenous reduction

in binge drinking could diminish rates of STD infection and unwanted pregnancy.

       Specifically, the goal of this analysis is to ascertain whether the observed positive

correlation between binge drinking and various sexual behaviors is reasonably interpreted as a

causal effect of heavy alcohol use. As the next section describes, previous studies of individual-

level data on alcohol consumption and sexual activity have used one of three approaches to

address the possibility that at least some of this correlation might be spurious. However, all three

methods – instrumental variables (IV), individual fixed effects and functional form restrictions –

suffer from potentially severe limitations in this context. Furthermore, my data are cross-

sectional and lack geographic identifiers, eliminating the possibility of identifying effects using

IV as a primary strategy, or person-specific fixed effects at all.

       I therefore pursue the simpler approach of holding constant proxies for the precise

unobservables that might induce a non-causal association between drinking and sexual behavior,

namely preferences for alcohol consumption and sex. This tactic would seem subject to the

criticism that proxying for every unobservable that could potentially impact the relationship

between alcohol use and sexual activity is impossible. However, two opposing sets of results

from the study are highly suggestive. At one extreme, the relationships between binge drinking

and some less risky types of sex are eliminated by conditioning on fairly crude proxies for time-

invariant proclivities to engage in sex and alcohol consumption. At the other extreme,

controlling for more stringent sexual activity preference proxies, as well as many other behaviors

correlated with drinking and sexual activity, fails to eliminate relationships between binge

drinking and more risky types of sex. Along with results from an IV model that satisfies basic




                                                  2
validity criteria and specifications showing intensive margin effects of drinking, these results are

consistent with the possibility that binge drinking directly increases risky sexual behavior.

       Another contribution of this study is that it is the first in economics to focus on college

students, even though the potential for binge drinking to impact sexual activity is particularly

important among this demographic. In my sample of never-married four-year college students,

for instance, 46% of respondents binge drank in the past month. Even among those who did not

binge drink, 54% had sex in the past three months, and 12% of the sexually active had sex with

at least two different partners during that time. However, the corresponding percentages among

binge drinkers, 68% for any sex and 25% for multiple partners, are considerably higher.



2. Previous Literature

       Many studies in the social science literature, e.g. Hingson et al. (1990), Leigh & Stall

(1993), Cooper et al. (1994), Lowry et al. (1994), Donovan & McEwan (1995), Shrier et al.

(1997) and Staton et al. (1999), have observed that adolescent drinkers are more likely to be

sexually active and have more recent sexual partners, while those who drank before having sex

are more likely to not use a condom. Subsequent economics research has attempted to move

beyond simply describing these associations by specifically exploring whether alcohol use

directly increases sexual risk taking.

       One strategy for establishing causality has been to identify, in U.S. state panels, a reduced

form relationship between an outcome of unprotected sex, rates of either STDs or births, and a

policy that is known to influence alcohol consumption and was implemented at varying times

across states. In 1981–1995 data, Chesson et al. (2000) estimated that rates of gonorrhea and

syphilis were reduced by increases in alcohol taxes and the minimum legal drinking age




                                                 3
(MLDA). Dee (2001) showed in 1977–1992 data that MLDA increases lowered teen

childbearing, particularly among blacks. Using data from 1985, 1988, 1992 and 1996 on women

age 15–19, Sen (2003) estimated that beer taxes were related negatively to abortion rates, but

unrelated to birth rates. Carpenter (2005) found that zero tolerance drunk driving laws reduced

gonorrhea rates of 15–19 year old white males in 1981–2000 data. These studies control for

unobserved time- and state-specific spurious correlates by including fixed effects for years and

states (or in Sen (2003), regions), as well as state/region-level time trends. To establish the

connection between alcohol policies and outcomes of unprotected sex, however, one must rely

on evidence from separate research finding that more restrictive drinking policies directly reduce

alcohol consumption.

         Other economists have attempted to identify a direct causal effect of drinking on risky

sexual behavior using IV regression with data on individual teens and young adults. While all of

the following studies estimated large and significant positive relationships between alcohol use

and risky sex in single equation models, most found the relationship to be insignificant in IV

models. In data from the 1995 wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health

(Add Health), Rees et al. (2001) obtained an insignificant IV relationship between intoxication

and having sex, both overall and without contraception. Among participants in the National

Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 (NLSY97), Sen (2002) estimated positive IV coefficients

that are significant for any alcohol use but paradoxically smaller and often insignificant for binge

drinking.1 Using Add Health, Averett et al. (2004) revealed relationships, by race/ethnicity for

each gender, which are mostly insignificant though at times quantitatively large (and negative).

Their only significant effect, for any past year drinking among white males, is extremely big


1
  The explanation offered in the paper is that alcohol-induced reductions in judgment and inhibition leading to sex
take effect with 1–4 drinks, but once the 5-drink binge threshold is reached, individuals are too inebriated for sex.


                                                           4
(over 0.5 for any past year sex) and twice as large as the (insignificant) effect of past year

drunkenness. For respondents to both NLSY97 and Add Health, Grossman et al. (2004)

estimated relationships that are significantly negative, and sometime large, for both males and

females. Grossman et al. (2005) found that for both male and female high school students in the

1991–1999 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys, binge drinking did not impact having any sex or the

number of recent partners, but significantly reduced the use of condoms and any birth control by

much larger amounts than implied by OLS.

       Using the same data from Add Health and NLSY97, Rashad & Kaestner (2004) criticized

the identification strategies used by Rees et al. (2001) and Sen (2002), because in many

specifications one or both of the necessary conditions for instrument validity are violated. Some

instrument sets are not significant predictors of drinking, while significance of other sets was

inflated because standard errors were not clustered to account for varying only at the county or

state level. Making use of the fact that a bivariate probit is identified by nonlinearity, they

further pointed out that some instruments are significant when also included in the sexual

behavior regressions. Moreover, they showed that an analogous IV strategy fails a falsification

test by predicting large positive impacts of cigarette use on sexual intercourse, even though there

is no reason to believe that smoking causally influences sexual behavior.

       Even ignoring the oft-problematic issue of instrument exogeneity, which as Rashad &

Kaestner (2004) imply might be a concern in studies like Rees et al. (2001), Sen (2002) and

Averett et al. (2004) that rely on cross-sectional variation in relevant state policies, lack of

instrument strength is a clear threat to the identification strategies in this literature. Weak

instruments inflate standard errors, limiting the power to identify reasonably-sized effects.

Furthermore, the asymptotic bias of IV relative to OLS, where F is the F-statistic for joint




                                                   5
significance of the excluded instruments, is approximately [1 / (F – 1)] (Stock & Yogo, 2005).

This has lead to a rule of thumb that first stage F-statistics should be at least 10, implying a

relative IV bias of roughly 10% or less. In contrast, instrument F-statistics range from 3 to 5 in

Rees et al. (2001) and Averett et al. (2004), and 1 to 4 in Sen (2002) and Grossman et al. (2005).

       The analysis in Grossman et al. (2004), which estimated bivariate probits identified solely

by functional form, is immune from such criticism. They test the sensitivity of their results to

various pre-specified choices for the value of the correlation between the error terms in the sex

and drinking equations, but not their assumption that the bivariate probit model is correct.

       Given these issues, perhaps the strongest estimates in the literature are those of Grossman

et al. (2004) from person-specific fixed effects models. These are smaller than estimates from

the corresponding OLS models and usually larger for binge drinking than any alcohol use,

relationships that are expected but are often contradicted by the IV estimates in the literature.

Binge drinking increased the probability of both any sexual intercourse and risky sex, defined as

occurring without birth control at least 10% of the time, by between 7 and 9 percentage points in

the NLSY97, although analogous estimates for any sex were insignificant in Add Health data.

As the authors caution, however, fixed effects models do not control for time-varying omitted

factors that might induce spurious correlation between drinking and sexual behavior.



3. Data

       I analyze data from the National College Health Risk Behavior Survey (NCHRBS),

developed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and administered during the first half of

1995. As described in CDC (1997), the NCHRBS was designed to monitor college student

health-risk behaviors. Two-stage cluster sampling produced a nationally representative group of




                                                  6
college students aged 18 and over. From 16 strata with varying percentages of black and

Hispanic students, the first stage selected 148 institutions, half two-year and half four-year, with

probability proportional to undergraduate enrollment. The second stage randomly sampled

undergraduates in the 136 institutions that chose to participate, targeting 72 students from each

two-year school and 56 from each four-year school. The questionnaire was mailed to 7,442

students for self-administration and completed by 4,814.

        I drop 1,911 students age 25 and above, for whom only 10-year age ranges are known, or

with missing age; 169 students who are either graduate students or have class standing of “other”

(not freshman, sophomore, junior or senior) or missing; 184 students currently or previously

married, since unprotected sex within marriage is not considered socially “risky”; 216 students

missing information on current sexual behavior or alcohol use; and 331 students with missing

values of explanatory variables. Among the remaining 2,003 respondents, I focus the analysis on

the 1,272 students at the 67 four-year colleges in the survey. Students at two-year schools, for

whom I also show results later, differ along many dimensions potentially relevant for the

relationship in question. Most importantly, while 46% of four-year college students binge drink,

only 36% of two-year college students do so.2 The number of sample respondents from each

four-year college ranges from 4 to 45, but is less than 10 for only 4 of the 67 schools.

        Binge drinking is defined as having “five or more drinks of alcohol in a row, that is,

within a couple of hours,” and encompasses the past month. This does not take into account the

relatively recent NIAAA definition change, which lowered the number of drinks threshold for

women to four because of biological differences in rates of metabolizing alcohol. Using a strict

number of drinks to define a proxy for intoxication ignores variation in tolerance levels across

2
  Other possibly pertinent differences include full-time attendance (94% v. 76%), class standing (45% freshmen or
sophomores v. 82%), and living arrangements (43% university housing and 23% with parents v. 4% and 72%,
respectively), although these factors are among the many that are included as controls in the analysis.


                                                         7
students, although controls such as age, gender, bodyweight and age when first consumed

alcohol will partially account for this.

       The NCHRBS asks how many partners of each gender the respondent has had sexual

intercourse with in the past three months (oddly, since no other survey question uses this timing),

and whether the respondent or partner used a condom never, rarely, sometimes, most of the time

or always in the past month, or did not have sex during that time. From these, I construct four

binary indicators of sexual activity that serve as the primary dependent variables for the analysis:

whether the respondent had sex and had multiple partners, both overall and without always using

condoms. Since binge drinking in the past month cannot literally impact sexual behavior in the

preceding two months, the implied assumption is that binge drinking over the period one to three

months before the interview is similar to that in the past month.

       The mismatch in timing between condom use and sexual behavior means that the “sex

without condoms” variables might either understate or overstate the inherent riskiness of

corresponding sexual activity. A respondent who is recorded as always using a condom might

have had sex without a condom prior to the past month but within the past three months. In

contrast, a respondent categorized as having sex with multiple partners while not always using a

condom might have had one partner in the past month and at times not used a condom, but used a

condom in all previous encounters with a different partner. More generally, simply having sex,

even without always (or ever) using condoms, might convey very little risk of STD transmission

or unplanned pregnancy, particularly when occurring within a long-term monogamous

relationship and accompanied by use of the pill or another form of birth control. Robustness

checks, therefore, use alternate dependent variables that incorporate responses to an additional

question about specific birth control methods used during the last sexual encounter.




                                                 8
       Sexual behavior frequencies are reported in the headings to columns 2–5 of table 1. In

the preceding three months, three-fifths of students had sex, and one-ninth did so with at least

two partners. In each case, 65% of the sexually active failed to use a condom at least once in the

previous month. The first row of column 1 shows that, as mentioned previously, nearly 46% of

students binge drank at least once in the past month.



4. Results

       The empirical analysis consists primarily of linear probability, i.e. ordinary least squares

(OLS), models in which one of the sexual behavior indicators described above is regressed

against the binge drinking indicator and, except initially, a set of additional covariates.

Unreported statistical inferences and average marginal effects from logit and probit models are

similar. Standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity.



Baseline estimates

       Table 2 displays the main results of the analysis. Each cell contains the coefficient and,

in parentheses, absolute t-statistic for the binge drinking indicator in the regression of the sexual

behavior dependent variable in the row heading. Column 1 begins with a simple difference-in-

means estimator. Binge drinking significantly predicts all four types of sexual behaviors at the

1% level. Relative to sample means, binge drinkers are more likely to have sex by 25%, sex

without a condom by 20%, and multiple recent sex partners, both unconditionally and without

always using a condom, by 94%. As will be the case moving forward, these differences are

considerably larger for multiple partners than any sex. Although these estimates almost certainly

reflect at least some spurious correlation, they are useful to consider as a starting point.




                                                  9
       Each subsequent column of table 2 adds to the model a set of control variables, as

indicated in the lower panel. Table 1 lists the specific covariates included in each control set,

with means shown in column 1 and regression coefficients, from more fully saturated models in

column 8 of table 2 (for any sex) or column 2 of table 3 (for multiple partners), presented in

columns 2–5. The column 2 specification of table 2 includes school fixed effects. All binge

drinking coefficients grow in size and significance, suggesting that binge drinking is more

common in universities where sexual activity is less frequent. School indicators are highly

significant at this stage, but in the equations for any sex and multiple partners without a condom,

ultimately remain significant only at the 10% level upon inserting remaining covariates.

       Column 3 adds a vector of “exogenous” variables. These include not only a standard set

of predetermined demographic characteristics, but also some behavioral variables that seem

unlikely to directly affect the relationship between drinking and sex. As table 1 details, these

include indicators for age, gender, class standing, full-time enrollment, race and ethnicity,

residence type, work hours, health insurance coverage and parental schooling, along with

gender-specific quadratics in height and weight. Controlling for these variables has little impact

on the binge drinking coefficients. If anything, as with the school indicators, characteristics that

predict binge drinking are associated with less sexual activity.

       Table 1 shows that significant relationships between these factors and sexual behavior are

sparse and not uniform across dependent variables. Sex is less likely among males, freshmen

and students living with parents, and more likely among students working 10–39 hours/week, but

only the relationship for working 20–39 hours/week persists for sex without a condom. Sex with

multiple partners is more common among Asians, those with unknown maternal schooling

(suggesting less maternal involvement) and, for females, as bodyweight rises.




                                                 10
Proxying for sexual behavior & alcohol use preferences

        The covariates added in remaining table 2 specifications are intended to proxy for

specific forms of unobserved heterogeneity likely to contaminate the relationship between binge

drinking and sexual activity. I attempt to avoid controlling for behaviors occurring currently or

very recently, i.e. within the past month, that are possibly on the direct causal pathway from

alcohol use to sex. However, many variables reflecting choices occurring over the past year or

lifetime are included in order to hold constant relevant time-invariant preferences. If concurrent

behavioral choices drive variation in these measures, this strategy could, in principle, impart a

negative bias on the estimated binge drinking parameters. As it turns out, though, the few

regressors responsible for the substantive ensuing changes in the binge drinking coefficients are

defined to capture decisions made prior to the survey period. In contrast, regressors that

potentially pick up contemporaneous behaviors have relatively small effects on the estimates.

        Column 4 of table 2 expands the model by a single additional control, a set of indicators

for age at first sexual intercourse, which is recoded to current age for virgins. Table 1 reports

that 37% of respondents had sex by age 16, presumably before entering college. From

unreported cross-tabulations, at least another 33% had sex before turning their current age. Only

23% of the sample has never had sex.3 Columns 2–5 of table 1 show that, not surprisingly, age

at first intercourse is strongly associated with sexual behavior, but much more so for any sex

than multiple partners.

        Accordingly, controlling for age of first sexual episode has a much larger impact on the

binge drinking coefficient in the two equations for any sex than the two for multiple recent

partners. Binge drinking is still significant in the equation for any sex regardless of condom use,


3
 Many of the remaining 7% might have engaged in sex prior to the past three months. Among those who first had
sex after age 16, it is known only whether sexual initiation occurred in age range 17–18, 19–20 or 21–24 years old.


                                                        11
but its effect is reduced by two-thirds, to 10% of the sample mean. More dramatically, the entire

effect of binge drinking on any sex without always using a condom is eliminated. In contrast,

the decrease in the multiple recent partners binge drinking coefficients is only 20–30%.

Compared to the initial difference-in-means model, the impact of binge drinking is the same for

multiple partners and only 15% less for multiple partners while not always using a condom.4

         The next specification further controls for two additional measures of inherent proclivity

for risky sex, whether respondents have ever impregnated a partner or been pregnant themselves

and have ever been tested for HIV. Table 1 reveals that over 10% of respondents have been or

gotten someone pregnant at least once, while 30% have taken HIV tests and another 10% might

have but are unsure (or unwilling to report conclusively). These are crude proxies for risky sex,

as not all unplanned or unprotected sex leads to pregnancy, while reciprocally HIV infection can

result from other behaviors such as drug injection. Nonetheless, previous pregnancy is

significantly associated not only with having sex, but also with having more than one recent

partner. Although the former might imply “safe” sex within a monogamous relationship, the

latter obviously does not. Moreover, controlling for previous pregnancy and HIV testing, in

column 5 of table 2, reduces the binge drinking coefficient in the any sex equation by another

13% and renders it insignificant at 5%. Binge drinking effects in the multiple partners models,

however, are diminished by only about half as much proportionately, remaining large and highly

significant.

4
  The relationship between age at first intercourse and current sexual activity does not become deterministic via
setting age at first intercourse equal to current age for virgins. Of the 392 respondents for whom initiation and
current age are the same, i.e. those for whom current age falls within the sex initiation age category, 100 (26%) have
previously had sex and 77 (20%) have had sex in the past three months. Conversely, 22% of students who initiated
sex prior to their current ages also report not having sex in the past three months. Moreover, in the fully specified
models from column 8 of table 1, alternatively including a single indicator variable reflecting whether or not the
respondent has had sex before his or her current age, and doing the same for age at first drink, produces a negative
(though insignificant) effect on any sex and a larger negative (but still insignificant) effect on any sex without a
condom, but a very similar effect on multiple recent partners and a larger positive effect on multiple recent partners
without a condom.


                                                         12
       Next, to capture previously determined tastes for alcohol, age at first drink, again recoded

to current age for lifetime abstainers, is added as a control. Table 1 indicates that students

generally initiate drinking before sex: 57% tried alcohol by age 16, and another 25% drank by

age 18, with 81% of this latter group currently age 19 or older. Unreported cross-tabulations

show that 82% of respondents consumed alcohol before their current age, while only 11% had

never tried alcohol. Relative to the modal age 15–16 category, however, age at first drink age

has little significant impact on sexual activity, other than a negative effect of not initiating

alcohol until at least age 21 on sex without a condom.

       Still, in column 6 of table 2, the effect of binge drinking on having sex has shrunk by

another 27%, to about 6% of the sample mean, and become insignificant at 10%. The combined

result of adding the sexual behavior and drinking preference proxies, i.e. moving from column 3

to 6, suggests that the correlation between binge drinking and participation in sex, both overall

and without a condom, among college students stems largely from previous initiation of alcohol

use and sexual activity. A more complex temporal relationship between drinking and sex cannot

be ruled out, but current binge drinking could not initiate this causal pathway. In contrast, the

binge drinking coefficient has also declined in the multiple partners equations, but by only

another 10% or so compared with column 5, and significance at 1% is maintained.



Adding further unobserved heterogeneity controls

       Table 2 reports estimates from two additional specifications. The first controls for having

ever tried, regularly smoked, and attempted to quit smoking cigarettes, along with ever having

used marijuana, cocaine and any other illegal drug. These variables reflect earlier-formed

substance use preferences that might be correlated with current drinking preferences, as well as




                                                  13
complementary consumption of illegal drugs that might be the true cause of some drinking-

related sex. Alternatively, cigarette smoking in particular might reflect higher rates of future

discounting (Farrell & Fuchs, 1982), which could be correlated with binge drinking. Including

lifetime rather than current measures of substance use avoids holding constant mechanisms that

might lie along the causal pathway between contemporaneous drinking and sexual behavior.

       Table 1 shows that the only significant relationships between use of other substances and

sexual behavior is for previous smoking in the any sex equation, and previous cocaine use in the

any sex without a condom equation. Nonetheless, in table 2, holding constant previous

substance use further weakens (or makes more negative) the effect of binge drinking in all four

sexual behavior equations. The coefficient in the any sex model now has a t-statistic below 1,

and an impact of only 3% relative to the sample mean. Although the coefficients in the multiple

recent partners models are reduced by more than 10%, they remain large and highly significant.

       The final table 2 model attempts to control for several additional correlates of binge

drinking and sexual risk-taking. Seat belt use frequency serves as a proxy for risk preference;

Anderson & Mellor (2008) found that risk aversion significantly predicts both more seat belt use

and less heavy drinking. Because substance use, including heavy drinking, often co-occurs with

psychological disorders, I control for two indicators of depression, having considered and

planned a suicide attempt, along with self-described bodyweight relative to ideal. Having

already held constant height and weight (and age and gender), considering oneself under- or

overweight might reflect self-esteem deficiencies. Also, sports participation might lead to

situations in which both alcohol and interactions with members of the opposite sex are available,

possibly spuriously correlating the two.

       In table 1, less risk-averse students are more likely to participate in sex, but significant




                                                 14
relationships with individual indicators are neither consistent across specifications nor systematic

in the direction from never to often using seat belts. Planning suicide increases multiple partner

sex, but decreases sex without a condom. A large negative relationship between considering

oneself very overweight and the likelihood of sexual activity is not significant for sex without a

condom, and also is evident for being only slightly overweight in the any sex equation.

Considering suicide and playing sports do not enter significantly. Accordingly, in table 2,

positive binge drinking effects are further diminished, but by relatively small magnitudes.

        At this point, I conclude that binge drinking does not directly increase the propensity to

have sex. Although the sample size limits identification power, the column 8 coefficient in the

any sex equation is very small in an absolute sense, representing 1.7% of an increase in the mean

likelihood of having sex. The insignificant effect of binge drinking on any sex without a

condom, and smaller effect on multiple partners without a condom than unconditionally, also

suggests that binge drinking does not reduce protective behavior. Because the negative effect on

any sex without always using a condom seems odd, particularly as it would be statistically

significant in a moderately larger sample, I further investigate use of condoms and other forms of

birth control in table 5.

        The large and significant positive coefficients in the two equations for sex with multiple

recent partners are consistent with binge drinking directly increasing sexual promiscuity.

However, inserting additional controls in table 2 diminished these coefficients, and by column 8,

the impact on multiple partners without always using a condom is no longer significant at 1%.

Thus, I continue to probe these relationships below.




                                                 15
Robustness checks

        Table 3 begins, in column 1, by showing standard errors adjusted for correlation of error

terms among students from the same school. In principle, this reduces the available degrees of

freedom to the number of schools, so should not be used when school indicators are already held

constant. Still, it is reassuring that clustering actually slightly reduces the standard errors.

        The remainder of table 3 further tests for causation in three different ways. First, column

2 adds a strong control for preferences towards sexual activity, the number of times respondents

had sex in the past month. Not surprisingly, table 1 shows a significant association between

having sex in the past month and having at least two partners in the past three months, even

holding constant the previously introduced covariates, although some students who abstained in

the past month (1.2%) still had multiple partners in the two preceding months (and 15% had sex

during that time). The pattern of coefficients, though, shows a perhaps unexpected relationship.

Students having past month sex infrequently, especially just once, are most likely to have

multiple partners, presumably via “one-night stands,” whereas those having sex at least 20 times

in the past month are not statistically more likely to have multiple partners than those who did

not have past month sex. Below I further investigate a prospective implication of this result for

estimated relationships between binge drinking and birth control use.

        Despite the large impact of past month sex frequency, the effects of binge drinking on

having multiple recent sex partners remain virtually unchanged in column 2 of table 3. As a

result, I keep the number of sex episodes indicators in the regressions for most remaining

specifications. In this model, relative to sample means, binge drinking raises the likelihood of

multiple partners, unconditionally and without always using a condom, by 62% and 51%,

respectively, with significance at 1% in the former case and 5% in the latter.




                                                  16
       Columns 3 and 4 of table 3 exploit information on drinking without binging and number

of binge drinking episodes, both also during the previous month: 28% of students drank but did

not binge, while 35% of students, i.e. 78% of binge drinkers, had at least two episodes of binge

drinking. If intoxication is the mechanism by which drinking causes risky sex, non-binge

drinking should have an effect that is negligible (although not necessarily zero, as for some

people inebriation may occur before five drinks). In column 3, I add an indicator of drinking

without binging, based on separate information about whether respondents drank at all in the past

month. Students who reported drinking, but not binging, are coded as non-binge alcohol users,

while binge drinkers and non-drinkers are both coded as not having used alcohol without

binging. As expected, non-binge alcohol use has effectively no relationship with having multiple

sex partners. The effect of binge drinking is slightly altered, as the control group is now non-

drinkers rather than all students who did not binge drink, but virtually the same, although

standard errors have risen.

       Column 4 goes one additional step, recoding the original binge drinking indicator to zero

for everyone except those who binge drank exactly once in the past month, and adding a separate

indicator reflecting binge drinking at least twice during that time. The logic is that causation

should imply an effect on the intensive margin, i.e. more binge drinking episodes should create

more chances for risky sex to occur. Indeed, the impacts of multiple-occasion binge drinking are

even larger, relative to not drinking at all, than were those of any binge drinking.



Instrumental variables

       Column 5 of table 3 reports the third check on causation, a rudimentary instrumental

variables model. The strategy is motivated by the results of adding the six substance use




                                                 17
variables to the regressions in table 1. Specifically, in columns 4 and 5, none are individually

significant, even at the 20% level, in either of the multiple partners equations. The F-statistics in

table 3 show that they are also jointly insignificant. Thus, I specify these variables as

instruments in a two-stage GMM model. The first stage regresses binge drinking on all the

controls, while the second stage re-runs the regression from column 2 of table 3 with the

substance use measures excluded and binge drinking predicted from the first stage in place of

observed binge drinking (using an efficient weighting matrix, which distinguishes GMM from

two-stage least squares). This strategy is not necessarily ideal because as described earlier,

substance use is potentially correlated with risky sex through preferences related to time and risk.

Controlling for the age of alcohol initiation, though, might mediate any such correlation.5

         The first stage F-statistic for the instruments is 12.52, larger than the Stock & Yogo

(2005) critical values corresponding to 10% maximal bias of IV relative to OLS and 20%

maximal bias relative to the IV estimate magnitude, which are 11.12 and 11.72, respectively.

Not shown is that all six substance use instruments have the expected sign in the binge drinking

regression. Significance levels are 1% for previous cigarette and marijuana use, 5% for previous

use of other drugs and 10% for having regularly smoked cigarettes.

         For unconditional multiple sex partners, the IV coefficient of .167 is significant at 5%

and more than twice the size of the OLS coefficient from column 2. However, the p-value of the

formal test for endogeneity is .269. This insignificant difference between IV and OLS implies

the more efficient OLS estimate should be used, and the fact that the IV estimate is larger



5
  In contrast, columns 2 and 3 of table 1 show that several substance use coefficients have or are approaching
significance in the any sex equations. Moreover, the substance use variables are jointly significant in these
equations, meaning they are unlikely to be exogenous as instruments for binge drinking. Not surprisingly, the IV
coefficients in the any sex equations are much larger than in column 8 of table 1, which is counterintuitive and
almost certainly due to the substance use instruments having a separate positive correlation with having sex, with or
without a condom, outside of the pathway from binge drinking to sex.


                                                         18
supports the interpretation of the OLS estimate as a causal effect of binge drinking. In the sex

with multiple partners without a condom equation, the IV coefficient is slightly smaller than the

corresponding OLS coefficient, although the difference clearly is highly insignificant, again

implying that OLS is consistent. Though insignificant, the IV estimate is quantitatively large,

i.e. 43% of the sample mean.

         The IV estimates also illustrate why it is difficult to draw inferences from instrumental

variables models in this literature, at least without much bigger samples. Unlike IV models from

previous studies, first stage instrument strength is sufficient to avoid appreciable bias from weak

instruments. Yet, the IV coefficient standard errors are much too large, i.e. 70–90% of the

corresponding sexual activity sample means, to identify reasonable-sized effects.



Does binge drinking directly precede risky sex?

         For binge drinking to truly cause risky sex, it must be directly initiating sexual contact by

occurring just before intercourse. Table 4 investigates the evidence for this timing by examining

the connection between binge drinking, sex with multiple recent partners, and a separate

variable, reported in the introduction, on whether respondents drank or used drugs before the last

time they had sex. Samples are restricted to the 766 respondents who had past three month sex.

         Columns 1 and 4 begin by re-estimating the preferred specification, from column 2 of

table 3.6 Not surprisingly, given the lack of effect on overall sexual activity, coefficient

significance and size relative to sample means, 65% overall and 49% for without a condom,

remain about the same even conditional on being sexually active. The implication is that the

effect of binge drinking on sexual behavior is primarily to increase promiscuity among students

6
  Degrees of freedom are insufficient for estimating the effect of binge drinking on condom use among the 141
students who had multiple recent partners or, later in the table, the 159 sexually active respondents who drank or
used drugs before their last episode of intercourse.


                                                         19
who would be sexually active regardless. Because some of this activity would have occurred

without a condom anyway, the net effect is to also increase unprotected sex among those who

have multiple partners, even though there is no apparent direct impact on protective behavior.

       Columns 2 and 5 insert into the regression an indicator for drinking or using drugs before

the last episode of sex, which occurred among 18% of students overall (table 1) and 21% of

students who had sex in the past three months. The large positive coefficients are expected, but

do reaffirm the connection between drinking & promiscuity, and provide evidence that relevant

alcohol use occurs directly before sex. Moreover, the binge drinking coefficient falls by 23%

and 36% in the overall and without condom equations, respectively, losing significance in the

latter case. This suggests that at least some of the binge drinking that the regressions link to

promiscuity is leading directly to the risky sex itself. When the sample is further restricted to the

607 respondents who report no alcohol or drug use before their last sexual encounter, binge

drinking effects are reduced even more, by 37% in column 3 and 47% in column 6. Because the

“substance use before sex” variable encompasses only the last sexual episode, though, it makes

sense that the binge drinking coefficient would remain sizable.

       Column 7 re-runs the regression in columns 1 and 4, with the indicator of using alcohol

or drugs before sex as the dependent variable. Again, although not surprising, it is reassuring

that the binge drinking coefficient is large, 82% of the sample mean, and highly significant.



Past month & other birth control behavior

       Table 5 returns to the issue of protection. The first four columns investigate sex and

condom use over the last month, which matches the time frame encompassed by binge drinking.

Columns 1 and 2 re-estimate the regressions in the top two rows of table 2, column 8, for having




                                                 20
sex in the past month. Results are quite similar, providing some validation for drawing

inferences about past three month sexual activity even though the condom use and drinking

variables reflect only past month behavior.

         In column 3, I look at a different margin of condom use, that of never rather than simply

not always doing so. As the headings of columns 1–3 imply, 72% of students sexually active in

the past month did not use a condom at least once, but only 43% never used one. The effect of

binge drinking is again counterintuitively negative, although still insignificant and smaller than

in column 2. Among just the 684 students who had sex in the past month, column 4 investigates

how often condoms were used during sex, where “never,” “rarely,” “sometimes,” “most of the

time” and “always” are recoded to fractions in increments of 0.25 from zero to one, respectively.

Results are similar to column 2; binge drinking actually increases the fraction of episodes

involving a condom by 13% at the sample mean, albeit insignificantly.

         The condom use results in tables 2, 3 and 5 consistently suggest that binge drinking does

not decrease efforts to protect against STDs & unwanted pregnancies. However, among partners

in a monogamous relationship, sex without a condom is not necessarily risky. If partners know

they are not infected with an STD and are having sex only with each other, so that the primary

reason for birth control is to prevent pregnancy, the pill might be the method of choice. In that

sense, using no birth control at all, which involves at least as much disease risk as not using a

condom for sex with a partner with unknown STD status and more pregnancy risk even for

monogamous partners, might be a more appropriate indicator of sexual risk-taking.7

         Columns 5–8 thus examine the use of no birth control and the pill the most recent time

the respondent had sex, reverting to the sample of 766 students who were sexually active in the


7
  Long-term partners might be trying to conceive a child, although not with a current spouse since all sample
respondents are unmarried.


                                                         21
past three months. In columns 5–6, the coefficient for binge drinking in the sex without birth

control regressions do not provide much information. Effects are large relative to the low

proportions of students who do not use birth control, especially in conjunction with multiple

recent partners, and positive in the latter case, but highly insignificant. Binge drinking also has

virtually no impact on using the pill, especially relative to the nearly half of the sample that does

so. However, binge drinking is associated with a significantly higher likelihood, 57%, of using

the pill while also having multiple recent partners.

       This last result might explain the unexpected positive relationship between binge

drinking and condom use. It could be that those who do not use condoms are particularly likely

to be in a monogamous relationship in which no protection against STD transmission is needed,

and the pill is used to prevent pregnancy. If sex is more likely among those in relationships than

not, the fact that binge drinkers are less likely, though not quite significantly, to have sex without

a condom might simply mark a weak association between binge drinking and not being in a

stable relationship. Interestingly, binge drinkers being more likely to have multiple recent

partners, which evidently involves less condom and more pill use, would then imply that some

binge drinking-induced promiscuity represents students who are cheating on their long-term

partners. The effect of binge drinking on having multiple partners and also using the pill, i.e. the

specification in column 8 of table 5, is particularly strong for males (.127, t = 2.15), while also

positive (.024) but insignificant for females.



Stratified samples

       Table 6 begins, in panel A, by showing that there are no comparable promiscuity effects

of binge drinking among NCHRBS two-year college students. Unreported results reveal that this




                                                 22
lack of effect is not explained by two-year students having higher propensities to be part-time:

coefficients remain slightly negative among full-time students, who still compose 76% of the

two-year sample. Similarly, among the 72% of two-year students who live with parents, binge

drinking coefficients are actually positive, although still less than half the size of those for four-

year students and insignificant. In panel B, binge drinking effects are actually slightly smaller,

though still significant, among the vast majority of the four-year sample that attends full-time.

       The remainder of table 6 shows results for samples split along the dimensions indicated

in the row headings. Perhaps surprisingly, binge drinking coefficients are larger for students of

legal drinking age but exhibit minimal difference by gender. Effects are large among non-

Hispanic whites, especially for multiple partners without a condom, but insignificant among

others. This contradicts Dee (2001), which finds more MLDA responsiveness for teen

childbearing among blacks than whites. Whether alcohol or sex was initiated at an age that

clearly precedes college entrance has no impact on the coefficients in the unconditional equation.

However, binge drinking has a larger association (but not necessarily more significant, because

of sample size) with promiscuity accompanied by not always using a condom among early

initiators of each activity. As anticipated, living with parents dampens the impact of binge

drinking on sex with multiple partners, especially without respect to condom use, while effects

are more substantial among those who have had a previous HIV test, do not always use a seatbelt

and play sports. Less expected is that among students who have ever tried cigarettes,

coefficients are largest among those who have previously tried to quit. This could simply mean

that many ever-smokers who do not currently smoke have never used cigarettes regularly enough

to necessitate “quitting.”




                                                  23
5. Conclusion

       The results of the analysis suggest that the observed relationship between binge drinking

and participation in sex is the product of spurious correlation with other characteristics that are

difficult to measure. Specifically, whether students have previously had sex, and to a lesser

extent consumed alcohol, is seemingly a much more important determinant of being sexually

active than is current binge drinking. However, the positive binge drinking coefficient persists

for sex with multiple recent partners, both overall and not always using condoms, when the

covariate set is extended to include a multitude of potentially correlated behaviors. This

conclusion holds even when controlling for number of recent sex episodes and in an empirically

defensible IV model. Consistent with a prospective causal effect of binge drinking, non-binge

alcohol use has no effect on promiscuity, while binge drinking on multiple occasions has a

particularly strong effect. Furthermore, the estimated relationship is connected with reports of

using alcohol or drugs prior to the most recent sexual encounter.

       The main limitation, of course, is that it is impossible to know for sure that the control set

accounts for all unobservable factors inducing spurious correlation between sexual behavior and

binge drinking. Thus, we cannot be certain that binge drinking causally increases promiscuity.

Nonetheless, binge drinkers are clearly more likely to have sex with multiple partners within a

relatively short time period, separately from various factors related to previously established

attitudes regarding sex and drinking. Low power to identify even large effects is another

limitation, as the standard errors in the preferred multiple partners equations specifications are

roughly 20% of the corresponding sexual behavior sample frequencies. Yet, this feature of the

data in a sense strengthens the argument for a direct effect of binge drinking, given that its

estimated impact on sex with multiple partners still manages to attain statistical significance.




                                                 24
       Because many regressors are defined for the past year or lifetime, and these longer

periods still encompass current behavior, the possibility remains that the identification strategy

biases the binge drinking coefficients negatively by controlling for behaviors that are on the

causal pathway from drinking to sexual activity. Consequently, my empirical approach might be

better viewed as a relatively strong test for potential causality, rather than a way to obtain the

least-biased point estimates of the relationship between binge drinking and sexual activity.

       An important implication is that policies reducing binge drinking among college students

have the potential to convey the positive external benefit of decreasing disease transmission and

unwanted pregnancies that can result from risky sex. This, of course, does not imply that such

policies exist, or that any loss in utility accompanying the resulting behavioral changes would

not outweigh the social benefits. Moreover, even if restrictive campus alcohol policies decrease

adverse consequences of risky sex, the harm from moving alcohol consumption to off-campus

locations might offset any corresponding benefit.

       An obvious extension of this study is to pursue the same strategy in a larger data set. In

particular, the Harvard College Alcohol Study collected nationally representative data on over

40,000 four-year college undergraduates on four occasions during 1993–2001. It contains the

same type of information examined here, and in fact has many additional measures of drinking

propensity that might be used to control even more strictly for unobserved heterogeneity, but is

considerably larger. These data would seemingly allow for an even stronger test of causation

between binge drinking and risky sexual behavior with considerably more power to detect small

effects. Furthermore, the additional sample size would presumably make it possible to examine

condom use in a sample of students with multiple partners, thus enabling further disaggregation

of effects on promiscuity from those on protection against pregnancy and STDs.

The sample size is 1,272. Regression estimates correspond to table 2, column 8 in columns 2–3, and table 3, column 2 in columns 4–5. Parentheses contain
standard deviations for non-binary controls (height and weight) in column 1, and absolute heteroskedasticity-robust t-statistics in columns 2–5. Demeaned height
and weight (and their squares) enter the regressions. Brackets in row headings contain sexual behavior dependent variable frequencies.

Each column represents a separate OLS regression of the sexual activity from the “Dependent Variable” column on the drinking indicators listed in the
“Coefficient/statistic” column and the full set of controls from column 8 of table 2. Parentheses contain absolute t-statistics and square brackets contain F-
statistic p-values, both robust to heteroskedasticity. Curved brackets contain frequencies of non-binge alcohol use and multiple-occasion binge drinking. In
column 4, the binge drinking indicator is recoded to zero for respondents who binge drink on 2+ days. The sample size is 1,272.
