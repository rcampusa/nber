                       Changing Balance Sheet Relationships In
                       The U.S. Manufacturing Sector, 1926 — 77



                                      ABSTRACT



     This paper documents trends in the sources and uses of funds, market
valuations, and rates of return for a sample of U.S. manufacturing firms
during the half—century ending in 1977. The major objective of the paper
is to construct economic balance sheet relationships based on securities
market valuations rather than on the more familiar book values used
for accounting purposes.
     Among the more interesting long—term trends highlighted in the
analysisis the finding that the widely recognized increase in debt in
manufacturing firms' capitalization has come primarily at the expense of
.preferred   stock. A second interesting point is the contrast between the
sharp fall in common equity values in 1929—32, which was entirely reversed
by 1936, and the even sharper post—1968 decline which was not reversed
by 1977 nor, for that matter, by 1981.
     This paper is an introduction to a more comprehensive study which
will be part of the second stage of the Debt/Equity Research Project.

     Several aspects of the recent performance of U.S. non-
financial corporations have attracted widespread attention.
Since the inid-1960s there has been a dramatic decline in the
securities markets' valuation of these firms relative to the

replacement costs of their assets, and also relative to the

returns generated by these assets.1 At the same time, nonfin-
ancial corporate businesses have become more reliant on debt
securities in financing their growth.2 The inflationary en—

vironnient of the past fifteen years has provided a powerful

incentive for those with taxable incomes to increase their

indebtedness. Additionally, as Friedman [3] points out, the
postwar trend away from internal sources of funds toward debt

financing represents, at least partially, an adjustment to-
ward more normal pre-depression debt levels.

     To place these issues in perspective, this paper documents
trends in the sources and uses of funds, market valuations,
and rates of return for a small sample of manufacturing corp-
orations over the 1926 - 77 period. The emphasis of the study

is on the detailed market valuations of the firms' securities.

There are several advantages to this sampling approach. First,

a consistent set of aggregate balance sheet and income accounts

is unavailable for the prewar period. Also, by working at the
individual firm level, one can obtain accurate information on
the market values of traded securities and more detailed

information on the structure of firms' balance sheets than is
                            —2—



    typically available at the aggregate level. While the purpose
    of this paper is only to describe the aggregate characteristics
    of this sample, future research will use the underlying micro
    data set to test specific hypotheses regarding firm financing

    and investment decisions, and the financial markets' valuation
 of these activities.

        The sample of firms used in this study is actually com-

posed of nine separate subsamples of firms drawn periodically
from various editions of Moody's Industra1 Manual.        The comp-
osition of this sample is outlined in Table 1. The goal was to
obtain subsarnples of size 50 but, given our criteria regarding

reporting and accounting procedures, this was not always poss-
ible. This procedure of using subsamples of firms has the ad-
vantage of admitting to the sample firms that were created
or destroyed during the 1926-77 period but presents some prob-
lems in maintaing continuity.

        While fifty items relating to the income account,balance
sheet and market valuations of the firms are included in the
database, a substantial amount of aggregation is performed to

present the general characteristics of the sample. Accordingly,
the balance sheets of the sample firms are consolidated as

described in Table 2. For each firm, variables of interest
—   — such as new debt or eguity issues, for instance —   - are
                             —3—




measured relative to net assets. Then firm data are averaged
for each year to provide a time series for a hypothetical
firm with the mean characteristics of its subsample   .   Table   3

shows the results of performing such calculations on the com-
ponents of net assets for the overlapping years of the sub—

samples as well as for the years 1926-27 and the years 1976-77.

     An interesting feature of the results presented in Table 3
is the rather dramatic decline in the Cash Items variable

which is composed mainly of cash and short—term marketable

securities. Considered in conjunction with the recent increase
in the role of debt in corporate capital structure, the decline

is even more striking. Closer inspection indicates that, at
least since the mid—l960s the fall in the share of Cash Items

in net assets has been accompanied by an increase in the share

of physical capital. The drastic jump in Current Liabilities
in 1941 is due primarily to increased corporate taxation.

Sources and Uses of Funds.

     Figure 1 illustrates the relative importance of external
and internal funds in financing our 'average' firm, while
Figure 2 depicts the role of debt among external sources of

finance. In both figures, the large spikes appearing above
the years. 1937, 1941, 1947, 1951, 1956, and 1974 coincide with

periods of unusual inventory accumulation and apparently rep-
resent a demand for external funds to finance unplanned invent-

ories. However, this is not true of the broad spike that appears
                          —4--




 above the years 1965-68. During this period there was an un-
 usually large demand for funds for capital expenditures and
 for takeovers.3

      To highlight the longer run trends, data on sources and
uses of funds have been averaged over the individual years of

 the subsamples and the results are presented in Table 4. Acc-

ording to these results, net issues of debt securities remain-
ed quite constant from the 1936-41 period to the mid-1960s
when a large shift toward external sources of funds occurred.

In fact, the percentage of total sources accounted for by net
debt issues since 1965 is about twenty, slightly more than

double the pre-1965 percentage. The results of Table 4 also
clearly illustrate the increased demand for funds to finance
nonfinancial acticities that occurred since the mid-l960s.
Virtually all of the jump in total uses is accounted for by

increased expenditures on physical assets. The gradual trend

toward external, relative to internal, sources of funds dur-
ing the earlier postwar years reflects primarily a decline
in undistributed profits relative to net assets.

     Several features of the 1927-30 and 1931-35 periods

require comment. First, during 1927-30 there were virtually
no no retirements of common stock and the —0.8 figure under
stock retirementsis solely due to retirements of preferred
stock. Net issues of common equity were negligible except
for the years l928 and 1929. Furthermore, the Plant/Equip-
                         —5—



ment numbers for years prior to 1935 were estimated as deprec-
iation allowances plus the change in net property account and
are thus not comparable to the figures presented for later

years. This latter feature of the aata accounts for the rel-

atively large discrepancy between total uses and sources for
1927-30. Also, the relatively low number for undistributed
profits for the 1927-30 period, 2.8 percent of net assets,
is not indicative of low profitability as seventy percent of
funds available for common were paid out as dividends.

Market Valuations.

     Securities markets provide a continuing valuation of
corporations and their earnings streams and, therefore, in-
directly of their net assets. This section of the paper invest-
igates how these market valuations have behaved, relative to
net assets, over the 1926—77 period.

     Figure 3 plots the ratio of the market value of securities
to net assets for each of the nine overlapping subsamples. In

addition the diagram also indicates the composition of the
total ratio. For instance, the distance between the horizontal
axis and the first broken line represents the market valuation

of debt securities relative to net assets. To assist in inter—

preting the figure, Table 5 provides the average values for

the overlapping years of the subsarnples, as well as for 1926-27
and l976—77.
     Both Table 5 and Figure 3 clearly indicate the increasing
                            —6—




 importance of debt in the capital structure of our 'average'

 corporation. What is somewhat surprising is that the sum    of
debt and preferred stock, relative to net assets, has remained
virtually constant over the entire fifty year period, suggest-
ing that the increase in debt has come primarily at the ex—
pense of preferred stock.

     Another feature of Figure 3 which clearly stands out is
the sharp fall and subsequent rapid recovery of the common
equity component of the ratio during the 1930-34 period. This
is even more dramatic when one considers that capital goods

prices were falling and, thus, reducing net assets and moving
the ratio in the opposite direction.

     Figure 3 also plainly shows the substantial decline in
equity values that began in 1968. This slide in the ratio of

the market value of equity relative to net assets is steeper

and more prolonged than any previous decline illustrated in
the diagram.

Rates of Return.

     This section of the paper presents calculations of several
measures of the returns experienced by firms in the sample.
Figure 4 compares the rate of return on common stockholders'
equity with the total rate of return on net assets. In com-

puting both rates, an adjustment is made to put depreciation

charges on a replacement, basis. Stockholders' equity is defined
                            —7—




here as net assets minus the market values of debt and prefer-
red stock.5 An inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) is not
included in the numbers in Figure 4 as, to date, the data-

base only contains sufficient information to compute the IVA

for the years since 1960. However, an IVA is included in Table 6

which compares various rates of return computed for the 1961—70

and 1971—77 periods. Coupled with the information presented in
Figure 3 and Table 5, these results confirm the significant
decline which has recently occurred in the securities' markets
valuation of assets relative to the returns generated by these

assets. Considering the differences in samples, the rates of
return on net assets, inclusive of the IVA, are surprisingly

close to those reported by Brainard,Shoven and Weiss [1 ,Table 1
  p. 463]. Their estimates for the rate of return on net assets
are 7.8 and 6.9 percent for the 1961-70 and 1971-77 periods,

respectively, compared to the estimates of 8.7 and 7.5 percent
presented in Table 6.

     The rates of return reported in Table 6 ignore the effects
of inflation and expected inflation on the real value of the
firms' financial assets and liabilities. In particular, the
component of the rate of return on net assets which reflects

the tax deductibility of the inflation premium contained in
nominal interest rates is not included in the calculations.
                                      —8—




Also,   no allowance is made for the distributional effects

of inflation and anticipated inflation between creditors and
stockholders.

Conclusion.

     This   paper has presented scir of the aggregate characteristics
of a sample of manufacturing firms for the years 1926-27. The results,
as regards the postwar period, are broadly consistent with those ob-
tained by other researchers. That is, the data show the increasing
importance of external, particularly debt, sources of funds in fin-
ancing finns' real invesimtent expenditures. The results also illustrate
the dramatic decline that has occurred during the past fifteen years
in the securities markets' valuation of net assets relative to replace—
rnent values,   and   also   relative to rates of return.

     Further    research will concentrate on using individual firm data to
attipt to             better understand the relationships between firm asset
and liability structure, and the relationships between finn financing
and real irivesthent decisions. A clearer resolution of many of the
outstanding issues regarding aggregate relationships between inflation,
tax policy, financing and investhent decisions, and market valuations
requires an improved understanding of individual firm behavior.

3. Takeovers show up on the balance sheet in miscellaneous items

   as this variable contains the difference between the actual
   cost of an acquisition and its book value. Generally,

   acquisitions exceeding ten percent of the purchasing firm's
   net assets disqualified the firm from the sample.

4. Debt due in less than one year is valued at book. Nontraded

   long—term debt is valued using a bond price index generated
   for each year for each subsample.

5. Analagous calculations using book values have little effect
  on the results.
