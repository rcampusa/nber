                    The Compliance Cost of Itemizing Deductions:
                        Evidence from Individual Tax Returns




                                      ABSTRACT




     The resource cost of operating the income tax system is large, totalling
as much as seven to eight percent of revenue raised.  One source of this cost
is the system of itemized deductions, which can require extensive record
keeping and calculation.

     This paper estimates the resource cost of itemizing deductions. In
contrast to previous studies of compliance cost which rely on survey evidence,
we infer this evidence from data reported on tax returns which suggest that
there exists taxpayers who would save money by itemizing but who choose not


     We find that in 1982 the private cost of itemizing totalled $1.4L
billion, or $3 per itemizing taxpayer. The compliance cost dissuaded from
itemizing over 650,000 taxpayers who would have thereby saved taxes, causing
an extra tax liability of nearly $200 million.  Increasing the standard
deduction by $1,000 would save $100 million in resources that would otherwise
have been devoted to itemizing.

                         Evidence from Individual Tax Returns

 1.   Introduction

      The reenirce cost of operating the income tsx system is
                                                              large.    Although
economists have traditionalty focused on the allocative effects of
                                                                   taxatIon,
Slemrod and Sorom (1984) recently eatmated the direct cost of
                                                              collecting Lndi—
vldual income taxes in 1982 to be between $30 and $35 billion, or seven to

eight percent of revenues raised.     They found that the time spent by taxpayers

in complying aith the tsx law (spproximstely two billion
                                                         hours, or twenty tours

per tax Jeer and one hundred million rsxpsyers) is equivslent to s hidden bu-

reaucracy of one million full—time civil servants.     Approxmstely three—fourths
of this cost ass borne directly by taxpayers (as opposed to the Internal Rev-

enue Service) in the process of record keeping, resesrching the tsx    law,   and

preparing the tax return itself.     This high cost is adely perceived, se evi-

denced hy the emphasis in the recent tax reform effort on simplificstion, which

presumablj is related to reducing the resource cost of opersting the system.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced marginal tax rates, incressed the stsndsrd

deduction, snd eliminated some itemized deductions, sll of which srgushly could

reduce the cost of collection.     However, the econometric snalysfs presented in

Slemrod (1985) could find no support thst reducing margnsl tax rates would

reduce complsnce cost,      It did, though, suggest that reducing the fraction of

taxpayers that itemize deductions would reduce compliance cost sigmificsntly.

      This paper provides further evidence about the compliance cost of itemiz-

ing deductions and the determinants of the cost.     Tn contrast to all previous

studies which rely on survey evidence, we infer this evidence from data re-

ported on tsx returna, which of course contain no direct information on com-

pliance coats.   We do, though, observe enough information about itemizing and
                                                             who would save
nonitemiziog taxpayers to suggest that there exist taxpayers

                                            We postulate that they so choose
mooey by itemiziog but do oot choose to.

beoauae the compliante ooat of itemizing exceeds the tax saving that oao be

obtaioed,   This allows us to estimate the magoitude aod determinaote of the

coat of itemiziog deductiooa,     We fiod that io 1982 the private ooat of item—

iziog totalled S1.44 billion, or $43 per itemizing taxpayer.

       That legitimate reductions in tax liability are frequently foregone by tax-

payers has been recognized in the past.     Perhaps the moat striking example of

this was documented by Steuerle, McHugh, and Sunley (1978), who found that only

31.3% of those eligible (and who therefore could have saved money) for income

averaging did so in 1971.    Eligible non—electors on average passed up potential

savings of $114 (1971 dollars).     They noted that the fraction of those eligible
                                                                   income.
using income averaging increased substantially with adjusted gross

       The phenomenon of non—participation in apparently rewarding government

programs has been observed io other contexts.     Moffitt (1983) noted that, in

                                        4      to Families with dependent children
1970, only 69% of families eligible for
                                                                rate wee only

38%.    Moffitt modeled this behavior as resulting from "stigma," the disutility

arising from participation in a welfare program £!Li!,      However,he remarks

in a footnote that

       "Another possible explanation is that the costs of applying for the
                                                                    make the
       program and of complying with the myriad program regulations
       benefit not worth the effort in obtaining and keeping it; that is,tne
       transaction costa may be too high.  This phenomenon is almost impossible
       to distinguish from stigma, so it is ignored here."

       There is no stigma attached to itemizing one's deductions on a tax form.

We conclude that   it is the transactions cost of itemizing that causes some tax-

                                                to choose instead to us     the
payers who could pay less in taxes by itemizing

standard deduction.

      Section   2   of the paper deecribea the empirical model that underlies the

analysis.   The data are deacribed in Section 3.       The econometric reaulta are

preaented in Section 4, along with the estimates of the coata of compliance

and tax saving foregone by not ttemizing for various groupa of taxpayera.         In

addition, the model ia used to predict the effect of alternative mnimun stan-

dard deduction levels.       Section 5 offers aome concluding remarks.


2.   The Empirical Model

      At the begtnning of the tax year, taxpayers are assumed to know their in-


come, marginal tax rate, and other actors that influence the dollar amount of

deductible activities that will be undertaken during the tax year.         In addi-


tion, they know all factors that affect the "cost of itemizing."         This coat may

iodide actoal and imputed compliance coats such as the value of time required

to collate receipts and fill out forms and the costs of purchased accounting

services,   In addition, the private coat of itemizing includes the psychic

costs (or benefits) related to the compliance activity.       The cost of itemizing

En   some nay include fear of complcstfng one's relationship with a powerful

agency of the state——this cost may not be entirely psychic, as the probability

of audit may depend on the itemization decision.       On the other hand, one night

obtain psychic astiefsction from reducing tax payments In excess of the re-

source costs of compliance st the margin.        For example, it might be that s tax-

payer values dollars paid to the state to a way that reflects his polticsl or

other judgments concerning its expenditure or other policies.        Alternatively,

one might simply enjoy the activity of minimizing tax payments.

     The slteroative to itemizing deductions is to take the standard deduction,

which is s known amount depending only on marital snd household status.        The

taxpayer sill itemize only if the tax saving from itemizing (TSi)__defined as
the tax bill if the minimum standard deduction is chosen less the tax bill if

itemizing is chosen——exceeds the (private) cost of complying with the require-

ments of itemization.             The tax savings from itemizing depends on the demand for

deductible items by the ith taxpayer and the tax function.                   Tax savings, TS.,

is modeled as a Linear function of s vector of observable exogenous variables

(Xl    which may affect both the demand for deductible items and the tax function

conditional on this demand.             Formally,

including preference heterogeneity, and F ia a vector of unknown parameters.

qonal to unobservables influencing compliance coat,                                does not have clear justi-

fication.          Fortunately, a strong case can be made that not all variables in F.

which influence tax savings also influence compliance cost.                                     These restrictions

arise from the belief that compliance coat depends on the complexity of the

irmization process but not on the dollar value of the individual deductions,

so that ;ariablea which affect dollar values and not complexity are sources of

identifying restrictions.                        The actual Identifying reatrctiona used are

described below.


3.     Data

       The data used for this study are drawn from the 1982 Treasury Tax File.

This    is a stratified random sample of individual income tax returns ahich heav-


ily ovetaamplea high income tax returns.                              Although the 1982 sample contains

over 116,000 recorda, for computational aconomy we work with a one—ia—four sam-

ple of the original file, totalling 29,407 tax records.                                   The sample used in the
estimation contained only chose tax returns for which adjusted gross income lay

in the tnterval $5,000 to $100,000 and which were nnt excluded for certain

other reasons described below.    The sample used in the estimation totalled

13,409 tax returns,

     There are four classes of taxpayers who were required to itemize deductions

even if these deductions sum to less than the standard deduction.       Clearly the

model described above does not apply to these taxpayers.      These classes are    U)

marriedtaxpayers   who file separate returns, (ii) individuals with earned in-

come lass than the standard deduction claimed as a dependent on their parents'

return, (iii) nonresident alien individuals, and (tv) U.S. citizens who

from the sample all married taxpayers filing ssparatsly, and deal with class

                                                            less than the stan-
(ii) by eliminating all single taxpayers with earned income

dard deduction.    We do not have the information required to identify taxpayera

who are in categories (iii) and (iv).    We rely on the fact that these situa-

tions are rare.

     The dependent variable in the tax asvings equation is scaled as ln(TS,

1700).   This form restricts predicted tax savings to be no less than minus

$1,700, which is the lowest possible potential tax saving, occurring

tential itemized deductions are zero and the marginel tax rats is 0.5, the

statutory maximum.    Hence this functional form restricts potentially deductible

expenses to be non—negative.     The unobserved dependent variable in the associ—

iated cost of itemizing equation becomes          + 1700),   thus preserving the

                                                                  on the com-
taxpayers but do not affect the cost of compliance, which depends
                                                               of the indivi-
plexity of the itemizstion process and not on the dollar value

dual deductions.     For example, the resource cost of deducting a $1,000 hospital

bill is equal to the resource cost of deducting a $2,000 hospital bill for the

same set of hospital services.     (Hospital services are particularly attractive

in this regard, since it seems unlikely that the complexity of deductible ex-

penses is responsive to this price.)     Likewise, the complexity of deducting a

property tax bill does not seem likely to depend on its magnitude.'         Prices of

certain itemizable deductions and tax rates affsct only dollar values of deduc-

tions and not the complexity of itemizing them.       Investment income is also ex-

cluded from the cost of itemizing equation with similar reasoning.         Investment

income generates deductible interest expenses of greater value but not greater

complexity     than ordinery consumer credit.2


4.   Results

     The itemitstion decision model described by equations       I   and 2 was estimated


by maximizing the likelihood given in expression (5).        Parameter estimates and

t—ratios are presented in Table 4—1 in the Appendix.        If compliance costs are

                                                                      model

rejects the hypothesis chat compliance costs are identically zero (2(9)

59.).      Furthermore, the cost of compliance is confirmed to vary with taxpayer

characteristics, since a test of the null hypothesis that the slope parameters

of the estimated stochastic cost of compliance equation are jointly zero is

also rejected (2(6)         21.0).    Similarly, the null hypothesis that tax saving

does   riot   vary with taxpayer characteristics is also conclusively rejected

(y2(10) = 20309).       Finally, a test of the null hypothesis that the identifying

variables in the tax savings equation are jointly zero is rejected (2(4)

750.2).

       ecause     the parameter estimates are difficult to    intpre   directly, Table

2 presents the implied impact effects of each variable, when evaluated at the

mean characteristics of each of three income classes.          These are changes in the

unconditional expectations of potential tax saving and the cost of Itemizing.

       Each of the statewide indicators of the 'price' of itemizable deductions

has the expected positive sign in the tax savings equation.         An increased price

of hospital services, a higher level of state income taxes,        and a higher level

of property taxes all are positively related to tax savings.          Increasing the

average rate of state income and sales tax by 0.01 (compared to a state average

of .050) increases the potential tax saving from itemization by $23 for someone

in the S10,000—$15,000 income range, by $54 for someone in the $20,000—$25,000

range and by $158 for someone in the S50,000$—75,000 income range.          Increasing

the average effective property tax by .01 (compared to a state mean          f   .013)

increases potential tax saving due to itemization by $33, $78, and $229 for

these three income classes.          An increase of $100 in hospital expense per day

(with a state averge of $327), increases potential saving by $115, $205, and

$490 for the three income classes.          Over most of its range, higher income iS

saving of these taxpayers amounts to 5196,2 million.     This is the revenue loss

that the Treasury would suffer if the itemization process were costless,         This

highlights that the general goals of a tax system can conflict,       In this case

        Finally, we calculate the impact of increasing the minimum standard dedoc—

tion allowed for all taxpayers, as was legislated    n   the Tax Reform Act of

1986.     This policy change has progressive implcatione for vertical equity, as

it eliminates all tax liability for many low—income households.       Preeumably it

also has a deleterious effect on horizontal equity, as it limits the applica-

                                               deductions from taxable income.

It also eliminates the tax incentive for increased charitable contributions and

other deductible activities for those taxpayers who no longer itemize.         Our

                                                           the standard deduc-
analysis allows us to measure another impact of increasing

tion, the reductton in the aggregate coat of compliance.      Table   5   shows how, as

the standard deduction is increased, the number of itemizing households de-

clines and the total coat of itemizing declines.     An acrosa—the—board increase

of $2,000 in the standard deduction reduces the coat of compliance from $1.44

to $1.07 billion, or by $370 million,      Note also that the average coat of those

householda who remain itemizers increases.      Thia occurs becauae the increased

atandard deduction reduces itemizing predominantly among lower income taxpay-

ers, who on average have a lower private cost of itemizing.

        The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains several changes which affect the ex-

tent of itemization, including the disallowance of the sales tax deduction,

                                                                    deductabil—

more than $1,000 for married couples filing jointly and stogie heads of house-

holds.   Our estimates suggest that this latter provision will reduce the pri—

vats cost of complying with the tax law by approximately $0.18 billion.

     All of the foregoing estimates apply to the privately borne cost of steni—

zaton, as valued by the taxpayers.       roe social coat of compliance may, though,

differ from the private cost.      Most signIficantly, for monetary expenditures

the social cost exceeds the privately—borne coat due to the deductibility of

these expenses.     The social cost of these expenditures is thus approximately

11(1 —   t) times   the privately borne cost,   where   t   is   the marginal tax rate.


5.   Conclusions

     The U.S. income tax system allows taxpayers to deduct certain expenses

from taxable incone in order to improve horizontal equity and to encourage cer-

tain activities, such as charitable giving, deemed socially desirable.              This

paper estimates that the privately borne cost in 1982 of allowing itemizable

dsducticna above some limit amounted to $1.44 billion, with the social cost

being somewhat higher.      An increased standard deduction, as legislated in the

Tax Reform Act of 1986, enhances progresstvity, diminishes the horizontal ecucy

and incentive effects of itemization, but saves resource costs.              We estimate

that increasing all taxpayers' standard deduction by 51,000 would save $180

million in privately borne costs, and increasing it by $2,000 would save $370

million.

      Earlier studies of the compliance cost of taxation have been based on aur—

vey responses, and therefore are subject to error due to faulty memory or de-

liberate misrepresentation.      How to value taxpayers' tine spent on tax matters

is also a difficult problem in such studies.        In addition, only tangible re-

source costs of compliance can be measured with any accuracy.              This paper

1.   The existence of a state income tax 15 likely to complicate the itemiza-

     tion procedure.     Adding a dummy variable for the presence of a state in-

     come tax in the coat of compliance equation was unsuccessful——the likeli-

     hood would not converge.     Of the 13,409 recorda, only 80 were from states


     without an income tax, so that this influence is unlikely to be qualita-

     tively important.


2.   If investment income is included   as an explanatory variable of cost of

     compliance, it is not statistically significant at common levels of

     significance.


3.   The results reported here and in Table     4   for the lowest and highest adjusted

     gross income classes were obtained by applying the mean characteristics of

     the adjacent income class except in the case of income, in which case

     55,000 was used for the less thsn $5,000 class and $100,000 was used for

     the over $100,000 class.


4.   The nonmonotonicity probably reflects the fact that taxpayers with low re-

     ported adjusted gross income are often not "poor," but have temporarily low

     annual income or have taken tax losses that reduce their income subject to

     tax.
