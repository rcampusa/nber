COVID-19 Surgical Abortion Restriction Did Not Reduce Visits to Abortion Clinics

                                          ABSTRACT

Due to COVID-19, 33 states banned elective medical procedures, and 13 of these states included
surgical abortions. We collected street addresses of abortion clinics and linked them to
SafeGraph's data on counts of visitors. We found a 32 percent decrease in clinics visits in
February-May of 2020 compared to 2019. States that banned elective procedures saw an
additional 23 percent decrease in visits. However, there was no significant additional decrease in
the states that explicitly banned surgical abortions. We estimate that the decrease in foot traffic
over these four months reduced abortions by 9 percent in 2020 relative to 2019.

Introduction

       The Covid-19 pandemic has infected over 6 million Americans since January 2020 and

caused almost 200,000 deaths. Early in the pandemic, health authorities, governors, and other local

leaders were concerned that there were shortages in key health care resources such as masks,

gloves, and gowns that would increase the risk of transmission to health care providers.

Policymakers were also worried about interpersonal interactions contributing to the spread of the

virus, which led forty-two states to introduce measures to encourage or mandate that residents stay

home. In addition to efforts to increase the supply of these resources, some states took steps to

limit demand by restricting non-essential health care procedures. Thirty-three states either

explicitly prohibited or actively discouraged health care providers from performing non-essential

and elective procedures, including surgery.

       Beyond these broad restrictions, many states explicitly targeted surgical abortion (as

opposed to medical or pharmaceutical abortion, which involves only orally taken medications) as

part of their COVID-19 restrictions. These states included these procedures as prohibited elective

surgeries that could be reasonably deferred until after the pandemic had subsided. This is despite

the obvious persistent growth of an embryo, eventually becoming a fetus that would have to be

aborted through more invasive (and often banned) procedures

       These temporary restrictions exist in the context of other permanent restrictions, including

imposing maximum gestational age and mandatory waiting periods, requiring multiple visits,

mandating detailed building codes, and insisting on providers having admitting privileges at

nearby hospitals. While these other restrictions have been studied previously in the health

economic literature and beyond (e.g., Slusky and Lu 2016; Packham 2017; Slusky 2017; Lu and

Slusky 2019; Fischer, Royer, and White 2018; Venator and Fletcher 2019; Lindo and Pineda-




                                                3
Torres 2019; Myers and Ladd 2020 Lindo, Myers, Schlosser, and Cunningham 2020), to our

knowledge no one has studied COVID-19 related abortion restrictions.

        We use two primary data sources: daily cellular location data from SafeGraph that counts

the number of visits to outpatient healthcare providers and lists of abortion providers across the

United States. These data do not distinguish between patients and employees of the health care

provider nor do they identify the reason for a visit.

        Our balanced panel included full data for 317 abortion providers located in 42 states and

the District of Columbia, and our time period spanned February to May 2019 and 2020. Using

fixed-effect Poisson regressions, we examined how abortion clinic visit volume on a given clinic-

date was impacted by several variables, including the number of COVID-19 cases in the county,

the year (i.e., a dummy for the COVID-19 pandemic), and restrictions on elective medical

procedures, and explicit restrictions of surgical abortion.

        We find that abortion clinic visits dropped by 32 percent in 2020 compared to 2019.

Restrictions on elective medical procedures led to an additional statistically significant 23 percent

decrease in the volume of abortion clinic visits. However, explicitly targeting surgical abortion as

part of these restrictions did not have a statistically effect.

Background

        In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many states chose to enact restrictions on medical

procedures to conserve the use of personal protective equipment and minimize interpersonal

contact. 33 states banned elective medical procedures, and 13 of these states included surgical

abortion in these bans despite the time sensitive nature of this procedure (Figure 1). The Centers




                                                    4
for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which directs the Medicare program, also advised health care

providers to defer elective, non-essential procedures when possible. 1

         Although we do not have information on the causal relationship between policy decisions

and abortions during the pandemic, there is some preliminary information from survey data.

Around one third of women reported that they had reproductive health appointments delayed or

cancelled during the pandemic (Guttmacher 2020). Additionally, a survey of South African clinics

showed a decrease in contraceptive implant application as well as abortion care (Adelekan et al.

2020).

         More broadly, there has been as much as a 40 percent decrease in non-COVID healthcare

utilization during the spring of 2020 (Ziedan, Simon, and Wing 2020), not all of which can be

attributed to state policies on elective healthcare. This indicates that there is a reduction in demand

for healthcare due to the pandemic and it is plausible to expect that reproductive healthcare such

as abortion could experience a similar decrease in demand. Still, we lack a nationwide examination

of the impact of the pandemic and related restrictions on abortion care.

         There has also been plenty of academic speculation and commentary on the topic.

Robinson et al. (2020), for example, write that "Contraception and abortion care remain essential,

and we need to work at the local, state, and federal levels on policies that preserve access to these

critical services," Similar opinion pieces were published in a variety of publications including

Sexual and Reproductive Health Matters (Todd-Gher and Shah 2020), The Lancet (Tran et al,

2020),, and the Journal of Law and the Biosciences (Donley et al. 2020).

       Baird and Millar (2020) argue that the pandemic has exacerbated the recent trend of

compromised abortion access in the United States. Many of the states with the strictest pre-

pandemic abortion laws ended up restricting it during the pandemic. The concern over this trend

is echoed by Viveiros and Bonomi's (2020) warning that the pandemic-related restrictions could

increase the risk of domestic violence and restrictions to abortion or contraception access.

       One proposal to maintain abortion access while minimizing interpersonal contact is

increased application of at-home medication abortion. Raymond et al. (2020) write that this is a

safe solution for patients. The authors lay out a treatment protocol for telemedical provision of

medication abortion using remote screening based on medical history and forgoing administration

of RhD immunoglobulin; they believe the latter is acceptable because of recent studies indicating

Rh sensitization is unlikely after early abortions. This method also forgoes lab testing or the use

of ultrasound to estimate gestational age, instead using the last menstrual period to date the

pregnancy. However, the telemedicine provision of medication abortion faces many legal hurdles

in the United States, as outlined by Romanis et al. (2020).

       Additionally, at present, the long-term impact of COVID-19 on fetuses or neonates is

unknown. Early in the pandemic (May 2020), Schwandt (2020) used differences in the mortality

profile of COVID-19 and the 1918 flu to argue that COVID-19 is unlikely to have long-term

adverse effects, while a fetus whose mother was infected with influenza during pregnancy had

worse long-term economic outcomes compared to their siblings who did not have the same

exposure (Schwandt 2018). More recent studies have documented vertical transmission (mother

to fetus) of COVID-19 and an increased risk of miscarriage (Shende et al. 2020). This corroborates

the findings from earlier studies (Dong et al. 2020) in Wuhan at the beginning of the pandemic.

The overall impact on maternal health is still unclear. While pregnant patients did not present any




                                                 6
differently than other adults (Lei et al. 2020), maternal mental health could be adversely impacted

by the pandemic and the response to it (Topalidou et al. 2020). Pregnant women who are SARS-

CoV-2 positive are also at a significantly greater risk of hospitalization, admission to the ICU, and

mechanical ventilation than women who were not pregnant (Ellington et al. 2020). Finally,

regarding reproductive care, second trimester abortions can be performed on COVID-positive

patients without compromising physician safety in areas with high community spread, as long as

proper precautions with personal protective equipment were taken (Fang, Castano and Davis

2020).

Data

Provider-level data

         We collected data on visits from SafeGraph's Weekly Patterns (v2.1) data files. These files

provide weekly, daily, and hourly counts of arriving visitors to over five million locations. These

data are derived from anonymized GPS data from applications on over 18 million cellular devices.

While SafeGraph does not disclose the applications or other datastreams that they use, typical

sources for these data include weather and shopping applications. In some cases, SafeGraph is

unable to assign a GPS ping to a specific point of interest. This issue is particularly salient when

multiple points of interest are in close proximity either horizontally (neighboring stores) or

vertically (different levels of the same structure). As a result, our ability to identify specific points

of interest is somewhat attenuated and this is reflected in the set of clinics that we are able to

identify.

         The size of the SafeGraph panel of devices evolves over time as individuals install and

remove apps from their phones and because immobile devices do not provide GPS pings. These

issues are relevant for some analyses, such as assessing compliance with mobility restrictions (e.g.




                                                   7
Allcott et al. 2020). However, only changes in apps are relevant to our study since the devices in

our study are, by definition, mobile. In conversations with SafeGraph engineers there appears to

have been relatively little "app-churn" in their sample over this time period, so we do not make

any adjustments to our visitor counts for changes in the number of devices in the panel over time.

Furthermore, because the adjustment involves multiplying by a fixed constant for each date, the

adjustment would be absorbed by the date fixed effects in our analyses.

           We also collected the names and street addresses of abortion clinics listed on several

publicly available online aggregators: Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and Abortion Clinics

Online. 2 Our first attempt to match these with Safegraph locations was to fuzzy match (with Stata

command reclink) by address and then by name; this allowed us to identify several hundred

matches between our list and Safegraph's outpatient center location database. Additionally, we

geocoded the clinics to facilitate Vincenty calculations (via Stata command geonear) of the

distances between our clinics and the Safegraph locations. This process uncovered several matches

that were not found in either round of the fuzzy matching process. Geocoding the clinics also

enabled us to map the clinics as shown in Figure 1. The clinics we could not match with either

method were excluded from our analysis, since we lacked any of Safegraph's visit data for those

locations. This required us to drop several states from our analysis as mentioned previously.

Policy Data

           We gathered data on elective procedure and surgical abortion bans from the COVID State

Policy Database (Raifman et al 2020) and the Kaiser Family Foundation (Sobel et al. 2020). 3

Several states listed exceptions to these bans; for example, in Iowa, abortions were permitted if

    Please see Appendix Table 3 for list of implementation dates for each state policy.



                                                            8
delaying an abortion until the relevant executive order had expired would mean a pregnancy

exceeded Iowa's existing gestational age limit (Mehaffey 2020). Similarly, a federal judge ruled

that abortion providers could determine a surgical abortion necessary on an individual basis,

including if delaying the procedure would push the pregnancy past viability (Borchardt 2020.)

       States varied in how strictly they enforced surgical abortion bans. In Iowa, for example,

enforcement was relatively lax. Texas, on the other hand, went as far as including medication

abortion in its elective procedure restrictions (Najmabadi 2020.) Although Indiana's governor

stated in a press conference that surgical abortions should not continue unless medically necessary

for maternal health, providers in Indiana indicated to a newspaper that they did not stop providing

abortions and had not faced interference from the state (Cook and Sikitch 2020.) The ACLU of

Alaska made similar comments regarding their state's own de jure abortion ban (Carter 2020.)

Meanwhile, Louisiana's attorney general attempted to inspect a Shreveport abortion clinic to

determine if they had performed non-medically necessary abortions (Westwood 2020.)

Additionally, while other states enacted de jure bans on abortion by classifying it as an elective

surgery, South Dakota's travel quarantine guidelines made it infeasible for medical providers to

come to the state's sole clinic to perform abortions. This led to a de facto abortion ban because the

clinic does not employ any doctors who reside inside the state borders (McCammon 2020).

       At least two states attempted or discussed surgical abortion bans that never came to fruition.

Kentucky's state legislature passed a bill that would have restricted abortion as part of the

pandemic response, but it was vetoed by Governor Andy Beshear (Sobel et al. 2020.) Utah's

legislature discussed a surgical abortion ban, but the measure never came to a vote (Keating et al.

2020.) Therefore, neither of these states are included in our count of those that banned surgical

abortion at some point during the pandemic. We did not attempt to index differences in surgical




                                                 9
abortion policy for our analysis, but it is important to note that these restrictions were not entirely

consistent from state to state.

       We also used a variety of sources, mostly local newspapers, to identify which states

attempted to ban surgical abortion as part of their emergency response to the pandemic. We also

made use of a crowdsourced collection of state pandemic responses to identify if and when a state

restricted elective medical procedures. We coded our two dummy variables to turn on the day a

state enacted an order banning elective procedures (and surgical abortion, when it was included in

these orders.) They turned back off when the relevant order expired or was halted by a court

decision, which occurred in a few cases. If the court order was appealed and overturned, the

variable turned back on. Although we found several instances of court orders requiring abortions

be allowed to continue, we did not find information about this occurring for general elective

procedure bans. Therefore, the indicator for surgical abortion bans turned on and off intermittently

for some states whereas the indicator for elective surgery bans turned on and then off once per

state. Finally, we used data from Johns Hopkins University (Center for Systems Science and

Engineering 2020) for the count of COVID-19 cases in each county.

Methods

       Using a balanced panel of abortion clinics, we estimated fixed effect Poisson regressions

to examine the impact of state policies on visits to abortion clinics during the pandemic.

 = ( +  + 

                        + +   + +   +  )

where ClinicVisits is the volume of clinic visits for clinic c in state s on day d (e.g., Monday) of

week w (e.g., week 10 of the year) and year y (e.g., 2020).




                                                  10
       We created two dummy variables for state restrictions on elective medical procedures. One

dummy (ElectiveProcedureBan) indicated if a state restricted elective medical procedures in

general, while the second (SurgicalAbortionBan) indicated if a state defined surgical abortions as

an elective procedure that ought to be canceled or postponed. To our knowledge, there were no

instances of a state banning surgical abortion without banning elective medical procedures in

general.

       In X, we also incorporated a control for public holidays such as Memorial Day and

President's Day, allowing us to control for decreased traffic on those clinic-dates. The final

controls had to do with the prevalence of COVID-19 in the county each clinic is located in. We

tested several COVID-19-related parameters, including the raw number of cumulative cases, new

cases on a given clinic-date, cumulative cases per 100 thousand, and new cases per 100 thousand

on a given clinic-date.

       We also controlled for clinic fixed effects (clinic) and day of the week-week fixed effects

(dayweek), e.g. Thursday of week 14. Controlling for day of the week-by-week fixed effects allow

us to compare days in 2020 to comparable days in 2019. We only used weekday visits in our

analysis, so this gave us 85 day-of-the-week-by-week groups (e.g., Monday of week 11). Our time

period encompassed epidemiological weeks 6 through 22, which is roughly February through May.

Day 1 was Monday of week 6 and Day 85 was Friday of week 22 and so on. Finally, robust

standard errors were clustered at the state level.

Results

       Although our original sample included over 500 clinics, our balanced panel includes 317

clinics located in 43 states and the District of Columbia (see Figure 1). For various reasons, some

states were omitted from the analysis. Louisiana, Kentucky and North Dakota were excluded




                                                     11
because we were unable to match any abortion providers in these states with locations in the

Safegraph database. Arkansas, Hawaii, Missouri and West Virginia were excluded while balancing

our panel because none of their clinics had data for each clinic-date in our time period. Finally, we

chose to exclude South Dakota from our analysis because of the unique nature of abortion

availability in the state.

        Table 1 shows our summary statistics. We have 53,890 clinic-day observations in our data,

corresponding to 317 clinics over 85 week days in each of two years. Of those observations, 15%

(30% of the 2020 days) from when an elective procedure ban was in effect, and 1.3% (2.6% in

2020) are from when an explicit surgical abortion ban was also in effect. Because our sample is at

the clinic level, we have relatively few observations in states that explicitly banned surgical

abortion since those states have very few abortion clinics.

        Figure 2 plots the raw daily difference in visit counts between 2020 and 2019. There is a

notable decline in visits beginning around day 25, which corresponds to March 6 in 2020. This is

also when many states announced states of emergency and began to take other steps to contain the

pandemic and reduce mobility. On March 13 (day 30), President Trump declared a nationwide

state of emergency.

        Our event study (Figure 3) shows a steep drop off in clinic visits after procedure bans went

into effect. Visits do not begin to increase again until approximately t=50, or 50 days after

procedure bans were enacted, which is around mid-to-late May for most states. This pattern is true

for states with elective procedure restrictions only as well as states that included surgical abortion

in their restrictions. There is also a pronounced decline before these bans took effect, which reflects

voluntary reductions in movement to abortion clinics. This is entirely consistent with Ziedan,




                                                  12
Simon, and Wing (2020) who found a steep decline in non-COVID healthcare utilization during

the spring of 2020, not all of which can be attributed to state policies on elective healthcare.

          We used several combinations of variables in our Poisson regressions, although a dummy

for the year 2020 was always included. This dummy variable proved to be significant across all

combinations, indicating that the pandemic year effect was highly determinative.

          In Table 2, we show a significant decrease in traffic to abortion clinics in 2020 compared

to 2019. However, we cannot attribute this to specific bans on surgical abortion. For example,

when we control for COVID prevalence using cases per 100 thousand people, there was a 34

percent (0.29 log points) 4 decrease in visits in 2020, and states that banned elective medical

procedures saw an additional 40 percent (0.328 log points) decrease. Both of these effects were

significant at the 99 percent level. There was no significant additional impact in the states that

specifically categorized surgical abortion as an elective procedure that ought to be postponed.

Finally, we found a 0.025 percent (0.00025 log points) decrease for each case per 100 thousand

people in the county, an effect that was significant at the 99 percent level.

          When we used new cases per 100 thousand instead of the sum of cases, we found a 32

percent (0.277 log points) decrease in the year 2020 and a further 23 percent (0.205 log points)

decrease from elective procedure bans; in this instance, these effects were significant at the 99 and

95 percent levels respectively. Again, we did not find a significant impact from specific surgical

abortion bans in this permutation. Each new case per 100 thousand people was responsible for a

further 0.21 percent decrease in visits, and this effect was also significant at the 99 percent level.

                                                  13
Robustness Checks
       To ensure that the clinics included in our balanced panel were not inherently different from

the rest of our original sample, we conducted several regressions on an indicator for whether or

not a clinic was missing data. The clinics with missing data were excluded to balance the panel.

The variables we tested included county population, the cumulative case sum per 100 thousand in

the county, the maximum new daily cases per 100 thousand in the county, elective procedure bans

and surgical abortion bans. The only significant variable was county population; although it was

significant at the 95 percent level, the coefficient was 0.0000000131 per person, so it did not seem

to have a large impact on whether a clinic would lack the full data for our time period. None of the

other variables we tested showed consistent significance at the 90 percent level or higher. Given

the nature of SafeGraph data, one would also expect to find clinics in denser locations--larger

counties--to be less likely to be precisely identified, which also explains some of the missing data.

Discussion
       Guttmacher has reported a consistent yearly decline in abortions (Nash and Dreweke 2019),

so even in the absence of a pandemic it would be expected that fewer abortions would take place

in 2020 than in 2019. However, using the most recent data, we can attempt to estimate how many

additional abortions were prevented by the pandemic and related policies. As of September 2020,

the most recent data available on abortions per state per year is from 2017. Guttmacher reported

that 862,000 abortions took place in the United States in 2017, which is about a 6.9 percent

decrease from 926,000 in 2014 and a 1.3 percent decrease from 874,000 in 2016 (Guttmacher Data

Center 2020.)

       Using our regression coefficients (Table 2, Column 2) and the Guttmacher data on state

abortion rates in 2017, we can attempt to estimate the impact of the pandemic and related state

policies. Our time period was 4 months, so these effects would impact about a third of the year.


                                                 14
For the United States as a whole, in a non-pandemic scenario with a consistent rate of decrease

year to year, we would have expected about 840,000 abortions in 2019 (from a 1.3 percent decrease

in each of 2018 and 2019) and about 829,000 in 2020 (from another 1.3 percent decrease).

However, in our regression there was a 32 percent decrease from 2019 to 2020 during the 4-month

time period. Therefore, we would assume about 750,000 (840,000 times a third of a 32 percent

decrease) abortions would take place in the United States in 2020, which is about a 9 percent

(comparing 750,000 and 829,000) decrease from what we would have expected from the

downward trend from before the pandemic.

       However, elective procedure bans were also responsible for significant decreases in clinic

visits according to our regression. Therefore, states with this policy would see an even larger

decrease in abortions. For example, Pennsylvania banned elective procedures for about 5 weeks

(Raifman et al. 2020), or about 10 percent of the year. Since there were 31,260 abortions in

Pennsylvania in 2017 (a 3 percent decrease from 32,230 in 2016), in the non-pandemic scenario

outlined above we might expect around 29,400 abortions in 2019 (two more years of 3 percent

decreases) and 28,500 abortions in 2020 (another 3 percent decrease). With the impact of the

pandemic and elective procedure ban causing additional decreases, we would expect around

25,700 abortions (29,400 times a third of a 32 percent decrease and a tenth of a 23 percent decrease)

to take place in Pennsylvania in 2020, a 10 percent decrease (comparing 25,700 and 28,500) from

the non-pandemic scenario.

       These estimates of the change in abortions assumes that the reduction in visits was spread

proportionally across visits for abortions and visits for other services. This is a reasonable

assumption because more targeted surgical abortion bans had no effect on the number of visits to

abortion clinics. If reductions in visits were disproportionally arising from visits for non-abortion




                                                 15
services, so that the number of abortion visits remained constant, then a targeted surgical abortion

ban should be effective at reducing visits to affected clinics.

       A large number of clinics in our sample were Planned Parenthood health centers. Planned

Parenthood claims that abortion accounts for only 3 percent of the services provided at their clinics

(Planned Parenthood 2014.) Although the true proportion of Planned Parenthood's services

constituted by abortion has been a source of controversy (Ye Hee Lee 2015), the 3 percent figure

does have validity by at least one measure. The organization's 2013-14 annual report shows that

abortion services made up 327,653 of 10.6 million services provided, which is about 3.1 percent

(Planned Parenthood 2014.) In 2018-19, the proportion was 4 percent (Planned Parenthood 2019.)

This statistic could explain why elective procedure bans (which would impact other Planned

Parenthood services such as contraception or STD testing) had a steep impact on clinic visits while

targeting surgical abortion specifically did not have a significant impact.

Conclusion
       In this paper, we estimate the effects of a new Targeted Restriction of Abortion Providers

(TRAP): explicitly prohibiting surgical abortions as elective surgery during a global pandemic.

Our hypothesis was that these restrictions, like many other TRAP laws and policies, were going to

reduce the volume of abortion services.

       Unexpectedly, we found that this was not the case. While the overall volume of visits to

abortion clinics decreased by 32 percent in 2020 compared to 2019, and states that banned elective

surgical procedures saw an additional 23 percent decrease, states that also explicitly banned

surgical abortions so no further decrease. These results can be rationalized through both demand

and supply-side explanations. For example, if abortions are a relatively small share of a clinic's

services then it may not be feasible to cover fixed costs if there are no patients coming in for other

services to share the costs of providing common services. On the demand side, elective procedure


                                                 16
bans may have provided signals about the severity of the pandemic in an area, leading the marginal

woman to decide against having an abortion.
