How Do Peers Influence BMI? Evidence from Randomly Assigned Classrooms in South Korea

                                           ABSTRACT

Obesity among children is an important public health concern, and social networks may play a
role in students' habits that increase the likelihood of being overweight. We examine data from
South Korean middle schools, where students are randomly assigned to classrooms, and exploit
the variation in peer body mass index. We use the number of peers' siblings as an instrument to
account for endogeneity concerns and measurement error. Heavier peers increase the likelihood
that a student is heavier; there is no spurious correlation for height, which is unlikely to have peer
contagion. Public policy that targets obesity can have spillovers through social networks.

Introduction

The proportion of overweight children in OECD countries has risen steadily

over the past several decades (OECD, 2015). Social factors rather than indi-

vidual characteristics may play a large role, especially for adolescents. How-

ever, empirical research on the impacts of peer effects and social contagion on

obesity is difficult because of well-known issues such as self-selection, common

environmental factors (frequently called contextual effects), and the “reflection

problem,” in which the direction of influence is unclear (Manski, 1993; Epple

and Romano, 2011). Christakis and Fowler (2007) use measured height and

weight data in Framingham Heart Study, spanning 32 years, to show that an

individual’s own chance of becoming obese increases by 57 percent if his or her

friend is obese. By examining the correlation of obesity within clusters of social

ties, they argue their effect is not due to common factors. However, there is

some controversy about the validity of their identification strategy, with others

claiming that these correlations are spurious (Cohen-Cole and Fletcher, 2008b).

Replicating Christakis and Fowler (2007) with a large sample of adolescents,

Cohen-Cole and Fletcher (2008b) show that peer effects on obesity are reduced

substantially once controls for contextual effects are included. In further work,

they show that similar peer effects can be found in acne, headaches, and height

using the same empirical approach, but that these effects also disappear when

using a more comprehensive estimation approach (Cohen-Cole and Fletcher,

2008a); Fowler and Christakis (2008) dispute a number of these claims.

   Since this work, there have been two general strategies to address these

empirical challenges. The instrumental variables approach uses pre-determined

peer characteristics or the characteristics of peers’ relatives or other friends to

provide identification (Trogdon et al., 2008; Mora and Gil, 2013). However, these

instruments may still be correlated with unobserved peer attributes that cause

social network formation. Another approach is to use institutional settings in

which peers are randomly assigned. For example, more-fit peers improve fitness



                                        2
outcomes among cadets who are randomly assigned to squadrons at the United

States Air Force Academy (Carrell et al., 2011). Similarly, there is peer influence

in weight gain among female college students randomly assigned to dormitory

rooms (Yakusheva et al., 2014).

   In this paper, we avoid the nonrandom sorting problem by using a unique

practice of Korean middle schools: the random assignment of students into

a physical homeroom classroom in which they stay with the same classmates

throughout the day for an entire school year. Because of the amount of time

spent with these peers, they form a useful social network to examine. Our data,

drawn from a sample of seventh graders, come with two shortcomings, however.

First, they are cross-sectional, meaning that we cannot use lagged observations

to better ascertain the direction of influence – that is, the reflection problem.

Second, student height and weight are self-reported. While self-reports have

generally been found to be reliable, it is possible that students with particularly

tall or heavy peers systematically misreport their own height and weight, leading

to spurious correlation (Strauss, 1999; Kuczmarski et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2011).

   We address these issues by using peers’ number of siblings as an instrumental

variable for peers’ average body mass index (BMI). Numerous studies have found

that the number of siblings is correlated with a child’s BMI and the likelihood of

being obese (Hesketh et al., 2007; Chen and Escarce, 2010; Haugaard et al., 2013;

de Oliveira Meller et al., 2015). Mechanisms posited for this correlation include

that children with more siblings tend to have higher level of physical activity and

lower food intake. Importantly, the number of siblings of the randomly-assigned

peers in Korean classrooms cannot directly affect a student’s own health. In

the Methods Section, we describe this instrument in greater detail and provide

evidence for its validity.

   Our estimates show that a one unit increase in average peers’ BMI increases

a student’s BMI by 0.83 units. Follow-on data, which unfortunately does not

include a sufficient number of peers for a lagged approach as in Christakis and

Fowler, does indicate that seventh grade peers still have a substantial impact on


                                        3
the student’s BMI in eighth grade. Our results are robust to the inclusion of a

number of student, peer, and teacher characteristics. We further show that our

results are driven by peer effects in weight, rather than height; effects on the

latter would suggest that our results are tainted by non-classical measurement

error or unresolved non-random sorting.

   While South Korea has rates of overweight that are among the lowest in

the OECD, the proportion of men who are overweight has increased rapidly in

recent years (OECD, 2010). Among male children, the proportion of boys who

are overweight is actually greater than the OECD average (OECD, 2015). Our

results are therefore relevant for other developed countries, and the strength of

our identification approach provides important evidence on the impact of social

networks on health outcomes.



Methods

Data Set

We use the Gyeonggi Education Panel Study (GEPS2012), which surveyed 4,051

seventh grade students in middle schools in Gyeonggi province (surrounding

Seoul, South Korea). Students were sampled with a two-stage cluster sampling

design; first, 63 schools were chosen from the population of 624 middle schools

in Gyeonggi province. Then, two classrooms were drawn within each school,

and all students in the classrooms were surveyed. GEPS also surveyed parents,

homeroom teachers, principals, and schools. Each student is linked to their

homeroom teacher, who manages the classroom to which the students belong;

subject teachers rotate through to present lectures to the same set of students

(Lim and Meer, forthcoming).

   Students were asked to report their height and weight, with which we con-

struct BMI. BMI has been criticized as sometimes misclassifying an individual

as obese or overweight when he or she is muscular, because it cannot distinguish

adipose tissue from muscle, bone, and other lean body mass (Burkhauser and


                                       4
Cawley, 2008). Nevertheless, BMI is a convenient measure, particularly because

it rescales to a fairly consistent metric across ages (Bellizzi and Dietz, 1999).

   GEPS surveys students in 8th and 9th grade as well, and students once

again provide their height and weight. However, since not every classroom in

a school is surveyed, data on peers is incomplete in 8th and 9th grades. While

we examine the impact of 7th grade peers on later BMI outcomes, we do not

examine contemporaneous peer effects in those later grades.

   Starting with 4,051 students, we drop 128 observations that have missing

height or weight information. We have a final sample of 3,909 students after

dropping 14 additional students who do not have classroom information or whose

parents report that the sum of male and female children at home is zero. There

is no correlation between attrition from the sample and other student or teacher

characteristics. Table 1 reports summary statistics for our sample.


Tests of Random Assignment

Peer Assignment        The random assignment of peers is crucial to our identi-

fication strategy. Middle school classrooms in Korea use some form of random

assignment to classrooms due to both social norms and government policies

(Lim and Meer, forthcoming; Kang, 2007). Students are re-randomized in each

year through 9th grade. This is an important feature for examining the impact

of peers on later outcomes; if students were somehow sorted into classrooms

based on their BMI, the measured impacts of 7th grade peers on 8th and 9th

grade BMI might actually reflect this sorting rather than a causal effect.

   We also provide empirical evidence to support this point. First, we conduct a

series of Pearson’s χ2 tests for the independence of students’ assigned classroom

and students’ characteristics, including gender, number of siblings, father’s and

mother’s education, parents’ marital status, as well as whether parents own their

own home. Eleven of 378 tests are not available in seventh grade because five

schools are single-sex (5 tests) and one school has only one classroom sampled

(1 × 6 tests). Five tests are unavailable for eighth and ninth grades.


                                        5
    Table 2 shows the number of rejections for the null hypothesis of indepen-

dence in a series of Pearson’s χ2 tests at 1, 5, and 10 percent significance level.

For each significance level, the rejection rates are below or near the significance

level. Hence, we conclude there is little evidence of nonrandom assignment of

students into classroom with respect to student’s observable characteristics.

    We also test whether the characteristics of classroom peers are correlated

with the student’s own characteristics. In general, regressing own characteristics

on peers’ characteristics is not appropriate because of the negative bias that

is inherent with random assignment (Guryan et al., 2009). Intuitively, when

peers are randomly assigned, the classroom averages for student characteristics

will be balanced across the classrooms. If, for example, a student’s family

income is higher than the classroom mean, then the peers’ family income, which

excludes that data point, will tend to be lower. This creates a mechanical

negative correlation between own and peers’ characteristics in spite of random

assignment. Monte Carlo studies show that this simple test of correlations over-

rejects independence at a very high rate; this issue is resolved by the use of the

leave-out mean for the population from which peers are drawn (for example, the

school-level rather than classroom-level average family income) (Guryan et al.,

2009).

    We estimate the following equation to test the independence of characteris-

tics:

                            1   X             1   X
          yics = α + β            yjcs + γ          yjs + λs + εics ,           (1)
                         nc − 1            ns − 1
                             j6=i,j∈c(i)         j6=i,j∈s(i)


where yics is student i’s characteristic in classroom c in school s. nc and ns

are the numbers of students in classroom c and school s, respectively, so that

the term including yjcs is the mean of the characteristic within the classroom

(excluding the student him- or herself). The term including yjs is the mean of

the characteristic within the school, also excluding the individual student. λs

are school fixed effects to account for the fact that random assignment occurs



                                           6
within a school and εics is an idiosyncratic error term.

   Table 3 shows that none of the characteristics are correlated with classroom

peers’ characteristics.


Teacher Assignment A related concern is that certain homeroom teachers

are more likely to be assigned to the students with a higher propensity to gain

weight, in which case our peer effects estimates will be confounded with teacher

effects. There is no evidence that teachers in South Korea are assigned to class-

rooms in a way that might lead to this type of bias (Lim and Meer, forthcoming).

However, we examine whether observable teacher characteristics are correlated

with student characteristics. Of the 25 coefficients from regressions of a student

characteristic on teacher characteristics, only one is statistically significant at

the 10 percent level. This provides strongly suggestive evidence that teachers

are not assigned to classrooms in a systematic manner.


Specification

The basic linear-in-means regression equation we use to estimate the effects of

peers’ BMI is:

                    1   X
    7th
BM Iics = α+                   7th
                         (βBM Ijcs + Xjcs γ 0 ) + Xics δ 0 + HTcs θ0 + λs + εics ,
                 nc − 1
                      j6=i,j∈c(i)

                                                                               (2)

             7th
where BM Iics    is the BMI for seventh grade student i, assigned to classroom c

in school s. nc1−1                     7th
                     P
                       j6=i,j∈c(i) BM Ijcs is the average BMI of student i’s peers.

Xics and HTcs are vectors of student and homeroom teacher characteristics.

Student characteristics include number of siblings, student gender, family in-

come, whether both parents live together, whether parents own their home, and

whether parents have bachelor’s degrees or higher. nc1−1
                                                           P
                                                             j6=i,j∈c(i) Xjcs is

peers’ average characteristics. Homeroom teacher characteristics include teacher

gender and dummies for teacher experience of less than five years, having a grad-



                                        7
uate degree, and graduating from a teachers college. λs are school fixed effects

to account for the random assignment of students into classroom within a school;

they also account for any broader unobserved impacts at the school level, such

as its location. εics is the error term.


Instrumental Variable

β is intended to capture the endogenous peer effects – that is, the impact of

peers on the individual (Manski, 1993). However, this coefficient will be biased

because of the reflection problem and contextual effects; namely, the student and

his or her peers affect each other’s BMI simultaneously, and they share the same

environment (the classroom). As such, a naı̈ve estimate will confound these

effects. To address this problem, we instrument peers’ BMI with peers’ number

of siblings; a number of studies find that the number of siblings is correlated

with the child’s own BMI and the likelihood of being obese (Hesketh et al., 2007;

Chen and Escarce, 2010; Haugaard et al., 2013; de Oliveira Meller et al., 2015).

Children with more siblings tend to have a higher level of physical activity

and lower food intake (Jacoby et al., 1975; Bagley et al., 2006). Parenting

practices may differ for multi-child families, with single-child families having

more restrictions on outdoor play and fewer restrictions on food (Hesketh et al.,

2007). Figure 1, which depicts average BMI by the number of siblings in our

data, shows a clear negative relationship for children with zero to five siblings

(we exclude the small number of observations with six or more siblings).

   The number of peers’ siblings is thus clearly relevant to peers’ BMI, satisfying

the first condition for an instrumental variable. The instrument must also not

directly affect the outcome variable – that is, the number of siblings that peers

have cannot directly impact the student’s own BMI except through its impact on

peer BMI. It is difficult to imagine a mechanism by which this could be the case,

though we remain agnostic on the exact nature of this transmission. Peer BMI

is the outcome of numerous inputs, including genetics, nutrition, and physical

activity. If peer BMI changes because of an increase in physical activity, that


                                           8
may have a different impact than if it changes because of an improvement in

dietary habits.

   We examine whether peers’ number of siblings is correlated with student

or teacher characteristics, which would provide evidence against random assign-

ment. Table 4 shows that only the coefficient from a regression of the instrument

on family income is significant at 10 percent level.

   We therefore use the following as a first stage equation in a two-stage least

squares frameworking, instrumenting peer BMI with the number of peer sib-

lings. We also examine reduced-form results, in which peer number of siblings

is substituted for peer BMI in the equation.

   1   X
                        7th          1   X
                    BM Ijcs = γ+δ                     Sjcs + θSics + ηs + ics ,
nc − 1  j6=i,j∈c(i)               nc − 1  j6=i,j∈c(i)

                                                                                      (3)


where Sics and Sjcs indicate number of siblings for student i and j 6= i.



Results

Contemporaneous Effects

Table 5 presents the coefficients from estimating variations of Equation 1. Col-

umn 1 reports the naı̈ve ordinary least squares result. The large negative effect

seems to suggest that heavier peers cause a reduction in BMI. However, as dis-

cussed above, random assignment and balance across classrooms will mechan-

ically generate a negative effect.∗ To illustrate this point clearly, we examine
   ∗ Suppose the sum of students’ BMIs and the number of students in each classroom are ȳ

and n and the same across classrooms. We define average classroom peers’ BMI for student
i as Xi = ȳ−y
           n−1
               i
                 , where yi is own BMI. Then, a regression of own BMI on peers’ BMI is the
same as estimating the following equation:
                              yi = α + βXi
                                          ȳ − yi
                                 = α + β(         )
                                           n−1
                                            ȳ       1
                                 = α+β          −β      yi
                                        n−1         n−1
            1
Because −β n−1 is always 1, β = −(n − 1) < 0.




                                            9
whether the OLS coefficient in Column 1 is more extreme than synthetic coef-

ficients made of randomly resampled students from the same school. We take

students within a school and randomly reassign them into the classrooms of the

same size as the existing classrooms. Using the artificial classrooms, we estimate

the same specification as in Column 1 of Table 5 10,000 times, obtaining the

sample distribution of the coefficients under the null hypothesis that peers’ BMI

is random. Figure 2 shows that the median OLS coefficient from this exercise

is −0.964; 2,631 (26.3%) coefficients in the distribution that are greater than or

equal to our estimate of −0.742. We therefore conclude the observed coefficient

is in line with the mechanical bias of peer effects due to random assignment.

   We next turn to the reduced-form results in Column 2. This substitutes the

number of peer siblings for peer BMI in the regression and provide a first pass

at the impact of peer BMI. An increase of one in the average number of peer

siblings (1.37 standard deviations) reduces the student’s own BMI by a little

over one unit (0.36 standard deviations). That is, students who have peers with

more siblings have, on average, lower BMI.

   In Columns 3 through 6, we show two-stage least squares (2SLS) results,

which rest on the assumption that the variation in peers’ BMI induced by sib-

lings causes changes in the student’s own BMI. That is, introducing more high-

BMI peers will cause a student’s BMI to increase. We do not suggest that BMI

itself is “contagious,” but rather that the habits associated with higher-BMI

peers have an impact on one’s own habits and therefore BMI.

   Panel B shows the first-stage regression, with peer siblings exerting a signifi-

cant impact on peer BMI, as expected. These results are robust to the additional

of student controls, peer controls, and teacher controls in each subsequent col-

umn. Panel A shows the second stage of the results, with a one-unit increase

in peers’ average BMI increasing own BMI by 0.83 units. This estimate is the

opposite sign of the OLS estimate in Column 1, and is precisely estimated. It

does not vary much with the addition of controls in Columns 4-6, indicating

that peer BMI is uncorrelated with student, peer, and teacher characteristics


                                       10
and providing further evidence that random assignment holds in our data.

   The effect is somewhat larger than that in Trogdon, Nonnemaker and Pais

(0.52) and Mora and Gil (0.63) (Trogdon et al., 2008; Mora and Gil, 2013).

Christakis and Fowler examine the effect of peers on obesity rather than BMI,

finding that the chance of being obese increases by 57 percent if a friend is

obese (Christakis and Fowler, 2007). Our larger effects might be due in part to

the exposure of classroom peers to each other – that is, during the school day,

throughout the entire year; as one would expect, peer effects are larger when

the peer group is defined as those with whom an individual spends more time

(Carrell et al., 2009)

   Next, we examine the effect of peers’ BMI on the likelihood of a student

being overweight or obese. We use the definition of adolescents being obese

or overweight from the 2007 WHO Reference Chart for Boys and Girls, which

varies by gender and age. In Table 6, the dependent variable in Column 1 is

an indicator for a student’s BMI being greater than or equal to the overweight

cutoff and shows that a one-unit increase in peer BMI increases the likelihood of

being overweight by 10.8 percentage points, a meaningfully large impact given

that, on average, 19.9 percent of 7th graders are overweight. Column 2 is the

same specification for an indicator for the probability of being obese; the impact

of heavier peers is positive but imprecisely estimated.


Effects Over Time

We examine the effects of seventh grade peers’ BMI on eighth and ninth grade

BMI to see if the effects in Table 5 fade out. We are able to isolate seventh

grade peer effects from the later year’s peer effects because students are again

randomly assigned to a new classroom at the beginning of the new academic

year; however, the structure of GEPS2012 does not allow us to re-estimate con-

temporaneous effects, since eighth and ninth grade peers are not fully sampled.

In Table 7, we regress student’s weight outcomes in eighth or ninth grades on

peers’ BMI in seventh grade controlling for seventh grade school fixed effects


                                       11
and instrumenting for peer BMI with peer number of siblings.

   The first column shows that seventh grade peers on BMI still have an impact

in eighth grade, but about a third of the initial effect of about 0.8 has faded out.

By ninth grade, the impact of seventh grade peers no longer has a significant

impact on BMI. However, there is still a positive and significant impact on

the likelihood of being overweight even in ninth grade, suggesting that certain

children are particularly susceptible to peer influence on BMI (note, however,

that there are no significant effects for obesity). That is, the effects are transitory

for most students, but those who at risk of being overweight are more likely to

remain so.


Falsification Test

Cohen-Cole and Fletcher (2008a) suggest that finding peer effects on implausi-

ble characteristics, such as height, indicates flawed methodology and spurious

correlation. BMI is composed of both height and weight; there is no reason

why peers’ BMI should have a causal impact on a student’s height. We there-

fore separate height and weight and estimate the specifications in Table 5 in

Table 8. Panel A reports the estimates on height in centimeters. The OLS

coefficient in Column 1 is negative, as is to be expected. There is no impact

of peers’ height in the reduced form and 2SLS specifications; in Column 6, a

one-unit increase in average peer BMI is associated with 0.2 centimeter lower

height, both statistically and economically insignificant. In Panel B, we focus

on weight alone. In this case, the impact is large and precisely estimated, with a

one unit increase in peer BMI causing an increase of slightly over 2 kilograms in

own weight. Altogether, these findings provide more evidence that our results

are not spurious.

Discussion

We examine the effects of peers’ BMI on middle school student’s own weight

outcomes. The random assignment of peers in our data, combined with our

instrumental variables approach, enables us to identify endogenous peer effects.

We find that a one-unit increase in peers’ average BMI increases a student’s own

BMI by 0.83 units and the likelihood of being overweight by 10.8 percentage

points. We show that peers BMI still have an impact one year after exposure.

Effects on the likelihood of being overweight last longer, suggesting that the

peer effects are transitory for most students, but persistent for those who are

at risk of being overweight.

   Recent findings that obesity spreads through social network have been criti-

cized for not properly handling the challenges of non-random peer groups. Our

natural experiment, in which students are randomly assigned their classroom

peers, circumvents this problem. We instruments peer BMI with peers’ number

of siblings, which is negatively correlated with peers BMI but clearly indepen-

dent from own BMI, to account for contextual effects, the reflection problem,

and measurement error. We show that peer height exhibits no contagion, while

peer weight does, suggesting that our results are not spurious. Further, we doc-

ument a mechanical negative relationship between peers’ and own BMI when

we reassign students into artificial classrooms, providing further evidence that

our results are not driven by confounds.

   Our robust results on the social network effects provide strong evidence that

social factors play a large role in the obesity epidemic, suggesting the impor-

tance of approaching obesity as both a public health and a clinical problem.

That is, policy intervention to reduce overweight or obesity can have multiplier

effects by influencing on both targeted subjects and their peers, particularly for

adolescents.

age peers’ number of siblings. Student characteristics include student gender, family income, and
indicators for both parents living together, father having a bachelor’s degree or higher, and mother
having a bachelor’s degree or higher, and parents owning their home. Homeroom teacher character-
istics include teacher gender and indicators for less than five years’ experience, having a graduate
degree, and graduating from a teachers’ college. Peer characteristics are leave-out means of student
characteristics. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at school level.
