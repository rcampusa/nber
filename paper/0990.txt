                     Unionization and Firm Performance:
               The Impact on Profits, Growth and Productivity

                                  ABSTRACT



           This paper examines the impact of unionization on profit-

 ability, growth and productivity using time series data on over 900

 product line businesses in the North American manufacturing sector (pre-

 dominantly U.S.). The first section of the paper develops a simple

 theoretical framework for studying the effect of the union on firm

performance. A key result of this analysis is that information about

union wage and productivity effects is not sufficient to permit predic-

tion of the sign (or magnitude) of consequent changes in the rate of

return on capital; one must know the parameters of production and demand.

Expanding the model to allow for the effects of market structure and

alternative bargaining regimes establishes the need to examine several

indicators of firm performance in assessing the impact of the union.

The empirical analysis reveals sizeable negative union effects on profit-

ability, but growth, productivity and the capital-labor ratio appear to

be little affected by unionization in this data. The data are thus con-

sistent with a model of union-firm interaction in which collective bar-

gaining affects the distribution of profits, but leaves real magnitudes

unchanged. The evidence suggests, however, that unionization may have

longer term implications for efficiency since the impact on profitability

appears to fall most heavily on firms with relatively little market power.

           The history of collective bargaining in the US has been marked

 by dramatic episodes of confrontation which underscore the change union-

 ization brings to the operation of an enterprise. Yet strikes and lock-

 outs are only the most visible of pervasive differences in the employ-

 ment relationship in organized establishments. It is well known that

 a wide variety of changes in the employment contract and adjustments

 in management procedure followed the wave of organizing begun in the 1930s)

 In spite of the diffusion of many practices associated with collective

bargaining (seniority, grievance systems) recent research has revealed the

continuing existence of important differences between union and nonunion

establishments in policies governing compensation, exit and entry, dispute

resolution and internal promotion.2 As Freeman has argued, these differ-

ences reflect the complexity of the employment relation and the potential

for collective action to yield a different set of conditions in the pres-

ence of substantial information problems. Yet little is known about the

effect of these differences on the profitability of the firm.

          The large body of evidence on the union wage effect, for example,

is not sufficient to establish a union effect on profits. Other changes in

the employment contract may lead to firm or worker adjustments which either

reinforce or offset the effect of increased wages on costs. The potential

negative effects of work rules and protection of malfeasance are well known,

but some recent evidence suggests that unionization may also lead to Improve-

ments in operations through reductions in turnover, and changes in management

procedures.3 These considerations have motivated statistical comparisons of

union wage and productivity differentials. Freeman and Medoff have stated

the assumptions underlying this approach quite clearly:
                                    -2-


              Unionism may increase productivity in some settings
      and decrease it in others. If the increase in productivity
      is greater than the increase in average unit costs due to
      the union wage effect, then the profit rate will increase;
      if not, the rate of profit will fall.4

           As I show below, this inference is only valid under quite restric-

 tive assumptions. In general, it is not possible to infer changes in the

 rate of return on capital from information on union wage and productivity

 effects. The impact of the union on a firm's economic performance depends

 on the wage setting process, the structure of markets, and the technology

 of production. Although an analysis of wages and productivity provides

useful information about the operation of the firm under collective bar-

gaining, an assessment of the impact of the union on profitability requires

a direct examination. Furthermore, evaluating the efficiency consequences

of unionization requires analysis of several measures of the firm's economic

performance. Unionization works through more than one mediating factor,

and the impact of the union on a given measure of firm performance depends

on the particular context in which bargaining and production take place.

Thus, focus on a single indicator can be misleading.

          This paper uses microeconomic data on over 900 product line

businesses to gauge the impact of the union on economic performance. In

the first part of the paper, relatively simple models of the firm are used

to derive a number of hypotheses about the effect of unionization.   An

important aspect of the analysis is the role of market structure and the

institutional context of the wage setting process. A clear implication

of the theoretical analysis is the need to examine several indicators of

firm behavior in order to draw inferences about the operation and consequen-

ces of collective bargaining. Part II presents an empirical analysis of

Unionization and interfirm differences in the rate of return on capital,
                                      -3-

sales growth, and productivity. Part III provides a brief summary and

suggestions for further work.


                          I. A Theoretical Framework

            The starting point for the models developed in this section is

a single product monopolist with a constant elasticity demand curve and

a constant returns production process. Although pure monopolies are

rare, analysis of this case is useful because most of the firms to be

dealt with in the empirical work face a downward sloping demand curve

and enjoy some barriers to entry. Unionization enters the analysis in

two ways.    I first treat the collective bargaining process as a problem

of selecting a point on the firm's labor demand curve. In this context,

the firm is assumed to be free to choose the level of employment and to

adjust other decision variables in order to maximize profits. The second

treatment of unionization allows the two parties to arrive at a wage!

employment combination off the labor demand schedule. In this case, out-

put and input decisions depend on the objectives of the parties and speci-

fication of the bargaining process.

            The analysis yields results on several measures of firm behavior,

but focuses particularly on the rate of return on capital as the basic mea-

sure of profitability. While a given firm's objective is to maximize total

profits, some way must be found to scale total profits in order to provide

a basis for comparison with other (possibly different-sized) enterprises.

Because theory suggests that risk-adjusted returns should be equalized across

industries and firms, the rate of return on capital has been widely used in

empirical work. Other indicators of profitability, including various price-

cost margins, have been suggested in the literature and will be examined

in turn.
                                    -4-

The Monopoly Case

            The firm in this model is a profit maximizing monopolist facing a

demand curve with constant elasticity. For simplicity, the technology is

specified to be CES with constant returns.5 The supply of factors is per-

fectly elastic. Initially, I assume that the only effect of unionization

is an increase in the wage. The firm takes the wage as given and chooses

a level of employment consistent with its labor demand schedule. For the

moment, let the union markup over the competitive wage be determined out-

side the model. The wage relationship can be written as:

            w=w(l+mU)                                              (1)

where w is the competitive wage, m is the percentage markup and U is a

dummy variable which has the value 1 if the firm is unionized. The effect

of unionization on the firm can be developed from the solution of the firm's

maximization problem, given by:6

            max t   f(K,L)           L -   r   K                   (2)

            K,L

The first order conditions can be used to derive expressions for the opti-

mal quantities of capital and labor. These, in turn, can be substituted

into the definition of total cost to yield a cost function. Under con-

stant returns (and perfectly elastic factor supplies) this function has

the form:

                    C   A'g(w,r)Q                                  (3)

where g(w,r) is marginal cost, and A is an index of total factor prod-

uctivity. The optimal level of output is determined by the equality of

marginal revenue and marginal cost. With a constant demand elasticity,

marginal revenue is simply (l-)Q so that at the optimum (ignoring the
                                           -5-

 constant A ):

                 =   [g(w,r)    -
                                    â€”
                                         ]fl
                                    '1
                                                                   (4)

 Since the elasticity of marginal cost with respect to changes in the wage is

 simply a, labor's share, equation (4), implies that the elasticity of output

with respect to wage changes is -aq.

          Using (4) and the definition of profits, total profit can be written

as:

            =
                       1-1/ri            q-l
                                                 {g(w,r)]          (5)



Thus, the elasticity of total profits with respect to changes in the wage is:

                 =   a(l-q)                                       (6)

          These results provide clear predictions of the effect of unioniza-

tion on output, the capital-labor ratio and total profits. Assuming m >   0,
unionization leads to a decline in output of aqm percent, a decline in total

profits of a(l-)m percent, and a percentage increase in the capital-labor

ratio of am, where a is the elasticity of substitution.

          The effect on the rate of return on capital is less clear-cut. Clearly,

as long as q > 1, unionization will lower total profits in the absence of off-

setting productivity effects. If the stock of capital were unchanged, the

rate of return on capital would also decline. But the capital stock will not

remain constant. Whether it rises or falls depends on scale and substitution

effects. In the case of a CES production function, this elasticity is:

          kw =       a(a-)                                        (7)

Note that the scale effect is just the effect on output (-aq) because of the

constant returns assumption.
                                      -6-

             The net effect of an increase in the wage on the return on capital

 can be derived by comparing (6) with (7) so that:

                     =            -   = (l-o)                        (8)

Thus, the rate of return on capital will fall with an increase in the wage if

the elasticity of substitution is greater than one.7 Otherwise, the return

will rise.

             How will these results change in the presence of a union productiv-

ity effect? Following previous work, the productivity effect can be charac-

terized by a simple change in A, the index of total factor productivity. Let

A be the index before unionization, and d the union effect on productivity.8

The index after unionization is then:

          A=A (1 +       dU)                                         (9)

One way to illustrate the effects of unionization is to separate the effect

of the productivity index from the effects of factor prices. Changes in total

factor productivity have a direct effect on costs, while the wage effect

depends on labor's share. The optimal level of output with both wage and prod-

uctivity effects is:

          Q[A(l+dU} [g(w(l+mU),r)               ]                  (10)
In elasticity terms, the effect of unionization on output is then:


          flqum_                                                   (11)

Thus, if the productivity effect is positive, and equal to cm, there will be

no change in output under unionization. A negative productivity effect will

simply reinforce the wage effect.

          Equation (10) supports a similar conclusion about total profits.

But the effect on the return on capital depends on relative changes in the

capital stock. Using the notation developed in (10), the effect of unioniza-

tion on total profits can be written as:
                                            â€”7â€”

               =   (1-q)    (am-d).                                  (12)

 With a CES, constant returns production function, the expression for the

 effect on capital is:

           ku =    d(q-l)   + &m(a-q)                                (13)

 Inspection of (12) and (13) reveals that the productivity effect enters

 symmetrically, and thus has no effect on the rate of profit. Changes in

 the rate of profit depend on the elasticity of substitution:

          rI(Tt/k)u_ (l-q) (cm-d)       -
                                             [d(q-l)   + clm(a-q)}   (14)



                   = cm{l-aJ

As before, the rate of profit will rise or fall depending on al. In this

context, it is not possible to infer changes in the rate of profits from infor-

mation on wage and productivity effects unless a is known. Wage and produc-

tivity comparisons do yield clear inferences about total profits, output and

the capital-labor ratio.

Alternative Bargaining Models

          The above analysis assumes that the wage-employment bargain lies on

the firm's labor demand schedule. This assumption has significant analytical

power, since it allows one to treat the problem of unionization using the

theory of derived demand. However, two related aspects of the approach suggest

the need for further analysis. First, a variety of bargaining issues associa-

ted with work rules, the introduction of technology and compensation seem to

involve wage/employment combinations off the firm's labor demand schedule.9

Second, in a bargaining context, points on the labor demand schedule are un-

likely to be Pareto efficient. Unless the union has a fixed coefficient ob-

jective function, the contract curve will be off the demand curve. Since

either the firm or the union could be made better off without reducing the
                                   -8-

welfare of the other party, it seems reasonable to expect that attempts would

be made to move toward a more efficient bargain.10

          Any attempt to achieve a bargain off the demand curve greatly com-

plicates attempts to gauge the union's impact on firm performance. It is

necessary not only to specify the technology and demand parameters, but the

objective of the union and the specific bargaining process, including some

statement of relative power must also be brought into play. A definitive

treatment of those issues will not be attempted here. The more modest pur-

pose of this section is to illustrate the implications of alternative bar-

gaining setups using a relatively simple bargaining model.

          For our purposes, the complexity of the union-management bargain-

ing process can be simplified to the problem of choosing a point on a con-

tract curve defined by the objective functions of the two parties. The assump-

tion that the agreement lies on the contract curve implies that bargaining ex-

tends beyond wage rates to include, perhaps implicitly, the level of employ-

ment, and other aspects of production.11 A variety of instruments are avail-

able that effectively constrain production adjustments by the firm without

involving an explicit agreement on the number of workers, or the total hours

of work. Work rules and provisions covering new technology, can be inter-

preted as measures to achieve a bargain off the demand curve. Moreover,

various compensations rules (royalty payments, profit sharing, equipment dif-

ferentials) can have similar effects.12

          Although in practice, the outcome of bargaining where such provisions

play a role will depend on the character and distribution of information, I

will abstract from such difficulties here.   I assume that sufficient informa-

tion is available to allow the firm and the union to reach the contract curve.
                                     â€”9-


 As in the previous section, the analysis concerns a single product monopoly

 operating under conditions of constant returns. The objective of the firm

 remains the maximization of profits. The union's objective is to maximize

 the difference between the wage bill and the opportunity cost of employ-

ment in the firm. 13   This can be written as 11(w-w)L, where w is the wage

 in the absence of unionization, w is the realized wage and L is labor input.

The maximization problem confronting the firm and the union can be treated

as a two-step process. In the first step, the joint interest or surplus of

the two parties is defined and maximized by adjusting those variable    which

do not vary along the contract curve. The division of the surplus is deter-

mined in the second step through some process which reconciles competing

claims.

     Given the objectives specified above, the maximization problem can be

written as:

          max S   PQ-wL-rK+(w-w)L,                               (15)
          K,L
or

          max S = PQ-w L-rK                                      (16)
          K,L

          The addition of the two objectives results in a maximand which

is identical to the firm's objective in the nonunion setting. Under the

bargaining regime, the firm makes production decisions as though it faced

the nonunion wage. Thus, the stock of capital and the level of employment

(and thus output and price) are unchanged after unionization. Only the

wage varies along the contract curve. Given product demand and the oppor-

tunity cost of labor, the interests of the two parties are maximized at

the point of maximum monopoly profits. The division of the surplus depends
                                   - 10   -




on the form of the objective functions, the distribution of power and the

particular decision rules which are assumed to apply. Although the total

surplus is unchanged after unionization, workers share in profits, and thus

reduce returns to the firm. With capital unchanged, the bargaining model

unambiguously predicts a decline in the rate of return on capital.

          The presence of union productivity effects in the bargaining con-

text may lead to paradoxical results. A positive union effect, for example,

results in an increase in output and total profits (before divisions with

the union). Since the firm makes input and output decisions as though it

faced nonunion wage rates, the union productivity effect has the same impact

as would neutral technological change in the nonunion setting. The firm

behaves as though marginal costs had declined and increases output (and

lowers prices). Since the elasticity of demand exceeds one, the stock of

capital and labor input are increased in proportion.14 If the productiv-

ity effect is large enough, it may increase total profits sufficiently to

leave the firm's profits unchanged after division with the union. Even

in this case, however, the rate of return on capital will fall, since the

stock of capital will have increased.

The Implications of tiarket Structure

          The analysis thus far has been limited to the monopoly case. Dif-

ferences in product markets are likely to influence the impact of the union

in two ways. For any given wage or productivity effect, the response of the

firm to unionization may depend on the nature of competition it faces. Fur-

thermore, the size of the wage and productivity effects themselves may depend

on the structure of markets. This is particularly evident in the bargaining

model, where relative power influences the division of total profits. The

introduction   of market structure considerations requires a richer theoretical

framework than the monopoly model provides. Note that the effect of the union

on profitability in that model does not depend on the elasticity of demand.

Thus, little can be learned about market structure and the impact of the union

on profits in the single firm framework where competition is defined

solely in terms of the shape of a constant elasticity demand curve. The de-

velopment of a full-scale model of competition in oligopolies is beyond the

scope of this paper. It is possible, however, to suggest a number of impor-

tant relationships between firm performance and unionization in different

market settings using a fairly simple theoretical framework.

          In the model developed here, the firm undergoing unionization (firm

1) produces a differentiated product, and has several competitors. Demands

are assumed to be interdependent. In order to simplify the notation, it will

be useful to group the firm?s competitors into a composite, representative

firm, firm 2. Technology is assumed to be constant returns, and may differ

in the two firms. The reaction of firm 1 to unionization will depend on

the degree of product differentiation and the output and pricing rules which

govern competition. A convenient assumption is that the firms reach equili-

brium by maximizing joint profits. This framework ignores interesting com-

plications (e.g., unions and rivalrous behavior) but is sufficiently rich

to illustrate the basic issues.

          Expressed in inverse form, firm l's demand curve is:

          P1 =                                                     (17)
                 f(q1, '2'
with the partial derivatives of (17) assumed to be negative. Firm l's

profits can be written as:

                                                                   (18)

where a1 is marginal cost, and q1, q2, are equilibrium values. With only
                                                                                              15
a wage effect, unionization raises a1 and the effect on 71 is given by:

                                                              aq1 +
                                                                        2 a2 - 1]     (19)
          aa1             aa1                                 aa1
The first term in (19) is the output effect, while the second term captures

changes in the price-cost margin. It is the latter which is of central im-

portance in determining the effect of unionization on the return on capital

in different competitive situations. The effect of a wage increase on firm

l's capital stock will depend on the output effect and the elasticity of

substitution. Since output affects profits and capital symmetrically under

constant returns, output effects will cancel out. Changes in the return on

capital will depend only on changes in the price-cost margin and the

extent of substitution in production. However, variation in union impact with

variations in market structure will depend solely on changes in the price-

cost margin, since there is no reason to expect a to vary with the structure

of the product market.

             A further example suggests the plausibility of this result.

Consider the case in which the newly unionized firm 1 is one of many small

firms in an industry with a dominant firm. Suppose further that the

small firms largely accept the dominant firm's price (products are only

moderately differentiated) which is set in the usual way on the basis of a

net demand function. A rise in a1 in this setting (with the costs of other

firms constant) is likely to lead to a declining price-cost margin for firm 1

since a relatively small firm will be unable to recoup cost increases by

raising prices. In contrast, if firm 1 were the dominant firm, the

price-cost margin would be likely to change very little.16 As long as

an identical union wage differential was imposed in the two settings,

and as long as cr was identical, the effect on the return on capital

would be more negative where firm 1 had less power.17 While intuitively

reasonable, the notion that unionization has a stronger impact on less

powerful firms is only one among several theoretically possible outcomes.18

Strong conclusions must await empirical evidence.

             The effect of market structure on the union's impact is likely

to be unaffected by productivity effects. As long as the union effect on

productivity does not vary with market structure, and unless unionization

leaves costs unchanged, qualitative conclusions about the effect of

differences in competitive environments will be unchanged from the wage

only case. With unchanged costs, however, the profit effect depends

only on the elasticity of substitution and is thus independent of market

structure.

             Conclusions about the effects of market structure are somewhat

stronger if a bargaining model of wage determination is introduced. The

analysis is simplified because a negotiated wage change in the
                                   - 14   -




bargaining   model leads to no changes in output or prices in the unionized

 firm. While the profits of firm 1 are reduced, competitors are unaffected.

From the competitors' standpoint, unionization of firm 1 only affects

how the total profits of firm 1 (which are unchanged) are allocated. In

this context the effect of different competitive environments is straight-

forward. Since unionization does not affect real variables, the issue is

how post-union returns to the firm compare to the pre-union level of

profitability. As long as the wage differential is the same in different

competitive environments, the union effect on profits will depend on how

pre-union profits per unit of labor vary with the competitive environ-

ment.   Under the usual assumptions about firm behavior, this ratio will

be higher and, consequently, the firm's share of total profits will be

higher, the greater the market power of the firm. In effect, the more

competitive firms must give up a larger fraction of lower total profits

if the condition of constant wage differential is to be satisfied.19

          A union productivity effect does not change the conclusion.

If unionization affects productivity, the level and price of firm l's

output will change, and adjustments will be made among competitors in

order to maximize joint profits. Consider the case of a positive union

effect, accompanied by a wage increase, both of which are independent

of market structure. Consistent with the two-stage bargaining procedure

developed above, the firm is assumed to incorporate the productivity

effect into its calculation of total profits, before the surplus is

divided. Thus, the productivity change affects the calculus of joint

profit maximization in a manner exactly analogous to equation (19).

As before, assessment of the difference in union impact in different
                                            - 15   â€”




 competitive      settings depends on changes in the price-cost margin. Let

the relationship between total profits before and after the productivity

effect be given by it1        = (1   +
                                         61)n,   where 61 captures the cross-price

effects of competitors (the own price effect is assumed to just offset

the cost change) which will be positive. The firmts share of total

post-union profits is                =
                                         01, and the union effect on profits is
given by n/n = 01(1 + 61).               (Similar expressions can be written

for the firm in the less competitive setting -             firm   2.)   As in

the wage effect only case, the constant wage differential implies

that ((l-01)n)/L1 =
                             ((l-02)7t)/L2.      Substituting for       and recalling

that 7t1/L1 <               the equality of wages implies that Oi(1 +            <
                   n2/L2,                                                  61)
       +           Thus, the union has a smaller impact in the less competitive

environment.

Market Structure and Wage/Productivity Effects

              The simple model of oligopoly developed above suggests that

competition increases the response of firm performance to unionization.

This result rests heavily on the assumption that wage and productivity

effects are independent of market structure. Yet it has long been

argued that wage determination is affected by structural conditions in

the product market.21 Moreover, the nature of competition is likely to

affect both the opportunity and the incentive for the firm to improve

productivity after unionization. In both cases, however, the direction

of the effect is ambiguous. Although definitive predictions cannot be

derived, theoretical considerations together with existing empirical

evidence can be used to provide insight into likely directions of influence.
                                    - 16   -




           In   the case of compensation two conflicting effects govern the

relationship between market structure and the union wage effect. Firms

with substantial market power tend to earn above-average returns, which be-

come the target of union negotiations. From the union's perspective high

profits increase the firm's ability to pay and constitute a legitimate

ground for high wage demands. Furthermore, if returns substantially

exceed the opportunity cost of capital, a high wage level need have little

effect on the firm's long-term survival. In contrast, unionization of a

firm operating in a highly price-competitive market may lead to very

low long-term wage gains. Either the union will recognize the need to

moderate demands, or the firm will not survive. Thus the only competitive

firms observed are those with wages close to nonunion levels.

          The foregoing argument ignores the role of relative power in

wage determination. While it is true that in the extreme case of perfect

competition the scope for wage gains is constrained, within the set of

firms exercising some market power, the union wage differential may be

affected by the relative power of the employer. Because of its ability

to weather a strike, a firm with few competitors and substantial financial

resources may be less willing to make concessions than a firm with less

market power. Thus, unionization of a firm with high market share may

not lead to a larger differential over nonunion wages. This is particu-

larly true if the high market share firm has already foregone some profits

by paying relatively high wages. The desire to increase an applicant

queue, to avoid community censure or unionization have been suggested

in the literature as explanations of a positive correlation between market

share or concentration and the level of wages. In such a setting, the

added impact of unionization may be small.22
                                    â€” 17 â€”




           Existing   empirical evidence on the relationship between market

 structure and the union wage differential in U.S. manufacturing suggests

 that the constraint of competition and the power of the firm tend to be

 offsetting. Work by Weiss, and Freeman and Medoff suggests no statistically

 significant relationship between concentration and the union wage effect.23

While the direction of the effect is generally negative (i.e., the differ-

ential is smaller in concentrated industries) large standard errors pre-

clude strong inferences. The implication is that the wage effect is

unlikely to offset, and may reinforce the tendency for the union impact

on profits to be more negative as the number of competitors increases

and as market share declines.

          Whether this result continues to hold in the face of productivity

effects, however, is unclear. If positive union productivity effects are

larger and/or more likely in more competitive settings, the union impact

on profitability (and output) could be attenuated. The threat of economic

demise may be more apparent the more competitive the market, and thus

could provide compelling pressure for the firm to improve operations.

In the case of perfect competition, for example, any union wage effect

would appear to require some offsetting productivity gain to ensure

survival. Yet pressure to improve operations is usually presumed to

be present in highly competitive markets without unionization, leaving

no possibility of further improvements after the union is introduced.

If as before attention is confined to the set of firms exercising some

market power, then the potential for improvement would seem to be greater

in less competitive markets since organizational slack, or x-inefficiency

is likely to increase with market share.24 Whether potential gains are
                                   - 18   -




realized,   however, depends on the presence of pressure from sources besides

other competitors. Even though market-based pressure may be less, for

example, the internal pressure imposed by the union could motivate a

search for new methods and procedures which improve operating performance

and offset, perhaps partially, any union wage gains and inefficient work

rules. Furthermore, a vigorous organizational response to unionization

could be observed in high market share firms if satisficing behavior is

important in less competitive markets, and if the union threatens to

reduce firm performance below satisfactory levels.25

            In light of the empirical evidence on the union wage effect and

market structure, the preceding argument suggests that the union impact

on profitability may well be greater in firms with less market power,

even if all firms experience some positive union productivity effects.

If the more powerful firms are better able to recoup wage increases

by altering internal organization the tendency for competition to sharpen

the impact of the union will be reinforced.

            The theoretical analysis in this section suggests that the

impact of the union on various indicators of firm performance depends

on technology, the wage setting process and market structure.     The

basic qualitative results are summarized in Table 1. It is clear that

inferences about the net efficiency consequences of the union based on

a single indicator like productivity or profitability may be misleading.

Evidence about productivity is incomplete without information on wage

differentials and even then, any resultant changes in the rate of return

on capital may convey information about the extent of substitution

possibilities, but little else. Similar conclusions apply to other

indicators     taken in isolation. A finding, for example, that unionization

has no effect on growth could result from a bargaining model of wage

determination, and need not imply the existence of a productivity dividend.

Adding information on productivity (and other indicators) is thus essen-

tial. Only evidence on the pattern of effects over a number of indicators

yields insight into the consequences of unionization.


                               II. Empirical Analysis

          The analysis of Part I focused on three indicators of firm per-

formance, each of which may be affected by unionization. The approach

in the theoretical analysis has been to treat the two effects of unioni-

zation - wages and productivity -      in   the context of a reduced form

equation for firm performance. In the case of profits, for example,

the effect of the union is gauged through the following expression:

          it     B[AeX(l   +   dU)]   [g(w(l +    mU),r)]'               (20)


Clearly, profits and other measures of performance depend on technology,

exogenous factor prices, the structure of markets and the nature of demand.

Unionization is assumed to affect performance through changes in wages

and through its effect on productivity. While the various dimensions of

performance are clearly related to one another, the intent is not to

estimate a structural model of performance but to identify the impact of

unionization in otherwise comparable enterprises. The general approach,

therefore, is to estimate a set of reduced form equations which relate

indicators of performance to a similar set of control variables

(including unionization) which are treated as exogenous or predetermined.
                                         â€” 21 -



           The analysis makes use of micro data on individual "business

units" -   generally       divisions of a given corporation - which are referred

to as the "firm" The indicators of firm performance are defined as

follows:

           rate of return on capital (ROl):

              net income (pretax) divided by total capital invested
              in the business

           output growth (GS):

              rate of growth of deflated sales (price deflator
              is firm's estimate of an index of the price of
              output)

           labor productivity (QL):

              sales (or value added) divided by total employment

           These indicators reflect in part the theoretical analysis of

Section I, In part the availability of data. Profitability is measured

as the return on total capital invested, a measure long used in economic
              â€¢        â€¢
analysis and in business as a measure of performance.       26,, Total   capital

invested" has been used, since there is no meaningful distinction between

equity and debt capital in the data (a line of business). Although

primary emphasis is placed on the ROl measure, the impact of unionization

on the return on sales (ROS - a price-cost margin) will also be examined.

A second measure of profitability may be useful in interpreting the source

of union/nonunion differences in the return on capital (e.g., lower gross

margin versus higher capital intensity).

           The effects of unionization on output and growth are captured

using the rate of growth of sales deflated by an index of product prices.

Although the theoretical analysis dealt with the effect of unionization

on the level of output, the empirical work focuses on the question of

whether unionization affects the extent to which a firm expands or
                                       - 22   -




contracts   relative to its market. The only variable close to the theore-

tical output measure is the firm's market share. While results with market

share will be discussed, this variable may be less a measure of performance

(at least current performance), and more a measure of structural conditions

in the market.

            The productivity analysis uses two measures, sales per employee

and value added per employee.      While it would be desirable to have

better measures of labor input (hours worked, more detailed categories

of employment) they are not available. In addition, the only price

information available is the firm's estimate of its own selling price

expressed as an index, with 1973 =      1.00.     Without cross-firm variation

in the level of prices, only sector-specific price deflation (e.g.,

2-digit SIC) will be possible. As discussed below, an attempt will be

made to control for variation in the ratio of materials to labor and the

capital-labor ratio, and thus to estimate the effect of unionization

on total factor productivity.

            The equations to be estimated can be expressed in general terms

as follows:

            R0I.t = ROT (UN. ,Mt,NIjt,t,Ti)                               (21)

            GS. =    GS                                                   (22)


            QL.t =   QL                                                   (23)


where for the        firm at time t,          is a measure of unionization,

     is a vector of variables measuring the nature of the competitive

environment in the firm's narrowly defined market, 11it captures the

market structure of the firm's larger industry, H. is a vector of work-

force characteristics, T., is a technology vector, KL.t is the firm's
                                   - 23   -



 capital-labor   ratio, and ML. is the materials-labor ratio. (Note that the

 value-added version of (23) omits the materials-labor ratio.) The specifi-

 cation assumes that the price of capital is constant across firms; the

 inclusion of work-force characteristics is intended to control for variation

 in competitive wages, and in labor quality. A full listing of the variables

 included in the analysis is presented in Table 2.

           For the most part, the models spelled out in equations (2l)-(23)

 are straightforward. Performance depends on structural conditions, both

 outside the firm in its labor and product markets, as well as inside, in

 its technology. In practice, there is little information about technology

and differences across firms in this dimension are captured by 2-digit

SIC industry dummies and time trends. The data provide a richer set of

control variables for market structure. Indeed, equations (21)-(23)

depart from typical industry-level analysis in their specification of

the firm's market structure, in the richness of the control variables,

and in the dependence of productivity on market structure. In addition,

the reduced form character of the analysis results in the presence of

work-force characteristics (albeit industry-level characteristics, tenure,

years of education, demographics) in equations explaining profitability

and growth.

          The principal concern of the analysis is estimation of the overall

impact of unionization, and its impact in different competitive situations.

Industry-level measures of market structure include barriers to entry,

industry growth, concentration and the share of imports. The analysis

assumes, however, that conditions in the firm's own narrowly defined

market are the primary structural determinants of competition; this is

the focus of the analysis of unionization and market structure.

          Three variables are used to characterize the competitive environ-

ment the firm faces: the market share of the three largest competitors,

the number of competitors and the firm's own market share. These vari-

ables are intended to capture the size distribution of competitors, the

difficulty of anticipating competitor reaction, and the firm's relative

position. A variety of alternative measures of market structure using

combinations and permutations of these variables -   e.g.,   marginal con-

centration ratios, the Herfindahi index - were examined in the course of

the empirical work but were found to provide no additional insight or

explanatory power. It should be emphasized that the definition of the

market and what constitutes a competitor are defined by the reporting

business. Thus, the variables should be interpreted as measures of

market structure as perceived by the firm.

          The market structure variables enter the equations for profit-

ability and productivity, but the firm's market share has been excluded

from the growth equation to avoid redundancy. In the productivity

equation, market structure is included to capture any x-efficiency

effects or effects which may flow from relative size.

          The unionization variable is based on the firm's response to

the question: "Of all the employees in this business, what percentage

are unionized?" The questionnaire makes no attempt to define what

"unionized" means. Moreover, given the breadth of the work force involved

("all employees") there is likely to be a good bit of error in the

estimates. Fine distinctions between firms are not likely to be meaning-

ful. It is much more realistic to assume that the respondents will

accurately identify whether a business is completely nonunion, or whether
                                  - 26   -




 the fraction unionized falls in a broad range (e.g., 30%-60%). Most of

 the analysis, therefore, will use dummy variables to capture the union!

nonunion distinction, rather than relying solely on variation in the

percentage unionized.

          Before examining the source of the data in more detail, a brief

word about the exogenous variables in equations (2l)-(23) may be useful.

As noted at the beginning of this section, I treat unionization, market

structure and other control variables on the right-hand side of (2l)-(23)

either as exogenous or predetermined. A few of the variables are affected

by the firm's decisions and their use raises the issue of simultaneity

bias in the coefficients. Two variables deserve particular mention:

the firm's market share, and unionization.27

          The market share of the firm provides information about the

elasticity of demand and the firm's position relative to its competitors,

characteristics of the market which are likely to have a major impact

on profitability and which may affect productivity. I assume that these

are structural features of the competitive environment, and are not

affected by current profitability or productivity (the two equations

where market share enters). It is clear that performance will affect

structure over time, but existing evidence suggests that the lags are

likely to be quite lengthy.28 Of course, this assumption may be more

tenuous for rapidly growing markets, particularly where products and

firms are not well established. In order to test the sensitivity of

the conclusions about union impact to the inclusion of market share,

equations where market share is excluded will be estimated.
                                  - 27   -




           A further critical assumption in model specification is the
                                                                       exogen-

 eity of unionization. At issue is whether estimated coefficients on the

 union variables capture the impact of unionization, or whether they also

 reflect the process through which establishments are organized (e.g.

unions organize the least (or most) profitable firms). The view that

unionization is exogenous finds some justification on empirical grounds.

For the great majority of unionized firms in this sample, union status

was achieved prior to the time period covered by this data. Direct simul-

taneity is thus unlikely. It is of course possible that unionization

could be correlated with an unobserved "firm effect" which persists

through time, thus creating a correlation between union status and the

error terms in equations (21)-(23). But the unobservable character of

the effect, and the difficulty of predicting profitability (or other

performance measures) far into the future based on observables, makes

this possibility unlikely.

The Data Set

          The data used in the empirical work provide fairly detailed

information on performance, technology, market characteristics and union

status. Data are available on over 900 product-line businesses which

participate in the PINS project directed by the Strategic Planning

Institute.29 The Institute is composed of over 250 member companies

which participate in the project by supplying annual data on individual

businesses within the company. Data are currently available from 1970-80.

Not all businesses provide data for each year so that the design of

the data base is unbalanced. In addition to income statements and

balance sheets, the data set includes variables measuring the structure
                                 - 28   â€”



of the market in which the firm participates, and the competitive strategy

of the business.

          The data have a number of features which may affect interpreta-

tion of the results. The companies in the project tend to be large, diver-

sified corporations; many are found in the Fortune 500, and almost all of

them are found in the Fortune 1000. The analysis thus deals with the

effects of unionization among a set of firms which are not representative

of all firms in a given sector, but which account for a significant

fraction of the assets and people employed. Because the unit of observa-

tion is a line of business, a given company may report on several busi-

nesses. The businesses tend to be synonymous with operating divisions

of the company (e.g., the washer and dryer division of the Diversified

Appliance Corporation), but may include product lines within the divi-

sion (e.g., commercial washers and dryers) if the appropriate data are

available, and if the finer breakdown is useful to the company. The

definition of each business is thus left for the companies to decide,

although guidelines for the selection are provided by SPI.3Â° The lack

of a uniform definition of the unit of observation should be kept in

mind when interpreting the results.

          The data provided by the respondent companies are a mixture of

information available through accounting systems, and the respondent's

perceptions or assessments of particular variables. Thus, the rate of

growth of sales, or the gross book value of plant and equipment are

provided by the accounting system. Data on the number of competitors,

or the firm's share of the served market reflect the perceptions of

the respondent; the data sre not computed from information provided by

outside sources or other participating businesses in the same industry.

            The self-reported character of the data raises a question about

 its integrity. Two considerations suggest the data are of relatively high

 quality. First, the information requested is information of great value

 to the firm (e.g., its market share) and it seems reasonable to suppose

 that the firm is both in a position to know, and has expended effort to

 acquire accurate data. Second, a firm's participation in the project is

motivated by a desire to use its data in the models developed by SPI.

 Considerable effort is made to preserve confidentiality and ensure

quality: participating firms only have access to their own data;

sensitive data (profits) are reported in disguised or ratio form (e.g.,

return on sales); researchers at SPI run the data through an elaborate

procedure to check for consistency and follow-up gross errors with the

company.

The Evidence

           Table 3 presents means and standard deviations for selected

variables. The calculations are broken down by union and nonunion status,

and are based on data for North American (predominantly U.S.) manufacturing

businesses over the period 1970-80. Each firm-year is treated as a separate

observation, though some firms are not represented in each year. There are

902 firms in the sample, and thus an average of about five observations per
                                                31
firm (there are 4,681 observations in total).

           It is evident from the calculations that the unionized firms

are substantially older, and participate in markets that are growing some

what less rapidly than their nonunion counterparts. They tend to con-

front about the same number of competitors, and to compete in markets

where the largest firms have a slightly larger share of the market.

           As far as performance is concerned, the raw means suggest that

nonunion firms are more profitable, and that their sales are growing more

 rapidly   -   even more than could be accounted for by faster market growth.

 In terms of market share, however, there is no difference in the average

 levels. On the productivity side, union firms have a slight edge (1 percent)

 in value added per employee and a somewhat larger advantage in sales per

 employee; although firm conclusions await statistical analysis, it appears

 that the productivity differences may reflect differences in capital and

materials per employee.

               Estimates of various specifications of equations (21)â€”(23) are

presented in Table 4. Results with three sets of control variables are

examined. The first (control 1) uses a set of 2-digit (SIC) dummies,

a time trend and a set of time-industry interaction terms.32 The inter-

action setup allows each industry to have its own time trend, and is

equivalent to using industry-level deflators. The second set (control 2)

of controls adds all the variables on market structure and labor markets

from Table 2, except the firm's own market share. The final set (control 3)

adds market share and market share squared, and two variables which

measure the fraction of sales or purchases made to or from components

within the parent corporation (these variables control for differences in

transfer prices).

               In general, the evidence points to a sizeable negative effect of

unionization on profits, and small or insignificant effects on other

measures of performance. Consider first the union impact on ROl in

line 1. The negative coefficient on the union dummy in line la suggests

a decline of ROI of about 12 percent. Once additional controls for

market structure and industry labor markets are added, however, the

estimated effect increases to -4.1 percentage points, or a decline of

about 19 percent relative to the sample mean. While the market share

variables       in line ic are highly significant, they have little effect on

the union coefficient.

                A negative union effect is also evident when profitability, is

measured by the return on sales. Only the results with the full model

are presented (line id) but the results with other specifications are

similar. The size of the coefficient implies about an 18 percent lower

return on sales in union firms. The size and significance of the ROS

effect suggests that the decline in ROl arises primarily from a decline

in total profits, rather than an increase in capital intensity. Indeed

the similarity in the percentage changes in ROl and ROS implies that

unionization has only a small effect on the ratio of sales to total
           33
capital.

             The large negative union effects in the profit equations are

not repeated in the growth or productivity equations.        Although signi-

ficantly negative in line 2a, the union effect on the rate of growth

relative to the market is small and statistically insignificant, once

the characteristics of the market are introduced. The specification

reported in line 2b allows the market growth rate (RNG) to enter

unconstrained. Estimates were also obtained with the RMG coefficient

set equal to 1. The results were literally unchanged -       the union
coefficient was -0.67 with a standard error of 0.83.

            The evidence in line 2 implies that there is little difference

in the way union and nonunion firms participate in the growth of the

markets in which they operate. While this finding sheds some light

on the effect of unionization, it does not rule out the possibility

that unionization causes a one-shot decline in output relative to
                                  - 34   -




the   market. In order to examine this possibility, real growth was

replaced with the firm's market share as the dependent variable. The

union coefficient in the specifications corresponding to 2a and 2b, were

(with standard errors in parentheses): -0.016 (0.62), and 0.65 (0.52).

When other measures of the firm's market structure were omitted, the

union effect was -0.20 (0.64). There is thus no evidence of a union

effect on the firm's share of its served market. Since market share

reflects structural conditions in the market, the absence of a union

effect may only suggest that union and nonunion firms operate in

similar competitive environments. However, it would seem likely that

a sizeable negative union effect on the firm's output would register

in these data.

           The analysis in line 3 of Table 4 turns to the question of the

union productivity effect. Here, labor productivity is measured by

sales and value added per employee. Inclusion of LKL and LML in the

equation means that the union coefficient measures differences in total

factor productivity. As the results indicate, the choice of dependent

variable has little effect on the union coefficient, although the

sales specification in which materials and capital are included on the

right-hand side is statistically superior. Unlike the results for

profits and output growth, the union effect on productivity is unaffected

by the inclusion of the control variables. Even though many of the

structural variables are themselves significant, the union effect is

estimated at -0.02 (0.01) with or without them. When value added is

used, the union effect rises to -0.03 (0.0l).

           While the union coefficient in the sales specification is twice

 the size of its standard error, it is substantively small; moreover, with

 over 4,600 observations, the power of the evidence that the effect is differ-

 ent from zero is not overwhelming. Yet these results stand in contrast to

 the results of Brown and Medoff, who found a positive union productivity

 effect using data on 2-digit SIC industries by state.     Moreover, the

 results are contrary to some findings based on specific industries.36

Reconciliation of these disparate findings is beyond the scope of the current

paper, but it is possible to put the results here in some perspective. It

must be remembered that the PINS sample is not a random sample of firms in

the manufacturing sector. Furthermore, the unit of observation here is not

the establishment. The productivity measure refers to total employees of a

business unit, and thus includes a variety of occupational categories (e.g.,

sales, managers, engineers, accountants) not included or not included with

the same weight in the establishment-based Census of Manufactures. It

should be noted, however, that when productivity equations were estimated

controlling for the occupational mix in the firm's 3=digit SIC industry rio

change in the results was obtained. It might be argued that failure to

control for the blue collar/white collar mix would bias the union coefficient

downwards since unionized establishments are likely to be more blue collar

intensive, and would therefore be somewhat less productive than white collar

intensive establishments (assuming white collar workers are more productive).

That argument, however, makes little sense within a 3-digit industry where

the technology of production would seem to leave little scope for large

differences in occupational mix.

                  Beyond the issue of comparability, it is important to note that
the question of the union effect is ultimately an empirical question.

There is no reason to suppose that the union effect has the same sign

or magnitude in every industry. In fact, the average effect estimated

in line 3 masks some differences across industries. Using the simple spe-

cification in line 3a, estimates of the union effect were obtained for

each 2-digit industry. While the majority of the industry effects (and

the bulk of the sample) were quite close to the average of -0.02, positive

union coefficients (6-17 percent) were found in textiles, furniture, and

petroleum, and negative effects (4-18 percent) were found in lumber, stone,

clay and glass, transportation equipment, and instrument manufacture.

These estimates may reflect differences in the union/nonunion mix of

component 3-digit industries, but they do suggest some diversity of

effects. Evidence from previous industry case studies suggests that

the nature of the union's impact on productivity depends on a complex

interaction between management adjustment and union policy and action,

tion         in the firms in this sample leads to little change in productivity,

but the results suggest the need for further analysis of industry effects.

Alternative Measures of Unionization

                  Thus far, the analysis has been based on a relative simple speci-

fication of unionization. The results in Table 4 are in effect compari-

Sons of conditional means for union and nonunion firms. It is possible

to construct additional measures of unionization which may enrich under-

standing of its impact. Three possibilities are pursued in Table 5. The

first is simply to enter the percentage of employees unionized in place

of the union dummy. The second breaks up the percent unionized variable
                                    â€” 37 -



 into   the three categories: less than 30 percent, between 30 and 60 per-

 cent, and over 60 percent. These two measures are combined in the third

 approach through the use of a linear spline function. For the problem

 at hand, the spline variables are written as:

            Z30       U      0<U<30
                      30     U>30
            Z60 =     0      0<U<30
                  =   U-30   30<U<60
                  =   30      U>60
            Z60-i-= 0        0<U<60
                 = U-60      U>60
where U is the percentage unionized.     The variables are constructed to

eliminate discontinujtjes at the breakpoint, and to allow the union

effect to vary with the percent organized, with different slopes in the

different ranges. The coefficients on these variables measure the slope

of the function over the specified range.

            The alternative measures of unionization are examined in Table 5,

using the full set of control variables (control 3) as defined in Table 4.

It is evident that the basic results on profitability, growth, and pro-

ductivity are little affected by the new forms of the union variable,

although some interesting patterns emerge in the comparisons between

measures. A large negative effect on profitability is found under all

specifications, but the monotonicity of the effect implied by the use

of percent organized is dubious. The spline function shows a strong

negative effect from 0 to 30 percent, and then no significant slope

thereafter; the slope over the final range is actually positive. Use

of three dummy variables suggests some differences depending on percent

organized, but statistically, the differences are not particularly signi-

ficant. A comparison of the standard errors of estimate for these equations

 and the comparable equation (ic) in Table 4 shows that the alternative

 measures of unionization provide little explanatory power beyond the

 union dummy.

           Similar statements apply to the growth and productivity equations.

 Although some differences in the various coefficients appear, the data

 appear to have little or very weak information about any differential effect

 of changes in percent organized. As noted earlier, this is likely to be

 a reflection of measurement error in the basic unionization variable.

 In light of the evidence, the remainder of the paper focuses on results

with a simple dummy variable to capture the effects of unionization.

Implications of the Basic Results

          Seen in terms of the models developed in Section I, the results

in Tables 4 and 5 appear to be inconsistent with the simple monopoly model

with the firm on its demand curve. If the union wage effect in these data

were in the proverbial 10-15 percent range, the profit results could imply

an elasticity of substitution on the order of 2. Yet, with a union wage

effect, growth and market share in the simple model should have declined

substantially; instead, the evidence suggests little change. Since pro-

ductivity also changes very little, there appears to be some support for

the simple bargaining model in which only a wage effect is present.

          Additional evidence on the bargaining interpretation of these

results is provided by examination of the capital-labor ratio. Neither

capital nor labor should deviate from nonunion values in the face of

unionization if wages are bargained through a process of joint profit

maximization as described in Section I. Thus, if the bargaining model

is correct, the union coefficient in an equation explaining the capital-

labor ratio should be zero.

          Within   the framework sketched out in Section I, the capital-labor

ratio is determined by technology and relative prices, but is unaffected

by market structure. In practice, it is important to control for differ-

ences in the market and industry, since the choice of technology is likely

to be closely related to the types of products the firm manufactures.

Evidence on the capital-labor ratio, therefore, is examined in the con-

text of a model which includes controls for industry structure, tech-

nology, and labor market characteristics, but which excludes the firm's

market share and the characteristics of its competitors.38

          Table 6 presents estimates of the union effect on capital per

employee under three specifications. The first includes only 2-digit

industry dummies and industry-time interactions. The second adds controls

for the labor market and the product at the 3- and 4-digit level. The

third specification adds a set of controls for the extent of vertical inte-

gration (ratio of purchases to sales and share of internal components in

those purchases), in order to control for differences in technology in the

chain of supply. Results were obtained with arithmetic and logarithmic

versions of the dependent variable, and in both cases the union effect is

not significantly different from zero, once the control variables are

added. In line lc, for example, the union dummy has a coefficient of

-129.6 and a standard error of 89.1. The effect is also substantively

small: compared to the sample mean of 3174, the union coefficient con-

stitutes a decline of about 4 percent.

          The difference in sign between the arithmetic and logarithmic

versions suggested the possibility of outliers in the data. Examination

of the residuals in equation lb revealed a small number (a little over

1 percent of the sample) of observations with residuals far from the

median.   These were primarily chemical processing firms, a sector in

which extremely large values of capital per employee would be expected.

Estimation without the outliers had no material effect on the magnitude

of the coefficients. The conclusion that the union effect is not signi-

ficantly different from zero is unaffected by discordant observations.

Evidence on the capital-labor ratio thus provides further support for

the bargaining interpretation of the union's impact on firm performance.

Union Effects and Flarket Structure

           It is obvious from the evidence developed in Tables 4-6 that

unionized firms earn substantially lower returns than their nonunion

counterparts. As far as other measures of performance are concerned, how-

ever, unionization appears to have only a minor impact. While the evi-

dence is thus not inconsistent with a bargaining model of unionization

and firm performance, broader inferences about the union's impact on the

allocation of resources must be viewed with some caution. It might be

inferred, for example, that unions affect the division of total excess

return between workers and the firm, but have little impact on the use

of real resources. Yet even if that characterization were to apply to

the sample average, there may well be some diversity in the pattern

of effects across competitive situations which could have real effects

over the longer run. It matters whether the average effect reflects

a situation in which the union extracts substantial gains from firms

with monopoly power, leaving the competitive sector little changed, or

whether the bulk of the union impact falls on firms with little market

power.

           The analysis in Section I suggested a number of reasons why

the union's impact might be different in different contexts, and in fact,
                                  - 43   -




 why the union may have a relatively larger impact on the smaller firms.

 Some insight into the effects of unionization in different environments

 is provided in Table 7.

           Estimates of the basic model are presented for subsets of the

 overall sample defined on the basis of market share. High market share

 firms are defined as those with more than 35 percent of the served market;

the cutoff point for low-market share firms is 10 percent. This approach

is relatively crude, since other aspects of the market may be important

in determining the nature of competition and the firm's market power. A

10 percent share has a different meaning in a world where the principal

competitors have 3 or 4 percent. While acknowledging the approximate

nature of the approach, the use of market share should capture the

basic tendencies in the data.

          Estimates of the union effect on performance are presented in

line 1 of Table 7; Table 8 provides mean values of the performance

measures. The results are revealing. Unionization has an extraordinary

effect on the return on capital in low-market share firms. Taken at

face value, the estimated coefficient (-4.7) implies something close to

a 40 percent decline in profitability due to unionization. A similar

decline emerges in estimates using the return on sales. This large

decline in profits among low-market share firms stands in contrast to

the results for firms with substantial market power. The estimated

effect In column 4 is statistically and substantively insignificant.

Whereas unionized firms with less than 10 percent share earn much

lower rates of return, profits among the "rich and powerful" appear

to be little affected by unionization.

           The contrast is not nearly as sharp for the other performance

measures. There appears to be some difference in the growth equation,

with lower share firms having a positive union effect. But the

coefficients are not significantly different. The estimated produc-

tivity effects are identical, although the coefficient for the high

share firms has a larger standard error. For the low-market share firms,

the pattern of effects across performance measures is much like the overall

results in Table 4. Unionization is associated with a large impact on

profits and small or negligible effects on productivity and growth. Among

high share firms, however, unionization has no statistically significant

impact on firm performance.

           Estimates were also obtained for the balance of the sample. The

results revealed a lower union impact on productivity as market share

increased, but the decline does not appear to be smooth. Among firms with

market shares of 10-20 percent, the data suggest a union effect of -2.4

(1.7), or about 12 percent of the mean. The estimates for firms with

20-25   percent   of the market was -5.8 (1.8), or 22 percent, quite close

to the sample average. In view of the fact that the effect vanishes

among firms with over 35 percent market share, it seems clear that the

high-market share firms in Table 7 form a distinctive group.

            The theoretical analysis in section I provided several reasons

why the impact of the union on profitability might be larger among firm's

with less market power. Without information on relative wages (which is

not available) it is not possible to draw firm conclusions, but the evi-

dence appears to be consistent with studies which found little relation-

ship between market structure and the union wage effect. In the context
                                    - 47   -




 of   the bargaining model, a constant union wage effect across market struc-

 ture implies that unionization will fall more heavily on the less powerful

 firms.

            While this line of thinking seems appropriate for most of the

 firms in this sample, a different explanation is likely to apply to those

 firms with substantial market power. The absence of a profit effect

among high share firms could imply no union wage effect, but that is

contrary to most of the evidence on the subject developed to date. A more

appealing alternative relies on the possibility of limit pricing behavior.

It does not seem far fetched to suggest that the firms in the high share

group enjoy some barriers to entry (average market share     50 percent)

and may be limit pricing. If so, no profit effect would be observed

even if unions raise wages, as long as the union effect was reflected

in the limit price. If the limit price were below the monopoly price,

and if the union imposes a cost which would be borne by new entrants, the

limit pricing firm will adjust the limit price to cover the added costs,

Leaving tue price cost margin uncnangea.

            The evidence on market structure and union effects provides

some perspective on the overall results, and suggests a number of inter-

esting hypotheses about the union impact. The evidence on profitability

is consistent with the models of competitive interaction developed in

Section I. Unionization appears to bear most heavily on those firms

whose profitability is already at a relatively low level. A dispropor-

tionate effect on less powerful firms raises the possibility that union-

ization influences processes of entry and exit and thus the structure of

the market. This notion is not unreasonable. Williamson has argued

precisely this point in the coal industry, and the effect of the UAW
                                 - 48   -



on the smaller automobile companies in the l950s provides a further

historical example.4Â° This obviously depends on the extent of organiza-

tion in the industry and the ability of new or smaller firms to avoid

unionization.

          It is difficult to pursue these hypotheses in the PINS data,

since the observations pertain to a single firm, while the hypothesis

involves the extent of unionization in an industry. Because the data

set is not necessarily composed of observations on direct competitors,

and because little information about competitors is available (e.g.,

the extent to which they are unionized), it is not possible to examine

what are essentially industry dynamics. In this case one is left with

suggestive results about the incidence of the union impact on profits and

a number of working hypotheses about longer-term effects on competition;

the need for further research is clear.


                            III. Conclusions

          This paper has developed a framework for analyzing the effect of

unionization on firm performance, and has provided empirical evidence on

several indicators, including rates of return on total capital and sales,

output growth, market share, productivity and the capital-labor ratio.

The analysis provides clear evidence that, on average, unionized firms

earn substantially lower returns than nonunion firms operating in com-

parable technological and competitive environments. It is also evident

that other dimensions of performance, particularly, growth and capital-

labor substitution, are little affected by unionization in this data.

The evidence is thus consistent with a bargaining model of union-firm

interaction, in which the union affects the distribution of profits, but

has little effect on output, or factors of production.
                                   - 49   -




          This   characterization of the union's effect has some interesting

implications. It explains why unionized firms may survive over long periods

of time, and why the owners of capital would be strongly opposed to unioniza-

tion. The evidence suggests further that the issue of the impact of the

union on resource allocation is really a question about the long run. In

this data, at least, efficiency effects would seem to derive from differences

between firms with and without market power, and from differences between

industries. Interpreted literally, the results point to factors which

influence the maintenance of union organization, and exit and entry behavior

as the key determinants of the union's impact on efficiency. One implication

is that research on these problems could benefit from analysis of unioniza-

tion in specific firms and industries with emphasis on the historical

perspective. Such longitudinal analysis, if carried out over a period of

time long enough to allow for entry and exit, would be a valuable addition

to the literature.

          These comments are not meant to imply that the questions about the

union's impact on the firm which motivated this study have been answered.

The analysis is suggestive of a possible interpretation, but it is well to

remember that the evidence in favor of the bargaining model is largely

negative: the data fails to reject the notion that unionization has no

effect on output or factor use. Furthermore, the special nature of the

PINS data suggests caution in embracing the bargaining model as generally

applicable. Even within the data set there is some indication that the

impact of the union may differ in different competitive settings. Further

analysis of the impact of the union on the firm, of possible differences

in productivity effects by industry and of the role of the union in

competitive dynamics within an industry seems warranted.

5. The model developed in this section is a special case, but it illus-
    trates the point that the impact of a union induced wage increase on
    the rate of return on capital depends on the parameters of production
    and demand. Only in the case where the price of output is fixed does
    the union wage increase have an unambiguously negative effect on the
    rate of return on capital. This can be seen by expressing the rate of
    return on capital, as:

                     n/K =   [-
     and (with the price fixed) calculating the logarithmic differential.
     This yields:

               dln() =   1[dln(Q/L)
                                      -
                                          (l-ci)dln(K/L)]   -
                                                                j&dlnW,
     where a is labor's share.

     Assuming that the changes in these variables were caused by unioniza-
     tion, the term in brackets is the union productivity effect, while
     the change in the wage is the union wage effect. With no productivity
     effect, and assuming that unionization raises the wage, the rate of
     return on capital will fall. If the price is allowed to vary (i.e.,
     if the firm is assumed to have a downward sloping demand curve) one
     obtains the same result as given in the text. In general, the direc-
     tion of the effect also depends on the elasticity of demand and returns
     to scale.

6. Note that I have defined profits net of a required return to capital.
    Doing the analysis in terms of gross returns would change the magnitude
    of the calculated elasticities but would have no effect on the signs;
    since the required rate of return is assumed to be fixed, the sign of
    changes in the gross rate of return (required plus excess) arising
    from a wage increase depends on the sign of changes in the excess
    rate of return.

7.   If returns to scale are not constant, then the sign of (n'k)w will
     depend on the elasticity of demand, and the degree of
     returns to scale, as well as the elasticity of substitution.

 8. It is important to note that the effect of the union is assumed to
     apply to the production process as a whole, rather than to a particu-
     lar factor of production. The assumption of a "neutral" productivity
     effect is roughly consistent with existing evidence that unioniza-
     tion affects all aspects of the enterprise. (See Clark and
     Slichter et al.) The notion that it affects them all equally,
     however, is only an assumption.

 9. Warren-Boulton describes several such measures in his work on
     vertical control by unions.

10. The likely inefficiency of points on the demand curve is a central
     feature of the work of Hall and Lilien; for a recent treatment of
     the bargaining problem, see HcDonald and Solow.

11. If the wage alone were subject to agreement, with the firm free to
     adjust output, prices and other factors, the firm would choose a
     point on its demand curve. Note that the bargaining model
     implicitly assumes that the relationship between the union
     and the firm persists indefinitely. A richer analysis would
     deal with the question of maintenance of organization.

12. See Warren-Boulton, pp. 119-156 for an intensive analysis.

13. This assumption has been used by de Ilenil and Rosen. The implica-
     tion is that the union seeks to maximize the rents associated with
     bargaining collectively.

14. A neutral change in technology (to which a union productivity effect
     is equivalent) has two effects on factors of production. The first
     is a direct reduction in input requirements equal (in percentage
     terms) to the productivity effect. The second is an increase in
     requirements through lower prices and increased output; the second
     effect depends on the elasticity of demand. If d is the produc-
     tivity effect, the impact on K and L, for example, is d(q-l).

15. The assumption of differentiated products is crucial here. Without
     it, joint profit maximization would imply that q1 would go to zero,
     with some kind of ex-post redistribution of profits. The analysis
     without differentiated products is equivalent to the problem of
     the multiplant monopolist.

16. This assumes that interdependence effects are minimal.

17. It should be noted that the mental experiment here is to compare an
     otherwise identical firm in two different market settings. The
     issue is not the profitability of the unionized firm relative to its
     competitors, but rather the differences in profitability within the
     same firm in the two different environments.

18. This conclusion can also be illustrated in a model where a large
     firm is limit pricing behind barriers to entry. If unionization
     leads to an increase in average costs and an increase in the limit
     price, there will be no observed effect on profits, as long as the
     new limit price is less than the profit maximizing price. All
     of these examples are merely illustrative. Other models suggest
     different conclusions. For example, a Cournot model of duopoly
     implies that unionization of the smaller firm actually reduces
     margins by less than unionization of the larger firm. But this
     model abstracts from cross-price effects and assumes a common
     output price. I am indebted to Therese Flaherty for these
     examples.

19. Note that the firm is assumed to face the same pre-union wage no
     matter what the product market environment. With the same union
     differential it must be the case that post-union wages are identical.
     In a bargaining model, the post-union wage can be expressed as
     w = ((1_O)n*)/L, where it* is total or pre-union profits, L is
     labor input, and 0 is the firm's share of total profits. Note
     that 0 also measures the extent of decline in the firm's profit-
     ability. Consider a firm in two environments, one a competitive
     situation (firm 1), the other a situation where the firm has much
     more market power (firm 2). Since post-union wages are equal,
     ((1-01)it)/L1 =                      It is reasonable to expect
                       ((1-02)rt2)/L2.
        <     and L1 > L2. Thus, wages can only be equalized if l < 02
     which implies that profits must fall more in the competitive situation.

20. The discussion here abstracts from any rivalrous behavior. It
     is assumed that competitors accept reformulation of prices and
     outputs caused by the union. But it may be that competitors
     come out worse off, since some of the union's gains may come out
     of their profits. Whether the consensus holds up or breaks down
     may depend on the relative power of the unionized firm. Thus,
     even in the case of rivairous behavior, it is likely that unioniza-
     tion will have less impact on the more powerftl firm.

21. See the papers by Weiss and Segal for a discussion of the theoretical
     and empirical issues.

22. This argument is made by Weiss, who also finds some support for the
     queue explanation. Similar conclusions apply to the work of Ashen-
     felter and Johnson.

23. See Weiss, and Freeman and Medoff (1981); additional evidence can be
     found in the paper by Pugel.

24. It is evident that such considerations apply only to firms enjoying
     some barriers to entry. The tendency for inefficiency to increase
     with market share has been inferred from the quadratic nature of
     the relationships between rates of return and market share. See
     especially the work by Shepherd.

25. The analysis has not treated the potential impact of unionization on
     market structure. While principal concern is with the effect of the
     union on the firm, it is clear that the extent of unionization within
     an industry could affect the nature of competition, both by affect-
     ing entry conditions, and communication about costs. Furthermore,
     if the union pursues a common wage policy, marginal competitors could
     be eliminated. The net result of these considerations is likely
     to be a larger impact of the union on less powerful firms.

26. The net income measure is based on conventional accounting practices
     which treat R&D, advertising and other marketing costs as expenses.
     Neither income nor cajital have been corrected for inflation in the
     results reported below. Capital is valued at historical costs and
     net income is taken as reported. However, a relatively crude attempt
     was made to restate capital in current prices, and to correct for
     profits on inventories.   (The PINS data provide an estimate of
     the replacement value of plant and equipment.) Since this correc-
     tion was a very rough cut, and since it had no effect on the
     estimated impact of the union, results with the conventional
     profitability data are presented below.

27. The capital-labor ratio is also endogenous, but it is used to control
     for the effect of the union on productivity which works through wages.
     The union coefficient is thus to be interpreted as an estimate of
     d, the union effect on total factor productivity.

28. See the paper by Martin for estimates of the lagged relationship
     between performance and structure.

29. The PINS data have been used in several analyses of strategy and
     performance. See in particular papers by Gale, Buzzell and
     Ravenscraft and Scherer.

30. The governing principles are that the business serve a well-defined
     set of customers, and face specific competitors.

31. The panel structure of the data does not permit estimation of a model
     with a fixed firm effect, since union status does not change within
     the sample period. It is possible that the efficiency of the regres-
     sion could be improved by allowing for a more complicated covariance
     structure (e.g., across firms and overtime). However, the unbalanced
     nature of the design makes this approach computationally burdensome
     and it has not been pursued.

32. Results with time dummies are very similar. Clearly, the cross-
     section variation in the data dominates variation over time.

33. This is in fact confirmed in the data. A regression with (S/K) as
     the dependent variable using the full model has a union coefficient
     of 0.09 (0.04). The mean of S/K is 2.29, which suggests a difference
     in S/K of about 4 percent.

34. Some estimates were obtained with a union-time interaction term,
     but the overall results were little changed; the interaction term
     was not statistically or substantively significant.

35. See Brown and Medoff.

36. Clark and Frantz found positive union effects in the cement and
     furniture industries.

37. The most explicit treatment of this issue is found in Clark.

38. In effect, the industry variables play the role of 3- and 4-digit
     SIC industry dummies.

39. See the paper by Duchatelet and Flaherty for a theoretical analysis
     of limit pricing which suggests that it may be a more pervasive
     phenomenon than previously believed.

40. Macdonald documents the effect on the so-called "Independents" of
     UAW wage policy. In this case, some of the smaller firms (i.e.,
     Studebaker) actually paid wages above those at the larger firms.
     This "pattern-plus" approach to bargaining between the UAW and
     the smaller companies may have affected the "Independents" ability
     to compete and may have contributed to their eventual demise.
