The Return to Hours Worked Within and Across Occupations: Implications for the Gender
Wage Gap

                                         ABSTRACT

We document two empirical phenomena. First, the observational wage returns to hours worked
within occupation is small, and even negative in some specifications. Second, the wage return to
average hours worked across occupations is large. We develop a conceptual framework that
reconciles these facts, where the key insight is that workers choose jobs as a bundle of
compensation and expected hours worked. As an example, we apply this framework to the gender
wage gap and show how it can explain the view expressed in recent work that hours differences
between men and women represent a large and growing component of the gender wage gap.

    1. Introduction

        Employed women work, on average, three to five hours fewer than employed men, even

controlling for demographics and occupation. 1 A recent literature, including Bertrand et al.

(2010), Gicheva (2013), Cha and Weeden (2014), Goldin (2014), Goldin and Katz (2016), and

Cortes and Pan (Forthcoming), has argued these gender differences in hours worked and

preferences for job flexibility are crucial to understanding the gender pay gap. 2 In order for hours

worked to have a significant bearing on the gender wage gap, it must be the case that the wage

return to hours worked is meaningful. While prior research has documented significant

heterogeneity in the income elasticity of hours worked across occupations, the average estimated

income elasticity is close to unity. 3 This implies that the wage-hours elasticity is close to zero

and thus incapable of explaining, in an accounting sense, a substantial fraction of the gender

wage gap across all workers.

        Consequently, we carefully examine the relationship between weekly hours worked and

wages. We show that weekly hours worked is not strongly associated with higher wages within

occupations. 4 Using individual data from the 2016 ACS, we find that a 10% increase in hours is

associated with 1% lower hourly wages. 5 Even accounting for measurement error, wages tend to

be only weakly related to hours worked. In contrast, we show that across occupations, there is a

large, positive relationship between occupation-level average hours worked and occupation-level

average wages. Again, using the 2016 ACS, we estimate a 10% increase in the average hours

worked in an occupation is associated with a 20.3% increase in average wages in the

occupation. 6

           To reconcile the differences in returns to hours within and across occupations, we

propose a simple framework relating hours worked and compensation. We envision a job as an

employment contract where compensation is a function of both expected hours worked and

actual hours worked. We allow the relationship between compensation and expected hours to be

different than the relationship between compensation and actual hours.

           A natural example of such a difference is found in salaried jobs, where the compensation

implicitly depends on the amount of work to be done (expected hours), but at the margin, wages

will have a negative relationship with actual hours worked. In jobs paid at hourly rates, the

relationship between hours worked and wages is naturally small, though may be larger than zero

when accounting for the possibility of overtime work. However, at the occupation level,

compensation for wage workers can increase with occupation level hours worked, as workers

who commit to more expected hours may receive a wage premium.

           It may be the case that even gender differences in hours within occupation may be due to

differences in expected as opposed to actual hours. This is consistent with Cortes and Pan

(Forthcoming), who conjecture that the large pay gains associated with closing gender hours

gaps suggests that relaxing hours constraints on women “enabled [them] to enter a different

job… within the same occupation” and that “shifts in women’s position in the males’ earnings

distribution are unlikely to occur if women simply worked more hours and stayed in the same

job.” It is also consistent with the findings of Hirsch (2005) who finds, using a person fixed

effects design, that the wage losses associated with part time work largely disappear when one

controls for industry, occupation, and task measures. If the difference in hours worked by men

and women within occupation is largely driven by differences in expected hours worked across

jobs, then pricing male-female hours differences may be best accomplished using the

occupation-level relationship between wages and hours. 7

        Empirically, we find that if we account for gender differences in hours using the price

implied by a regression of wages on individual level hours, this actually widens the residual

gender wage gap, as increased hours are associated with lower wages. In contrast, if we price

hours based on the cross-occupation wage-hours relationship, even controlling for occupation

task characteristics, the residual wage gap drops by half. If we perform the same exercise, but do

not control for occupation level task characteristics, the residual gender wage gap closes almost

entirely. These pricing exercises indicate that, as argued in prior literature, hours worked may

play a critical role in accounting for the gender wage gap, and the degree to which this is

important depends on the nature of hours differences between men and women.

        We also document that the relationship between hours worked and wages has been

increasing over time both at the individual and occupational level. Given the gender gap in

hours, this finding suggests that women have been swimming upstream in terms of achieving

wage-parity with men. When pricing gender differences in hours at the individual level from

1980 to 2016, these changing returns to hours worked exacerbate the gender wage gap by nearly

20%, similar to the conclusions of Cha and Weeden (2014). However, when we use the

occupational-level relationship between hours and wages to price gender hour differences, our

estimates imply that the gender wage gap would be as much as 46% lower if returns to hours



7
 Supporting evidence for this is found in Cortes and Pan (Forthcoming), who find that when hours constraints on
women are relaxed, this results in different occupational choices and not simply more hours worked within an
occupation.

                                                        4
worked had remained at 1980 levels. Thus, even as the educational attainment of women has

surpassed that of men and they have been increasingly employed in higher wage occupations,

this increasing returns to hours worked has worked against wage-parity.

        We view our paper as complementary to the existing literature on the role of hours in

explaining gender gaps in compensation. 8 Much of this literature has documented important

heterogeneity in the returns to hours worked across occupations, such as Bertrand et al. (2010),

Goldin (2014), and Goldin and Katz (2016), who show much higher returns to working longer

hours in law and business occupations than occupations such as pharmacists, and

correspondingly larger gender wage gaps. We focus on the average level of the gender wage gap

and returns to hours worked for all workers and not the variation in gaps and returns across

occupations. Our analysis demonstrates that the returns to expected hours worked may be higher

on average than previously believed, suggesting an important role for hours worked in mediating

the gender wage gap.

        By examining the relationship between wages and hours, it is natural to question how our

paper relates to the voluminous literature on labor supply. Historically, this literature has

typically assumed that workers can choose their hours in response to wages. However, in many

settings workers do not have complete discretion over hours worked which complicates

interpretation of the relationship between wages and hours worked. 9 In particular, Altonji and

Paxson (1988, 1992) focus on changes in hours and wages among job switchers, arguing that job

switching is a primary channel for workers to adjust their hours of work and associated



8
  We acknowledge that other job characteristics beyond hours are important in thinking about the gender wage gap.
For example, a job with relatively low hours but rigid requirements about scheduling may be disproportionately
unappealing to women. We abstract from them in the current paper as is common in this literature (Goldin (2014),
Cortes and Pan (Forthcoming), Cha and Weeden (2014)).
9
  In some atypical settings it is quite plausible that workers can adjust hours such as stadium vendors (Oettinger
1999) or taxi cab drivers (Farber 2015).

                                                         5
compensation. More recently, Chetty et al. (2011) study labor supply decisions in a framework

where firms set hours constraints on workers and thus changes in hours worked induced by wage

changes for individuals typically come when switching jobs. Our analysis of the cross-

occupation wage-hours relationship is consistent with these studies, suggesting that choices

across jobs and occupations are crucial to individuals’ labor supply decisions.

         We continue our analysis by describing a set of empirical facts regarding the relationship

between hours worked and wages. We then sketch a theoretical framework to rationalize these

facts. We finish by relating our empirical findings and theoretical insights to the gender wage

gap.



   2. Empirical Facts

         We begin this part of the analysis by establishing three facts. First, the relationship

between hours worked and wages at the individual level is consistently small. Second, the

relationship between hours worked and wages at the occupation level is substantively larger.

Third, since 1980, the occupation-level relationship between hours worked and wages has

grown.

         We use individual-level data on hours worked and income from the Current Population

Survey, the Census and the American Community Survey (ACS). We focus on the civilian non-

institutionalized population of workers between ages 25 and 55. We drop observations with

missing occupation data, as well as individuals who are self-employed. Our primary measure of

weekly hours worked is given by an individual’s reported usual weekly hours worked for the

prior year. Hourly wages are computed by dividing total reported wage and salary income for

the prior year by the product of usual hours worked and weeks worked in the previous year.



                                                   6
Where incomes are top coded, we set them to be 1.5 times above the top coded level, and we

drop observations with reported wages below half the minimum wage. We also drop

observations with imputed usual hours, weeks worked, income or occupation.

         The OLS Mincerian relationship between hours worked and wages may not reflect a

causal relationship. They do, however, serve as a useful benchmark for illustrating the challenge

of accounting for the gender wage gap using conventional estimates of the return to hours

worked. Additionally, both Goldin (2014) and Cortes and Pan (Forthcoming) use this

relationship to categorize occupations into ones in which there is a high or low return to hours

worked. Our cross-occupation analysis is novel and suggests that the returns to hours worked are

much higher than can be explained by conventional Mincer estimates—strengthening the

empirical foundation for the conjecture that hours worked are central to understanding the gender

wage gap. We view our analysis as complementary to that of Cortes and Pan (Forthcoming) who

present quasi-experimental evidence that when barriers to labor supply are relaxed, high-skill

women work more and the gender pay gap is reduced. Of course, one must also exert caution in

interpreting these cross-occupation returns to hours worked, which we discuss in greater length

later.

         Figure 1 shows the relationship between raw wages and hours at both the individual (left

panel) and occupational level (right panel). To illustrate the relationship between actual

individual hours worked and wages, we bin individuals into 1000 groups corresponding to the

logarithm of number of weekly hours they report usually working. For occupations, we compute

the average log hours and average log wages for occupations at the three digit level. The average

log wages and average log hours for each individual bin or occupation are plotted as open circles

on the figure, with the size of the circles corresponding to the size of the bin or occupation, as



                                                  7
determined by survey weights and the number of workers in each bin/occupation. The dark line

is the best fit line from a bivariate regression.

          For individual level hours and wages, the relationship is not particularly strong, with a

slope of roughly 0.25. Without any adjustment for individual characteristics, this implies that

individuals who work more hours per week only earn slightly more per hour than those who

work fewer hours. In contrast, the relationship between occupational averages for hours and

wages is much stronger, with a slope of 2.35. Thus, individuals working in more time intensive

occupations have a substantially higher hourly wage than individuals working in less time

intense occupations.

          This difference between the wage-hour relationship at the occupation level versus

individual level is robust across various samples and specifications. We first illustrate the

consistency of the wage-hour relationship at the individual level for several specifications. Table

1 reports estimates from a standard Mincer wage regression using individual level data from the

2016 American Community Survey (ACS). Specifically, we estimate variants of the following

model:

    (1)          𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽2 + 𝛿𝛿𝑜𝑜 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑜𝑜

where i indexes individuals and o indexes measured 3 digit occupation. The variables w and h

represent wages and hours respectively, and Xi is a vector of individual covariates including

binary indicators for race (black, Hispanic, Asian and other race) and gender, indicators for

educational attainment (high school only, some college and BA or higher), and a quartic in age.

𝛿𝛿𝑜𝑜 represents a set of occupation fixed effects. All regressions are weighted with the person

weights provided by ACS, and robust standard errors are clustered by three-digit occupation.




                                                                8
       Column 1 of Table 1 presents estimates from the bivariate regression of log wage on log

hours, and corresponds closely to Figure 1. This indicates that a 10 percent increase in usual

hours worked is associated with 2.4 percent higher hourly wages. The inclusion of race, gender,

age and educational attainment in column 2 further reduces the coefficient on log hours.

       To this point, we have not controlled for occupation fixed effects, however, and thus

these point estimates represent some weighted average of the returns to hours within and across

occupations. Including occupation fixed effects in column 3, we isolate the return to hours within

occupations and we find that this causes the estimated return to flip signs. Within occupation, a

10 percent increase in hours is associated with a 1.1 percent lower hourly wages.

       Columns 4-5 show that this same basic pattern holds true for men and women. In results

available upon request, we show that the same general relationship holds for those with and

without a BA degree, and in samples limited to full-time, full-year workers, defined as those

working at least 40 weeks in the previous year and at least 35 hours per week.

       Tables 2 and 3 shows that these relationships persist when using individual level data

from the March CPS pooled across years 2012-2017, including corrections for measurement

error and separately addressing hourly wage and salaried workers. Columns 1-3 mirror the

results from Table 1 that use ACS data. As in the ACS data, the bivariate relationship is positive

and significant (elasticity of .195) but falls to zero with the inclusion of basic controls and

becomes negative with the inclusion of occupation fixed effects. However, the hours worked

variable may be measured with error in CPS and ACS, which will introduce a negative bias in

our estimate of the impact of hours worked. To address this measurement error, the specification

in column 4 instruments for a worker’s reported usual hours this year with the usual hours the

individual reported in the prior March. Although the coefficient increases from -.14 to .15, it



                                                  9
remains small. Alternatively, column 5 instruments for a worker’s reported usual hours this year

using the number of hours the worker reported actually working in the prior week. The

coefficient is -.0004 and is statistically insignificant. 10

           Table 3 uses the CPS’s Outgoing Rotation Groups and shows that the same general

pattern is present for wage earners and salary workers. 11 With the inclusion of occupation fixed

effects, the coefficient on log hours is .17 for wage earners. This rises slightly to .23 when we

instrument log hours using lagged hours. In contrast, salary workers have a negative relationship

between log hours and wages of -.22, after including individual level controls and occupation

fixed effects. Instrumenting for log hours with lagged hours increases the coefficient to .02,

which is statistically indistinguishable from zero.

           In contrast to the consistently small estimated relationship between hours and wages at

the individual level, the relationship between hours and wages at the occupational level is

consistently large. Table 4 reports estimates from wage-hour regressions at the three-digit

occupation level in the 2016 ACS, corresponding to the aggregate relationship shown in Figure

1. 12 Specifically, we estimate variants of the following model:

     (2)                                wo =β o + β1ho + β 2taskso + ε o

where wo (ho ) indicate average of log wages (hours) in occupation 𝑜𝑜. The coefficient of 2.35 in

column 1 indicates that a 10 percent increase in hours worked is associated with a roughly 23.5

percent higher hourly wage. This relationship remains large when we residualize hours and


10
   Using either of these instruments reduces the sample size to some extent, however, while unreported, re-
estimating the specifications in Columns 1-3 of the table with this smaller sample size does not meaningfully change
the coefficients.
11
   Sample restrictions are identical to the previous two samples. We link individuals across years as in the ASEC
sample. One distinction from the ASEC and ACS/Census samples is that wages for wage earners in the ORG sample
are collected directly rather than computed, and wages of salary earners are computed by dividing weekly earnings
by usual hours worked.
12
   We calculate respondent-weighted averages for each occupation.

                                                        10
wages. To construct these residuals, we regress log wage (hours) on the same demographics

used at the individual level (shown in column 3 of Table 1) as well as a full set of occupation

fixed effects. We use the coefficients on the occupation fixed effects as measures of average

residualized log wage and log hours. Column 2 shows the results of the bivariate regression of

residualized log wage on residualized log hours. The relationship between hours and wages is

still very large, with an elasticity greater than 2.

        However, average hours might be correlated with other aspects of the occupation that

influence wages. To control for specific traits of each occupation, we follow the literature on

occupational tasks, and in columns 3-4 control for four measures of the tasks associated with

each occupation (Autor, Levy & Murnane 2003, Deming 2017). 13 While the return to average

hours decreases, it remains significantly large. In column 4, for example, the estimates suggest

that a 10 percent increase in average hours worked is associated with 11.7 percent higher hourly

wages. In columns 5-8, we replicate the specification from column 1 with different groups of

occupations. Column 5 (6) shows the results for high (low) skill occupations, which we define as

those above (below) the median in terms of fraction of workers in the occupation with at least a

BA degree. Column 7 (8) shows the results for female (male) dominated occupations, which we

define as those above (below) the median in terms of fraction female in the occupation. In all

cases, the coefficients are large, positive and significant. In results not shown, we find that these

results are very similar using the CPS.

        The final empirical fact we establish is how these relationships in the cross-section have

changed over time. Figure 2 shows how these relationships have changed over time as measured


13
  In particular we include abstract analytical, manual, routine and social tasks constructed from the ONET 4.0. For
more detail on how these are constructed, see Appendix A. There are seven occupations for which task measures are
unavailable, and thus these are dropped in these regressions. Running columns 1 and 2 with only occupations for
which we have task data does not materially change our results.

                                                        11
from the Census and the ACS. 14 We plot the coefficient on log hours in each year corresponding

to the regressions with individual controls and occupation fixed effects (Table 1 Column 3) and

the residualized occupation regressions (Table 4 Column 2).

        Looking at the individual level wage-hours estimates, we see the relationship has

increased modestly between 1980 and 2016, but is always negative and small in absolute

magnitude. These individual-level results are consistent with those documented by Kuhn and

Lozano (2008), Cha and Weeden (2014), and Cortes and Pan (Forthcoming). Examining the

relationship between occupation level wages and hours, we see a much more dramatic change. In

1980, a 10 percent increase in occupation average hours was associated with a 9.4 percent

increase in average wages. By 2016, the relationship had doubled so that a 10 percent increase in

average hours was associated with a 20.2 percent increase in average wages. 15

        As the returns to certain skills (e.g., cognitive ability and social skills) have increased

over this period (Autor, Murnane and Levy 2003; Deming 2017), we show in Figure 3 the

coefficients on hours at the occupation level controlling for tasks in each year. 16 We use the

same measures of tasks as in Table 4. The inclusion of task measures attenuates the coefficients

but the large in magnitude and positive coefficient on log hours remains across all time periods.

For example, without task controls the coefficient is 2.02 in 2016 and falls to 1.12 with task

controls.



14
    In running these regressions, we use contemporaneous occupation codes. However, though we do not report it,
using time-consistent occupational codes does not impact our findings.
15
    We have calculated analogous measures for the CPS, looking at 5-year moving averages of the coefficients to take
into account the smaller sample size. We also examined both OLS and IV estimates of the return to individual hours
worked. For the IV specifications, we instrument usual hours worked in the reference year with usual hours worked
in the prior year to account for measurement error. All these specifications generate a similar pattern.
16
   Ideally, we would be able to control for the changing task composition within occupations over time. However,
O*NET only covers a limited period of time and is not easily mapped to its precursor, the Dictionary of
Occupational Titles. As a result, we use time-invariant task characteristics from O*NET 4.0. See Appendix A for
more details regarding task measurement.

                                                        12
        To summarize, we find that the individual-level relationship between hours and wages is

small, negative within occupations and that it has changed only modestly over time. The

occupational level relationship between hours and wages is large has been growing over time.



    3. Conceptual Framework

        Our descriptive analysis demonstrates that the return to average hours worked at the

measured occupation are systematically higher than the corresponding return to a person’s actual

hours worked within the occupation. In this section, we present a framework for thinking about

this empirical result that has the potential to shed light on other economic phenomena of interest.

        We assume that a job, j, is an employment contract offered by a firm and is associated

with a compensation level, 𝑐𝑐�ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 , ℎ𝑗𝑗 �, which is a function of expected hours worked, ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 , and

actual hours worked, ℎ𝑗𝑗 . These contracts are determined in hedonic equilibrium by firms offering

contracts consistent with profit maximization and workers choosing jobs consistent with utility

maximization. Consistent with our empirical results, we allow the return to expected hours to

differ from actual hours.

        It is helpful to consider a few illustrative examples of common compensation schedules

that have this form and are consistent with our empirical observation. Consider first the case of

salaried workers. In this case, workers agree to a level compensation based on an expected

workload but the salary does not adjust in the short run to actual hours worked. This

compensation is determined in a simple hedonic equilibrium between workers and firms. Actual

hours worked may vary from expected hours due to variation in skill across workers, how busy

the firm is, idiosyncratic expectations of a demanding or lenient supervisor, or other reasons. In

the context of our framework, this implies that the compensation function has the following


                                                    13
form: 𝑐𝑐�ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 , ℎ𝑗𝑗 � = 𝑐𝑐�ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 �. This leads in a straightforward fashion to a potentially large return to

expected hours across jobs if 𝑐𝑐 ′ �ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 � is large, even as the individual’s personal compensation to

                                                                                   𝑐𝑐�ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 �
actual hours worked is zero. The implication for the actual hourly wage,                        , is that the effect of
                                                                                      ℎ𝑗𝑗


a marginal hour worked within a job is to reduce the wage, a phenomenon consistent with some

of our descriptive analysis.

        While many jobs are salaried, other jobs pay wages per hour worked. In such jobs, it

seems natural to model the compensation function in the following way: 𝑐𝑐�ℎ𝑗𝑗 � = 𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑗𝑗 , where 𝑤𝑤

is the hourly wage. In such jobs, earnings scale linearly with hours worked. Even in these cases,

however, the firm may place restrictions on the range of hours offered to the worker. As a

consequence, it may not be possible to obtain a high wage hourly job without committing to an

expected hours of work, ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 . In this case, the menu of compensation across jobs may take the

following form: 𝑐𝑐�ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 , ℎ𝑗𝑗 � = 𝑤𝑤�ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 �ℎ𝑗𝑗 . For an individual working an extra hour within a given

job, the wage is fixed at 𝑤𝑤�ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 �. However, moving across jobs, the wage may increase in

expected hours if in equilibrium 𝑤𝑤 ′ �ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 � > 0. Hence, in hourly jobs the wage return of an

increase in expected hours across jobs may be quite high, even as the wage is constant within a

job.

        A natural exception to this is the case where workers are paid a higher hourly rate when

they are required to work overtime. This would suggest a higher relationship between actual

hours worked and wages, which is consistent with what we observe when splitting our results

into hourly wage workers and salaried workers in Table 3. However, if the possibility of

overtime is only available in jobs with already high expected hours, this still implies that

expected hours play a potentially substantial role in a worker’s compensation.


                                                      14
       Both of these examples suggest that the wage return to expected hours of work across

jobs may be substantially larger than the wage return of actual hours worked. Our descriptive

analysis of the relationships between hours and wages is consistent with this conjecture. We

interpret the returns to hours across occupations as representing a useful approximation of the

return to expected hours, ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 . We believe that occupation average hours represents a good proxy

for expected hours since it is averaged across many jobs. Our preferred estimate of this is 2.03

from column 2 of Table 4.

       The estimate that most closely relates to the returns to actual hours within jobs (or

deviations from expected hours) is -.11 from column 3 of Table 1 (where we include occupation

fixed effects). This estimate only partially reflects the returns to actual hours because some of the

variation in hours worked within occupation may represent differences in expected hours of

different jobs within three digit occupation. However, given that this estimate is so small, this is

consistent with the returns to actual hours being small, if not substantially negative.



   4. Application to the Gender Wage Gap

       Recent research emphasizes the role that job intensity (as measured by hours worked)

plays in the gender wage gap. Work in economics (Goldin 2014) and sociology (Cha and

Weeden 2014) suggests that the increasing prevalence of long work hours as well as the high

return to job intensity has slowed the convergence of the gender wage or earnings gap. It is well

documented that, on average, female workers work fewer hours than working men. In the 2016

ACS, for example, employed women work an average of 39.0 hours compared with 43.5 for

men, a difference of 4.5 hours. After accounting for race, age and education, this difference

increases to 4.8 hours. Controlling for three-digit occupation fixed effects as well, we find that


                                                 15
women still work 3.2 fewer hours than men. 17 In 1980, the raw gender difference was 6.7 hours

and falls to 5.0 hours after accounting for comparable demographics and occupation fixed

effects.

             When thinking about how hours worked impacts the gender wage gap, it is helpful to

write a simple decomposition of the gap that focuses on the role of hours worked. Consider the

following regression similar to the earlier specifications but focusing on the residual gender

wage gap, which we denote by 𝛼𝛼. Given our focus on the role of hours worked, we abstract from

other covariates for expositional clarity, but they can be added easily.

       (3)           𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 = 𝜋𝜋 + 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖

If we take expectations of this equation separately by gender, we obtain the following:

       (4)           ������
                     𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 = 𝜋𝜋 + 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 �����
                                                        𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓

       (5)           ������
                     𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 𝜋𝜋 + 𝛽𝛽 �����
                                               𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚

We can thus express the gender wage gap as

       (6)           𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝𝑤𝑤 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝ℎ

where 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝𝑤𝑤 = ������
                 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 − ������
                                       𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 and 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝ℎ = �����
                                                                     𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 − �����
                                                                                          𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 .

Note that the gender gap in hours is priced at rate 𝛽𝛽 and 𝛼𝛼 represents the residual wage gap.

Given the positive hours gap between men and women, as 𝛽𝛽 rises, the residual wage gap will

decline. Indeed, if 𝛽𝛽 becomes large enough, it is possible that the residual wage gap could be

negative, even with a substantial unconditional gender wage gap. As we have demonstrated

above, estimates of 𝛽𝛽 at the individual level regressions show hours worked has a weak positive

or even negative correlation with wages (see Table 1). Thus, a simple regression adjustment for

hours worked does little to close the residual gender wage gap.


17
     If we limit our analysis to full-time full-year workers, women work 1.8 fewer hours than men in 2016.

                                                                     16
        Our conceptual framework offers different insights on how to handle gender differences

in hours worked. If the gender difference in hours worked is due to differences in expected hours

worked, ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 , correcting for differences in hours worked using individual estimates will

systematically understate the contribution of hours worked to the gender wage gap. If instead the

gender difference in hours worked is related to actual hours worked, ℎ𝑗𝑗 rather than expected

hours ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 , then using individual level estimates of the returns to hours worked would be more

appropriate. 18 Because we do not observe whether an individual’s actual hours worked is due to

expected hours in the job or deviations from expected hours, researchers need to make an

assumption regarding which estimate of the returns is appropriate.

        In column 1 of Table 5, we present a baseline residual wage gap in which we do not

account for hours or occupational choice at all. We do so by regressing log wages on a female

indicator variable as well as race, age, and education level. The coefficient on the female

indicator indicates a residual wage gap of .25 log points. We now consider alternative

specifications in which we make different assumptions regarding how hours should be taken into

account.

        In column 2, we add to our minimal regression a simple control for the log of actual

hours worked. In this specification we do not control for occupation fixed effects as occupational

choice may be driven by differences in hours. This model implicitly assumes that there is no

difference in the returns between actual and expected hours. The coefficient on log hours

worked is quite small at .06, and reflects the return to some combination of actual and expected

hours (along with other occupation-specific factors that might be correlated with expected hours




18
 Actual hours worked in individual level regressions will inherently be a mix of across-job variation in hours
worked and within-person variation in hours worked.

                                                        17
and wage). As a consequence, it does little to shrink the residual wage gap, which falls to .24.

This clearly illustrates the difficulty in explaining the gender wage gap by a simple regression

adjustment for hours worked.

        In column 3, we add occupation fixed effects but eliminate the control for hours worked.

This specification implicitly controls for differences between men and women in the expected

hours associated with their occupational choices at the level of the 3-digit occupation codes we

observe. The inclusion of occupation fixed effects substantially reduces the residual gender wage

gap to .16. 19 This substantial reduction is due to the fact that the fixed effects control for not

only the expected occupational hours, but also any other occupational differences (e.g. tasks) that

drive compensation.

        In column 4, we again include occupation fixed effects but also control for actual hours

worked. This regression prices the hour-wage relationship at the individual level. In this model,

the coefficient on log hours should be interpreted as the return to actual hours worked driven by

idiosyncractic factors such as supervisor requests, speed at completing tasks, etc. We estimate a

residual wage gap of .17, larger than what we find in the prior specification (column 3) in which

we do not control for hours. This is due to the fact that actual hours have a negative price in the

regression. As a consequence, the fact that women work fewer hours within occupations means

that they should have higher wages than men. 20 Hence, when we price hours based on the

individual-level wage equations, the residual gender wage gap essentially does not change at all.




19
   Additionally, we have experimented with further including interaction terms between hours worked and
occupation fixed effects, which would allow for an occupation-specific wage-hours elasticity. However, including
these does not significantly change the point estimate on the residual gender wage gap.
20
   In results available upon request, we show that accounting for measurement error in hours worked using the IV
strategy in Tables 2 and 3 does not substantively change the estimated residual gender wage gap.

                                                       18
         However, at the other extreme, one can instead assume that the hours differences between

men and women, both across and within occupations, is driven entirely by gender differences in

choices about expected hours worked. Under this assumption, researchers would wish to price

the gender difference in hours at the expected hours wage rate. This implicitly assumes that the

expected hours wage rate is the same across measured occupations as well as across jobs within a

measured occupation. One tractable way to implement this thought experiment is to instrument

individuals’ actual hours with the occupation level average hours, omitting the individual’s own

contribution to this average. 21

         Column 5 of Table 5 shows these results. Consistent with our expectation, the coefficient

on hours worked is 1.8, quite similar to the aggregate cross-occupation return to average hours

worked presented earlier. In this specification, the residual gender wage gap virtually disappears.

These results suggest that gender-correlated choices over job intensity could account for the

lion’s share of the difference in wages between men and women.

         As we showed in Section 3, occupational average hours worked is correlated with job-

related tasks. It is unclear whether it is appropriate to control for such factors. If we control for

occupation task measures, this reduces the estimated coefficient on hours worked, which has the

effect of increasing the residual wage gap. It may be that women prefer to work in jobs with task

requirements correlated with high hours, such as abstract reasoning and team management, but

do not enter these jobs because of the concomitant expectation of high hours. In this case,

controlling for occupation tasks understates the importance of hours when estimating the gender

wage gap. On the other hand, if women choose not to work in some high-hours jobs not because




21
  We do not control for occupational fixed effects, since they are collinear with the occupational average hours.
This method is similar to that used in Angrist (1991).

                                                         19
of the hours, but rather because of the associated tasks, one would wish to account for the task

mix of the job and other correlated characteristics including scheduling flexibility.

        In column 6 of Table 5, we consider this possibility. Again, we instrument hours worked

with average occupational hours (omitting the reference individual). However, we control in the

second stage for the set of occupational tasks discussed earlier. This has the effect of lowering

the return to hours worked to 1.2. Relative to the prior specification, controlling for task mix

expands the residual gender wage gap to 0.08. The gap, however, remains substantially narrower

than cases in which hours are priced at the actual hours rate implicit in the individual level

regressions. 22

        Ultimately, with available data it is not knowable the extent to which the gender hours

gap is driven by actual versus expected hours. However, evidence suggests that the difference in

realized hours is a reflection of desire for lower expected hours among women and should be

priced accordingly. In particular, recent work has shown that men and women have different

willingness to pay for flexible work arrangements (e.g. Mas and Pallais 2017, Wiswall and Zafar

2017). Though unreported, we also find a substantial correlation between the gender hours gaps

and wage gaps within occupations, even when controlling for demographic characteristics. 23

Thus, there is evidence that gender gaps in observed individual hours worked may be priced at a

higher level than implied by standard Mincerian specifications.




22
   The number of observations is slightly lower in column 6 compared with columns 1 through 5. This is because a
small number of occupations do not have ONET task information. If we replicate the specifications in columns 1-5
on the sample used in column 6, the results are qualitatively the same.
23
   Using the pricing implied by the slope on within occupation regressions of gender wage gaps and hours gaps with
empirical Bayes corrections for measurement error implies a similar reduction in the gender wage gap as in Column
4 of Table 5, where we use the pricing of hours from occupation-level regressions controlling for tasks.

                                                       20
Gender Wage Gap over Time

        The difference between women’s log wages and men’s log wages has shrunk

considerably since the 1980s, but flattened in recent years, as shown by the blue trend line in

Figure 4. Over this same period, the gender gap in log hours worked has closed somewhat (red

trend line in Figure 4), although by much less, and in 2016 women still work notably fewer hours

than men on average. The green trend line in Figure 4 illustrates the increasing returns to hours

worked at the occupation level, which we estimated earlier and also show in Figures 2 and 3.

Taken together, these facts suggest that wage convergence between men and women would have

been larger if the wage premium for hours worked had remained the same. In this section, we

consider what the evolution of the gender gap would have been if the returns to hours worked

had remained at 1980 levels.

       To begin, we estimate individual level wage regressions separately by year for 1980,

1990, 2000 and 2016. We do so both estimating the relation between wages and hours worked

via OLS and also via IV in which we instrument individual hours with occupational average

hours. This allows us to consider how the counterfactual wage gap would have evolved had the

return to hours not increased. Our primary empirical specification is given by:


       (7)             𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡 + 𝛼𝛼 𝑡𝑡 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽1𝑡𝑡 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + γt 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

Because changing demographics and the coefficients on those demographics are not the focus of

the analysis, while we control for them in our analysis, we ignore them for the purposes of

presentation. Building on the logic we developed in our static analysis, we can write the gender

wage gap (conditional upon demographic covariates) as




                                                              21
       (8)                  𝑡𝑡
                      𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝𝑤𝑤 = 𝛼𝛼 𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽1𝑡𝑡 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝ℎ𝑡𝑡

This expression allows us to consider how the gender wage gap would have increased if the

residual wage gap evolved according to the observed time series but the prices on hours

remained constant at 1980 levels. Put another way, we allow the unexplained part of the gender

wage gap to change period by period but fix the returns to hours worked at 1980 levels.

       Again, we are faced with the question of what price should be used to relate the hours gap

to the wage gap period by period. In Table 6 we present these results for four different prices

for log hours worked. In each of the cases, row 1 shows the evolution of the gap described in

equation (8) above—that is, the residual wage gap plus the wage gap that can be explained by the

gender gap in hours. Row 2 considers the counterfactual evolution of the gap assuming that the

residual gap evolved according to the observed time series but the prices on hours are held

constant at 1980 levels. Row 3 shows the percentage difference between Row 1 and Row 2—

how different the gender wage gap would have been if returns to hours remained constant at

1980 levels.

       First consider the top panel, where we price the hours gap at the rate implied by the return

to actual hours, controlling for the standard covariates. We do not control for occupation fixed

effects, instead pricing both hours within and across occupations at the single price indicated by

this regression. We find that the total residual and hours related wage gap declined from 0.43 to

0.25 over the time period, with the bulk occurring between 1980 and 1990. Performing our

counterfactual exercise, we show that gender wage gap would have been roughly 20 percent

smaller in the year 2016 had the returns to hours worked not increased over the time period.

Note that even though the return to hours worked is very small in 2016, it was negative in 1980.

Thus even though hours does little to explain the residual wage gap in the contemporary cross-



                                                           22
section, the change in the return to actual hours still can still account for a portion of the change

in the gender wage gap.

         In the second panel, we base our analysis on specifications in which we control for

occupation fixed effects. Doing so removes from the residual wage gap the contribution of hours

associated with differences in expected hours across occupations. As a consequence, the level of

the gender wage gap falls relative to the other specifications. However, we find that the reduction

in the gender wage gap is comparable to the first case, with the counterfactual wage gap being

roughly 24 percent lower than the actual wage gap.

         We next consider the case in which the hours gap is priced at the rate implied by the

cross-occupation wage-hours schedule. 24 As we did in the prior section, we implement this by

instrumenting actual hours worked with the leave-out mean of hours in each occupation. We do

not control for occupation fixed effects and instead price out all hours, both within and across

occupation, at the rate estimated in our instrumental variables specification. In the third panel of

Table 6, we show the results corresponding to this specification. With the large increase in the

return to expected hours, the counterfactual wage gap would have been substantially lower had

the hours premium remained at 1980 levels. By 2016, the gap would have been 46 percent

lower.

         For the bottom panel, we perform the same analysis but control for the occupational task

mix. The results are qualitatively similar to the prior panel. Had the hours premium remained

fixed at 1980 levels, the counterfactual gender wage gap would have been 34 percent lower in

2016. Thus, although the hours gap between men and women has been closing over this time




24
   Note that the residual wage gap plus the wage gap explained by the hours gap is nearly identical to what we saw
in the first panel. The primary difference is the portion of the gap that is explained by the difference in hours.

                                                        23
period, it has not closed as rapidly as the return to hours has grown and thus this has exacerbated

the gender wage gap from 1980 to 2016.



5. Conclusions

       In this paper we consider the manner in which wages are related to hours worked. We

demonstrate that while the hours worked by an individual has only a weak relationship with

wages, the average hours within an occupation is much more strongly related to wages. This

relationship holds, controlling for individual characteristics and occupation tasks. Indeed, a 10

percent increase in occupational hours worked is associated with between a 10 and 20 percent

increase in wages depending on the specification.

       We examine how this relationship has changed over time. We find that while the

relationship between actual hours worked and wages has increased modestly, the relationship

between occupational average hours and wages has doubled between 1980 and 2016. This

substantial increase is observed whether or not we control for the occupational task mix. This is

consistent with prior literature showing that the return to hours worked has risen over time.

       We present a framework to rationalize this finding in which equilibrium compensation is

a function of expected and actual hours. In the context of this framework, we provide clear

settings in which expected hours would be priced at a much higher level than the deviations from

expected hours. These findings are consistent with what we observe in the data.

       Informed by these empirical findings and our conceptual framework, we revisit the

gender wage gap. Because hours have such a weak relationship with wages, they explain very

little of the gender wage gap. In the context of our framework, we demonstrate that the extent to


                                                24
which the gender wage gap is mediated by hours worked depends crucially on whether we

assume the hours difference is priced according to the empirical schedule for expected hours or

rather hours deviations. If we assume that the gender difference in hours worked should be

priced according to the relationship we observe across occupations, then hours worked accounts

for virtually all of the unexplained gender wage gap. If we price hours according to the cross-

occupation schedule and control for the occupational task mix, hours differences account for

approximately half of the gender wage gap. These results imply that the findings of Cortes and

Pan (Forthcoming) that increases in labor supply have important wage effects generalize to a

broader sample of U.S. workers.

       Given that return to hours worked has risen over time, we examine how the gender wage

gap would have counterfactually evolved had the return to hours worked not risen relative to

1980. We do so under various assumptions regarding the pricing of hours worked. Consistent

with Cha and Weeden (2014), the increase in returns to hours worked imply that the

counterfactual wage gap would have been substantially narrower had the price of hours not

increased over time. Significantly, if we price hours worked according to the occupation-level

relationship, the counterfactual gender wage gaps would have been between 31 and 46 percent

smaller. This suggests that the increase in the return to occupational intensity made it

increasingly difficult for women to achieve wage parity with men.

       Further research is needed to obtain more precise estimates of the pricing of hours

differences between men and women at the individual level. We also leave for further research a

greater understanding of why the returns to hours have increased over time and additional

implications of this change.

Appendix A
Creating Task Measures
Task measures are constructed from the raw data in the ONET 4.0. We first standardize the raw
level variables to be mean zero and standard deviation one across the 900 ONET-SOC occupation
codes. We then collapse to 677 soc2000 codes by taking the simple average across ONET-SOC
codes associated with a single soc2000 code. 25 The composites are created as the average of the
included variables (see details below) and are standardized.
For analysis that uses data from 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2016 we merge on task data using David
Dorn’s occ1990dd classification system. The occ1990dd system consists of 330 codes that provide
a balanced panel of occupations covering the 1980, 1990 and 2000 Censuses and the 2005 ACS.
For the purpose of our analysis, we extend the coverage to the 2016 ACS by creating a crosswalk
from the codes used in the 2016 ACS to the occ1990dd system. We start with the composite task
measures at the soc2000 level and merge on soc2000 weights. We create soc2000 weights by
pooling data from the 2005, 2006 and 2007 Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey.26
We then collapse task measures to the occ2000 and standardize, yielding composite task measures
for 445 occ2000 codes. Lastly, we use the occ2000 to occ1990dd from Dorn (2009) and the sum
of soc2000 weights for each occ2000 code to collapse task measures to the occ1990dd level. The
final dataset merged onto data for 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2016 consist of task data for 325
occupations standardized to be mean zero and standard deviation one. Thus, there are five
occ1990dd occupations for which we are unable to obtain task data; these map into seven
occupations in the 2016 ACS coding system. 27
We use four composite task measures in our analysis taken previously from the literature. Each
measure is constructed as the average of the included variables. For each composite the variable
names are given in italics, the variable type in parenthesis and the variable question text in
quotations.
     1. Social Skills (Deming 2017):
        - Coordination: (skill) “Adjusting actions in relation to others' actions.”
        - Negotiation: (skill) “Bringing others together and trying to reconcile differences.”
        - Persuasion: (skill) “Persuading others to change their minds or behavior.”
        - Social Perceptiveness: (skill) “Being aware of others' reactions and understanding
           why they react as they do.”

     2. Abstract Analytical (Acemoglu & Autor 2011):
        - Interpreting the Meaning of Information for Others: (work activity) “Translating or
           explaining what information means and how it can be used.”


25
   For example, onetsoccode 11-1011.01 and 11-1011.02 are collapsed into soc2000 code 11-1011.
26
   Specifically, we follow the procedure used by Autor & Acemoglu (2011) to create soc2000 weights from the
2005, 2006 and 2007. Weights are calculated as the mean of employment across the three survey waves for each soc
code.
27
   The occ1990dd occupations for which we cannot construct task data are occupations 76, 346, 37, 349 and 415.

                                                      28
         -   Thinking Creatively: (work activity) “Developing, designing, or creating new
             applications, ideas, relationships, systems, or products, including artistic
             contributions.”
         -   Analyzing Data or Information: (work activity) “Identifying the underlying
             principles, reasons, or facts of information by breaking down information or data into
             separate parts.”

     3. Manual (Acemoglu & Autor 2011):
        - Spend Time Using Your Hands to Handle, Control, or Feel Objects, Tools, or
           Controls: (context) “How much does this job require using your hands to handle,
           control, or feel objects, tools or controls?”
        - Manual Dexterity: (ability) “The ability to quickly move your hand, your hand
           together with your arm, or your two hands to grasp, manipulate, or assemble objects.”
        - Operating Vehicles, Mechanized Devices, or Equipment: (work activity) “Running,
           maneuvering, navigating, or driving vehicles or mechanized equipment, such as
           forklifts, passenger vehicles, aircraft, or water craft.”
        - Spatial Orientation: (ability) “The ability to know your location in relation to the
           environment or to know where other objects are in relation to you.”
     4. Routine (Acemoglu & Autor 2011) 28:
        - Controlling Machines and Processes: (work activity) “Using either control
           mechanisms or direct physical activity to operate machines or processes (not
           including computers or vehicles).”
        - Spend Time Making Repetitive Motions: (context) “How much does this job require
           making repetitive motions?”
        - Pace Determined by Speed of Equipment: (context) “How important is it to this job
           that the pace is determined by the speed of equipment or machinery? (This does not
           refer to keeping busy at all times on this job.)”
        - Importance of Being Exact or Accurate: (context) “How important is being very exact
           or highly accurate in performing this job?”
        - Importance of Repeating Same Tasks: (context) “How important is repeating the same
           physical activities (e.g., key entry) or mental activities (e.g., checking entries in a
           ledger) over and over, without stopping, to performing this job?”




28
  The measure of routine used in Acemoglu & Autor 2011 also included the variable Structured versus
Unstructured Work (“To what extent is this job structured for the worker, rather than allowing the worker to
determine tasks, priorities, and goals?”) but the variable is unavailable in the ONET 4.0 and responses were not
gathered until subsequent installations of the ONET.

Personal Consumption Expenditures. High (low) skill occupations are defined as those above (below) the median in terms of fraction of workers in the occupation
with at least a BA degree. Female (male) dominated occupations are defined as those above (below) the median in terms of fraction female in the occupation. Task
data is constructed from the ONET 4.0 aggregated to the occ1990dd level. There are five occ1990dd occupations missing task data in the ONET 4.0 which yield
missing task data for seven occs. Task controls include social skills, as defined in Deming(2017), and abstract analytical, manual and routine, as in Acemoglu &
Autor (2011). See appendix A for an explanation how of these composites were created. Task measures are standardized to be mean zero and standard deviation
one across the occ1990dd distribution.

Columns (3) and (4) include occupation fixed effects. Columns (5) and (6) are IV regression with individual log
hours instrumented with occupation average log hours, thus occupation fixed effects cannot be included. Occupation
average log hours are calculated using a leave-out mean by excluding the individual's hours. Standard errors are
clustered at the occ level. Occupations aggregated to occs as classified in the 2016 American Community Survey.
Observations are weighted using perwt. Sample includes prime-age workers aged 25-55. Demographic controls
include a quartic in age, indicators for race/ethnicity (black, Hispanic, Asian, other), and indicators for educational
attainment (HS degree, some college, college degree or more). Hours are derived from usual hours worked per
week. Hourly wage is calculated as total reported wage and salary income for the prior year divided by the product
of usual hours worked and weeks worked in the previous year. We trim wages that are below half of the federal
minimum wage and inflate wages to 2012 dollars using the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) National Income
and Product Accounts Personal Consumption Expenditures. We merge on task data constructed from the ONET 4.0
aggregated to the occ1990dd level. There are five occ1990dd occupations missing task data in the ONET 4.0 which
yield missing task data for seven occs. Task controls include social skills, as defined in Deming(2017), and abstract
analytical, manual and routine, as in Acemoglu & Autor (2011). See appendix A for an explanation how of these

Occupations aggregated to occs as classified in the 2016 American Community Survey. Observations are weighted
using perwt. Sample includes prime-age workers aged 25-55. The gap in hours (𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝ℎ𝑡𝑡 ) corresponds to the difference
between male and female log hours in year t. In the first panel, 𝛽𝛽1980 is the coefficient on log hours fro a regression
of log wage on a female dummy and a set of demographic controls. The second panel adds in occupation controls to
derive the coefficient on log hours, 𝛽𝛽1980 . In the third panel 𝛽𝛽1980 is the coefficient from log hours in a IV regression
of log wage on female, demographic controls and individual log hours instrumented with occupation average log
hours. Occupation average log hours are calculated using a leave-out mean by excluding the individual's hours. In the
fourth panel add occupation tasks controls to derive the coefficient on log hours, 𝛽𝛽1980 . In each panel 𝛼𝛼 𝑡𝑡 is the
coefficient on female and 𝛽𝛽 𝑡𝑡 is the coefficient on log hours from the corresponding regression in year t. All regressions
include a quadratic in age, dummies for black, Hispanic, Asian and other race, high school only, some college and at
least a bachelor’s degree. Hours are derived from usual hours worked per week. Hourly wage is calculated as total
reported wage and salary income for the prior year divided by the product of usual hours worked and weeks worked
in the previous year. We trim wages that are below half of the federal minimum wage and inflate wages to 2012 dollars
using the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) National Income and Product Accounts Personal Consumption
Expenditures. Task data are constructed from the ONET 4.0 aggregated to the occ1990dd level. There are five
occ1990dd occupations missing task data in the ONET 4.0 which yield missing task data for seven occs. Social skills
are as defined in Deming(2017), abstract analytical, manual and routine as in Acemoglu & Autor (2011). See appendix
A for an explanation how of these composites were created. Task measures are standardized to be mean zero and
standard deviation one across the occ1990dd distribution.
