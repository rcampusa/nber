       This paper presents an endogenous growth model of an open economy in which the

growth rate of income is higher if foreign capital goods are used relatively more than domestic

capital goods for the production of capital stock. Empirical results, using cross country data for

the period 1960-85, confirm that the ratio of imported to domestically produced capital goods in

the composition of investment has a significant positive effect on per capita income growth rates

across countries, in particular, in developing countries. Hence, the composition of investment

in addition to the volume of total capital accumulation is highlighted as an important detenninant

of economic growth.

I. Introduction

    The links between international trade and economic growth have interested
economists for a long time. Can international trade increase the growth rate of
income? Should less developed countries follow their comparative advantage in order
to become as rich as developed countries or should they protect certain key industries
to grow faster?     Free trade orthodoxy since Adam Smith typically predicts that
international trade, by following the law of comparative advantage, produces static
gains in income in all trading partner countries. It has, however, been equivocal in
answering the question of whether international trade and a free trade regime can
bring about any gains in the growth rate of income. This paper presents a new
theoretical model and empirical evidence which show that international trade, by
providing relatively cheaper foreign capital goods, increases efficiency of capital
accumulation and thus the growth rates of income in less developed countries.
     Recently there is a growing literature suggesting that international trade and trade
policy may increase growth rates of income.          Many researchers have provided a
variety of frameworks for an open economy that are rooted in the closed economy
endogenous growth models of Romer(1986) and Lucas(1988) (see the survey in Roubini
and Sala-i-MartinU99l)). One of the key lessons from this branch of literature is that
imports of foreign inputs are an important determinant of the link between trade and
growth. Grossman and Helpman(1991), Rivera-Bath and Romer(1991), and Quah and
RauchQ99O) show that international trade can increase the growth rate by providing a
wider range of intermediate inputs, which in turn facilitates more research and
development or learning-by-doing activities. Thus, this literature seems to provide a
theoretical foundation for the long-held conviction among development economists that
international trade, by providing essential and efficient foreign inputs for industrializing



                                             1
sector, is an important factor of economic growth.        Anne Kruger(1983, p.9), for
example points out "a     reduction   in capital goods imports would reduce the GDP
growth rate and a reduction of intermediate goods and raw material imports would
adversely affect output and employment."
     The model presented here shares a common feature with these recent endogenous
growth models in that it focuses on the importance of foreign inputs to economic
growth But, in contrast to the previous literature, which stresses the effects of trade
on technological progress, this paper emphasizes another link between foreign inputs
and growth--that is, the efficiency of capital accumulation. The price of capital goods
has been relatively cheaper in higher income countries.    (Section II shows detailed
data from the United Nations Comparison Project and the Penn World Table.) Thus,
lower income countries, by importing the relatively cheaper capital goods from high
income countries, increase the efficiency of capital accumulation and thereby the growth
rates of income. A simple model of an open economy that incorporates this
characteristic is presented by extending a recent endogenous growth model of
Rebelo(1991) in which two final goods--one consumption and one capital good--are
produced and the "core" capital good sector determines the long-run growth rate of per
capita incorne The model of Rebelo implies that the relative price of the capital good
decreases over time along the balanced growth path and thus the price of the capital
good relative to the consumption good is cheaper in a higher income country, which
has a larger capital stock. This closed economy model is extended to a framework of
a global economy in which a less developed country imports capital goods from a
develops country and combines them with domestic capital goods for the production of
its core capital goods sector. The cheaper foreign capital goods then make the less
developed country grow faster. Hence, the growth rate is higher 'in the country that
uses imported inputs relatively more than domestically-produced inputs for investment
     This paper tests the empirical implications of the modeL Using cross-country
data for the period 1960â€”85, regression results show that the ratio of imports in
investment(ie the ratio of imported to domestically-produced capital goods) has a

                                           2
significant positive effects on per capita income growth rates across countries. On the
other hand, the share of total imports in GDP has no significant effect on growth.
The results, thus, highlight that the composition of investment in addition to its size
should be considered important in determining economic growth.
     This paper consists of six sections.       Section II presents information on the
relative price of capital goods. Section III presents an open economy growth model in
which an imported capital good is a key input to the production of the domestic capital
stock The impact of the imported capital good on the growth rate of per capita
income is discussed. Section W discusses the impact of distortionary trade policies on
capital goods imports and thus on growth rates.          The results of the empirical
investigations are presented in Section V1 and finally, Section VI summarizes the
principal finding of the paper.



H. The Relative Pike of Capital Goods arxl Per Capita Incont

     There are some studies that discuss characteristics of cross-country data on the
relative price of capital goods. For example, by using data on price of investment
components drawn from the 1980 United Nations International Comparison Project(UN
ICP), De Long and Summers (1991) have found that there is a negative correlation
between GDP per worker and the real price of equipment (which is defined by the
price of equipment relative to the GDP deflator in 1980). They note that "the fast
growing countries are also those that have experienced the steepest declines in relative
real machinery prices 7 inferring that as investment drives economic growth, the
relative price of capital goods declines with capita] accumulation. Unfortunately, their
price measure is the real price of equipment investment goods relative to the GDP
deflator, not to the price of consumption goods.
     Summers and Hestan(1991) report the 1980 UN ICP data on national prices and
international dollar jxices of aggregate commodities groups.       They divide all 60

                                            3
countries into six groups according to per capita income. Using their data, Table 1
presents the yatio of the. national to the international price, which indicates the
difference between the domestic price and the international price in each aggregate
commodity and country group. For example, national prices of domestic investment
goods are relatively expensive in the poorest group 1 countries, by a factor of 1.55,
compared with the international price, which is defined by the U.S. price. The data of
the first row show that the price of food declines only slightly with income. In
contrast, as shown in the next three rows, the price of investment goods decreases
dramatically with per capita income. Therefore, the relative prices of investment goods
to consumption goods are more expensive in lower income countries, as depicted in the
bottom three mws.1
     Data from the UN ICP are limited in showing trends of the relative price of
investment goods over time because they do not cover a wide range of countries, in
particular, for the earlier years. To examine whether the negative relationship between
the relative price of capital goods and per capita income holds over time, the relative
price of investment goods has been constructed as the ratio of the investment deflator
to the consumption deflator in the four groups of countries, which are classified
according to 1960 per capita incoma2) Figure 1 demonstrates that the negative
relationship between the relative price of investment goods and per capita GDP is
stable over time among income groups: the lower the income, the higher is the relative
price of the capital goods.
     All findings show that capital goods have been relatively cheaper in richer
countries. Thus, in the international trade between LDCs and DCs, the lower income
countries have a comparative advantage in consumption goods, while the higher income
countries have a comparative advantage in investment goods.

ifi. An Endogenous Growth Model

     This section first discusses the model of a closed economy in which the capital
good sector determines the long-run growth rate of per capita income and the relative
price of the capital good in terms of the consumption good decreases over time along
the balanced growth path. And then the model is extended to an open economy where
an imported foreign capital good is a key input to the production of domestic capital
goods.


   1. The closed economy
  Consider a country that is assumed to have the same features of the two sector
endogenous growth model as that of Rebelo(1991),              The economy produces a
consumption good and a capital good. The consumption good is produced by a
Cobb-Douglas combination of capital and labor. The capital share is fixed by a:


         C=   (Ã¸}OÂ°L' 0 Cad                                          (1)


where K is capital stoclc L is labor, and 0 is a fraction of the capital stock employed
in the consumption good sector.       Time subscripts are omitted.     To simplify the
exposition, the total size of labor L will be normalized to one.
     The capital good is produced using only capital stock:


         I = A(Iâ€”0)K                                                 (2)


where A is a parameter of productivity that may reflect the level of technology. All
capital goods are used for capital accumulation:


         K=I                                                         (3)



                                            5
where the dot over K indicates the time derivative of the capital stock K. No
depreciation of capital and no reversibility of investment(I 0) are assumed to
simplify discussions.
       The profit maximization condition specifies that the marginal productivity of
capital will be the same in both sectors:


         pA =   a(Ã˜K)'                                                   (4)


where p is the relative rice of the capital good in terms of the consumption good.
Since in the steady-state the fraction of capital stock employed in the consumption
goods sector is fixed, equation (4) implies that the relative price of the capital good
decreases with capital accumulation in the steady-state. Thus, the relative price of the
capital good is cheaper in a country with a higher per capita capital stock.
       National income measured in terms of the consumption good is derived by
combining all the above equations:


         Y C + p1       [1Ã·a(lâ€”Ã¸)/G] C                                   (5)


Thus. GD!' grows at the same rate as consumption in the steady-state, implying that
economic growth always leads to a higher level of consumption and of utility.
       The consumption side of this model assumes that the representative,
infinitely-lived household maximizes a lifetime utility given by


          u=   f etlog(c) cit                                             (6)


where p > 0 is the constant rate of time preference.               In the steady-state, the
household chooses the optimal consumption growth path at the rate
   =      - p, where rc is the interest rate denominated in tenns of the consumption

                                            6
good. The standani arbitrage condition in the capital market requires that rc = A +
(see Rebelo (1991)). From equations (1) and (4), in the steady-state the growth rate
of the relative price of the capital good gp = (a â€”       1)gi   and gc = gk +   gp   = agk.
Then, combining all these results with equation (5) gives the steady-state growth rate
of income as foUow&


               a (A â€” p)                                                (7)


The expression implies that the more patient (lower p) and the more pmductive(higher
A) an economy is. the faster it grows. In this endogenous growth model, therefore,
the divergence of growth rates across countries is explained by the difference in
preference or productivity among countries.3 The model thus predicts that poor
countries remain always poor.

     The optimal saving rate C = p k / Y is solved by combining equations (2), (4)
and (5) :4)


          s = [1 + a'G(lâ€”GY'T1 = (1+a4 p(Aâ€”pi'f'                         (8)


Thus, the optimal saving rate is higher in an economy that is more patient and more
productive.


  2. The goon economy
        The closed economy in the above subsection does not consider any possibility of
trade   between countries. Now consider a global economy in which two countries- -a
less developed country (LDC) and a developed country (DC)-"are engaged in trade.

3) As well noted, in this AK-ti,e of epdogenous gmwth miyjej, differences in government policy
   influence growth rate in the long-na See Rebeio(1991), BanoU99l), Easteily(1990) and Jones
   and Mamielli(1990L
4) To get the saond equality it is used that the eqilibriurn 0 is p/A, which is derived by
   combining equations (2), (3) and (7).


                                              7
Suppose that         DC has already achieved industrialization and grows at the
                    the

steady-state rate as given by equation (7). In contrast, the LDC is just starting to
produce its own capital goods sector. Equation (4) implies that domestic price of the
capital good is relatively lower in the DC, which has a larger capital stock. Thus, the
DC has a comparative advantage in the capital good, while the LDC has a comparative
advantage in the consumption good. By trading with each other, the DC gets a
relatively cheaper consumption good and the LDC gets a relatively cheaper capital
good. The importation of the cheaper capital good from the DC raises the LDC's
growth rate, while the DC gets higher utility by importing the cheaper consumption
good.
   Let's suppose that the LDC requires both a domestic capital and an imported capital
good    to build its own capital goods sector under the assumption that the capital good
of the DC is an imperfect substitute for the capital good of the LDC. The assumption
of imperfect substitutability between domestic and imported capital goods is considered
to be more realistic than the usual assumption of the perfect substitutability between
the DC and LDC capital good&S) Some components of investment, such as public
capital goods (for example, railways) are nontradable and littie substitutable for the
imported capital goods (for example, locomotives). If the capital stock of the LDC
includes human capital as well as physical capital, the imported capital goods will have
little substitutability for the human capital.
       Let's assume that the LDC's capital good is produced by a Cobb-Douglas
combination of a domestic capital good, hi, and an imported capital good, I.M


         I=11Y' TM7, 0<7<1                                                      (9)


5) The assumption of imperfect substitutability between domestic and imported capital goods is crucial
   in this model as it jrevents the small LDC froi becoming immediately specialized in the
   consumption goat Onilci and Uzawa(1) investigate the knits betwn trade and growth in the
   standard two-sector, two-consy                                  model, whne consumption and
   investment goods axe afi perfectly subslituta,le and freely traded. Also, see a survey of the
   related literature in Smith(1984).

where y denotes a parameter given by production technology.
     The domestic capital good is produced using only capital stock as in the
developed country:


           = A(1â€”G)IC                                              (10)


Equation (9) can be rewritten as:


        I = [A(1â€”Ã¸)K] V                                            (11)


where Z denotes the ratio of imported to domestic capital good in the production of the

capital good, that is


        Z=k(/In=IM/EA(1â€”Ã¸)K]                                        (12)


The variable Z will be called henceforth by mtio of hnprts in investment
     Assuming that the consumption goods sector has the same production function as
given by equation (1), the profit maximization condition gives


        p A(1â€”r) V = a Ã˜r K'                                        (13)
        pMp r                                                       (14)


where pi denotes the price of the imported capital good, which is assumed to be given
to the LDC exogenously. Equation (14) implies that equilibrium Z is determined by the
difference between the domestic price p and the foreign price pr.. Using equations (13)
and (14), the equilibrium Z is solved by:


        Z = r/(1â€”r) (GK)4 a4 1 A4                                  (15)




                                            9
Equation (15) shows that, given the capital stock (K) and other parameters, a cheaper
imported capital good leads to a higher value of 1
        The competitive equilibrium gives the steady-state growth rate by the same
procedure as in the closed economy. Assume that the representative household in the
LDC maximizes the intertemporal utility function given in equation.6) Combining the
optimal consumption path such that gc =         r-   p and the arbitrage condition such that
rc = A(lâ€”r)Z' + gp, we get:


              = A(1â€”r)Z' + g0     â€”
                                      p                                        (16)


Capital accumulation occurs by the production of capital goods. From equation( 11), the
growth rate of capital, stock is given by:


              = A(1â€”Ã¸)Z7                                                     (17)


     National income measured in tenns of the consumption good is given by:


          Y= C     +   (1â€”r)pI   [1+e(1â€”G)/Ã¸] C                             (18)


Thus, GDP grows at the same rate as consumption in the steady-state.
       The saving rate, s = p it / Y, is solved by:


          S      (1â€”ri' [1+aÃ¸(1â€”Ã˜)']'                                       (19)



Steady-state equilibrium


6)   It is assumed that the DC and the LDC have the same parameters for productivity (A) and
     prefence (p). Any complication of this assumption does not change the qualitative results in
     the pap&.


                                                10
     In the steady-state, the fraction of capital stock employed in each sector is fixed.
By combining equations (16), (17) and gk = g -g9, the equilibrium share is solved by:


         0 'pA'Z" + y,0<0<1                                                    (20)



where Z denotes the steady-state value of Z. Using gy                      =   a gk, the balanced
growth rate in the steadyâ€”state is given by:

              =   alA(1â€”r)Z7      â€”
                                      p]                                       (21)



Equation (14) implies that in the steadyâ€”state the growth rate- of price should be the
same in the LIX and DC. Thus the steady-state equilibrium requires that the growth
rate of income in the LDC be equal to the growth rate is determined by the given
preference and technology parametersJ)


Transitional dynamics

      During the transitional period            in which a LDC economy             approaches     the
steadyâ€”state from a low initial level of capital stock, the capital stock and per capita
income rise monotonically towaixl their steady-state values.
      Throughout the fransitional period, the growth rate of income is higher in an
economy with a higher ratio of imports in investment (Z). As shown in equation (17),
given parameters, the growth rate of capital stock (and thereby income) is higher with
1     Thus,   if an economy uses imported capital goods relatively more than its own
domestic capital goods for capital accumulation, it grows faster. If two LDCs have the
 same per capita income and trade with the same DC, the country that devotes
 relatively more of a given portion of its income to the importation of cheap foreign

 7) Comparing the growth rate in equation (21) with equation (7),the steady-state equilibrium requires
    that the productivity of capital be the same in both countries. Since t is a monotonic increasing
    function of Z, there exists a unique equilIbrium 2.


                                                    11
capital goods than to the purchase of domestic capital goods grows faster than the
other country.
     Another prediction of the model is that the capital stock and income rise at
decreasing rate in the transitional period. Equation (15) shows that Z decreases as the
capital stock increases. By replacing Pn with equation (4), equation (15) can be
rewritten as


        Z 1 / (1â€”r) [(0K) / (0jC)]t"'Â°                = r/(1â€” 7) (y/y')(Ofl/Q J          (22)


where J    ([(1â€”a)0'] / ((1â€”a)0])"Â°1Â°. The nationS income per capita is
denoted by y and the superscript * denote the DC. Equation (22) shows that, given
other parameters, Z decreases as income gap between the LDC and the DC decreases.8)
Thus, When the LDC starts wtha smaller capital stockjt has a higher Z and thereby
exhibits a higher growth rate than in the steady-state.9 As the LDC economy, which
starts with a huge income gap, approaches the steady-state, the ratio of imported
capital goods (Z) and thereby the growth rate of income decreases. This prediction
implies a convergence of income--since the growth rate of income is higher in lower
income countries, the gap of per capita income between countries declines over time.
8) The model thus predicts that the volume of bade is smaller as the factor proportions become
   similar between trade rartners. This prediction is the common feature in the Heckscher-Ohlin
   model (see Krugman and Helpman (1986)).
9) Equation (17) shows that the growth rate of capital stock decreases unambiguously as Z decreases
   if (1-0) were tmcbanged in the transitional period Equation (19) indicates that (1-0) would be
   constant if saving rate were fixed over time. Although optima] saving rate can be either constant,
   increasing or deasing monotonicafly in the transitional period of the neoclassical model as
   shown in Barro and SaIaâ€”iâ€”Matin (1991, Chapter 1). the saving rate decreases over time for
   reasonable values of the jnrants in the economy considered here. The decline of saving rate
    it the transitional period can be explained intuitively as follows: As the economy starts with a
   small capital stock, it has a relatively higher ratio of (WAX) than the steady-state ratio. Thus,
   in this economy the present export of consumption goods (which is needed for the importation of
   capital goods) is ler relative to the present capital stock, implying that the present level of
   consumption relative to the capital stock is lower than the steady-state level. Hence, the
   representative consum who wishes to maximize his intertemporal utilities will decrease saving
   and reallocate his capital stock relatively mae to the consumption goods sector in order to smooth
   out his consumption over finn


                                                12
Thus, although the model considered here is built on the endogenous growth model, it
implies the convergence of income through trade among countries: international trade
makes trade partners' income gap smaller and the LDCs catch up to the DC in terms
of per capita income.lO



IY.    Trade Distortions, Capital Goods Iniports and Growth


       In the transitional period over which an economy approaches the steady-state, the
ratio of imports in investment(i.e., the ratio of imported to domestically-produced capital
goods in the investment sector) turns out to be important for the growth rate. This
section discusses what may influence the ratio of imports in investment
        Equation (22) shows that trade policies adopted by the government could be a
crucial determinant of the ratio of imports in investment. Any kind of trade distortions
imposed on capital goods imports, such as tariffs and quantitative restrictions, increases
the price of imported capital goods and thereby decrease Z. Thus the distortionary
trade policies decrease the growth rate by forcing the economy to use domestic capital
goods more than their efficient level. With other parameters equal, therefore, a high
distorted country exhibits a lower growth rate of per capita income than a low
distorted country.
        In addition to trade policies, structural features of an economy can influence how
much the economy depends on foreign capital good relative to domestic capital good in
building its own capital stock. If the economy has plentiful endowment of diversified

   growth rates can be negative to one trading pertxa which is usually the LDC in north-south
   tz For example, in Krugzmn(1981) trade with developed nations, by reventing industrialization
   in less developed countries, makes poor counties remain poor. Young(1991) shows that the less
   developed countries are likely to specialize in goods that have exhausted their po'tential to exhibit
      Sring-by-doing, so that the impact of trade on the growth rate can be negative in peor
      countries. Also see the survey by Ftndlay(1984).


                                                   13
 natural resources, it can be more easily to be self-sufficient in the production of capital
goods. Also if a country has a natural trade barrier, such as high Iransportation costs,
it is likely to import less. Thus the ratio of the foreign to the domestic component of
investment may be determined by stz-ucturai characteristics such as factor endowments
and natural trade barriers, that are present in each economy.



 V. Empirical Implementation

   1.   Secitication of the emDiricaI eauation
        The   previous sections have illustrated how international trade could lead to a
higher rate of growth in a less developed country, which imports cheaper capital goods
from developed countries in acconjance with the comparative advantage in trade. This
section investigates empirically the main theoretical prediction on the positive link
between the growth rate and the ratio of imports in investment.
        In order to test the importance of imported capital goods in economic growth, a
regression model using crossâ€”country data is specified as follows:


          GY1 = constant + aZ + bib+ Ej                                (23)



where GY is the growth rate of per capital income, and I is a set of variables that are
included in the regression as important explanatory variables. Thus, the regression
tests whether any independent effects exist with respect to the ratio of imported to
domestic capital good (Z) on the growth rate of per capita income controlling other
"relevant" explanatory variables. The "relevant" variables in I include the initial real
GD!'. the initial secondary school enrollment rate the investment share of GD!' and the
average annual rate of population growth as suggested by Levine and Renelt (1992),
who control the same variables in their regressions in order to investigate the effects
of various policy variables on growth rates.11


                                            14
      Equation (23) can be estimated, in principle, by the ordinary least squares (OLS)
method, by assuming that the ratio of imports in investment is independent of the
unmeasured country-specific en-or terms e. However, a certain degree of correlation
may exist: correlation between the imports of capital goods and the error term may
arise for instance, if any unobserved macroeconomic policy affects both imports of
capital goods and growth rate of income. If the correlation were present, unbiased
estimates of the coefficients should be obtained by using instrument variables, which
are correlated with the independent variable but not with the error terms.     Thus,
equation (23) is estimated by the two-stage least squaxes(2SLS) method in addition to
the OLS method As discussed in Section 1Y, the ratio of imports in investment can
be determined by each economy's stnictural characteristics, such as natural resources,
natural trade bather, and the trade restrictions imposed by government. Thus, in the
2SLS estimation of equation (23), we use the following variables as instruments: land
size (as a measure of total resources), distance from trade partners (as a measure of
the natural barriers) and tariff rate (as a measure of trade distortion) in addition to the
included I variables. Lee(1993), for instance, shows that in a sample of 79 countries
the share of imports in GDP are significantly relates to a log value of land size a log
value of distance from trading partners, and measures of trade distortions such as tariff
rate and black market exchange rate premium.


  2. Data
     For the empirical investigation, most of the national account data are from the
Summers and Heston(199i) data set. The growth rate is the annual rate of per capita
real GDP growth during the period of 1960-'S& The per capita real GDP in 1960 is
used for the initial income. The investment rate is measured by the average share of

11) One controversy is to include the investment rate as one of the indendent variables in the
  estimitMn.   Investment may be endogenously detarmined. For exande, in BanoQ1) and
   Ronwr(19), both the investment rate and the growth rate aie driven by the initial human cStai
   stock When the regression uses a subset of I excluding the investment rate in consid&ing this
  endogeneity problem, there is no significant change in the estimation results.

real investment in real GDP during 1960-85. The initial secondary school enrollment
ratio comes from Bazro(1990. Data for the other insthsrnent variables, such as land
size, distance from trading partners, arid tariff rate, come from LeeU99S). The distance
is an import-weighted average distance of each country to major world exporting
countries. The tariff rate is an import-weighted tariff rate on imported capital and
intermediate goods.
      Data on imports of capital goods are collected from the data tape of the OECD
Trade Series C. This data reports total value of machinery exports from OECD
countries to their individual trading paxtner.12 This measure is a good approximation
of the total value of capital goods imported by each country born its higher-Income
trade partners at world prices. Then, the value of domestic capital goods is calculated
by subtracting the value of total imported capital goods from total investment, which is
the total value of investment in terms of the PEP-adjusted current international price
in Summers and Heston(1991). The ratio of imports in investment is measured by the
value of the imported capital goods divided by the value of the domestic capital goods.


   3. Eshmation results
      Table   2 presents the estimation results of equations (23) using the compiled
cross-section data of the 89 sample countries,13) The results confirm that there is a
positive relationship between the ratio of imports in investment and the growth rates of
per capita income, when the other important variables are controlled.                   The first
regression shows that for a given value of initial income, school enrollment, population
growth, and investment rate countries grow faster if they use mere imported capital
goods than domestic capital goods in building their capital stock. The estimated
12) When the sum of machineiy and transport &uipment is used for a msure of capital goods. the
   regression results change only slightly.
13) The data set indudes all countries for which data can be assembled except Sudan, which is an
   extitne outlier. Sudan is the only country in which the value of imported capital goods is larger
   than the value of domestic capital goods over the sample galod. The credibility of the Summers
   and Heston data on Sudan is unclear. (Sudan's total investment rate on average is 0.018 in
   Summers and Heston(1991), which it was o.ir in Sumxs and Heston(l9)).


                                                16
coefficient on the ratio of imports in investment is positive and significant (the
coefficient = 0.029 and tâ€”value =     3.1).   It implies that an increase of 0.1 in the ratio of
imports in investment leads to an increase in the growth of per capita income of 0.3
percent per year. The importance of foreign capita] goods in economic growth is much
stronger in the second regression, in which the 2SLS estimation method is used: the
estimation coefficient jumps to 0.071 (tâ€”value =
      Since   the ratio of imports in investment has a significant, independent effect on
growth rates when the investment rates are controlled, imported capital goods increase
growth rates directly by enhancing the productivity of capital.            Thus, the regression
results imply that     imported    capital goods have a much higher productivity than
domestically-produced capital goods.           Therefore, by switching a portion of GDP
devoted to the purchase of domestic capital goods for investment to the importation of
cheap foreign capital goods, countries can grow faster.
      Regression (3) shown in Table 2 includes the share of imports in GDP in the
regression. If foreign trade affects growth mainly by providing access to cheaper
improted capital goods, the usual trade indicators, such as share of exports or that of
imports in GDP, may not be accurate measures for the purpose of investigating the link
between trade and growth. This conjecture can be tested by estimating the equation
(23) with the additional independent variable: the share of total imports in

    of the null hypothesis of orthogonality fails to reject at the 0.10 level.
 15) Data cont from Summer and Heston(1991). Due to the availability of the data, the sample size
    shrinks to 84 countries as it excludes Angola, Guinea, Iran, Iraq. and Taiwan from the W country
    sample.
 16) Many economists claim that there is a positive, though weak, correlation between the share of
    total imports in GDP and the growth rate (see Harrison(1991), and Quah and Rauch(1%0)). In
    contrast, Levine and Renelt(12) find that once investment is controlled. measures of trade--the
    import share in GD!' and its growth--are insignificantiy related to growth.


                                                  17
the importation of capital goods, not total imports, is the key factor that links trade to
economic growth.
     Levine and ReneltU992) note that cross-country relationship between long-run
growth rates and macroeconomic policy indicators can change a lot, depending on
which variables are included in the regressions.     In considering this skepticism
regarding the cross-country regressions, regression (4) of Table 3 includes a more
comprehensive set of rightâ€”hand side variables by adding government consumption,
political instability (number of revolutions and coups, and number of assassination), and
deviation of investment deflator, such as in Barm(1991).          With these additional
explanatory variables held constant, the estimated coefficient of the import ratio of
investment is still significant (the coefficient =   0.058   and tâ€”value =    2.7).   The
significant positive association between the ratio of imports in investment and the
growth rate appears in Figure 2 where the vertical axis is the p& capita growth rate
net of the value predicted by the regressors other than the ratio of imports in
investment.
     One would wonder whether the ratio of imports in investment is proxying for
some other unknown determinant of growth that is specific to a group of countries.
Regression (5) of Table 3 adds three continent dummies for countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa, Latin America and East Asia, and a dummy for OPEC countries to the
regression.   Again, the positive effect of capital goods import on growth appears
significantly even when the continent dummies held constant (the coefficient =        0.056

and t-value    2.4).
     The regressions of Table 2 includes all countriesâ€”both less developed countries
(LDCs) and developed countries (DCs) - in the sample. Although the benefits from
cheap foreign capital goods can be applied to any country that imports capital goods
from the higher income countries, the LDCs would get more benefits from the
importation of cheap capital goods. Regressions (1) to (4) of Table 3 presents the
estimation results of equation (23) when the sample is restricted to only 68 non-OECD
countries. The results show that the estimated coefficient of the ratio of imports in


                                           18
investment are still significantly positive in the sample of 68 non-OECD countries. In
contrast,. however, the ratio of capital goods imports shows a negative sign in the
sample of OECD countries alone (regression (5) of Table 3).. Thus, the significant
positive association between the capital goods imports and the growth rate are mainly
from the LDCs, as predicted from the model.



VI. Conclusions

    This paper examines the role of capital goods imports on economic growth.
Using an endogenous growth framework of a two-sector open economy where a core"
capital goods sector, which is produced by combining foreign and domestic capital
goods, is an "engine of growth", the model points out that lower income countries with
relatively smaller capital stocks have a comparative advantage in the consumption
goods sector and that they can grow faster by importing relatively cheaper capital
goods from higher income countries.
     The theoretical predictions accord with the regression results using cross-county
data for the period of 1960-85. The ratio of imported to domestic capital goods in the
investment sector has a significant positive effect on the per capita income growth
rates across countries, in particular, in developing countries. Thus, it is implied that
imported capital goods have a higher productivity than domestically-produced capital
goods. The growth rate is higher in a county that uses relatively more imported
capital goods for the production of capital stock than other countries at the same stage
of economic development
     This paper highlights the importance of the composition of investment in addition
to the size of total investment in determining economic growth. While the importance
of investment in economic growth has always been emphasized in literature, the issue
of how to build the investment sector has been somewhat neglected.          This paper
shows that the ratio of foreign to domestic components of investment is an important


                                          i9
factor in economic growth. More use of imported inputs, which are relatively cheaper and
more efficient than domestic capital goods, increases efficiency of capital accumulation and
thereby growth rates of income. Therefore, any trade distortions that restrict the importation
of capital goods reduce real incomes in the long run.

Table 2 Continued.
Notes: Standard errors are in parentheses. The sample includes all countries-both
      OECD and non-OECD countries. The dependent variable is the annual growth
      rate of real GDP per capita over the period 1960â€”85. The two-stage least
      squares (ZSLS) technique uses a log value of land size and a log value of
      distance from trading partners, a tariff rate in addition to the other independent
      variables in the table as instruments for the ratio of imported to domestic
      capital goods.
            The ratio of imports in investment is measured as the value of imported
      capital goods(which is the value of machinery exports from OECD countries to
      each individual country) divided by the value of the domestic capital goods
      (which is defined by subtracting the value of the imported capital goods from
      the total value of investment in terms of PPP-adjusted current international
      prices from Summers and Heston(1991)).
            Initial income is real per capital GDP in 1960 in terms of the thousand
      cuntnt international price Population growth is the annual growth rate of total
      population over the period of 1960â€”85. Investment rate is the annual average
      over the same period of the ratio of real investment to real GDR ImportJGDP
      is the annual average over the sample period of the ratio of total imports to
      GDP in terms of current international prices. These variables are from Summers
       and Heston(1991).
            Secondary school enrollment rate is the value in 1960. Gov. -cons/GDP is
      the annual average over the sample period of the ratio of real government
      consumption (exclusive of defense and eÃ§lucation) to real GDR Revolution is
      number of revolutions and coups per year. Assassination is number of
       assassination per million population per year. Deviation of investment deflator is
       measured as the magnitude of the deviation of 1960 PIP value of investment
       deflator from the mean value. These variables are taken from Barrn(1991).
