                                          ABSTRACT

This article examines age variations in support for environmental protection policies that affect

climate change using a sample of over 14,000 respondents to a 1999 Eurobarometer survey. There

is a steady decline with age in whether respondents are willing to incur higher gasoline prices to

protect the environment. This relationship remains after controlling for socioeconomic

characteristics. There are age-related differences in information about environmental risks,

information sources about the environment, perceived health risks from climate change, and degree

of worry about climate change. However, taking these factors into account does not eliminate the

age variation in willingness to pay more for gasoline to protect the environment.

1. Introduction

         Many environmental risks, including those posed by global warming, generate

long-term hazards for society. The long-term nature of these risks requires that any

effective policies must be sustained policy efforts for which the benefits will not be

immediate.1 Our working hypothesis is that people’s support for environmental policies

is governed by their self interest. Maximizing one’s own welfare may, of course, include

concern for others alive now and possibly future generations as well. Indeed, U.S.

interview evidence reported by Kempton (1991b) indicates that a desire to preserve the

environment for one’s descendents is often a prominent concern. However, because

younger people have longer future remaining lifetimes, private welfare calculations will

tend to include a larger direct personal benefit for the young than for the old.2

         Decision making governed by self interest rather than broader social welfare

calculations has potentially important ramifications for the age structure of support for

environmental policies. This article examines support for gasoline price increases to

protect the environment. Gasoline consumption is closely related to climate change.

Because of the long-term character of climate change risks and the likely delay before

there will be a payoff from policy initiatives, the degree to which different members of

society will benefit directly from climate change policies will decline with age, with

younger persons benefiting more from policies as they anticipate longer periods of

exposure to problems associated with ongoing climate change. The possibility that there

  For similar reasons, studies such as that by Read and Read (2004) have shown that older individuals are
more present-oriented with respect to financial rewards than are the young.


                                                      2
will be intergenerational differences in support for climate change initiatives has been

noted in the literature, but the empirical basis has not been explored in detail.3

        The extent to which there will be intergenerational differences in support for

higher gasoline prices will hinge on the source of these preferences. If the primary

impetus for contributing to such policies is a bequest value with respect to future

generations, then age-related differences may not be stark. One would expect greater

age-related differences in preferences if there is a dominant role of individual use values,

whereby the individuals themselves expect to benefit from policies that mitigate adverse

environmental effects. Similarly, option values in which people thought that there was

some probability that they would undertake activities that would be affected in a

favorable way by environmental policies would also decline with age.

        To examine these issues we use data from a 1999 Eurobarometer survey of

European citizens.4 The focus on Europe makes possible an assessment of how

information relating to climate change and support for environmental policies is reflected

within countries that supported the Kyoto Protocol. Whereas the European Union ratified

this international treaty that sought to reduce greenhouse gasoline emissions, the United

States did not. European interview and survey data has, of course, been the focus of

previous studies of the support for climate change policies and understanding of climate

change risks, such as Löfstedt (1991) and Kempton and Craig (1993). What is unique

about our study is that we examine risk beliefs regarding global warming and link these

risk beliefs to a measure of willingness to pay to protect the environment.

(1995).

  The 1999 survey is the most recent wave of the Eurobarometer survey that includes both global warming
risk perception questions and willingness-to-pay to protect the environment questions.


                                                    3
       The Eurobarometer data provides a quite diverse sample, with respondents from

15 countries. After accounting for missing data, the sample consists of over 14,000

individual respondents. The Eurobarometer survey includes detailed information and

precise questions pertaining to the individuals’ willingness to pay higher gasoline prices

if doing so would protect the environment. The gasoline price increase mechanism has a

variety of attractive features in that it provides a concrete and meaningful payment

mechanism for respondents. The data set also includes information on the extent of the

respondents’ environmental knowledge, their information sources, their perceived risks

of global warming, and their support for policy initiatives, making it possible to explore

age-related determinants of political support for policies to curb global warming.

       Section 2 introduces evidence on the extent to which respondents are willing to

support policies that boost gasoline prices. As the empirical results demonstrate, the

willingness to incur higher gasoline prices is quite modest, perhaps in part because

gasoline prices in Europe are already high. However, what is of greatest interest is that

there are strong age-related variations in the willingness to pay higher gasoline prices to

protect the environment.

       To explore the source of the age-related differences in willingness to pay, we

examine the roles of information and perceived risks in Section 3. Do people in different

age groups have the same extent of knowledge of environmental issues? Do the

perceived risks of global warming vary substantially by age? The evidence presented in

this paper shows that while there are systematic age differences, they are not as stark as

the willingness-to-pay disparities.




                                             4
         The respective role of the different determinants of willingness-to-pay values is

examined using regression analysis to control for demographic characteristics as well as

information sources and perceived risks. As shown in Section 4, environmental risk

information and risk beliefs each affect willingness-to-pay amounts in the expected

manner. However, as is observed in the concluding Section 5, even after controlling for

these and other influences there is an intergenerational gap, with older respondents less

willing than younger respondents to pay more for gasoline that would be less harmful to

the environment.

2. Willingness-to-Pay Measures

         Before describing the key variables of interest, we begin with an overview of the

data set. We use the Eurobarometer 51.1: Environmental Issues and Consumer

Associations, April-May 1999 survey.5 Since 1970, the administrators of the

Eurobarometer survey have undertaken a survey twice a year in each of 15 European

Union countries.6 There are about 1,000 respondents in each of the 15 represented

countries. The total sample size of Eurobarometer 51.1 is 16,144. After eliminating

observations that were missing data on key variables, we use a sample size of 14,503

individual observations for our analysis.

         The Eurobarometer survey includes information on demographic characteristics.

Our interest here is in age differences, which are reported in this survey in bands of 10

years, ages 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and age 65 and older. The regressions of

  Our analysis includes 17 countries, in that we treat Ireland and Northern Ireland as separate entities, as
well as treat East Germany and West Germany as separate countries. The other countries included in the
analysis are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, The
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Norway did not participate in the survey
considered here, though Norway does participate in some Eurobarometer surveys.


                                                      5
Section 4 also control for sex, marital status, education, and income, as well as variables

for perceptions of urban problems such as traffic congestion and whether the respondent

checked emissions in their car. More important, it also includes detailed perception and

preference information pertaining to the risks of climate change and awareness of

environmental issues.

       Developing survey questions that elicit meaningful values of environmental

policies poses considerable research challenges. As Fischhoff and Furby (1988) and

Carson, Flores, and Meade (2001) have emphasized, such contingent valuation or stated

preference studies should include well-defined commodities, a credible payment

mechanism, and internal rationality tests to demonstrate the consistency of the answers.

We will assess the performance of the Eurobarometer questions on these dimensions;

however, even perfect performance on such criteria would not satisfy some critics. Risk

analysts such as Adams (1995) express reservations about any survey effort to monetize

environmental benefits. It may well be that the Eurobarometer survey responses and

similar surveys lead to overstatements of people’s actual willingness to pay. Our main

concern, however, is not with absolute financial levels of support but with the variations

of these amounts with key variables such as age and perceived risks of global warming.

       Our policy valuation variable is willingness to pay a higher price for gasoline,

referred to in the survey as “petrol.” The willingness-to-pay questions are in two parts.

First, the survey ascertained whether the respondent would be willing to pay more for

petrol if doing so would protect the environment. In particular, for a series of products

including petrol the survey asked: “For which, if any, of the following products and

services would you be prepared to pay a little more now so that they are less harmful to




                                             6
the environment?” If the respondent indicated a willingness to pay more for petrol, the

survey ascertained how much more: “Would you be prepared to pay 10 percent more, 20

percent more, or 30 percent more for it?”7

        Using these questions, as well as other information, we construct two different

variables as measures of the respondents’ willingness to pay for gasoline. First, we

formulate an indicator variable for whether or not the subject is willing to pay more for

petrol if doing so would protect the environment. Second, we analyze the percentage

price increase that the respondent is willing to pay.

        The survey’s focus on gasoline prices has a number of attractive properties from

the standpoint of being a meaningful willingness-to-pay question. First, paying more for

gasoline is a credible payment mechanism that is more concrete than would be responses

with respect to hypothetical interview money. The danger from purely hypothetical

questions is that the willingness-to-pay responses may reflect general support for the

environment as opposed to specific support for this policy initiative. Such influences are

known as embedding effects.8 Gasoline is a well-defined commodity for which there is

substantial awareness of prices and the opportunity costs involved of paying more for

gasoline.

        By comparison, previous survey questions pertaining to willingness to pay have

been defined less precisely. For example, the World Values Survey that was the subject

of research by Israel and Levinson (2004), as well as other researchers, asked respondents

7
  There were some additional issues regarding the construction of variables. Willingness to pay percentage
amounts were coded based on the midpoints of the ranges. The survey also had an additional possible
response of being willing to pay more than 30 percent for petrol, though only 0.4 percent of respondents
fell into this group. For concreteness we will assign a 40 percent value to these people, but in the
regression analysis using a 2-limit Tobit approach, we will estimate the percentage willingness to pay
amounts without imposing any specific upper bound. The fuel price data came from GTZ Fuel Price
Surveys (1998, 2000), available at http://www.internationalfuelprices.com.
8
  For description of these influences, see Kahneman and Knetsch (1992).


                                                    7
the extent of their agreement with the statement, “I would buy things at 20 percent higher

than usual prices if it would protect the environment.” Unfortunately, this question does

not specify which prices would be increased, so that the payment mechanism is not as

concrete as it would be for an increase in gasoline prices.9

        Table 1 summarizes the age variations in the responses to the different

willingness-to-pay measures. In every case, the relatively low willingness-to-pay values

suggest that respondents took these questions as a meaningful expression of willingness

to pay, as opposed to a more general sign of support for the environment with no

financial consequences. Perhaps in part due to the existence of already high gasoline

prices in the European Union, only a minority of the respondents indicated a willingness

to pay more for gasoline.

        These willingness-to-pay amounts differ substantially. Notably, there is a steady

decline in willingness-to-pay amounts with age. The bottom row of the table reports

mean values for the pooled age 15-64 results. In every case, the mean values for those

age 15-64 are higher and significantly different from those age 65 and over. In the case

of the percentage of respondents who are willing to pay more for gasoline to protect the

environment, those aged 15-24 are twice as likely to express such willingness as those 65

and over. In terms of the percentage amount more that the respondents are willing to pay,

those aged 15-24 are willing to pay 2.8 percent more, as compared to 1 percent more for

those 65 and over. Note that for these calculations, all those who did not express a

willingness to pay more for gasoline received a zero value for the percent more that they

were willing to pay.

9
 Other examples of willingness to pay questions can be found in Israel (2004) and Dunlap, Gallup, and
Gallup (1993). Berk and Fovell (1999) explore willingness to pay measures for climate change policies
using a sample of Los Angeles residents.


                                                   8
        The final two columns in Table 1 summarize the total cents more per liter that the

respondent is willing to pay for gasoline. The third column in Table 1 provides the cents

per liter that the respondent is willing to pay, conditional on being willing to pay a

nonzero amount. These values exhibit only modest age variations, ranging from 9.1 cents

per liter for those age 65 and over to a peak value of 12.5 cents per liter for those age 25-

34. The observed differences are starker for the final column of results that reflect

sample wide averages in willingness to pay including those responding they would pay

zero amounts. Whereas those 65 and over are willing to pay an average of 1 cent per

liter, the age 15-64 average is 2.3 cents and the value for those age 25-34 is 2.7 cents.

3. Information and Risk Beliefs

        Particularly among those age 65 and above there is a pronounced age-related

decline in willingness to pay a higher gasoline tax to protect the environment. If these

age-related differences can be traced to age-related factors such as shorter life

expectancy, the prospects for changing their degree of political support are not bright.

However, if the shortfall can be traced to a lack of information about the risks of global

warming, then informational policies potentially could muster broader support for climate

change initiatives. Previous studies have used large scale interviews as a technique that

they call a “mental models” approach in which a small sample is interviewed in depth

regarding their conceptualization of climate change issues. 10 These studies have shown

that the U.S. public often does not fully understand climate change. For example, they

often confuse ozone depletion with global warming. The Eurobarometer survey does not

  See Kempton (1991a, 1997) for a mental models analysis, as well as Bostrom, Morgan, Fischhoff, and
Read (1994). Read, Bostrom, Morgan, and Fischhoff (1994) report on a larger-scale interview study in the
same vein.


                                                   9
include questions that can be used to test the accuracy of beliefs, but it does include self-

assessed degrees of knowledge and beliefs.

       The Eurobarometer survey includes a series of questions that can be used to

establish measures of the respondent’s informational bases and perceived threat from

climate change. One set of questions pertains to the individual’s self assessment of

whether he or she is informed about environmental risks. The particular question used in

this analysis asked respondents how well they were informed about “major

environmental problems, like holes in the ozone layer, global warming, the disappearance

of forests, etc.” For purposes of our subsequent regression analysis, we define three

indicator variables equal to one for those who respond that they were very well informed,

fairly well informed, or fairly badly informed about these major global environmental

problems, and zero otherwise. The indicator variable group omitted from the regressions

is people who were not informed at all, so that subsequent regression effects are relative

to this uninformed group.

       To provide an overview of these perceptions, in Table 2 we pool some of these

groups to make the presentation of the results more parsimonious. Thus, in the first

column we contrast those who are very well informed or fairly well informed with those

who are badly informed or not informed at all. As the age group mean values reported in

Table 2 indicate, roughly half of each age group considers themselves to be very well

informed or fairly well informed about global environmental risks. The age group 65 and

above has 47 percent who consider themselves to be well informed, as compared to 54

percent for the pooled age groups 15-64. Within this younger age band, the degree to




                                             10
which people are well informed does not vary greatly by age, as it ranges from 52 percent

for those 55-64 to 56 percent for those 15-24.

        Being aware of environmental problems does not necessarily mean that people

believe that problems pose a risk to them. The first measure of risk belief is the extent to

which respondents believe that climate change would affect their health. This measure

reflects a combination of perceived climate change problems and their personal

vulnerability to these problems. Once again, our regression analysis will use a detailed

version of the variable, distinguishing with separate indicator variables those who believe

climate change will affect health a lot, a little, or not at all. For the purposes of Table 2,

we contrast those who believe it would affect health a lot with the pooled group of those

who believe it would affect health a little or not at all. As the data in the second to last

column in Table 2 indicate, roughly two-fifths of all age groups perceive a risk to their

health. Those age 65 and over are significantly less likely to perceive a health risk, but

the 3 percentage point difference with those age 15-64, although statistically significant,

is not substantial.

        The final risk perception question analyzed is the extent to which individuals are

worried about the risks of global warming. The particular wording of the survey question

asked respondents whether they were “very worried, somewhat worried, not very

worried, or not at all worried” about a series of nine possible problems. Respondents

who indicate that they were very worried about “global warming (greenhouse effect)”

received a value of 1 for the variable that we call “very worried about global warming.”

Similarly, there are separate indicator variables for whether the respondent was

“somewhat worried” or “not very worried”, with “not at all worried” about global




                                              11
warming the omitted category in the regressions. In Table 2, we contrast the very

worried group with the other three categories.

        Those age 65 and over express lower degrees of worry about global warming than

do the other age groups. As the values in the final column of Table 2 indicate, 33 percent

of those age 65 and over are very worried about global warming, which is just over 4

percentage points less than those age 15-64. This measure of risk beliefs rises then falls

with age, reaching a peak of 40 percent among those age 35-44. Once again, these

differences as well as the other pattern in Table 2 are not as pronounced as are the

willingness-to-pay differences.

        Could these differences in beliefs stem in part from a different informational

base? People in different age groups rely on different information sources. Respondents

were asked, “When you are looking for information on the environment, which of the

following sources do you use?” followed by a list of nine sources such as newspapers and

magazines, television, and friends. Use of newspapers or studies by environmental

groups, for example, could affect not only the extent of one’s knowledge but also the

willingness to spend funds to address environmental risks. Table 3 reports usage of

sources for environmental information for two age groups, those age 65 and above and

those age 15-64. Three-fourths of the population use television as an information source,

with somewhat greater usage by those age 65 and above. However, for every other

category for which there are statistically significant differences, those age 15-64 are more

likely to use that information source. The differences are particularly great for use of the

internet, books, and information from environmental organizations.11 Overall, those age


11
  Some of these effects could, of course, be endogenous. Those with greater interest in environmental
problems could seek out more information.


                                                   12
65 and above draw on 2.3 information sources as compared to 2.7 for those under 65.

Thus, both the number of sources used and the composition of the sources relied upon

differ by age.

4. Willingness-to-Pay Regression Estimates

       To distinguish the influences on willingness to pay of age versus factors

correlated with age, it is instructive to consider regression estimates for the two

willingness-to-pay questions in the Eurobarometer survey. To estimate the dichotomous

choice of whether respondents are willing to pay more for gasoline to protect the

environment, we use probit regression and report estimates for which the coefficients

have been transformed to reflect marginal probabilities. The additional percentage

amount that respondents are willing to pay for gasoline poses two econometric issues, the

many responses at the lower bound of zero and the unbounded category of possible

responses, which was “over 30 percent.” The double bounded Tobit estimates for the

gasoline price percentage increase addresses each of these concerns. We report Tobit

coefficients that are the unconditional marginal effects of each variable.

       For both of these willingness-to-pay measures, Table 4 reports estimates by age

group with and without the set of risk perception variables and the indicator variables for

different information sources. Each equation also includes an extensive set of additional

characteristic variables and country indicator variables. Specifically, all equations

control for income, education, indicator variables for gender and marital status, and

country of residence. The equations controlling for risk perceptions and information

sources reported in columns 2 and 4 also control for whether the respondent checks

automobile emissions. The check emissions variable, which has a significant positive




                                             13
effect, provides a validity test for whether private actions are consistent with the

expressed willingness-to-pay measure. The omitted age group is age 65 and over so that

all age coefficients are interpreted relative to this group.

        The results in columns 1 and 2 in Table 4 for whether the respondent is willing to

pay more indicate that the age 65 and over group has a significantly lower willingness to

pay any positive amount relative to all other groups. For this discrete response, people in

older age brackets have a 0.05 to 0.09 lower probability of being willing to pay more for

gasoline even after including extensive controls for other demographic influences. The

results for the percent higher gas price one is willing to pay, reported in columns 3 and 4

of Table 4, follow a similar pattern of a drop-off with age in willingness to pay.

Although not all of the age category coefficients are significantly different from one

another, there is a steadily declining pattern by age for both sets of results and a

significant difference with those aged 65 and over.

        The steepest decline in both the probit and Tobit estimates is for those age 65 and

above relative to the age 55-64 group. The drop-off in the estimated effect by moving

into that age group is of roughly the same magnitude as the observed drop between the

age groups 15-24 and 55-64. Thus, the effects of the age variable are not proportional to

remaining life expectancy.

        Each equation also includes a set of personal characteristic variables. Neither

gender nor marital status are influential, but education levels and, to a lesser extent,

income, boost the level of support for higher petrol prices to protect the environment.

Education and income will reflect the respondent’s affluence in terms of lifetime wealth

and current income levels. If environmental amenities are a normal economic good, the




                                              14
person’s willingness to pay for environmental policies should increase with income.

However, the support being examined in this survey is in terms of higher petrol prices,

not a lump sum donation to protect the environment. If the amount of gas purchased

increases substantially with income, the effect of income on support for a gas tax is

ambiguous even if overall willingness to pay to protect the environment increases with

income.12 The estimates in Table 4 control for gasoline consumption to the extent that is

feasible with the Eurobarometer data in that car usage will be reflected in the check

emissions variables and the country variables. The possibly competing effects of higher

petrol prices as a policy instrument may account for the weaker effect of income levels

on support for higher gas prices, as compared to the influence of education levels, which

proxy lifetime wealth.

           The equations in columns 2 and 4 in Table 4 add measures of risk belief, risk

knowledge, and risk information. The effects on whether the respondent is willing to

pay, which are shown in column 2, are very similar to the percentage amount results in

column 4, so we will discuss them together. Each of the willingness-to-pay measures

increases if the person is very worried or somewhat worried about global warming, and

there is no significant effect of being not very worried about global warming. In terms of

the magnitude of the effects, being very worried increases the probability of supporting

higher gas prices by 0.08, and being somewhat worried boosts this probability by 0.05.

These effects are relative to the omitted indicator variable category of not being worried

at all. The declining pattern of coefficients as the degree of worry decreases also follows

the expected pattern.

increase in the expected direction. If climate change is believed to affect one’s health a

lot, the probability of support is 0.04 higher, and it is 0.02 higher if climate change will

affect health a little.

           These two sets of results for worry about climate change and perceived effects of

climate change on health share a consistent theme. On a theoretical basis, the degree of

support for an increase in petrol price should increase with the extent of the risk that is

being addressed.13 This overall relationship is clearly borne out in these results, both in

terms of the direction of effects and the declining magnitude of the effects for less

strongly held risk beliefs.

           The degree to which the respondent is informed at all about environmental

problems has effects of comparable magnitude. Relative to not being informed at all

about environmental problems, being fairly well informed raised the probability of

support by 0.05, and being either very well informed or fairly badly informed raises the

probability of support by 0.03.

           Many specific individual information sources also have incremental effects on

willingness to pay even after accounting for these risk belief variables. In terms of

magnitude, the strongest influences are the positive coefficients for books, information

provided by environmental organizations, and the internet. These are all sources that

those age 65 and above use at a lower rate than do younger age groups. Information

sources used extensively by the oldest age group – television and radio – have

comparatively minor effects.

       The differences by country are interesting as well. The omitted country category

is Austria. Consider the results in column 1 of Table 4 for whether the respondent favors

higher gas prices to protect the environment. Residents in two countries, East Germany

and France, have a significantly lower probability of supporting higher prices; however,

respondents in 10 other countries have significantly higher probabilities of such support.

Countries with strong environmental movements and substantial vulnerability to the

flooding risks of global warming display especially strong levels of support. The

countries for which respondents have a probability of support of at least 0.10 greater than

Austria are Denmark, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, and Sweden.

       Even after controlling for this diverse set of risk perceptions and informational

factors, the pronounced age variations remain and are reduced in magnitude by only a

modest amount. Differences in demographic background, risk beliefs, extent of

knowledge, information sources, and country of residence do not account for the

substantial intergenerational gap in willingness to pay.

5. Conclusions

       Given the long time lag before any climate change initiatives can produce

demonstrable policy results, there has long been speculation in the literature that support

for climate change policies may differ substantially across the population based on

individual age. To examine whether there are important intergenerational differences in

support for global warming policies, this article examined a large sample of respondents

to the 1999 Eurobarometer survey. The detailed data available in the survey makes it

possible to analyze both the overall levels of environmental risk information and




                                            17
willingness to pay for environmental initiatives while controlling for background factors

that may influence these outcomes.

       The respondents’ willingness to pay higher gasoline prices to address

environmental problems revealed stark age-related differences. For each of the measures

of willingness to pay considered, there was an overall drop-off in the willingness-to-pay

value with age. Those over age 65 were half as likely to be willing to pay more for

gasoline and, on average, were willing to pay just over one-third as much as were people

aged 15-24.

       A possible explanation for the willingness-to-pay differences is that there are age-

related differences in environmental risk information and concern about environmental

risks. Sources of environmental risk information also differ by age. Younger age groups

are more likely to avail themselves of almost every form of available information

sources, ranging from drawing upon newspaper articles to reading reports from

environmental groups. While there are in fact unambiguous age-related differences in

environmental risk information and risk beliefs, these influences do not account for a

great deal of the age-related variation in willingness to pay.

       What these results suggest is that the concrete support that people may exhibit for

climate change policies cannot be traced solely to a disinterested bequest motive with

respect to future generations. Younger age groups may believe that they will personally

benefit more from climate change policies. In addition, their children will also benefit to

a larger extent, since they are even younger, so that concerns with respect to the next

generation will reap a longer-term benefit for younger respondents than for older

respondents. For countries such as the United States, for which there is going to be a




                                             18
substantial growth in the percentage share of the age 65 and over population, there may

be a decline in the overall country’s political support for climate change policies unless

they can be characterized in a manner that better addresses the concerns of the older

segments of the population.
