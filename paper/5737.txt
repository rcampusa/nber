                                  CONSEQUENCES FOR CITIES

                                              ABSTRACT




         This paper demonstrates that rising crime rates in cities are correlated with city depopulation.

Instrumental variables estimates, using measures of the certainty and severity of a state’s criminal

justice system as instruments for city crime rates, imply that the direction of causality runs from

crime to urban flight. Using annual city-level panel data, our estimates suggest that each additional

reported crime is associated with a one person decline in city residents. There is some evidence that

increases in suburban crime tend to keep people in cities, although the magnitude of this effect is

small.   Analysis of individual-level   data from the 1980 census confirms the city-level results and

demonstrates that almost all of the crime-related population decline is attributable to increased out-

migration   rather than a decrease in new arrivals to a city. Those households that leave the city

because of crime are much more likely to remain within the SMSA than those leaving the city for

other reasons. The migration decisions of high-income households and those with children are much

more responsive to changes in crime than other households.        Crime-related mobility imposes costs

on those who choose to remain in the city through declining property values and a shrinking tax

base.

           The difficulties         confronting        large American          cities in recent      decades       are well


documented.’             The urban riots of the late 1960s                  turned    the post-war        suburbanization                trend


into large-scale         urban flight.        A declining        tax base, shrinking         federal    subsidies,         tax


limitations,       and city residents          in need of greater          public services         has pushed        many         cities to


the brink of fiscal crisis.               Among    the greatest        difficulties      faced    by large American               cities    is


crime.       Violent     crime    rates in U.S.        cities with     populations        over 500,000           in 1993      were         four


times      higher than in cities with             populations       below      50,000,     and seven times           greater        than in


rural areas. z Higher            crime rates in large cities are even more remarkable                            when       one


considers       that     both per capita        expenditures         on police and the level of victim                precaution


(e.g.    locking      doors,     private    security    guards,      alarm systems)         are much greater              in large


cities.3


           This paper examines               the link between          crime and urban flight.4               Although       there         is an


extensive       literature       analyzing     this subject       (e.g. Taeuber       and Taeuber         1965,      Bradford         and


Kelejian      1973,      Frey 1979,         MarshalI     1979,      Marshall     and O’Flaherty         1987),     there     has been


relatively     little focus       on the role of crime in explaining                 the phenomenon,             A handful          of


studies      have included         the level of crime as a right-hand                 side variable       in cross-city           OLS



        1 See, for instance,          Bradbury,        Downs,       and Small (1 982),           Gottdeiner      (1 986),        Wilson
(1 987),      and Inman,         Craig,    and Lute      (1 994).

    2 The Uniform Crime Re~o rts, which reflect only those crimes reported to the police,
are likely to understate the actual difference  in crime rates across city types because of the
greater likelihood a crime will be reported to the police in smaller cities (Levitt 1995),

        3 In 1990-1991,           cities with     population        over one million spent             an average         of $210          per
capita     on police protection,             whereas      cities with      populations      below       75,000      residents
expended          an average       of $97      per capita     (U.S.    Department         of Commerce            1993).

        4 While    urban flight       is interesting      in its own right, declines              in city population             are also
correlated        with    increases        in the percent     of families       below     the poverty         line in the city, the
fraction      of city residents           failing to complete         high school,       and declines         in median      housing
values.       Thus,      urban flight       proxies    for city decline        more generally.

                                                                       1
estimates       of urban flight.            These      studies    typically      obtain      a positive     relationship          between


crime rates and urban flight                  (e.g.     Frey 1979,        Grubb      1982,     Katzman        1980,       Sampson          and


Wooldredge           1986).5


            In contrast        to previous         research      on the topic,        our analysis        focuses       primarily        on the


impact      of changes           in crime rates rather than levels.                   There    are both theoretical               and


methodological           justifications        for examining           changes       in crime rates.          From a theoretical


perspective,         the simplest          residential      choice     model predicts          that changes            in crime rates,        not


levels,     will influence        changes       in city populations              On a practical          level,     focusing      on changes


mitigates      problems          associated        with    non-comparabilities            in crime reporting             rates,    crime


definitions,     and police department                    practices     across cities         (O’Brien     1985).


            Section     I documents           the strong empirical              correlation      between          rising crime          rates and


central     city population          declines       using a panel of 137              cities over the period              1976-1993.


After     controlling      for other factors,             each additional          reported     crime in a central              city is


associated       with     a net decline         of about        one resident.         Higher suburban              crime rates tend to


keep people          in central     cities,    although         the magnitude         of this effect        is much smaller               than for


crimes      within     cities.


            Of course,        one cannot           necessarily     draw        any causa/      conclusions          from these




    5 Previous          research      has also documented                 a positive      relationship        between           population
turnover       and crime         rates at the neighborhood                level,     especially     in poor neighborhoods                   (Smith
and Jarjoura          1988,      Taylor     and Covington             1988).       In contrast    to that         literature,     which
focuses      on gross flows           of residents,         our analysis         is concerned       with      net population             changes.

    G In a simple          model where             property      values       fully capitalize     the costs and benefits                  of a
location,      then changes          in amenities          can be captured            by changes         in housing        values        without
any net population               change.      Relocation         costs and heterogeneous                  tastes      affect     the
composition          of the residents,             but do not necessarily             imply any change              in the total         number
of city residents.            In this paper,          we take the empirical            regularity        of fluctuating          city
populations          as a starting        point,      leaving    the theoretical        puzzle    of why          property       values     do not
fully adjust     for future         work.

                                                                          2
estimates.       While     the most obvious             causal     link runs from rising crime rates to urban flight,


it is also possible       that an omitted             third factor     may be responsible             for both rising crime                and


urban flight.         For instance,        if population     loss in shrinking            cities is disproportionately


comprised       of high income            individuals     (who tend to have lower                  rates of crime victimization),


then the average          crime rate among              remaining      city residents           will rise, even if each resident’s


risk of victimization        is unchanged.              On the other hand,             since crime rates are strongly


positively     correlated        with    city size, city growth            is likely to be correlated            with    rising crime


rates.   If that      is the case,        OLS may understate               the causal      impact     of crime on city


population.


         We attempt          to establish        a causal     link between         crime and urban flight through                        the


use of instrumental          variables        in Section     Il.    A valid instrument             must affect     the crime         rate


but not otherwise           belong       in the equation          explaining     city population         changes.         The logical


source   of such instruments                is changes      in the punitiveness                of the criminal    justice     system.              In


particular,     we use lagged            changes       in state    prison commitments                and state     prison releases


per crime.       These     variables        are demonstrated           to affect       crime      in the predicted        manner,         yet


are plausibly         excluded     from the city population                equation.       The estimated          impact     of crime on


city population         using 2SLS         are slightly     larger than the OLS estimates,                  suggesting            that     any


bias in the OLS estimates                 resulting     from omitted         variables         or compositional         changes          in city


population       is overwhelmed            by the tendency           for large cities to have higher crime rates.


         A major        limitation       of the above       panel-data         analysis        is that it addresses        only


aggregate       population        changes.       Using PUMS           data from the 5 percent              sample         of the     1980


census       yields    a number         of additional     insights     in Section       Ill.    We are able to obtain             estimated


migration       in and out of 81 U.S.            cities by income            category,         race, and family         status.      Using


census       data,    it is also possible       to distinguish         between      increasing        out-migration         and


                                                                       3
declining     in-migration      and to identify        the destinations       of those      who leave cities.             Our results


suggest      that almost       all of the impact          of crime on city population           results     from increased           out-


migration;      the link between         changes       in crime and in-migration           appears        weak.      Seventy


percent      of those     people     leaving     central    cities due to crime remain            within    the SMSA,


compared       to forty     percent     of all central      city out-migrants.          The mobility        decisions       of high


income      households        are five times       more responsive         to changing         crime rates than those             of


the poor.       Whites     and blacks show           similar responses        to crime.        Households         with    children


are twice      as responsive         to crime     as households        without     children.


           Section       IV summarizes         the results    of the paper and provides             rough calculations            of


the costs of crime          and crime-related         mobility     for cities and their residents.                In addition     to


the direct     costs of victimization,            crime imposes        numerous       other costs on city residents.


Because       crime-related        out-migration      is concentrated         among      the rich, rising crime will be


accompanied          by increasing       concentrations         of poverty.       While    those    remaining        in the city


are likely to have greater             need for locally provided          public services         such as police protection,


public education,          public transportation,           and city hospitals,       the ability to provide             those


services      is diminished.         Evidence     also suggests        that rising crime rates are associated                    with


declining     housing      prices,     eroding    the property     tax base, which          is the primary          revenue


source      of cities,     In the presence         of fiscal increasing       returns     (Blanchard       and Summers


1987),      cities can be caught          in a downward          spiral in which        rising tax rates lower           real


wages.       To the extent         that peer effects         are important       to human       capital    development           (Case

groups will exert          a further    negative     externality       on those    left behind.

Section     1: Correlations     between        Changes      in Crime     and C hanaes         in Citv POK)UIation


           We begin our analysis          by specifying        a simple    reduced-form          relationship     between


changes      in crime    and changes          in city population.       We include       changes      in both central            city


and suburban       crime      rates in the specification,        along with          a range of other covariates


described      below    to capture     socioeconomic,          economic       and demographic             characteristics         of


the city,    SMSA,      and state.       Our logic for focusing          on changes       in crime rates is that            in


equilibrium,     the previous        level of crime in a city will already             have been incorporated               into the


individual’s    residential     choice       decision    (although     potentially     with    some adjustment          lag).


The theoretical        prediction     that changes        and not levels of crime should effect                 changes          in


city population        is strongly    supported         by the empirical     evidence         presented     later in the paper.


The basic specification          we employ         is as follows:


  Aln (CITY_ POPit) = ~lACITY                           CRIMEit + fi2ASUBURB_CRIMEit + P3 UNEM
                                      + ~4 INC;MEit_l + ~~aln                 (S TATEPOpit_l)                                         (1)

where      the subscripts      1, t, and r index cities,       time,     and regions      respectively.         The population


variable    is in log changes         whereas      the two     crime variables        are in changes         in per capita


rates.     This specification        allows     the impact     of changes      in crime on mobility           to be


independent       of the level of crime;          other specifications        such as log changes             in both crime


and population,         or changes      in levels of both variables,          lead to similar results           when


evaluated      at the sample         mean.     With     the exception      of the crime variables,           which     enter


contemporaneously             and will be instrumented,           one year lags are used for all of the other


covariates      to reduce      endogeneity        problems.’     In addition     to economic         controls,     a set of




     7 It is unclear      whether      these     covariates    should enter in levels or changes.                  The same
logic that     makes     changes      rather than levels of crime rates appropriate                   suggests        changes           for

                                                                 5
variables       reflecting     the age distribution              of the population,             lagged       log-changes         in state


populations,        and a variety          of indicator        variables        are included         to capture        other systematic


sources        of variation.


           Equation       (1) is estimated            using a panel of data covering                       the years     1976-1993            for


137     U.S.    central      cities with      populations          greater      than   100,000             in 1975.     Throughout           the


analysis       we allow       for heteroskedasticity               by city size.          Data limitations            necessitate      a number


of compromises            because         the analysis        is performed         at the city level.              Annual      data on net


migration        is unavailable,         so changes          in overall       city population,             which    are influenced          not


only by migration            but also by birth, death,               and immigration             rates,       are used instead.             Birth


and death        rates    (approximately            1.5 and 0,9         per hundred)         are relatively           low compared            to


gross flows        due to migration               (roughly    six percent         of the U.S. population                moves       across


county      lines each year (Schwartz                  1987)).     a Immigration            rates in the United              States    over the


time period examined               are roughly         0.2    percent         per year.     Sampson           and Wooldredge               (1 986),


using data from the decennial                      census,     find that their results              are not sensitive           to the choice


of overall      city population           changes       versus      net migration          flows.          Our results       are also robust


to the use of net migration                 data from the Census                  in Section        Ill.


           The crime rates used are the per capita                            number      of index crimes             reported      to the


police and collected            in Uniform          Crime     Re~orts.         Given that less than half of all




these    other variables         as well.          On the other hand, the demographic                           controls      may be picking
up differential       levels of mobility             across groups            (e.g. young       adults       move      six times      as
frequently       as those      over age 65),           which       suggests       levels as the correct               choice.      The results
that follow       include      levels.      An earlier version            of this paper (available                 on request      from the
authors)       utilized   changes         with     little effect    on the crime coefficients.

      8 Moreoverr         movers         affect    city populations            in both the community                  they    leave and the
community         they    move to, whereas               births and deaths             affect     only one community.                  This
effectively       doubles      the importance            of migration          in explaining         city-level       population      flows.

                                                                          6
victimizations         are reported      to the police,        the UCR crime data are potentially                    contaminated


by substantial         measurement          error.     Victimization         data,    however,       is not available        below     the

level of regions,        necessitating          the use of UCR statistics.                 In a previous      version     of this


paper,     we attempted          to disaggregate          crimes      into violent        and property,       obtaining      similar


coefficients      on both types.            The high degree           of collinearity        between      those     two   crime


classifications        makes     it difficult     to separately        identify      the coefficients,        particularly      in the IV


estimates      presented        in Section       Il.   Consequently          we present        only estimates          aggregated


over all crime categories             in the tables;         full results     disaggregating         crimes     into violent      and


property     are available       from the authors             on request.           We use crime rates in the rest of the


Metropolitan       Statistical      Area,       excluding      the central      city,     as our measure          of suburban        crime.


           The types      of covariates          available     in a city-level        panel are less than ideal.             Most      city-


Ievel data is collected           only in decennial           census       years,    necessitating        a tradeoff      between       the


level of aggregation            of the data and the frequency                   of collection.       As a general         principle,      we


use the most disaggregated                  annual      source of data available              in our regressions.


Unemployment            rates    are available         annually     by SMSA.            Per capita    income       is available      on a


yearly     basis at the state         level.     The age distribution             of the population          is also available


annually     by state.      We choose            to linearly      interpolate       the percent      of a city’s     population        that


is black from decennial             census       data rather than using state-level                  data.     In the OLS


regressions       of this section,        the primary          strategy      adopted       for minimizing      the problems


associated       with    the lack of good controls                is the inclusion         of numerous        indicator      variables:


year dummies,           region dummies            corresponding            to the nine census          regions,     and city-fixed


effects.       Because     the left-hand         side variable        is already        in differences,      a city-fixed     effect


picks up within-city            trends   over time.          In some cases,           we replace       the year and region


indicators      with    region-year      interactions          to better     control      for regional     economic       and


                                                                       7
demographic          shifts     as well as possible           changes        over time in tastes         for climate         or other


regional    characteristics.              Two     further   points about the lack of good control                     variables        are


also worth         noting,      First, in the instrumental            variables      estimates,       as long as the omitted


variables     are uncorrelated             with    the instruments,           consistent     estimates         of the crime


parameters         will nonetheless             be obtained.      Second,        in Section      Ill of the paper where              we use


individual-level       data from the census                 and therefore        have a much          better    set of controls,             we


obtain     similar    results     whether         we use the limited           set of covariates        utilized    here or a greatly


expanded       set of covariates             including      household-level         controls.


           Summary           statistics     for the data are presented              in Table     1.    For those         variables        that


enter equation         (1 ) as changes,            summary       statistics     for both the levels and changes                   are


shown.       OLS regression           results        are presented         for a range of specifications             in Table        2.


Column       1 corresponds           directly      to equation      (1).     Column     2 adds city-fixed           effects.      Column


3 includes      both city-fixed            effects    and region-year          interactions.       Columns         4-6    mirror the first


three    columns       with     once-lagged          crime levels added to the specification.

           The coefficients          on the crime rate changes                  are in the top two         rows.         Including        city-


fixed    effects     and region-year             interactions     improves       the fit of the model           but has little effect


on the crime variables.               The crime coefficients                are statistically     significant       in all


specifications.          For the purposes              of interpreting        the results,      the change       in city residents               for


each additional         reported          crime is a useful measure             of the magnitude          of the effect.             It is


straightforward         to demonstrate               that D1 closely        approximates        (but slightly      overstates)            that


measure       and thus is directly              interpretable.    g The interpretation            of ~z is more complicated,




    9 The larger is the variation                    in crime rates relative to the variation in city populations,
the closer is the approximation.                       In our data, the standard deviation of percent changes in
year-to-year         crime     rates is five to six times           larger than the corresponding                  value for city
populations.

                                                                       8
however,       because       it depends       on the relative       sizes of the city and suburban                   populations.            In


our data,     suburbs        on average       have three times             as many     residents       as central     cities.    Thus,


to determine          the change      in city residents         per additional         suburban      crime at the mean             of our


sample,      one must divide          ~z by three.         According        to the estimates,          an additional      city crime


is associated         with   a decline      in city population         of about one resident.               The coefficient        on


suburban       crime    rates translate           into an impact       about one-sixth           as large as that for city crime


rates.     A one-standard          deviation        change      in city crime rates (roughly              a ten percent         change


in crime),     translates      into a decline        in city population          of slightly     less than one percent.


           The other covariates             enter    in a plausible        manner.      A percentage          point change         in


SMSA       unemployment            leads to a 0.035          to 0.23       percent     decline    in city population.           This


translates      into a decrease           of between        5 and 35 city residents              for each     100     additional


persons      unemployed.           That     estimate       is similar in magnitude           to the state-level         estimates           in


Blanchard       and Katz (1 992),            The size of the unemployment                   effect     on city populations


increases      substantially        when      city-fixed     effects       are included.       There     is some evidence           that


cities    located     in states     with    higher per capita          income     tend to grow          faster.     Cities with         a


higher     initial fraction       of black residents         appear to grow          more slowly,         mirroring      the earlier

findings     of Frey (1 979).          There       is little within-city       variation     in percent      black,     however,            so


with     city-fixed     effects    the estimates           are imprecise.        The age coefficients,            which     are relative


to the omitted         category      “over age 65, ” flip sign with the inclusion                       of city-fixed     effects.


The coefficient         on lagged         state    population     growth       is very large with         estimated       elasticities


between       0.33     to 0.64.      Excluding        this variable,        however,       has little impact        on the crime


parameters.


           The specifications          in columns          1-3 of Table       2 assume       that changes           in crime    and

lagged    crime rates       are statistically       significant,     and the magnitudes               of the coefficients      are


generally     less than a tenth          as large as those         associated      with    changes       in crime rates.


Lagged      crime changes          also appear       to have weak         explanatory       power,      as do /cads of crime


changes.


          We have also explored               numerous        other variants      of the basic specification            (not


shown       in tabular    form).      Estimating      the model using fixed            effects     or longer differences          in


place of one-year          differences       yields similar estimates.            Dividing       the sample     according      to


time period,        we cannot        reject the null of equal coefficients              across the two         parts of the


sample.       Finally,   splitting    the sample       by city size, we cannot              reject the null of equality


across    cities greater         than or less than 250,000              in population.




Sect ion 11:Establishing            Causa Iitv in the Relationship            between       C itv PODulations       and Crime


w

          The preceding           section    documents         a strong     negative      correlation     between    changes           in


crime rates and changes               in city populations,         but cannot      provide       any clear guidance         about


the direction        of causality.      While      one possibility      is that rising crime rates           lead to urban


flight,   there     are also a number          of plausible      channels     through      which      population    changes


might     affect     crime rates.      Looking      cross-sectionally,        crime rates are much             higher in large


urban areas,         suggesting      that increases          in city population     lead to higher crime rates,             due


perhaps      to increased         criminal   opportunities       in densely     settled      areas,     the increased


anonymity          of big-city     life, or because     big cities attract        likely criminals        (e.g. Glaeser     and




                                                                   10
Sacerdote       1996).’0       If that    is the case, the estimates              of the previous         section     may


understate      the true causal          relationship      between        city crime and depopulation                since city


growth     will lead to higher crime rates.


          On the other         hand, there       are a number          of factors     suggesting         that the OLS estimates


may overstate           the true magnitude           of the causal        impact     of city crime.        First, an omitted


third variable       that    is positively     correlated     with     changes       in crime rates and negatively


correlated     with      city population       changes       could explain         the negative         OLS coefficient.


Second,       if the pool of residents          in shrinking       cities is increasingly           comprised       of less mobile


groups that      are also more likely to engage                  in criminal      activity,     then depopulation            might      be


associated      with      increasing      per capita     crime rates.’l         Wilson        (1 987)   further    argues      for non-


Iinearities    between        concentrations         of poverty        and crime that would              exacerbate         this bias.


Third,   if there     is measurement           error in city populations,            then a ratio-bias        problem         is present


since crime      rates are defined           on a per capita         basis.     Unlike the standard           regression        model


where     measurement              error in the left-hand        side variable       will not bias the coefficients,                 when


the dependent           variable     appears    in the denominator             of the right-hand          side variables,


measurement           error induces         a negative     bias.12     Finally,    city population         may be an incorrect




     10 Where        data    are available,      urban crime rates are almost                   always     higher than rural crime
rates.     Beattie      (1 995),     for instance,     reports    that for the period            1690-1720,         prosecutions          for
offenses      against       property     in the city of London were               almost      seven times         greater     than the
mostly     rural counties          of Essex and Sussex,            An apparent         exception         to this pattern        is
American       cities    in the late 1800s;          the emergence            of the professional          police force        in the
latter half of the 19th century appears to have dramatically                                  reduced     the amount         of disorder
in large American cities (Monkkonen    1981).

     11 One caveat           to this argument          is that the rich are more likely to report                    crimes     to the
police than the poor, so even if the actual                      victimization       rate rises due to compositional
changes,       the reported         crime    rate may not.

     12 When         an individual       household’s        mobility      decision    is used as the dependent                 variable      in
Table    8, ratio bias is not a concern.                 The results       are unaffected,          suggesting       ratio-bias       is not

                                                                     11
denominator          for crime rates if a large fraction               of the victims      of crime are commuters                or


tourists,      If many      former     city residents       relocate     to the suburbs         but continue      to work        in the


central     city and be victimized             therer13 this could induce            a spurious     negative      correlation


between       city populations          and city crime rates as measured                 in this paper.


            We attempt          to determine       causality    through     the use of instrumental             variables.        In


what      follows,     we focus       our efforts      on instrumenting        for city crime rates,         treating       suburban


crime rates as exogenous                to city population.            From a theoretical        perspective,       the


endogeneity          stories    discussed      above    are more directly           applicable    and compellin9          for city


crime     rates     (e.g. reverse      causality     and ratio bias).       Empirically,        we have also experimented


with     instrumenting         for both city and suburban               crime rates,     with    no impact      on the city crime


coefficients.         Because       of a weaker       first-stage      fit, we can never reject         that the suburban


crime coefficients             are equal to zero when           instrumented.


            Valid    instruments       for the city crime variable           must affect         city crime rates,        but not


otherwise         belong    in the equation         determining        city population     changes.       The natural        choices

of such instruments              are measures        of the severity       of the state     criminal    justice     system,


which       will reduce     crime either through            deterrence      or incapacitation,        but should      have little


effect      on city migration         except     via crime.      The two     instruments         we use exploit       the well-


documented           crime-reducing         impact     of prisons.       Prisoner    self-reports     suggest      that the


median       prisoner      commits      roughly      15 index crimes        a year prior to incarceration             (Dilulio     and


Piehl 1991,          Spelman       1994).      Panel-data      analyses     using state-level       aggregates,       which


capture      not only incapacitation,              but also deterrence        and replacement          effects,     yield




a major problem            here.

     13 Census data on place of work suggests that roughly 80 percent of those who work
in the central city continue to work there after moving residence to the suburbs.

                                                                    12
estimates      of crime       reductions      per prisoner       of similar magnitudes           (Marvell     and Moody         1994,


Levitt   1996).


           The particular       instruments       used are lagged          changes      in the commitment              and release


rates of state       prison systems         per reported       crime in the state.         Commitments            include       both


new prison terms          resulting      from criminal       convictions      and commitments               resulting    from


probation     and parole violations.14            These      variables     capture     both incapacitation           effects        and


deterrence        via the certainty        and severity      of punishment          in the state.        A high commitment


rate implies       a high likelihood       of detection      and conviction.           A low release         rate translates         into


a longer mean         punishment         per conviction.


           These     prison population         flows    include convictions           for crimes     other than the index


crimes     considered       in this paper,      notably     drug offenses.           In 1993,     22 percent       of state


prisoners     were    held on drug-related             charges    only, up from 6.4         percent       in 1979.       The state


prison data also does not include                 either federal        prisoners    or those      held in local jails.        Though


imperfect,     the instruments           are still highly correlated         with     crime rates.        The instruments            are


unlikely     to be strongly       correlated     with changes           in city populations,        however,       except


through      their impact       on crime rates.         This is particularly         likely to be true since the


instruments        are defined      at the state       level rather than the city level,             The average            city in our


sample      represents      only seven percent            of the population         and only eleven          percent     of the


crime for the state           in which     it is located .15




     14 When        entered     separately,      new commitments             and parole         and probation-related
commitments          had similar coefficients            in the first-stage         regression     and the 2SLS         results
were     not substantially        affected.

     15 State       prisons    generally      are not located       in big cities which          could potentially          induce        a
negative      correlation      between      city populations         and commitment             rates:   when     many       city
residents      are being sent to prison,           the removal          of those     offenders     will reduce       city
populations.         Our reduced         form estimates,         however,     find that commitment              rates and city

                                                                   13
           One potential          problem     with    the instruments           selected     is the fact that they         are


denominated         by crime rates (albeit             state    crime rates)      while     they are also instrumenting                  for


crime rates.       In the absence           of measurement            error, the presence          of crimes     in the


denominator        of the instrument           does not result in any contamination                     of the instrument              if the


functional      form     is correctly     specified.       With     measurement            error in reported     crime     rates,


however,       ratio bias arises.         There      are two      important       points to note on this topic.             First, the


instruments       are constructed           using state-level         rather     than city-level       data and individual             cities


generally      represent     a small fraction          of state     crime.       Nonetheless,        we attempt       to lessen this


source      of bias by using only lagged               values      of the instruments.           Second,     ratio bias will


exaggerate       the negative        relationship        between       commitments           and the crime rate in the first-


stage regression          while    the effect        of releases     will be systematically            understated.


Empirically,      however,        we find that commitments                   and releases      carry coefficients         of similar


magnitude.


           Columns       1-3 of Table        3 present         the first-stage     estimates      using the same sets of


covariates      used in the previous            section.        In all cases,    the instruments         enter with       the


expected       sign: a higher rate of prison commitments                         reduces     crime     whereas    more releases


are accompanied            by crime increases.             As reported         in the bottom       panel of the table,           the


prison variables         are jointly    significant      at the .01       level for all of the crime regressions.

Releases      and commitments               have similar effects.            A one-percentage           point increase          in the


prison commitment            or release       rate per crime shifts city crime by roughly                    six percent          over a


two-year       period.     The demographic             and economic          variables      included    in the regressions             are


generally      not strong     predictors       of crime rates having              controlled    for the other factors.




populations       are positively        correlated,      implying      that this source         of bias cannot        explain      our
results.

                                                                     14
           If prison commitments              and releases     are valid instruments           for crime rates and there                  is


a negative     causal      link between        crime and city populations,            a reduced         form regression        of


city population        on the instrumental         variables     should yield coefficients              that    are opposite        in


sign to those        obtained     in the first-stage      regressions.         Columns       4 to 6 of Table        3 present


such estimates.           As predicted,        each of the instruments            enters    with the opposite          sign


observed      in the first three columns.            The prison variables           are jointly    significant       at the .05


level.    As in the first stage,          the magnitude        of the coefficients          on commitments           and releases


are comparable.


           Table     4 presents     the two-stage        least squares         estimates     treating     city crime       rates as


endogenous         and instrumenting           with the once- and twice-lagged                 changes         in commitments


and releases.        The coefficients         on city crime that we obtain            are slightly       more negative         in


each case than the corresponding                  OLS coefficient        in Table     2.     Although      the standard        errors


rise substantially,        the estimates        are statistically     different     from zero at the .05            level.    Each


additional    city crime        results   in roughly     a 1.3 to 2.0 person          reduction     in population,


compared       to estimates        of approximately          1.1 from OLS.         The larger 2SLS             estimates     suggest


that     any bias in the OLS estimates             resulting    from omitted         variables     or compositional


changes      in city populations          is overwhelmed        by the natural        tendency      for large cities to have


higher crime rates.          Our results       cast some doubt          on the arguments          of Wilson        (1 987)    which


suggest      that declining       city populations       “cause”      crime rather than vice-versa.                 A one-


standard      deviation     increase      in city crime rates translates            into a decline        in city population             of


between       one and two         percent.l    G The other covariates,            which      are treated       as exogenous,

to our instruments          potentially       biasing the 2SLS estimates.                 To test this hypothesis,            we

                                                                 15

           P-values     from an N*R2 test of the overidentifying                     restrictions      are reported          in the


bottom      panel of the table.            In all three     cases,   the overidentifying          restrictions      are near the


.05   level of statistical         significance.         One possible      reason for the relatively            poor performance


of the overidentifying            restrictions     is the inclusion        of cities in our sample          that represent            a


non-negligible        fraction     of the state’s        population.       For such cities,        the arguments        made


earlier    for the erogeneity            of the instruments          are less persuasive.          To test this hypothesis,


columns      4 and 5 of Table             4 break the sample           according     to whether       a city has more or less


than four percent         of the state’s         total    population.      The overidentifying           restrictions        pass with


ease in column         4, but are rejected           at the .05 level in column             5.    This lends credence            to the


argument      that the erogeneity              of the instruments          is suspect      for cities that       are large relative


to the state.      Comparing             the coefficients      on city crime in columns             4 and 5, the estimated


impact     of crime is larger in the cities that are a small fraction                         of their state.       This pattern          is


not apparent      in OLS estimates,              where      the city crime coefficients            are actually      slightly


smaller     for cities that       are less than four percent              of the state     population      (-1 .12 vs. -1. 19),


The larger parameter              estimates      in column      4, for which       the erogeneity         of the instruments              is


more likely,     suggest         that,    if anything,    the coefficients         reported      in columns      1-3 are biased


towards      zero because          of the inclusion         of cities of all sizes.

                                                                     16
           Because      the results      up to this point are derived           from aggregate           population     data,     it


has been impossible           to isolate    differential    impacts      among      sub-groups          of the population.             In


this section,       we perform       two types       of analysis      using mobility        information      from the 1980


Census      of Population       and Housing         to investigate      crime-related        migration     patterns     by


income     group and race.           Since we only have a cross-section                   of 81 cities,      we limit our


analysis    to OLS.        The first approach          aggregates      the individual-level        data to the city level


and estimates          regressions      that are similar to the preceding             section,     but for sub-groups            of


the population.          The second       approach      employs       the migration         decisions     of individual


households         as the dependent         variable    (as opposed         to city-level     aggregates).       The


advantages          of the latter    analysis   are that it makes           it possible     to control    for individual


household       characteristics         and that    it eliminates     ratio-bias    concerns.




Analvzina      Census      Data Aaareaated           to the Citv Level


           The data used are from the PUMS                  5 percent        sample    of the     1980     census,     aggregated


to the city-level.        Only half of the observations               in the PUMS         data were       also included        in the


mobility     sample,      leaving    usable data for 2.5 percent              of the U.S.      population.      We are able to


identify    movers      in and out of 90 of the 137 cities analyzed                    in the preceding         section.        In the


remaining      47 cities,     central     cities and surrounding         areas are not separately              identified      in the


PUMS       data.     Of those     90 cities,    9 are missing        data on one or more covariates,                  leaving    81


cities in our sample.


           To construct       the net migration         data,    we compare        the place of residence             of the


household          head in 1975      and 1980.         Households       are divided       into three     migration     categories:


stayers,     comers,      and goers.       Households       that do not move           or change         addresses     but remain


within     city limits are categorized             as stayers.      Those    who arrive in a city or leave the city


                                                                 17
are classified       as comers       or goers respectively.              In some of the analysis,             we further          divide


comers       and goers       according      to whether        their change        of residence         is within    or across


SMSAS.        Households         are also grouped         according       to total       household       income     from all sources


in 1979.       Households         with    income      below    $10,000          in 1979      dollars    (roughly    $20,000        in


1993     dollars)     are classified       as “low”     income.        Households          with   1979     income       between


$10,000       and $30,000           ($20,000-$60,000            in 1993         dollars)    are labeled     “middle”       income.


Households          with   income     above    that level are considered                 “high”   income.        Approximately             30


percent      of the households           fall into the low income             category,       50 percent      are middle        income,


and the remaining            20 percent       are high income.           Because         we only have        1979       income,       we


are unable        to classify    households        according      to their initial 1975           incomes        or to examine


within-household           changes        in income    between         1975      and 1979.17


           For each of the 81 cities for which                  we have data,            the fraction      of stayers,      comers


and goers is computed               by income      group,      using 1975         city population         within    the income


category      as the denominator.             We have an average                of 5,856       household      observations          per


city, with        over 1,000      observations        for the smallest          cities in our sample.            Summary


statistics    on migration        patterns     are presented           in Table     5,     Overall,    net migration       (comers


minus goers as a fraction                of 1975    population)        for the five year period is approximately                        -8


percent.l     E    Net migration         rates were     larger for high income               households       (-1 6,8    percent)       and




     17 Given the possible               endogeneity     of 1979        income,      we have also examined                mobility
classifying        households      by educational        attainment,          obtaining      similar patterns.

     1s This number            is greater    than the observed           3 percent         aggregate      decline    in city
populations         for the cities in our sample            over the period          1975-1980.           Most     of that gap can
be explained         by differences         in birth and death         rates.     Annual      national     birth rates     (per 100
population) were approximately 1.5 in this time period; comparable death rate statistics
were roughly 0.9.  Assuming that the same rates apply to these cities, the differential
between       birth and death         rates accounts          for a three percentage              point gap between            city
population         changes      and net migration.          Overall,     the correlation          between     city population

                                                                   18
actually    positive     for low income          households         (0.5    percent).      Blacks flowed         into cities on net,


while     the non-black         population     declined     by 10 percent.            Roughly      30 percent      of households

residing    in one of these         central     cities in 1975        had left that       city by 1980,      with    low income


households          less likely to leave.        New     arrivals to cities offset          three-quarters        of these     leavers,


with    high income        households         less likely to come to cities.               60 percent     of city out-migrants

left the SMSA;          over 70 percent          of the new arrivals           to central       cities came from      outside       the


SMSA.


           OLS estimates          of the relationship        between         changes       in city net-migration       rates and


changes      in crime     rates are presented            in Table     6.    In addition     to using a cross-section              rather


than a panel of data,             the specifications        shown         in Table   6 differ     from earlier estimates           in


that    five-year     rather    than one-year         changes     in crime rates are used (since only five-year


changes      in place of residence            are available).        A richer set of covariates            is available      in


census      years,     Therefore,         in addition   to all the variables          used in the previous          section,      the


specifications         in Table    6 add the fraction        of city residents            completing     high school,        percent


in owner-occupied              housing,     percent     employed         in the manufacturing          sector,    mean    hourly


manufacturing          wage,      city median      family    income,        percent     of housing      units that    are multi-


family,     mean temperature              in January,     and mean         annual precipitation.         All of these        variables


are available        in the Cit v and Cou ntv Data Books published                        by the U.S.     Census.        The      1970

value of the census             covariates      are used as controls            in Table    6.     Using changes       between


1970       and 1980      or the 1980         levels did not materially           affect     the crime coefficients.


            Column      1 of Table        6 presents     the estimates         for all cities and income           groups


combined.           The coefficient        on city crime,       -1.39,      is consistent        with the estimates       of the




changes       and net-migration            in our sample     is 0.45.

changes,        while    carrying     the same sign as previously,               are imprecisely         estimated.            High


median      family      income      in a city is a statistically        significant     predictor     of city population


growth,      as are high January             temperatures        and low rainfall.        The other covariates                 are not


statistically      significantly      different      from zero.


           Columns        2-4 provide       separate     estimates        of net migration       by income            group.     High


income      households        are most responsive              to city crime rates with          a coefficient          of -2.58.        The


net migration          response      of low income         households       is less than one-fifth          as great.          Middle-


income      households        have an intermediate             response.       When     the three        specifications          in


columns      2-4 are estimated             jointly   we reject the equality           of the crime coefficients                across


high and low income               groups     at the .05 level,       A one standard          deviation       change       in city


crime over the five-year              period    (0.01 65 crimes         per capita)     is associated          with    a 4.3     percent


decline     in high-income          households,       a 2.0     percent    fall in middle-income           households,           and a


0.8    percent     decrease        among     the poor.       Columns       5 and 6 divide the sample              on racial lines,


with     no apparent        difference      across    races.     The last two         columns    compare         families       with     and


without     children.       Families     with     children     are almost      three times      as responsive           to city crime


rates.     While       the suburban      crime coefficients         are imprecisely         estimated,         it appears       that


families    with       children    are also more responsive             to suburban      crime      rates.lg


           Because        the number        of variables      is large relative       to the number        of observations             in


the specifications          in Table     6, we also present          the city crime coefficient             from specifications

test of the sensitivity            of our results      to the inclusion        of control    variables.         The estimates            are

in Table     7 for city crime rates.              The columns         in Table     7 correspond         to the categories            in the


previous      table.     In each case, the first row redisplays                    the coefficient        on city crime           rates


from Table       6, which       is then decomposed                in the subsequent         rows.       The coefficient           on goers


(row      5) minus the coefficient             on comers         (row 2) equals the total           crime-related       impact         on


net-migration          (row   1).     Within     comers        and goers,      we further      decompose         the effect       by


whether      the migration           is within      or across SMSAS.


           Almost       all of the crime-related           impact      on mobility      arises from increased              out-


migration,      as evidenced           by the large magnitudes                 on goers compared          to comers,         One


possible     explanation        for this patterns          is that current        residents     are better       informed        about


recent     changes       in crime than are potential               in-migrants.       Comparing         the bottom         two     rows       of


Table     7, those      leaving      cities due to crime remain                in the SMSA       70 percent       of the time


overall     (less frequently          for the rich, more frequently               for blacks     and families       with    children).


In contrast,      for all out-migrants              (including     those    who move for reasons             other than crime),


40 percent       remain       in the SMSA.

            Focusing      on individual          household       mobility      decisions    rather than city-level           aggregates


has two       advantages.            First, it allows     the inclusion         of household       characteristics         as


covariates.       Second,           it eliminates     concerns       over ratio-bias       since measurement            error in city


population       does not affect           the dependent           variable,     The primary        difficulty    associated           with


performing       a household-level             analysis        are the computational           costs.    For example,           to avoid


                                                                      21
sample       selection         bias when     estimating      the decision        of whether      or not to move           into a


particular      city,    one must include           all households          in the sample      in the estimation,         even


though      only a trivial        fraction    of the total households             actually     move     into the city.


            We use the results             of the preceding         city-level     analysis    to guide our specification


choices      in reducing         the computational           burdens        to a manageable       level.     Table    7


demonstrates            that    almost     all of the crime-related           net migration      from cities is due to


increased       outflows         of residents.      Therefore,       in the following         analysis     we focus       exclusively


on the decision           of current       city residents      about whether             to stay or leave.        Doing so limits


the sample        to residents        of large cities in 1975,              approximately       400,000       observations,         or


roughly      15%        of the 1980        PUMS     mobility     sample.


            The results         of the individual-level        analysis       are presented      in Tables        8a and 8b.        For


simplicity      of interpretation,           we present      estimates        from linear probability         models       where     the


dependent        variable        is equal to one if a household               residing     in one of the large central            cities


in our sample           in 1975     remains      in that city through            1980,     and zero if the household              leaves


the central      city before        1980.      As before,       the five-year        change     in the per capita         reported


crime      rate captures         the effect    of crime.       Probit and Iogit yield similar              marginal     effects     when


evaluated       at the sample            means. zo All specifications             in Tables     8a and 8b include          the full set


of city,     state,     and region controls          that were       used in Tables          6 and 7.      With    the exception           of


the first column,          the regressions          also include       a wide     array of househo/d-/eve/            controls:


income       indicators        (high, middle,     and low),        the age, sex, race, years of education,                   and


marital     status      of the household          head,   and whether            the household        head is a homeowner,                in




    20 We have also experimented                      with     multinominal Iogit models           that allow for differential
effects     for those          households     moving      within     and across SMSAS.             These      results     suggest        that
crime      has a larger effect           on those    moving        within    the SMSA         as would     be expected.

                                                                     22
the armed        forces     in 1975,      or attends       college     in 1975.       We account         for correlation         in the


error term       for households         in a given city so as not to understate                    the standard          errors.


Failing to account           for within-city       correlations        leads to standard          error estimates         that     are


roughly        twenty     times   too small on the crime coefficients.                     Because       all of the variation            in


the crime variable           is at the city level, there             is actually     very little information           gain in moving


from city-level          aggregates       to individual-level         estimation,       as reflected       in the fact that the


standard        errors in Tables       7 and 8 are not very different.                   For comparison         purposes,          we


report     the corresponding           coefficient        from the city-level         regressions        in the bottom       panel of


Table     8.


           Column         1 of Table    8a includes         only aggregate          controls     for the full sample         of


households.             Each additional      reported      crime is associated           with     1.61     residents     leaving     the


city.     In contrast       to Table    6, there      is some evidence             that suburban         crime rates matter             here.


This difference           is consistent     with     suburban        crime rates having two              offsetting     effects      on


city population.           The first effect        is to increase       city population          by reducing     the outflow             of


city residents          to the suburbs.        The second         effect    is to discourage         those     outside     the SMSA


from moving             into the SMSA,       depressing        city population.          The net migration             regressions            in


Table     6 capture        both of these       effects,     whereas        Table     8, which     looks only at the decision


on city residents           to stay or go, reflects          only the former.

           The household-level             estimate       of the impact       of city crime in column             1 of Table         8 is


indistinguishable           from the comparable             value from the aggregated                regression        in the bottom


panel of the table.            Since the aggregated             regression         potentially    suffer    from ratio-bias,            but


the individual-level          regressions       do not, the similarity             of the two      sets of estimates          suggests


that     ratio-bias      cannot   account      for the observed            negative      relationship       between      crime      rate


changes         and population         changes.


                                                                      23
            Column      2 of Table        8a is identical      to column       1 except      that a full complement              of

household-level          controls     are added to the specification.                  It is interesting     to note that            while


these      variables    significantly          improve     the R2 of the regression,          the estimated           impact     of crime

is little changed.         This increases           our level of confidence            in the earlier estimates          using city-


Ievel aggregates,          where     there       was concern        that the set of controls            was incomplete,


Having      controlled     for city-level         characteristics       household       heads who are young,                 male,


black,     have children,         are single,      or have lower         educational      attainment       are more likely to


stay in central        cities,     Members         of the military       and those      attending       college    are far more


likely to leave the city.            The only surprise           among       the coefficients,       is that having          controlled


for these      other factors,        the rich are somewhat               more likely to remain           in cities.


            The last three        columns        of Table     8a divide the sample           according      to household


income.       High income          households         are more sensitive         to crime,      but the differences            are


muted      compared       to Table        6.    The other covariates          tend to carry similar coefficients                 across


income       groups.     The first two           columns      of Table    8b divide the sample            between       blacks        and


non-blacks.          As before,      little differential       effect    of crime is observed           across     races.      The most


interesting      difference       between         blacks    and non-blacks        is the effect      of income.         Among          non-


blacks,     high income          is associated       with    remaining       in central    cities,   controlling      for other


factors,      With     blacks,    there        is no such effect.        The final two columns            of Table      8b split the


sample      into households          with       and without      children.      Households       with    children      are


substantially        more likely to leave central              cities in response         to rising crime.         High income


families     with    children     are somewhat             more likely to leave cities than low income                      families


with     children,     whereas      the opposite           is true of households          without    children.




Sect ion IV: co nclusions


                                                                    24
           This paper examines          the connection           between         crime,     urban flight,       and central        city


decline.     Rising city crime rates appear               to play a causal           role in city depopulation.              Each


reported     city crime     is associated         with   approximately           a one person         decline     in city residents.


There      is some evidence         that rising crime rates in the suburbs                    tend to keep people            in cities.


Instrumenting       using measures             of criminal     justice    system      severity      yields slightly       larger


estimates      than OLS.       Almost     all of the impact             of crime on falling city population                is due to


increased      out-migration        rather than a decrease               in new arrivals.          Migration     decisions      of high-


income      households      are much more responsive                    to changes        in crime rates than those             of the


poor.      Households      with     children     are also more responsive                 to crime.     Crime-related        out-


migrants      are much      more likely to stay within             the SMSA           than those       leaving     the city for


other reasons.


           Increases      in crime rates and the subsequent                    exodus      from the city impose            a number


of costs on those         city residents         who remain        behind.       The most obvious              cost to city


residents     is the direct       costs of increased          crime victimization.            Over the last twenty              years,


the quartile     of cities with the greatest             increase        in crime saw per capita               crime roughly


double      from 0.065      reported     crimes      per capita         to O. 127;    crime       rates were      essentially


unchanged       for cities in the bottom            quartile     (0.069        in 1973     to 0.074      in 1993).        Cohen


(1 988)     and Miller,    Cohen,      and Rossman           (1 993)      estimate       victim    costs per crime,

incorporating      out-of-pocket         costs,     physical     and psychological            damages,          lost productivity,


and lost life,     Valuing        a lost life at $2.7        million,    the typical       crime reported         in large cities         in


1993       has victim     costs of $10,200           associated         with    it,21 The difference           in crime    increases




     21 The total       estimated      costs of crime are sensitive                  to the value      assigned      to a human
life. If the value        of a human      life is assumed          to be $1,0         million dollars,      the cost per crime
falls to $6,100,

                                                                   25
between        top and bottom           quartile        cities translate        into almost        $600    per person     per year.


Since the estimated             crime gap between                the two        sets of cities includes         only those          crimes


reported      to the police,       the true difference                in costs may be even greater.


           In addition        to the direct       costs of crime,             crime-related        migration    imposes       further


costs on cities.          Decreased         city population            decreases        the demand         for housing,    causing


declines      in property       values.      Blanchard          and Katz (1 992)           find the short-run         (1 -5 year)


elasticity     of housing       value      with     respect      to employment            levels of approximately             two      and a


long run (1 O year)           elasticity     close to zero.            Assuming         declines     in population      and


employment            have similar effects           and taking          an elasticity      intermediate       between        those     two


estimates,       the crime-related           migration         differential      between       top and bottom          quartile      cities    (7


percent      of the city population)              translates          into a $5,500       decline     in median      housing        values     in


high versus         low quartile       cities.      Property      values       will also decrease          if the disamenity           of crime


is capitalized        into housing         values       (Smith        1978,    Thaler    1978,      and Hellman        and Naroff


1979)      -- an additional        $16,000          if the direct       costs of crime computed                above    are fully


capitalized     .22


           Because       crime-related           mobility     is concentrated           among       the rich, crime will increase


concentrations           of poverty        in central       cities,    although     the effects        do not appear      to be


particularly     large,       In 1975,      roughly        30 percent         of central      city residents     fell into our low


income       category,        50 percent         were    classified       as middle      income       and the remaining           20


percent      were     high income.           Using our estimates                of net-migration          by income     group in Table


6, the increases          in crime in the top quartile                  cities by 1993         would      have caused      the fraction




    22 Declining          housing      values       due to capitalization            of the disamenity          do not entail          an
additional      cost to city residents,              but rather         are a reflection       of the direct     costs of
victimization         cited   above.

                                                                         26
of high income         residents       to fall to 18,2      percent       and the fraction         of low income           residents        to


rise to 31.6       percent,        While   it is unlikely       that the real economic            effects      of a change         of this


magnitude         could be substantively              large, it is possible        that the decline         in the number          of rich


households         imposes      negative      externalities       on those       who remain        in the central        city.     To the


extent     that    peer effects       are important        to human          capital    development         (Case and Katz          1991,


Benabou       1993,      Cutler     and Glaeser        1995),     the exodus           of skilled residents      hurts those         who


stay.


           Fiscal stress       on city government               is likely to be linked to rising crime               and differential


mobility     patterns.        Low-income        residents        will have greater          need for locally-provided              public


services     such as police protection,                public education,          public transportation,           and city


hospitals,        In particular,      high and rising crime rates are associated                       with    increases     in future


spending      on police,        Using panel-data          from the 59 largest              U.S. cities,       we estimate        that the


crime difference           between      top and bottom            quartile     cities translates       into an additional           $30


per capita        annually    in police expenditure.23               The poor are also less likely to be covered                         by


private    health     insurance.        Public education           costs are greater          for low-income         children,      who


are disproportionately              represented        in special    educational          programs.24         Combining      the




    23 These         estimates        are obtained       from city finance             data for the years        1976,     1981,
1986,      and 1991.         We regress        the five-year        lead change          in police expenditure           per capita       on
either the current crime rate, the five-year lagged change in crime, or both. We include                                                  the
same covariates   as in Section II of the paper. When entered separately,  the coefficient                                                on
crimes     per capita        is 648    (SE= 225)        and the coefficient             on five-year    lagged     changes         in crime
per capita        is 696     (SE= 262).       When       both the level and changes                in crime are included             in the
same regression,             both enter positively.             The two       coefficients     are jointly,      but not
individually,       statistically      significant,      Full regression         results     are available      from the authors
on request.

        24 Crime     also carries      with    it large costs for courts,              jails, and, prisons,       but these        are
generally not borne by cities.
         If there are increasing              returns     to scale in goods and services                  provided       by city
governments,          declining       populations       lead to inefficiencies            in producing        such goods.

                                                                     27
estimated      declines     in housing     value due to crime with the increased                   levels of police


expenditure,         for a fixed   effective         property   tax rate, the impact       of differential       crime    rates


between      top and bottom          quartile        cities translates     into roughly    40%     of the mean       city’s


property     tax revenue.25        In comparison,           municipalities        in Massachusetts       anticipated      losing


about    14 percent       of total tax revenue            after the passage         of Proposition      2 X (Ladd and


Wilson     1983),      and property      tax revenues           fell by 50 percent      in California    after


implementation          of Proposition         13.




Empirical     evidence,      however,      suggests         that the production        of these    goods is characterized
by roughly      constant      returns    to scale (Bergstrom             and Goodman       1973,     Gonzalez      and Mehay
1987),

    25 Crime         is also likely to reduce           other sources      of city revenues,       such as sales taxes            and
income      taxes,     on a per capita     basis,        The fact that most of the crime-related                 movers       remain
within     the SMSA       suggests      that    many      will continue      to work    in the central     city.
Consequently,          the tax losses through these other channels is likely to be smaller
proportionately         than via property taxes.  Also, to the extent that state governments
increase     aid to cities experiencing               fiscal stress     (Yinger   and Ladd 1989),        this figure     may
overstate      the true costs borne by city residents.

Notes: Dependent variable is Aln(city population), Sample is comprised of annual observations from
1976-1993   for 137 U.S. central cities with population greater than 100,000 in population in 1973.
Year and region dummies are included in all specifications except those where region-year
interactions    are present,      Once-        and twice-lagged   state     prison commitment         and release     rates per
crime are used as instruments   in all columns.  The P-value of an NR2 test of overidentifying
restrictions on instruments is reported in table. All variables are available annually, except                              for   YO

black, which is linearly interpolated   between decennial census years.                        Estimation    allows       for
heteroskedasticity  by city population.    Standard errors in parentheses.

Notes to Table        8a: The sample        includes   only households    residing   in one of the 81 central           cities   included   in
the sample      in 1975.       The dependent    variable is an indicator equal to one if the household remains in the
central    city in 1980,      and zero otherwise.    The complete set of state and city-level regressors are included
in these    specifications:       state   real per capita   income   and age distribution      variables     in 1975,      state

in the error   term     across    households     in a given city so as not to understate            the standard     errors.
