Measuring Productivity: Lessons from Tailored Surveys and Productivity Benchmarking

                                          ABSTRACT

We use tailored surveys and benchmarking in the flat-weave rug industry to better understand the
shortcomings of standard productivity measures. TFPQ performs poorly because of variation in
product specifications across firms. Controlling for specifications aligns TFPQ with lab
benchmarks. We also collect quality metrics to construct quality productivity (the ability to
produce quality given inputs) and find substantial dispersion across firms. This motivates interest
in multi-dimensional productivity, or capability. As quality productivity is negatively correlated
with TFPQ, TFPR may perform better at capturing capabilities in settings where better firms
make products with more demanding specifications that have greater input requirements.

  1    Introduction
    Economists have long recognized that the reason some countries are richer than others is
not primarily due to differences in their endowments or resources, but because of how effec-
tively their firms deploy those resources to generate economic activity. This prompts a set of
obvious questions. How large are productivity differences across firms? What drives this disper-
sion? What policies are most effective at raising productivity? Answering these questions is an
active area of research (see the review by Syverson, 2011) and central to this goal is the ability to
accurately measure the productivity of firms.
    What the researcher typically wants is a measure of physical output conditional on physi-
cal inputs, termed quantity-based productivity (TFPQ). This requires data on input and output
quantities that are not typically available. In cases where these data are available, quantities
are likely measured with substantial error since they cannot be easily read off accounting state-
ments. Even if well measured, product specifications and quality levels can vary dramatically
across firms and within firms across product lines—variation that is not well captured by dis-
aggregated product categories in typical administrative datasets. This makes it difficult to both
measure productivity for firms that produce many varieties or to compare productivity across
firms making different varieties. Multi-product firms pose further challenges since output and
input mixes vary even more widely across products than within.
    As most firm-level datasets only provide expenditure and revenue data, much of the liter-
ature relies on revenue-based productivity (TFPR) measures that also capture differences in
markups and quality across firms. However, if a firm’s capabilities come from its ability to pro-
duce both quality and quantity, TFPR may be closer to the object of interest even though it con-
founds forces unrelated to productivity.
    The existing literature has pursued various approaches to understand and to mitigate these
measurement issues by drawing upon additional data (e.g., prices) alongside (often strong) iden-
tifying assumptions.1
    We take a different approach. We develop tailored surveys focusing on a specific industry—
flat-weave rugs—that directly address many of these measurement issues through the combi-
nation of detailed product specifications and external assessments of quality. The surveys allow
us to calculate not only quantity productivity (the ability to produce quantity with a given set of
inputs), but also quality productivity (the ability to produce quality with a given set of inputs)
and capabilities (the combination of the two, essentially a TFPQ measure using quality-adjusted

duction function estimation.

quantities).2
    To better understand the shortcomings of standard productivity measures and potential reme-
dies, we compare survey-based productivity measures to productivity benchmarking exercises
which we argue are closest to true productivity. We find that standard TFPQ performs poorly
at measuring quantity productivity, shows excessive dispersion across firms, and is inversely
correlated with quality productivity. Controlling for product specifications—effectively mak-
ing apples-to-apples comparisons—goes a long way towards remedying those deficiencies. Al-
though TFPR does better than TFPQ at capturing broad capabilities, it performs worse than
methods that combine survey information with explicit quality measures.


  2    Survey Design and Data
    Our data come from surveys we designed and administered on 219 rug-making firms in
Fowa, Egypt. These firms produce a type of kilim rug called “duble” using double-treddle foot
powered looms. As part of a randomized experiment exploring the impact of exporting we re-
cruited all firms with 1-5 workers making this type of rug.
    Rug producers receive orders with a particular set of specifications that include the design,
thread types, and thread count. Producers prepare the appropriate inputs, install the threads on
the loom and weave the rug. Although duble rugs are already a subset of a 10-digit HS-product
code, there are many varieties (we observe 435 unique combinations of specifications).
    In addition to rugs having different specifications, rugs also differ in quality. Unlike specifications—
codifiable attributes of the rug that are typically chosen by the buyer—quality depends on weav-
ing technique and is difficult to codify or contract on. For example, how flat the rug lies is de-
termined by how skillfully the firm installs the thread on the loom, and whether the threads are
held correctly while weaving.
    We created a survey instrument to address the measurement issues noted above in contexts
where output varies in quality and firms produce many varieties. We administered 6 rounds of
surveys at the product-line level capturing the rug produced in the prior month. (As produc-
tion runs last longer than a month in this industry, this was almost always a single variety of
rug.) These surveys recorded detailed rug specifications; prices and quantities of all inputs and
outputs; and labor hours spent on production and preparation activities. We also hired an in-
dependent quality assessor who graded each rug that the firm was working on at the time of the
survey across 11 different dimensions (grading on a 1 to 5 scale).3
   2
    Hallak and Sivadasan (2013) also explore multidimensional firm productivity.
   3
    The dimensions are: corners, waviness, packedness, weight, touch, warp thread tightness, firmness, design ac-
curacy, warp thread packedness, inputs, and loom.


                                                       3
    Additionally, we set up a controlled laboratory in a rented space where all firms were paid a
flat fee for their head weaver to produce a 0.98m2 rug with identical specifications using identical
material inputs and capital equipment we provided. We recorded dimensions, weight and time
taken to weave the resulting rug, and sent the rugs to be scored anonymously by both our qual-
ity assessor and a local professor of handicraft science. Atkin, Khandelwal and Osman (2017)
provide further details on the sample, rug production, and the laboratory.
    Online Appendix Table 1 provides summary statistics of the survey and lab, and Online Ap-
pendix Table 2 shows that our six product specifications (thread type, thread count, design dif-
ficulty, number of colors, market segment, duble subcategory) capture rug varieties relatively
well—specifications explain about half the variation in prices, output and revenue, and dimen-
sions such as thread count and type have the expected signs.


  3     Measuring Productivity
    We calculate several productivity measures from the survey data. The first measure we call
“unadjusted” productivity because, as in the existing literature, it does not adjust for the fact that
different firms produce rugs with different specifications (i.e., different varieties). We estimate
unadjusted TFPQ (φu ) from a Cobb-Douglas production function:


                                                  x = φu lαl k αk e                                                (1)


where x is output in square meters, l is labor hours, k is capital (number of looms), and  is mea-
surement error.4 For transparency, we estimate (1) in logs over every firm-round observation
using OLS and recover φu by exponentiating the residual. The Online Appendix replicates the
analysis estimating (1) using a control function.
    Although this formulation is standard, a number of features reduce measurement concerns
compared to other settings. First, we observe quantities of x, l and k rather than revenues and
expenditures. Second, given the simple technology there are essentially no other inputs used
in production (e.g., no accounting, logistics, human resources). Third, we recorded the inputs
used for each specific rug produced so there is no error in allocating inputs to outputs.
    Our second measure, “specification-adjusted” productivity, is more novel because it controls
for differences in the variety mix across firms that may make standard TFPQ measures mislead-
ing. To guide our specification adjustment, we place more structure on equation (1) by assuming
φu = φa eλγ , where λ denotes the vector of specifications which affect how quickly a rug can be
    4
    At this level of disaggregation, the production function is best characterized as Leontief in materials. The unit of
analysis is the firm-round level.


                                                           4
produced (e.g., a high thread count rug requires more labor and capital inputs) and γ are pa-
rameters to estimate. φa is specification-adjusted TFPQ that is recovered from estimating the
production function conditioning on the six specification controls.
    These two measures essentially capture how many labor hours firms require to produce rug
quantity, potentially controlling for the specifications of the rug; we call these quantity produc-
tivity. While the literature typically explores a single dimension of productivity, as discussed
above, similar specification rugs also vary substantially in quality. Thus, there is a second di-
mension of productivity that also raises revenues:5 the skill of a firm at producing quality from
a given set of inputs. We term this quality productivity, or TFPZ.
    It is necessary to construct a quality index in such a way that quality and quantity productiv-
ity estimates can be compared and aggregated. To do so, we let the consumers’ relative valuation
of quantity and quality guide us. For simplicity, we make the assumption that consumers have
CES demands between rugs and another good y, where consumers trade off the quality and
                                           θ      σ−1           σ−1     σ
quantity of rugs as follows: U = ((Πj qj j x)      σ    + (y)    σ    ) σ−1 . The vector θ determines the trade off
between quantity and the eleven dimensions of quality q indexed by j. This implies demands:

                                                       X
                                   ln x = (σ − 1)           θj ln qj − σ ln p + c                               (2)
                                                        j


where p is the price of the variety and c is a function of total expenditure and the rug price index
that is common across varieties. We recover the θj s by regressing (ln x + σ ln p)/(σ − 1) on our
eleven quality metrics and setting σ = 2.74 based on Broda and Weinstein (2006).6
                                                                                                                θ
    We next conjecture a production function for producing consumers’ valued quality, Πj qj j ,
with the same functional form as the quantity production function:

                                                   θ
                                               Πj qj j = ζu lβl k βk eε                                         (3)


where ζu is the residual after conditioning on labor and capital inputs.7 We assume ζu = ζa eλδ ,
with the residual increasing in the firm’s quality productivity, ζa , and allowing the residual to also
depend on specifications (for example, ensuring high quality for a high thread count rug may
require more inputs than for a low thread count rug).8 Thus, as with quantity productivity, we
estimate two variants of quality productivity: unadjusted TFPZ (ζu ) and specification-adjusted

   5
      Atkin, Khandelwal and Osman (2017) shows that prices conditional on specifications increase in quality.
   6
      This is their average elasticity estimate within the six-digit HS category for these rugs (HS 570231).
    7
      In principle we could also adjust inputs with measures of input quality, particularly worker skill.
    8
      Atkin, Khandelwal and Osman (2017) implicitly assume βl = βk = 0 as skill (rather than l and k) primarily
determines quality in this industry. Here, we posit similar production functions for quality and quantity.


                                                            5
TFPZ (ζa ).
    Given our assumptions on supply and demand, it is straightforward to aggregate quantity
                                                                                         θ
and quality productivity by forming a production function for the Πj qj j x aggregator valued by
                    θ
consumers (Πj qj j x = ζa φa eλ(γ+δ) lαl +βl k αk +βk e+ε ). The implied productivity aggregator, which
we term specification-adjusted TFPC or firm capability, is the product of specification-adjusted
TFPZ and TFPQ (ζa φa ).9 Similarly, unadjusted TFPC is ζu φu .
    Finally, we also estimate standard TFPR from equation (1) but replacing x, l and k with rug
revenues, labor expenditures and the value of the capital stock, respectively.10
    We compare the survey-based measures with productivity benchmarks from the controlled
lab. The lab provides direct measures of quantity productivity in meters squared per unit input:
                    α̂l α̂k
Lab TFPQ = .98m2 /(llab klab ), where llab is the hours taken to produce the rug in the lab, and klab =
                                                                                j       β̂l β̂k     θ̂
1 is the number of looms. We calculate lab quality productivity, Lab TFPZ= Πj qlab,j /(llab klab ), by
combining the anonymized quality assessments for the lab rugs (averaging over the two experts’
grades) with the θ̂j s from regression (2). The α̂s and β̂s come from the specification-adjusted
production function estimates above. Lab capabilities, Lab TFPC, is simply the product of Lab
TFPQ and Lab TFPZ.
    As we are able to ensure that inputs and product specifications are identical across firms, we
believe that the lab measures contain the least measurement error and come closest to reflecting
firms’ true productivity.11 Thus, we treat them as benchmarks with which to assess our survey
measures.
    To summarize, the surveys provide two measures of quantity productivity (φu ,φa ), two of
quality productivity (ζu ,ζa ), two of capability (ζu φu ,ζa φa ), and TFPR. The controlled lab provides
three benchmarks: lab quantity productivity (Lab TFPQ), lab quality productivity (Lab TFPZ),
and lab capabilities (Lab TFPC).
    For each firm, we have one survey-based measure for each survey round. To reduce noise, we
take firm-level averages over all post-baseline rounds and present all the productivity measures
relative to the mean.12 The Online Appendix provides further details on implementation and the
production function estimates.


    9
       This approach mirrors the price index literature with equation (2) acting as a hedonic regression that quality
adjusts quantities before estimating the production function.
    10
       Rug revenues and the value of k come from direct survey questions. Labor expenditures equal wages paid to
employees and the take home pay of weaver-owners. Values are adjusted using the monthly CPI.
    11
       Since the loom, specifications, and inputs are identical for all firms in the lab, we do not need to specification
adjust to compare across firms.
    12
       The experiment in Atkin, Khandelwal and Osman (2017) showed that inducing firms to export raised productiv-
ity. To ensure that we are not combining estimates for the same firm pre and post treatment, we only include the post
treatment rounds.


                                                           6
  4     Comparing Productivity Measures
    We now explore the relationship between the various productivity measures and draw con-
clusions for practitioners working with less-rich datasets. We also discuss the dispersion in pro-
ductivity across firms implied by each measure, a key moment of interest in the productivity
literature.
    Result 1: Importance of Adjusting for Product Specifications. Comparing unadjusted TFPQ
across firms is challenging when specifications vary substantially.
    Figure 1 plots both unadjusted and specification-adjusted TFPQ against Lab TFPQ—the mea-
sure we believe is closest to true quantity productivity.13
    Consistent with the claim above, although the slope is positive (β = 0.13), unadjusted TFPQ
only weakly correlates with Lab TFPQ (corr=0.02). Specification-adjusted TFPQ has a steeper
slope and a stronger correlation with Lab TFPQ (β = 0.51,corr=0.14). This shows the value of
finer product-category controls for accurately measuring quantity productivity.
    Result 2: Quantity versus Quality Productivity. In this industry, as in many others, consumers
place substantial value on quality. Our prior is that firms that are able to produce high quality are
highly skilled, and so can also produce products with a given set of specifications more quickly.
If there is a strong positive correlation between the two, then quality-productivity measures may
do a satisfactory job at capturing a firm’s broader capabilities.
    Figure 2 shows two plots. The first reveals a strong negative relationship between unadjusted
TFPQ and unadjusted TFPZ (black). Thus, the in the absence of specification controls, quan-
tity and quality productivity are negatively correlated: firms that make lower quality rugs pro-
duce more quickly. However, and further showing the importance of adjusting for specifications,
this relationship flips when we adjust for specifications (the second plot in gray, specification-
adjusted TFPQ against specification-adjusted TFPZ). Consistent with our prior, quantity and
quality productivity are positively related. More capable firms take longer to manufacture rugs
only because they typically make varieties with more demanding specifications.
    Thus, and as we show more directly below, in the absence of specification controls, TFPQ
may be a misleading measure of broad capabilities given the strong negative correlation be-
tween unadjusted quantity and quality productivity.
    Result 3: TFPR as a Proxy for TFPC. If capabilities are multidimensional, and consumers value
quality, TFPR may be preferable to TFPQ-based measures since higher prices and revenues may

   13
     The figures show both the line of best fit, the slope and significance of this line, the correlation coefficient, as
well as a bin scatter of observations (each dot reflects about 10 firms). The online appendix reports a correlation
matrix for the various measures.


                                                           7
capture the ability to produce high quality. Figure 3 explores this claim by comparing several
of our productivity measures to Lab TFPC, the capability measure that combines quality and
quantity productivity from the lab.
   Consistent with the discussion above, unadjusted TFPQ is a misleading measure of capa-
bility: it is negatively correlated with Lab TFPC (black diamond). However, TFPR (grey circle)
does indeed mitigate this measurement issue since it is positively correlated with Lab TFPC. Al-
though the relationship is weak, this reversal of slope relative to unadjusted TFPQ reveals that
TFPR may be a more suitable proxy for a firm’s capability than TFPQ if product specifications
are unavailable. Specification-adjusted TFPQ (black triangle) is more strongly positively cor-
related with Lab TFPC. As shown in Result 1, it more accurately captures quantity productiv-
ity, and as shown in Result 2, quantity and quality productivity are positively correlated after
specification-adjusting. Reassuringly, specification-adjusted TFPC (grey square), which com-
bines specification-adjusted TFPQ and TFPZ, has the strongest positive relationship with Lab
TFPC.
   Result 4: Unadjusted TFPQ Overstates Dispersion more than Specification-Adjusted TFPQ.
Table 1 provides 90-10 ratios for the various productivity measures (figures 4-7 plot the distri-
butions of TFPQ, TFPZ, TFPC and TFPR respectively). Dispersion in Lab TFPQ is over three
times smaller than unadjusted TFPQ. Adjusting for specifications closes about half this gap. This
suggests that dispersion in standard datasets may partially reflect product differentiation rather
than differences in underlying productivity.
   Result 5: TFPZ Dispersion is Large. Table 1 reveals large dispersion in quality productivity.
The 90-10 ratio in Lab TFPZ is 2.2. From the surveys, the unadjusted and adjusted TFPZ ratios
are 2.5 and 1.5, respectively. This suggests that even within a very narrowly defined product
category, there is large quality variation across firms.
   Result 6: TFPC is More Dispersed than TFPQ and TFPZ. Capabilities are even more dispersed
than either quantity or quality productivity. The 90-10 ratio for Lab TFPC is larger than that
for Lab TFPQ and Lab TFPZ (similarly for specification-adjusted TFPC). An implication of the
fact that quantity and quality productivity are positively correlated, this result suggests that the
broad capabilities of firms may be more dispersed than a single dimension of productivity. To
our knowledge, this is the first attempt to document dispersion in capabilities through direct
measurement.




                                                  8
  5      Concluding Remarks
   We close with a summary of this measurement exercise. First, standard TFPQ performs
poorly at measuring quantity productivity. Using product specifications to make apples-to-
apples comparisons substantially raises the correlation with the lab benchmarks and halves the
gap in measured productivity dispersion between survey and lab measures. Second, firms differ
substantially along a second dimension of productivity—their ability to produce high-quality
products. Finally, if researchers are interested in broader capabilities of firms, TFPR—for all its
imperfections—may be a better proxy than (unadjusted) TFPQ. TFPQ is likely to perform partic-
ularly poorly in settings like ours where more capable firms make products with more demand-
ing specifications that take longer to manufacture. But, tailored surveys that collect product
specifications and direct measures of quality may be the best path to understand productivity
dispersion across firms.

Appendix
  A.1        Summary Statistics
   We collected data for 219 rug producing firms in Fowa, Egypt between July 2011 and June
2014. We administered six rounds of surveys that captured information on rugs produced in the
prior month including the rug specifications, prices and quantities of all inputs and outputs, la-
bor hours spent on production and preparation activities. We also hired an independent quality
assessor (a highly-skilled rug producer) who graded the rugs being produced at the time of the
survey along eleven quality metrics (grading on a 1 to 5 scale, with 5 being the highest quality).
Table A.1 provides the means and standard deviations of key variables used in our estimations.
   After the last survey round, we set up a controlled lab in a rented space where all firms were
asked to send their main rug producer to produce a rug with identical specifications using the
same material inputs and capital equipment that we provided. The rug producer was paid a flat
fee for his time. We recorded the rug’s final dimensions and the time taken to weave it. We also
sent the rugs to be scored anonymously by both our quality assessor and a local professor of
handicraft science. We use the average score for each quality metric in this paper. Table A.1 also
reports the mean and standard deviations of the quality lab measures. Atkin, Khandelwal and
Osman (2017) provides further details on the surveys and the sample.
   Table A.2 reports the association between the rug specifications and the price of the rugs,
overall output and total revenue of the firm during the month prior to the survey. The coeffi-
cients have signs consistent with our priors and the high R-squared suggests that specifications
can explain much of the variation in these variables.


  A.2        Survey-Based Productivity Measures

A.2.1       Quantity Production Functions
   Our production function estimation follows Atkin, Khandelwal and Osman (2017). The first
set of production function estimates do not control for rug specifications and hence provide our
unadjusted TFPQ estimates. We estimate the following Cobb-Douglas production function:14

                                                              αl αk it
                                                 xit = φu,it lit kit e                                            (4)




  14
       We assume that output is Leontief in materials and therefore materials do not enter into the estimation.


                                                          15
where xit is the output (in m2 ) of firm i in period t, lit is total labor hours, kit is the number
of active looms, and φu,it is the firm’s unadjusted TFPQ. The error term captures unanticipated
shocks as well as omitted variables (the specifications of the rugs produced). To estimate the
parameters of the production function, we take logs to obtain


                                  ln xit = ln φu,it + αlu ln lit + αku ln kit + it                             (5)


    The second set of production function estimates controls for rug specifications and provide
our specification-adjusted TFPQ estimate. We estimate

                                                                               0
                            ln xit = ln φa,it + αla ln lit + αka ln kit + ln λit γ + it                        (6)


where φa,it is the firm’s specification-adjusted TFPQ and the vectorλit includes six rug specifica-
tions: rug difficulty, thread count, thread type, number of colors, market segment, and narrow
product type (where we include dummies for each value of the latter two categorical variables).15
The error term now only captures unanticipated shocks and measurement error.
    We estimate TFPQ via OLS and a control function. For the OLS regressions, we estimate (5)
by regressing log of output on labor and capital. For (6), we add the six specifications to the
regression. We estimate the production functions using the full set of duble firms in our sample
of post-treatment rounds.16 Standard errors are clustered by firm. We report the estimates in
columns 1 and 2 of Table A.3 below.
    In the control function approach (Olley and Pakes (1996)) we assume capital is subject to
adjustment costs, labor is a flexible input, and we use warp thread quantity as the proxy. We
estimate the production functions using the one-step approach proposed by Wooldridge (2009),
with lit−1 as the instrument for lit , and cluster standard errors by firm. We report these estimates
in columns 3 and 4 in Table A.3 below.
    Unadjusted and specification-adjusted TFPQ are constructed from exponentiating the resid-
uals of these production functions and then averaging across rounds for each firm.




   15
       As discussed in Atkin, Khandelwal and Osman (2017), we have two samples of firms that we pool over in this
production function estimation. For the firms in the first sample, we did not record the market segment or rug
difficulty. We replace these missing values with the corresponding values from the subsequent survey round.
    16
       This differs from Atkin, Khandelwal and Osman (2017) where we estimate the production function only on the
sample of control firms to avoid having to take a stance on the Markov process governing productivity evolution over
time for the treatment firms. In this paper, since we are simply interested in cross-sectional comparisons, we only
focus on the post-treatment sample where export status is not changing and estimate the production function over
all firms.


                                                         16
A.2.2     Quality Production Functions
    Quality productivity, TFPZ, is estimated as follows. As noted in the text, we begin by obtaining
the consumers’ valuations for quality implied by the following demand curve:

                                                              X
                                     ln xit = (σ − 1)               θj ln qj,it − σ ln pit + cit                  (7)
                                                                j


where qj s are the eleven quality metrics, p is the price that firm i receives for its rug produced at
the time of the survey, and c is a common price index. Using an estimate of σ = 2.74 from Broda
and Weinstein (2006), we can re-write (7) as an estimating equation:

                                                                                  X
                      (ln xit + 2.74 ln pit ) / (2.74 − 1) = κ +                        θj ln qj,it + νit         (8)
                                                                                    j

where κ is a constant and ν is measurement error. The estimates of the θj s are reported in Table
A.4.
    With the estimates of θ in hand, we formulate the production function for producing con-
                                    θ̂
sumers’ valued quality, Πj qj j , with the same functional form as the quantity production function
in (5):

                                                   
                                             θ̂j
                               ln        Πj qj,it       = ln ζu,it + βlu ln lit + βku ln kit + it                (9)

As before, we can estimate (9) via OLS or a control function to obtain unadjusted TFPZ. The
results are reported in Table A.5.
    Analogously to specification-adjusted TFPQ, we can recover specification-adjusted TFPZ by
controlling for specifications in the quantity production production:

                                          
                                   θ̂j                                                         0
                      ln       Πj qj,it        = ln ζa,it + βla ln lit + βka ln kit + ln λit δ + it             (10)

The results of estimating (10) via OLS and a control function are reported in Table A.5.
    Unadjusted and specification-adjusted TFPZ are constructed from exponentiating the resid-
uals of these production functions and then averaging across rounds for each firm.

A.2.3     Capabilities Production Functions
    For unadjusted firm capabilities, which we term unadjusted TFPC, we multiply output by the
                                                                            j                               θ̂
quality aggregator to formulate a combined production function for xit Πj qj,it , the combination




                                                                    17
of quantity and quality that consumers value in their utility function.

                                           
                                     θ̂j
                    ln       xit Πj qj,it       = ln ζu,it + ln φu,it + (αlu + βlu ) ln lit + (αku + βku ) ln kit + it    (11)

As before, we estimate (11) via OLS and a control function, and report the results in Table A.6.
The structure of the production function implies that the coefficients of the capabilities pro-
duction function equal the sum of the coefficients from the quantity and quality production
functions (e.g., the sum of the labor coefficient in column 1 of Table A.3 and the labor coefficient
in column 1 of Table A.5.17 ). Unadjusted TPFC is the product ζu φu .
    Similarly, we can estimate specification-adjusted TFPC from the following production func-
tion:


                                                                                                          0
                     θj
    ln       xit Πj qj,it       = ln ζa,it + ln φa,it + (αla + βla ) ln lit + (αka + βka ) ln kit + ln λit (γ + δ) + it   (12)


with the results reported in A.6. Specification-adjusted TPFC is the product ζa φa .

A.2.4         Revenue Production Functions
    We estimate a revenue production function using the following specification:


                                            ln rit = ln T F P Rit + ηl ln wit + ηk ln rkit + it                           (13)

where rit is the revenue of the firm, wit is the wage bill, and rkit is the value of the capital stock.
We estimate (13) via OLS and a control function and report the results in A.7. (Note that we do
not control for specifications in these regressions). TFPR is constructed from exponentiating the
residual of this production function and then averaging across rounds for each firm.


  A.3           Description of Appendix Figures and Tables
    • Table A.1 provides summary statistics for the variables used to estimate the production
         functions.

    • Table A.2 estimates the relationship between the rug specifications and price, output and
         revenue.

    • Table A.3 reports the coefficients from the quantity production function.

   17
   Due to missing observations, the coefficients do not line up exactly. The paper uses the TFPC estimate that
comes from the product of the individual ζu and φu estimates.


                                                                        18
   • Table A.4 reports the θs coefficients from the demand estimation.

   • Table A.5 reports the coefficients from the quality production function.

   • Table A.6 reports the coefficients from the capabilities production function.

   • Table A.8 is the correlation matrix for the measures used in the paper estimated using OLS.

   • Table A.9 is the correlation matrix for the measures used but estimated using a control
     function approach.

   • Table A.10 shows the correlation matrix including both OLS and control function values.

Notes: Table reports summary statistics of the variables used to estimate the production functions. “Quality”

denotes the 11 quality metrics. “Lab” denotes the quality metrics from the controlled lab, which are averaged

over grades given by the quality assessor and professor of handicraft science. “EGP” denotes Egyptian pounds

(which was around 6.31 pounds to one USD over the sample period). See Atkin et al (2017) for more details

about the sample and variables.
