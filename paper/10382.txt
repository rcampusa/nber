                                       ABSTRACT


I use data from the Current Population Surveys and Employee Benefits Surveys to analyze

employer-sponsored disability insurance coverage. There does not appear to be a systematic trend

from 1980 to 2000 in the fraction of workers with coverage. Disability insurance coverage rates are

lower than health insurance coverage rates; low-skill, low-wage, low-tenure, part-time and small

establishment workers are all less likely to have either of these fringe benefits. Public policy debates

about workers without health insurance fail to consider an important economic risk these workers

face in the event of an illness or injury: the risk of lost wages.

1. Introduction*

        A great deal of public policy attention focuses on workers without health insurance

coverage. Coverage by disability insurance – that is, insurance that replaces workers’ wages in

the event of a disability – receives far less attention, even though lost wages may represent a

larger economic risk than medical bills for many workers. This risk may be especially large for

low-wage, low-skill workers who are eligible for public health insurance but who have fewer

resources to help provide for their other living expenses if they are disabled.

        This paper analyzes trends in rates of coverage by private employer-sponsored disability

coverage and compares the determinants of this coverage at a point in time to the determinants of

employer-sponsored health insurance coverage. I find little evidence that there is a systematic

trend from 1980 to 2000 in the fraction of workers with either short or long-term disability

insurance, although changes in the data collection methods make it difficult to know this with

confidence. I find that in 1993, rates of coverage among workers by short and long-term

disability insurance are lower than the rate of coverage by employer-sponsored health insurance.

I also find that the same worker and job characteristics that predict not having health insurance

predict not having sick leave or long-term disability insurance. Specifically, low-skill, low-

wage, low-tenure and part-time workers are all much less likely to have any of the three types of

fringe benefits, as are workers in small establishments. Public policy debates that focus on

workers without health insurance omit an important economic risk these workers face:

specifically, the risk of lost wages in the event of an illness or injury.

2. What Is Disability Insurance?

        Many public and private insurance programs provide cash benefits to replace wages in

the event that a worker is injured. The federal Disability Insurance (DI) program pays benefits to




                                                                                                1
workers with disabilities that are expected to be long term (lasting at least one year) or to result

in death; there is a five month waiting period before DI payments begin, and an additional two

year waiting period for Medicare eligibility (Ways and Means Committee 2000).                                    State

Workers’ Compensation programs generally provide cash benefits and pay medical expenses for

workers with short or long-term disabilities that result from work-related injuries. In 2000, 87.5

percent of all workers and 93.9 percent of wage and salary workers (i.e. those who were not self-

employed) were eligible for Worker’s Compensation (National Academy of Social Insurance

2002). Thus, public programs replace at least some wages lost due to injuries that are either long-

term or work-related, but provide no insurance against wages lost because of short-term injuries

and illnesses that are not work-related.

           One function of private disability insurance is therefore to replace earnings for workers

with disabilities not covered by public insurance. Another is to provide supplemental income in

case of long-term or work-related disabilities that are covered by public insurance, since

replacement rates for DI and Workers’ Compensation are generally well below 100%. There is a

great deal of variation in the specifics of employer-provided disability insurance, but generally it

falls into the following three categories: 1

       •   Sick leave: Paid time off while recovering from a temporary injury or illness that is not

           work-related.

       •   Short-term disability insurance: Partial salary replacement for a short period, usually 6

           to 12 months.

       •   Long-term disability insurance: Cash benefits for workers with disabilities that are not

           work-related. There is usually a waiting period of 3 to 6 months before benefits begin;



1
    The discussion of types of private disability benefits is condensed from Department of Labor Bulletin 2517, p. 24.


                                                                                                                     2
        benefits may continue until retirement, until a predetermined age, or for a set number of

        months.

        Clearly, the lines between these categories are not sharply drawn. In practice, within a

firm, there may be important institutional differences involved in receiving benefits from one

program or the other. For example, “calling in sick” (an example of the first type of insurance)

typically requires very little paperwork whereas receiving short-term disability insurance benefits

may be much more complicated. There may also be important differences in the assumption of

risk across different plans; as is the case with health insurance, some employers choose to self-

insure while others will contract with an insurance company. An employer might also make

different choices about self-insuring for different types of insurance; for example, self-insuring a

short-term disability insurance plan but purchasing commercial long-term disability insurance.

An employer might also not offer benefits at all; with the exception of New York, New Jersey

and Hawaii, all of which mandate or sponsor temporary (i.e. short-term) disability insurance

plans, these plans are voluntarily provided (or not) by employers.2 Workers may also purchase

individual disability insurance policies directly from insurance companies.

        Private employer-sponsored disability insurance is only one of many mechanisms for

insuring workers against the risk of lost earnings because of disability, and some of the

distinctions between it and other types of insurance contracts may seem arbitrary. Nonetheless,

there are at least two reasons to focus on this segment of the market. First, it is provided as a

distinct and recognizable feature of many employment contracts and is measured by surveys

collecting data on fringe benefits. Second, it is the wage-replacement analogue of private

employer-sponsored health insurance. That is, in a situation where medical bills would be paid


2
 The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 requires establishments with 50 or more workers to provide
unpaid leave for specified purposes including illness or injury. For details, see Ruhm (1997) and Waldfogel (2001).


                                                                                                                  3
by private employer-sponsored health insurance, lost earnings would be replaced by private

employer-sponsored disability insurance. Lost wages may represent a larger economic risk than

high medical bills. More than half of Workers’ Compensation benefits are paid to replace wages

rather than for medical care costs (Williams 2003). Policy concern about “the uninsured”

typically focuses on individuals without health insurance coverage, but might just as well focus

on individuals without disability insurance coverage.



3. Data on private employer-sponsored disability insurance

       The data to be used are microdata from the April 1993 Employee Benefits Supplement to

the CPS, microdata from the basic monthly CPS’s from 1980 - 1999, and published data from the

Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Surveys.



The Employee Benefits Surveys

       The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has conducted the Employee Benefits Surveys

more or less annually since 1980. The first survey in 1980 included 1,509 medium and large

private firms. “Medium and large” was defined as having more than 50, 100 or 250 employees

depending on the industry. With the exception of 1987, similar surveys were conducted annually

through 1989. The definition of “medium and large” was standardized across industries as of the

1988 survey to include establishments with at least 100 workers. Beginning in 1990, the

Employee Benefits Surveys have covered small establishments (less than 100 workers) in even

years and medium and large establishments in odd years. There have also been periodic surveys

of state and local governments.




                                                                                              4
           The EBS asks establishments about benefits provided on a sample of jobs within the

establishment.3 The EBS asks about sick leave (paid time off, for short periods), short-term

disability insurance (called “accident and sickness insurance” prior to the 1995 survey) and long-

term disability insurance, among other benefits. The BLS publishes summary statistics on the

fraction of jobs with different benefits annually; the EBS data in this paper are taken from these

published bulletins.

           There are two changes to the EBS that make it difficult to interpret trends over time in

EBS data on disability insurance. The first is the 1988 change in scope mentioned above (see

Bulletin 2336, p. iii for details). The second is a change in the definitions of “paid sick leave”

and what was called “sickness and accident insurance” prior to 1995 and is called “short-term

disability insurance” beginning in 1995. As shown in Appendix Exhibit 1, the change in

definition means that unfunded per-disability plans were considered “paid sick leave” prior to

1995 and considered “short-term disability insurance” in 1995 and later.

           Also in 1995, the EBS publications no longer provide detailed information on what

fraction of jobs have sick leave only, short-term disability insurance only, either, or both; instead,

the published data say only what fraction of jobs have any sick leave and what fraction have any

short-term disability insurance. It is possible to use the detailed data in the pre-1995 years to

construct what should, in theory, be a comparable fraction of jobs with any sick leave or any

disability insurance by adding detailed categories; but since this construction occurs at the same

time that the definition of the two quantities changed as described above, the data should not be

viewed as providing a consistent trend before and after 1995.

                                                                                                    5
The Basic Monthly Current Population Surveys

       The second component of the analysis relies on data from the basic monthly CPS from

1980 through 2000, which asks about labor force activity in the week prior to the survey,

including whether the respondent missed work because of illness and if so, whether the

respondent was paid for the time off. This question sequence changed in 1994; Appendix

Exhibits 2 and 3 summarize the relevant pre-1994 and 1994 and later questions. From 1980

through 1993, respondents were asked what their “major activity” had been in the previous week.

Those who report that they did not work at all, but had a job from which they were temporarily

absent are asked why they were absent. If the reason is illness, vacation, weather or a labor

dispute, they are asked whether they received wages or salary for any of the time off the previous

week. This allows me to identify workers who missed work because of illness, with or without

pay. This measure does not capture individuals who are so disabled that they do not work at all,

nor does it capture a worker who (for example) missed a day of work because of illness but

nonetheless reported that his/her “major activity” in the prior week had been working. This

measure of the probability of missing work due to illness therefore misses both very serious and

very minor work disabilities; nonetheless, it is possible to estimate what fraction of workers

experienced a disruption to their “major activity” of working because of illness, and whether

they were paid for this time off.

       Beginning in 1994, respondents are asked simply whether they worked at all in the week

prior to the survey. If they say no, they are asked whether they had a job from which they were

absent; if they were absent from a job, they are asked why they were absent and whether they

were paid for any of the missed time. Therefore it is possible to construct similar measures of

the fraction of workers who missed work due to illness, and the fraction of that group who were




                                                                                                6
paid. It is likely that the change in the question sequence affects the responses, however, so the

data should not be viewed as a consistent time series before and after 1994.



The April 1993 CPS Supplement on Employee Benefits

       The April 1993 CPS included a supplement on employee benefits that was administered

to about 26,000 workers. The supplement includes questions on non-wage benefits including

disability insurance, sick leave, pensions, and health insurance, as well as job characteristics such

as firm size, establishment size, industry, occupation, and the worker’s tenure on the job. The

questions about sick leave and disability insurance are presented in Appendix Exhibit 4. It is

possible to determine whether a worker has any sick leave/short-term disability insurance; if the

worker has any, the number of months for which wages would be replaced; and whether the

worker has long-term disability insurance coverage.



4. Results

A. Trends over time

The Employee Benefits Surveys

       Table 1 shows trends over time in the fraction of employees with sick leave, short-term

disability insurance and long-term disability insurance. As discussed above, changes in the

scope of the survey (1988) and in the definitions (1995) mean that these data are not a consistent

time series; nonetheless, the data reveal some interesting patterns. Starting with long-term

disability insurance, which has been defined relatively consistently throughout this period, it

appears that the fraction of jobs with this benefit in medium and large establishments has

remained fairly constant from 1980 to 1997, fluctuating slightly just above forty percent. During




                                                                                                   7
the early 1980s there was an increase in the fraction of jobs with long-term disability insurance,

from 40 percent in 1980 to 48 percent in 1986. The drop to 42 percent in 1988 may be because

of the change in the scope of the survey.

       Most jobs in medium and large establishments have either sick leave or disability

insurance; the fraction is constant at about 93 percent from 1980 to 1986, then drops to 89

percent in 1988, though this drop most likely is due to the change in the scope of the survey. It is

also interesting to note the differences in benefits for employees of small establishments versus

those in medium and large establishments. Both short-term and long-term disability insurance

are more common for employees of medium and large establishments than for employees of

small establishments. About half of all employees of medium and large establishments have

short-term disability insurance, while among employees of small establishments the fraction is

about 29 percent. Small establishment employees are also much less likely to have long-term

disability insurance (around 20 percent compared to around 40 percent for employees of medium

and large establishments). The fraction with sick leave seems to be more similar in the different

types of establishments, with half of all small establishment employees and slightly more than

half (56 percent in 1997) of employees of medium and large establishments having sick leave.

       Overall, the EBS data suggest that sick leave is a very common benefit in medium and

large establishments, and slightly less common though still widespread in small establishments.

Short and long-term disability insurance are not as common, covering 40 to 50 percent of jobs in

medium and large establishments and about 20 to 30 percent of jobs in small establishments.




                                                                                                  8
The Basic Monthly Current Population Surveys

         Table 2 shows the probability that a private-sector wage and salary worker in the basic

monthly CPS reports that in the week prior to the survey s/he missed work because of illness (as

described above – referred to from now on as “being out sick”), and the probability that this

absence was paid, from 1980 to 2000. Overall during this period, the probability of being out

sick is 0.8 percent; about 43 percent of workers who were out sick received at least some pay

during the time out. It appears that the change in the wording of the question resulted in many

more people reporting being out sick, since the fraction jumps from 0.4 percent in 1993 and the

two preceding years to almost 0.9 percent in 1994.4 There is no evidence of a systematic trend

in the probability that a worker is out sick. Similarly, there is a discrete jump in 1994 in the

probability that a worker who reported being out sick also reported being paid, from about 38

percent in 1993 to 41 percent in 1994; this too is most likely the result of changes in the

questionnaire rather than an actual change between 1993 and 1994 in the probability that a

worker who was out sick was paid.



B. Determinants of disability and health insurance coverage in 1993

         In order to say more about which types of workers are likely to have sick leave, disability

insurance, and health insurance, I analyze data from the April 1993 CPS Supplement on

Employee Benefits. Table 3, columns 2 through 6 present the distribution of the number of

months for which a worker would be paid at least some wages if s/he “got sick tomorrow and

couldn’t go to work for six months,” by various worker and job characteristics. Overall, half of

all workers would get no pay in this situation. Among those who would receive some pay, about

4
  An alternative possibility is that the FMLA resulted in an increase in actual work absence. It is not possible to use
these data to evaluate whether this is true; though it is worth noting that if this were the case, one would expect the
probability of being paid conditional on being out sick to have gone down, which it did not.


                                                                                                                      9
a third (17.6 percent of all workers) would be paid for only one month and another third would

be paid for 5-6 months. Forty-three percent of all workers report having long-term disability

insurance coverage on their job, as shown in column 7 of Table 3. Both of these benefits are less

prevalent than employer-sponsored health insurance, which 56.3 percent of these workers have,

as shown in column 8 of Table 3.5 Moreover, workers who have one benefit are more likely to

have the others. Seventeen percent of workers without health insurance have sick leave and only

about 12 percent have long-term disability insurance, while among workers with health

insurance the corresponding rates are 77 percent and 67 percent.

        All three benefits are much more prevalent for highly educated workers. Only about 20

percent of workers with less than a high school education have any sick leave or have long-term

disability insurance, and only 31.4 percent of them have employer-sponsored health insurance.

By contrast, two-thirds of workers with a college degree have sick leave, 56 percent have long-

term disability insurance and three-quarters have health insurance.

        Interestingly, black workers are slightly more likely than white workers to have either

sick leave or long-term disability benefits, and are just as likely to have health insurance. Men

are slightly less likely on average than women to have any sick leave (48 percent versus 52

percent), but are more likely to have long-term disability insurance (47 percent of men versus 39

percent of women) or health insurance (60 percent of men versus 52 percent of women). Single

parents, whether male or female, are less likely than their single counterparts without children to

have any of the three benefits.

        Very young workers (25 years old or less) and older workers (65 and older) are far less

likely to have jobs with any of the three benefits than are prime-aged (26 to 64 years old)


5
 Note that this is the fraction of workers who are policyholders, not the fraction covered by any employer-sponsored
health insurance (including coverage as a dependent), which would be higher.


                                                                                                                 10
workers. Among workers of prime age the only group for whom benefits differ by age is those

close to retirement; workers ages 55 to 64 are slightly less likely than workers ages 26 to 54 to

have any of the three benefits, although they are still more likely to do so than are very young or

older workers.

         Full-time workers are far more likely than part-time workers to have each of the three

benefits.6 Three-quarters of full-time workers have some sick leave, compared to less than one-

quarter of part-time workers. Almost sixty percent of full-time workers have long-term disability

insurance, compared to about one-sixth of part-time workers.                           This full-time/part-time

differential is comparable to the one for health insurance (74 percent of full-time workers versus

only 22 percent of part-time workers). There is also a strong differential with respect to the

number of years the worker has held the job; three-quarters of workers who have been on the job

less than a year have no sick leave, less than a quarter have long-term disability insurance, and

only 29 percent have health insurance. Among workers on the job for more than ten years, just

over two-thirds have sick leave, 59 percent have long-term disability insurance and three-

quarters have health insurance. Unionized workers are also far more likely to have any of the

three benefits.7

         The probability of each of the three benefits increases with hourly wage; more than 80

percent of workers in the top fifth of the distribution of hourly wages have sick leave, 72 percent

have long-term disability insurance, and 86 percent have health insurance. By contrast, only 15

percent of workers in the bottom fifth of the wage distribution have any sick leave, 13 percent

have long-term disability insurance, and 19 percent have health insurance.



6
  See Farber and Levy (2000) for a detailed discussion of how the probability of having health insurance varies with
full-time/part-time status and job tenure.
7
  See Buchmueller et al. (1999) for a discussion of the effect of unionization on the provision of health insurance.


                                                                                                                  11
       Provision of all three fringe benefits is also strongly related to firm and establishment

size. By sector, public employees are most likely to have each type of benefit, followed by

private sector wage and salary workers; self-employed workers are least likely to have any of the

three. Only 14 percent of the self-employed have long-term disability insurance and only 21

percent have health insurance.      There is also considerable variation across industry and

occupation.

       Table 4 presents the results of multivariate linear regressions that include most of these

variables in order to determine which ones are of independent significance. These regressions

are estimated using only private-sector wage and salary workers; each model also includes a full

set of state dummies that are always jointly significant but are not reported in Table 4. I estimate

four separate models: a linear probability model with dependent variable equal to one if the

worker reports having any sick leave; an OLS regression using workers with sick leave only

where the dependent variable is the number of months (<1, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6) of wage replacement

the worker would receive; a linear probability model with dependent variable equal to one if the

worker reports having long-term disability insurance; and a linear probability model with

dependent variable equal to one if the worker reports having health insurance.

       The regression results generally confirm the differentials described in the two-way table.

There are some exceptions; there is no significant black-white health insurance differential, for

example, in the multivariate analysis and the effect of age on the probability of benefits is not as

straightforward as it appeared in the simple table. But generally, the regression results confirm

that highly educated, highly paid workers, full-time workers, unionized workers, and workers

who have been on the job a long time are more likely, all else equal, to have benefits. This is as




                                                                                                 12
true for sick leave and long-term disability insurance as it is for health insurance. In other words,

workers on jobs without health insurance are also unlikely to have disability insurance.



5. Implications and directions for future research

        The main findings of this analysis are first, that there does not seem to be a clear trend in

rates of private disability insurance coverage and second, that workers who do not have health

insurance are also unlikely to have disability insurance. What do these results suggest for public

policy? The lack of a trend suggests that in contrast to the market for employer-sponsored health

insurance, there is no cause for concern that private disability insurance coverage is eroding over

time.

        The fact that workers without health insurance are also likely to lack disability insurance

is more troubling. A great deal of policy attention focuses on “the uninsured” – meaning

individuals without health insurance – and particularly on uninsured workers. This concern is

presumably motivated by a desire to buffer the economic consequences of illness or injury,

which are of course not limited to medical bills. If a family lacks both health insurance and

disability insurance, it is not clear whether medical bills or lost earnings represent a greater risk

to their economic security. On one hand, medical bills may be many times larger than total

family income while the lost earnings of one family member must by definition be less than this.

On the other hand, there are multiple sources of “charity” medical care, including defaulting on

debts to hospitals that are legally required to provide necessary medical care without advance

payment, while the same may not be true for rent, food, clothing, and many other necessities.

Further research is necessary to determine whether medical bills or lost earnings represent a

larger economic risk to uninsured households. In the meantime, the results in this paper suggest

that lack of disability insurance is another important dimension of being “uninsured”.
