                                           ABSTRACT

Default options have an enormous impact on household "choices." Defaults matter because opting

out of a default is costly and these costs change over time, generating an option value of waiting.

In addition, people have a tendency to procrastinate. We develop a theory of optimal defaults based

on these considerations. We find that it is sometimes optimal to set extreme defaults, which are far

away from the mean optimal savings rate. A default that is far away from a consumer's optimal

savings rate may make that consumer better off since such a "bad" default will lead procrastinating

consumers to more quickly opt out of the default. We calibrate our model and use it to calculate

optimal defaults for employees at four different companies. Our work suggests that optimal defaults

are likely to be at one of three savings rates: the minimum savings rate (i.e., 0%), the match

threshold (typically 5% or 6%), or the maximal savings rate.

      Default options have an enormous impact on household “choices.” Such eﬀects

have now been extensively documented in the literature on 401(k) plans.1 Defaults

have been shown to aﬀect participation, savings rates, rollovers, and asset allocation.

For example, Choi et al. (2003b) study three firms that use automatic enrollment.

When employees at these firms are automatically enrolled in their 401(k) plan, only a

tiny fraction opt out, producing participation rates exceeding 85% regardless of tenure.

But when employees at these firms were not automatically enrolled, participation rates

were significantly lower, ranging from 26% — 43% after six months of tenure, and from

57% — 69% after three years of tenure.

      Defaults matter for three key reasons that we model in this paper. First, acts of

commission – e.g., opting out of a default – are costly. Second, these costs change

randomly over time and therefore generate an option value of waiting to change a

default. Decision makers would like to wait for a low cost period (e.g., a free weekend)

to make a change. Third, people have a tendency to procrastinate. Even if they want

to make a change, they have a tendency to delay that change longer than they should.

      Because of these eﬀects, the choice of a particular default can have a significant

eﬀect on consumer welfare. However, it is not always obvious how to select a socially

optimal default.

      If all employees would like to be saving at a rate of exactly 5% in their 401(k) plan,

then the employees’ welfare will be maximized if the employer sets a 5% default. But

the calculation of an optimal default is not as straightforward if diﬀerent employees

have diﬀerent optimal savings rates. For example, what is the optimal default savings

rate if employees have optimal savings rates that are distributed uniformly with a mean

of 5%?

   In this paper, we develop a theory of optimal defaults which implies that the obvious

answer to the previous question – 5% – is not necessarily the right answer. In a world

of heterogeneous agents, it may sometimes be optimal to set extreme defaults which

are far away from the mean optimal savings rate. This eﬀect arises for two reasons.

First, a default that is far away from a consumer’s optimal savings rate may make

that consumer better oﬀ than a default that is closer to the consumer’s optimal savings

rate. Intuitively, if an agent suﬀers from a procrastination problem, then a “bad”

default – i.e., one that is far from the consumer’s optimal savings rate – will be more

motivating than a better default. Hence, sometimes bad defaults make people better

oﬀ than better but imperfect defaults. Second, our theory implies that optimal defaults

are highly sensitive to the actual distribution of optimal savings rates. In particular,

optimal defaults are often associated with the modal optimal savings rate and not the

mean optimal savings rate. Since these modes are sometimes extreme (e.g., minimum

or maximum contribution rates), optimal defaults will sometimes be extreme as well.

   At the end of our paper we calibrate our model and use it to calculate optimal de-

faults for employees at four diﬀerent companies. For two of our companies, the optimal

default is close to the mean optimal savings rate, whereas for the other two companies



                                           4
the optimal defaults are extreme: 0% and 15% respectively. Our work suggests that

optimal defaults are likely to be at one of three savings rates: the minimum savings

rate (0%), the employer match threshold (typically 5% or 6%), or the maximal savings

rate (around 15% in our sample of companies from the late 1990’s).2


                            1.   A model of savings choices

We adapt the model of Choi et al. (2002b) to describe the 401(k) enrollment decisions of

employees that have been newly hired at a firm. However, the model is general enough

to describe any problem in which an actor decides when to move from a default state

sD to an optimal state s∗ .

       We assume that each employee at a firm has a fixed optimal savings rate (i.e.,

optimal state) s∗ , with density function f characterizing the distribution of these op-

timal savings rates for the population of employees in the firm. When new employees

join the firm, the employees are automatically enrolled at a default savings rate of sD ,

which is a choice variable for the firm. In this paper, we consider the case in which

this default can only take values in the support of f .3 We assume that the firm uses

a single default savings rate for all of its employees either because the firm does not

observe an employee’s true type, s∗ , or because of legal/practical costs of implementing

employee-specific defaults.4

   2
     More recently, regulatory changes under the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act
of 2001 (EGTRRA) have led many companies to raise their maximum savings rates well above the
historical norm of 15%.
   3
     See Choi et al. (2002b) for a generalization.
   4
     Such employee-specific defaults are a natural extension of our current framework and merit the-
oretical and practical evaluation.


                                                 5
       Employees remain at the default election sD unless they opt out of the default by

incurring a cost c. This opt-out cost is drawn each period and takes the value 1 with

probability µ < 1 and value 0 with probability 1 − µ. The value of the cost is known

when the agent decides on her action. We suppress individual and time subscripts to

simplify notation.

       When the agent opts out, she sets her savings rate equal to her optimal savings rate

s∗ , which we assume the agent knows with certainty.5 Until that action takes place,

the agent suﬀers a flow loss of L = L(sD , s∗ ) ≥ 0, where the first argument of L is the

current savings rate and the second argument of L is the optimal savings rate. After

the action occurs, the agent suﬀers a flow loss of 0 = L(s∗ , s∗ ).

       Finally, we assume that agents are naive hyperbolic discounters, with discount

function 1, βδ, βδ 2 , ....6 Such naive agents believe that their future selves will make

choices that are consistent with their current preferences. We adopt such naive beliefs

because they increase the force of procrastination, but our qualitative results would

be unchanged if we instead assumed that agents are sophisticated in their beliefs. For

simplicity and analytical tractability, we set δ = 1 (no long-run discounting).7 We also

   5
      Another natural generalization is to consider the case in which agents have imperfect information
about their personal value of s∗ . If agents learn more about this value over time, they have another
motive for delaying the costly action of opting out of the default.
    6
      See Laibson (1997) for a discussion of hyperbolic discount functions and Akerlof (1992) and
O’Donoghue and Rabin (1999) for a discussion of naifs and procrastination. Note that the term
“hyperbolic” is overly restrictive, since the important property of these preferences is simply that
they are characterized by more discounting in the short-run than in the long-run.
    7
      We will calibrate our model at the frequency of a pay-cycle. So if the annual long-run discount
rate is 0.05, then the discount rate per pay-cycle is approximately 0.05/26 = 0.002 or 0.05/12 =
0.004, implying respective δ values of 0.998 and 0.996. Relative to these values, setting δ = 1 has
little impact on our results.



                                                  6
adopt the standard hyperbolic assumption of β < 1.

   We use the following timing convention. If the employee has not previously opted

out of the default, the period begins with a flow loss of L. The employee then draws a

current opt-out cost c and decides whether to delay opting out or to instead pay the

cost, thereby ending the game. If the employee delays she will pay a flow cost of L next

period and also face an anticipated continuation value function, which we denote v(c0 ),

where c0 represents next period’s draw from the cost distribution. Hence, the employee

chooses to pay c and end the game if the cost today is less than the discounted cost

of delay, or c < β [L + Ev(c0 )]. When this inequality is not satisfied, the employee

chooses to delay. Ignoring mixed strategies, which only arise on a zero measure region

of the parameter space, the employee’s strategy is thus


                  “Opt out only when c = 0”         if β [L + Ev(c0 )] < 1
                                                                                     (1)
                                                                   0
                “Opt out when c = 0 or c = 1”       if β [L + Ev(c )] ≥ 1


1.1.     Naive expectations and the continuation value function v(c). Since the

employee is assumed to be a naive hyperbolic agent, the continuation value function

is constructed under the (mistaken) belief that all future selves will exhibit no time

discounting, since this is what today’s self wants those future selves to do. Recall that

δ = 1.

   The strategy of opting out whatever the draw from the cost distribution means that

the employee’s expected loss is µ = E(c). Waiting until c = 0 to opt out implies that



                                           7
the employee’s expected loss would be



              Ev(c|wait until c = 0) = µ [L + Ev(c|wait until c = 0)]
                                         µL

                                        1−µ


This formula has a natural interpretation: the expected costs are equal to the expected

                                                                            1

                         µL
   If L < 1 − µ, then   1−µ
                              < µ, implying that the expected losses generated by waiting

to opt out until c = 0 are less than the losses from opting out immediately at cost

c = 1. So if L < 1 − µ, the employee will plan to wait until c = 0 to opt out. If

L ≥ 1 − µ, the employee anticipates that next period she will act with certainty. In

We reiterate that Ev(c) is based on naive beliefs, so this expectation reflects the actor’s

incorrect model of her future behavior.

Let w(c) represent the employee’s expected total costs, discounted with the agent’s

long-run discount factor. A recursive representation for w(c) is given by



                  Ew(c) = pE(c|opt out) + (1 − p)δ [L + Ew(c0 )]

                          = pE(c|opt out) + (1 − p) [L + Ew(c0 )] .



We evaluate social welfare using the long-run discount factor δ and omitting the short-

run discount factor β. These preferences represent the actor’s preferences at economic

birth, which we assume occurs before she starts working at the firm. The last equation

contains no discounting, since it reflects the fact that δ = 1 in our calibration. Note

however that our results would not change qualitatively if we had instead assumed

δ < 1 throughout our analysis.

   Because Ew(c) = Ew(c0 ), we can show that

                                   

   We are now in a position to characterize the relationship between defaults and



                                             9
welfare. To do this, we consider the relationship between expected (dis)utility and L,

the per-period flow losses of not being at an optimum. To focus on the role of L, we

stop suppressing L in our notation and consider



                                   W (L) = Ew(c)|L .



W (L) is the expected losses for an agent with initial flow losses per period of L.

   In a standard model with exponential discounting (i.e., β = 1), W (L) would increase

as flow costs L increase. But for hyperbolics (i.e., β < 1), it will always be the case

that W is non-monotonic in L. To see this, note that W (L) = µ when L = 1 − µ. This

is the level of L at which an exponential (i.e., dynamically consistent) agent should opt

out of the default whatever the cost realization. But when c = 1, a hyperbolic agent

                                          1
will only opt out of the default if L ≥   β
                                              − µ, which is greater than 1 − µ. Hence, when

              1
1−µ < L <     β
                  − µ, the hyperbolic agent is insuﬃciently motivated to act, and this

motivational gap produces self-defeating procrastination. In this region of L values,

the expected loss function lies above µ, the value that W (L) would take if the agent

were not procrastinating and were willing to act at the high cost realization. But once

                                          1
L is high enough – specifically, above    β
                                              − µ – the procrastination eﬀect vanishes and

expected costs fall back to µ, since the hyperbolic agent is now willing to act whatever

the cost realization. Figure 1 plots the expected cost function against the flow costs

L, revealing the non-monotonicity that arises whenever β < 1.

   In a world with procrastination, moving the agent further from the optimum (i.e.,

                                               10
increasing flow costs L) can make an agent better oﬀ, since it decreases the agent’s

tendency to procrastinate. This eﬀect is not everywhere oﬀset by the direct eﬀect of

reduced welfare arising from the increase in the delay cost, L.


1.3.   The firm’s optimization problem. We now analyze the employer’s choice

of a default savings rate under the assumption that the employer is interested in max-

imizing the welfare of the firm’s employees. We recognize, however, that employer and

employee incentives need not generally be aligned. This is particularly likely in the case

presented here, since naive hyperbolic agents will not anticipate their own tendency

to procrastinate and hence will not pick an employer based on the employer’s ability

to mitigate the harms of such procrastination. Therefore, this normative exercise is

also relevant for regulators or unions that can influence the defaults that firms pick.

Identifying and incorporating the other motivations and constraints that firms face in

designing their benefit plans (e.g. non-discrimination testing, good corporate citizen-

ship, reputational value in the labor market, or personal altruism, to name a few) is

beyond the scope of the current paper.

   We derive the optimal default, s∗D , that minimizes the social welfare function,


                               Z s
                                     W (L(sD , s∗ ))f (s∗ )ds∗ .                      (3)
                                s




                                               11
We adopt the cost function



                                       L(sD , s∗ ) = κ(sD − s∗ )2 .



This quadratic cost function is convex in deviations from the optimal savings rate,

s∗ , and has the advantage of analytic tractability. However, it does not reflect the

particular institutional features of many 401(k) plans (e.g., an employer match that

ends at a threshold, implying a discontinuity in the cost function). We believe that

the quadratic cost function represents a good compromise between tractability and

realism.

   We will minimize equation (3) numerically, using the actual estimated distribution

of optimal savings rates. However, for the purposes of exposition, it is useful to consider

the case in which f (s∗ ) is uniform over support [s, s]. In this case, one can prove the

following result when β < 1.

Intuitively, when there is little variation in optimal savings rates, it is best to design a

default that is in the middle of the range of optimal savings rates, since all employees

will then be very close to their optimal savings rate and delays in opting out of the

default will not be very costly. By contrast, when there is a great deal of variation

in optimal savings rates, it is better to design a default that is close to one of the

                                                    12
two boundaries of the support. This “boundary” strategy reduces the proportion of

employees who engage in costly procrastination, since the boundary strategy reduces

the fraction of employees who fall in the “procrastination” interval 1 − µ < L <

(1/β) − µ.
                                                                    s̄+s
      Finally, note that if β = 1 and f is uniform, then s∗D =        2
                                                                           will always be an

optimum8 because the procrastination eﬀect does not apply and there is no gain in

welfare from moving agents away from their optima.

      It is also useful to emphasize a trivial property of these models, which is important

in the empirical analysis that follows. This additional eﬀect is easiest to understand if

we assume that f is a discrete density on the domain of feasible savings rates: {0.00,

0.01, 0.02, ...}. Then it is easy to show that



                                      lim s∗
                                     κ→∞ D
                                               ∈ arg max
                                                      ∗
                                                         f (s∗ ).
                                                       s




In other words, as the cost of deviations rises (κ → ∞), the optimal default converges

to the mode of the distribution of s∗ . This eﬀect is driven by the fact that for large

costs of deviating from s∗ , all employees will immediately adjust to their s∗ except

those who are already at their optima. Hence, the optimal social policy minimizes

adjustment costs by setting the default equal to the most common value of s∗ . We

refer to this as the mode eﬀect.

  8
      However, it will not generally be the unique optimum.




                                                  13
1.4.   Calibration. Our model has very few free parameters: the density of optimal

savings rates, f (s∗ ); the short-term discount factor β; the scaling variable κ; and the

probability of a high-cost draw µ. We further restrict this list by using individual

employee data to pin down the density f (see next section). We set β = 23 , reflecting a

large body of experimental evidence and a growing body of field evidence. For example,

Laibson, Repetto, and Tobacman (2003) use the method of simulated moments to

estimate β using household financial data. Their benchmark estimate is 0.70 with a

standard error of 0.11.

   Only κ and µ remain to be calibrated. Before doing this we need to pick units for

the variables in our model. We assume that time units are periods of a pay cycle (about

two weeks). We assume that utility units can be interpreted in terms of a money metric

in which one unit of utility is equal in value to 1/10 of a pay cycle of income. So when

the cost realization is high (c = 1), opting out of the default generates a time cost that

is equal in value to 1/10 of the agent’s income during that pay cycle. We assume that

such busyness is the norm and set µ = 0.9. It then follows that the cost realization will

be zero 1/10 (1 − µ) of the time.

   To set κ, we use the following thought experiment. Suppose that a consumer is

ten percentage points away from her optimal savings rate: |sD − s∗ | = 0.1. What is

the money-metric cost of this deviation? Let x represent the loss in units of 1/10th

of one pay cycle of income. Then, κ(0.1)2 = x. We will consider a range of values

for x : 0.1, 1, 10. This translates into the following range of values for κ : 10, 100,



                                           14
1000. We consider this wide range for two reasons. First, we are agnostic about the

appropriate calibration value. Second, we wish to explore the sensitivity of our results

to the choice of κ. However, if forced to choose, we would set κ = 100, implying that

a ten percentage point deviation in one’s savings rate is as bad as losing one tenth of

one’s income during that pay cycle. For companies with an employer match, one could

motivate losses of this magnitude by considering the missed match payments induced

by undersaving.


                              2.   Empirical analysis

Table 1 shows the variation in both 401(k) plan design and employee characteristics of

the four companies for which we compute the optimal default 401(k) savings rate. We

denote these four companies by their industry: Health, Oﬃce, Food, and Finance. All

are large employers with well-established 401(k) plans.

   There are two key diﬀerences in the 401(k) plan environment that vary across the

companies. First, two of the companies (Health and Oﬃce) match employee contri-

butions up to 6% of pay, while the other two have no match at all. These latter

companies are of interest because the distribution of employee contribution rates will

not be aﬀected by the presence of a match threshold. Having an employer match may

either raise or lower the desired 401(k) contribution rate. Because the match subsidizes

saving in the 401(k) plan, employees with a match may desire to contribute more, at

least up to the match threshold. However, the match also increases the total amount

of savings that is being done, and the employees may use the match as a means to


                                          15
oﬀset their own contributions.

   The second key diﬀerence in plan environment is that two of the companies (Oﬃce

and Food) have an employer-sponsored defined benefit pension plan, while the other

two do not. Other things equal, we would expect a lower desired savings rate for

employees in companies with a defined benefit pension.

   The workforce demographics of our four companies also vary quite considerably.

The median pay ranges from $25,000 per year in Food to $41,000 per year in Finance.

Because Social Security replaces a higher fraction of income for low income employees,

we would expect a higher desired savings rate for high income employees. There is also

significant variation in the fraction of employees that are female (from 30% in Oﬃce

to 78% in Health) and the median age of the workforce (from 29 years in Finance to

39 years at Food).

   To estimate the distribution of optimal savings rates (i.e., the density f in the

model), we use two approaches. First, we report densities over 401(k) savings rates for

“medium-tenure” employees. We informally reason that such medium-tenure employees

have been at a firm long enough to select their optimal savings rate (i.e., the option

value of waiting and procrastination hurdles have been surmounted), but not so long

that tenure-driven selection eﬀects dominate the data. These savings densities are

reported in Table 2 for employees with 3-5 years of tenure (density f1 ) and 5-7 years

of tenure (density f2 ).

   Second, we use a regression framework to control for demographic variables. We



                                          16
run an ordered logit regression in which the explanatory variable is the actual 401(k)

contribution rate chosen by each individual employee. We include non-participation,

which implies a 0% contribution rate, as one of the categories. The control variables in

the regressions are ln(pay), ln(age), ln(tenure), and a gender dummy variable (D = 1

if the employee is female). We then predict the distribution of contribution rates

that would obtain if each employee had 30 years of tenure, holding other demographic

characteristics constant. The underlying presumption behind this exercise is that 30

years is enough time to overcome any delays due to procrastination or the option value

of waiting. The projected density from this procedure is reported as density f3 in Table

2.

     With these densities in hand, we are now in a position to estimate the optimal

savings rate by minimizing equation (3), the social welfare function. We undertake

this maximization for 3 × 3 × 4 cases of interest: three diﬀerent values for κ, three

diﬀerent ways of calculating the density f, and four diﬀerent test companies. The

results of these maximizations are reported in Table 3.

     Table 3 documents six findings. First, the analysis reveals a high degree of het-

erogeneity in policy recommendations. The optimal default ranges from 0% to 15%.

Moreover, even within a single firm there exists a large degree of variation in optimal

defaults (e.g., Finance). Second, the range of variation in optimal defaults is twice

as large as the range of average optimal savings rates. Third, the optimal default

calculation is extremely sensitive to distributional assumptions on s∗ . To see this, fix



                                           17
κ = 100 and read across the columns. The defaults show substantial variation arising

from very small (within-company) diﬀerences in f1 , f2 , and f3 (see Table 2). Fourth,

as κ gets large, much of the variation in optimal defaults is driven by the mode eﬀect.

For κ = 1000, five out of twelve of the optimal defaults are equal to the modal optimal

savings rate. Fifth, the optimal defaults vary in a sensible way with the underlying

firm-specific attributes. Firms whose employees have a high motive to save turn out

to have higher optimal defaults than firms whose employees have a low motive to save.

For example, the employees at Food have a defined benefit plan and a low average

salary (i.e., a high average Social Security income replacement rate), and hence very

low optimal defaults (0% to 3%). By contrast, the employees at Finance have no de-

fined benefit plan, a high average salary, and a median optimal default of 14%. Sixth,

and finally, the optimal defaults tend to cluster in one of three regions: close to 0%,

close to the match threshold (6% for Health and Oﬃce), or close to the maximum

contribution rate allowed under the plan.


                         3.   Discussion and Conclusion

This paper has presented a model of 401(k) enrollment. The model includes four

components: costs of opting out of a default, an option value of waiting to incur those

costs, procrastination in opting out of a default, and heterogeneity in optimal savings

rates.

   One should also consider other important psychological and economic issues when

picking socially optimal defaults. First, some employees may interpret defaults as im-


                                            18
plicit advice, an issue that does not arise in the current model since each employee

is assumed to know her true optimal savings rate.9 Second, defaults may be partic-

ularly sticky because of loss aversion.10 If the default is perceived to be a reference

point, then deviations from that reference point may be psychologically aversive, since

the resulting “gains” from the deviation (e.g., higher current consumption) are only

weighted half as much as the resulting “losses” (e.g., lower saving). Third, if house-

holds do not know how to think about the future or are overoptimistic about future

income, they may undervalue savings. In such a world, it may be optimal to pick a

high default savings rate, even if households eventually move away from it. Fourth,

households may know the optimal savings rate but not appreciate how important it is

to implement it, increasing action delays. Fifth, choosing a long-run savings rate that is

one percentage point too low is more costly than choosing a long-run savings rate that

is one percentage point too high (since retirement is short relative to working life and

the utility function generates a precautionary savings motive11 ), suggesting a desirable

upward shading of optimal defaults. Sixth, optimal savings rates are not constant over

time (as we assume), but instead are likely to trend up slowly with working age. Sev-

enth, the firm may wish to pick an optimal default that weights some employees more

heavily than others. For example, it may be sensible to calculate optimal defaults that

overweight the interests of employees that are likely to have a long duration of em-

  9
     Employees may treat a zero default as weaker implicit advice than a non-zero default.

     Precautionary savings eﬀects arise when u000 > 0, a common assumption in applied economic
models.

ployment at the firm and underweight employees that are likely to separate relatively

quickly. Future work should extend our theoretical framework by incorporating many

of these additional considerations.

   Future work should also explore the empirical implications of our model. The model

makes quantitative predictions about the timing of savings rate changes. Employees

who change their savings rate soon after they are hired should select larger changes

than employees who change their savings rate long after they are hired. This is because

employees who are willing to wait a long time for a low cost opportunity to opt out

of the default are likely to have little to gain from doing so. The model also predicts

that average savings rates will not necessarily increase monotonically with the default

saving rate. As the default savings rate rises, procrastination eﬀects can strengthen,

leading more agents to delay selecting an even higher savings rate. Such perverse eﬀects

have already been observed in the data (Madrian and Shea 2001, Choi et al. 2003b).

   Finally, the model suggests one important generalization that we are currently

exploring (Choi et al. 2002b). If it is occasionally optimal to select “bad” defaults –

i.e., defaults that are not close to one’s optimum saving rate – then it may be optimal

to pick defaults that are so “bad” that all consumers feel compelled to immediately opt

out of them. Such a setup is equivalent in practice to something that we call “active

decision,” a regime that forces new employees to pick their own savings rate early in

their tenure at the company without the benefit of a fall-back default. In a world

with significant procrastination, such active decision regimes are sometimes the best

“defaults” of all.

                                   Table 2. Savings Rate Distributions
This table reports distributions of savings rates. f1(s*) is the savings rate distribution of eligible employees at
December 31, 1997 whose tenure is between 3 and 5 years. f2(s*) is the savings rate distribution of eligible
employees at December 31, 1997 whose tenure is between 5 and 7 years. f3(s*) is the distribution of optimal savings
rates based on predicted values from an ordered logit regression of savings rate on age, gender, pay, and tenure.
Predicted values are calculated using 30 years of tenure instead of actual tenure.

This table shows the optimal savings rate for four different firms. Food Company and Financial Company have no
employer match in their plans. f1(s*) is the savings rate distribution of eligible employees at December 31, 1997
whose tenure is between 3 and 5 years. f2(s*) is the savings rate distribution of eligible employees at December 31,
1997 whose tenure is between 5 and 7 years. f3(s*) is the distribution of optimal savings rates based on predicted
values from an ordered logit regression of savings rate on age, gender, pay, and tenure. Predicted values are
calculated using 30 years of tenure instead of actual tenure.
