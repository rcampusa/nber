1.    Introduction
       A topic of continued public concern is the national level and

distribution      among areas and individuals of the availability of hospital
services. The      New   York Times in 1971 contained articles stressing the
cost in terms of delayed treatment and death of insufficient hospital
beds.1 During the same year, the Times carried articles indicating


       See, for example, New York Times, January 21, 1971, p. 29, column 1;
and   September   12, 1971, section IV, p. 9, column 5.



                                                    2
the   cost to society of unused hospital beds.




      2For example, the Timea reported Elliot Richardson, then Secretarj
of   Health, Education and Welfare, as citing "an estimate of $3.6 billion
as    last year's cost of maintaining unused beds all over the country."
(York_Times, August 26, 1971, p. 36). Richardson's (unexplained)
figure of $3.6 billion may be contrasted with the $4 billion in federal
money spent for hospital construction under.the Hill—Burton program
sice its inception 25 years ago. (New York Times, November 23, 1972,
p.i., column 1.)



       Table I—i presents data for the country          as a whole on hospital
utilization    during the post World War II period for short—tern non—federal

hospitals. The bed rate( the number of beds per thousand popuiatio4

These changes are important because hospitals do perform useful services,

but at a considerable cost —— a cost which has been growing rapidly.2




     2The American Hospital Association reported that the daily cost
of caring for patients in short—term general hospitals averaged $81
in 1970, $92 in 1971 and $105 in 1972. The cost has almost doubled
ftoin 1966 to 1972. (New York Times, July 31, 1972, p. 36, co1tn 4,

Although        occupancy rates are declining nationally, regIonal mal-

distributions and political pressures still induce hospital bed

hospital bed construction (New York Times, September 21, 1972, p. 36,

       The purpose of this study is to present a. model (Chapter II)

for    analyzing the utilization of short—term general hospitals —— in
particular,    occupancy rates, admission rates ,   bed   rates and length
of stay.                                                          .
                                        —3—

    This model is then applied (Chapter III) to a cross—section analysis

    of regional differences in hospital utilization. The objective is

    •to develop structural equations and hypotheses as to why the measures

    of   hospital utilization vary across communities, and to estimate these
    equations   and test these hypotheses. There is, however, an identity
    relationship   between average length of stay (LS), and the occupancy

    rate (OR), admission rate (Adnis*) and bed rate (Beds*):

                     OR =                .   Length of stay is the "redundant't
    varable     for the purpose of this study.

    2. Framework

          The number of hospital admissions demanded in a year in a

    community is viewed as a declining function of the cost of such care.

    This relation)however)need not be the sane for all communities. For.

:
    example, the number bf admissions demanded may be greater, the larger

    the number of surgeons and the more      important   is health insurance in

    the   community. In addition, more strict rationing of admissions
    (and hence a smaller number of admissions) may occur when hospitals
    are very crowded.
          The analysis of the supply of hospital admissions is based on
    both a short run and a long run model of hospital bed availability.
    In the short run the bed rate    (the number of beds per thousand

    population)    is assumed to be fixed and determined by factors outside
                                   —4—

the model under investigation. If we assume a fixed bed rate (Beds*)

and a constant length of stay (LS), the largest possible admission

rate   would be found by: Adms* = (Beds*) (365)   .    In   Figure I this is

represented   by the point at which the demand curve for admissions
intersects the supply curve of admissions and the numl)er of admissions

isq0.
       However, this is an unrealistic view of the supply side of the
short run model. The demand for hospital beds is not a constant
daily quantity but rather a fluctuating one. It is higher on some days
than on others.' In the case of hospital care, the output cannot

generally   be stored by the consumer.2 This means     that    if on a given

health services.



day there is a greater demand for hospital beds than can be satisfied
by the available supply and if    non—price rationing is used, some con—

awners   will have to delay (or forego) the satisfaction of their demand
for hospital services even though they were willing to pay the current
market price. Delayed satisfaction of demand for hospital care is
not without cost, as anyone who has ever been in pain or discomfort or has
ever faced death is veil aware. Thus, a community would want to have

what appears to be excess capacity in hospital beds on the average

day of the year, so that it could provide some additional in—hospital

bed care during periods of high demand.1




     'This assumes that "at capacity" the marginal cost of admissions
rises steeply. If the marginal cost of providing additional beds
and ancillary services did not rise with the quantity supplied in the
short run, there would be no economic demand for an "excess supply"
on the average day.


     A useful measure of "excess capacity" in a community is its
average occupancy rate in a year. The average occupancy rate is
measured by the ratio of the number      of patient days (admissions multi—

plied by average length of stay in days) to the number      of available
bed days (thenumber of beds trniltiplied by 365 days) ——

                (Beds)(365)             If, for example, the average
length of stay is five days, a community with 100 beds and an average
bed occupancy rate of 90 percent accomniodate6,570 admissions.
        OR(Beds)365    =   (0.90)(l00)(365)    =   6,570 admissions.) At a 100
(q
percent occupancy rate it      could accommodate this nuniber of admissions with
90 beds, but more   patients   would have to b granted a delayed admission.
A delayed (or denied) admission of a serious case is costly. More
excess capacity on the average reduces the likelihood of the demand for
beds exceeding the number of beds. However, constructing and maintaining
excess capacity are costly. Thus, there is some desired average occu-
pancy rate   that is less than 100 percent. This is represented in
Figure I by a number of admissions equal to q1, which is less than q0.
                                       —7—

       Hospital administrators have control over the occupancy rate

through their control of admissions and length of stay. If a lower

•occupancy rate is desired) they can be more        selective   in the cases

that are admitted and thus decrease the admission rate and/or the average

length of stay. The variables that are hypothesized to enter into the

process of selecting the community's desired occupancy rate, given a

fixed supply of beds, form the framework for the analysis of the occu-

pancy rate equation.

       In summary, the short run includes a fixed supply of

beds, a hospital admission rate equation and          an occupancy rate equation.
Both equations are needed to detepnine the number of admissions
Vand the occupancy rate    in   a community: a high admission rate causes
a high occupancy rate, but a high occupancy rate causes a low admission
rate.
        In the long run, however, the bed rate (beds per thousand population)
is    not exogenous to   the model. For example, if      the    demand for admissions
is high   relative to the number of beds, the occupancy tate is high.

Some patients for whom     the   cost of   a   delayed admission is high do

 in   fact experience a delayed admission in       their community and    must

either    postpone the hospital    admission or seek such care elsewhere.

The implicit value of an additional admission is now high. If corn—

inunities respond to this high marginal value of admissions, the

 number   of beds will be increased in the long run (see          Figure II)




     'The supply response may come from the public sector,
 voluntary hospitals or proprietary hospitals.                        V
                                    —8—


Our long run analysis        relies on a two equation model: the admission

rate is a funétion of the bed rate, and the bed rate is a function of

the admission rate.

    This study, therefore, focuses on three inter—related dependent

variables: the admission rate, the occupancy rate and the bed rate.

Chapter II presents the development of the three equations       one for

each dependent variables and Chapter III presents the empirical

estimation and interpretation of these equations.

of observation in the empirical analysis.1 SNSAs    were   selected for




     "A standard metropolitan statistical area is a county or group

inhabitants or more, or two contiguous cities with a combined population

            3. Summary of Finding

                  This study analyzes SMSA differences in the utilization of short—
•

            term general hospitals by explicitly examining three dependent (endogenous)
        •
            variables: the occupancy rate, admission rate and bed rate.



                  Our analysis of SNSA differences in occupancy rates is based on

            the randcnness of the demand for admissions. Since the demand for admis-

            sions fluctuates, the populace and hospital planners in an SMSA    are
    •


            concerned with maintaining an average occupancy rate sufficiently less

            than 100 percent so as to have an optimal probability that someone

            desiring an admission will be turned away because the hospitals are at

            full capacity. It is estimated that under 1967 utilization levels the

            demand   for beds in an SNSA   would exceed the supply of beds (on average)
            in   only one week out of 12.8 years.
    •
                  The empirical analysis strongly supports    the predictIons of   the
            randomness model for occupancy rates. SMSA''s with higher admission
            rates have higher occupancy     rates. More populous SMSAare   better able
            to take advantage of their smaller relative fluctuations in demand for
            admissions, and maintain a higher occupancy rate. When there are more
            hospitals for the same number of beds (and hence the hospitals are smaller))
            there is a lower occupancy rate. The larger number of hospitals reduces
            the substitutability among hospital beds, because of a poorer "referral"
            system between hospitals than within hospitals.
                  Higher occupancy rates could be obtained by reducing the barriers
            between hospitals. These barriers iticlude the limited number of hos-
            pital affiliations had by most physicians, the required veteran status

            for entry into federal hospitals,     the provision of charity hospitaliza—

       Occupancy   rates are higher in SMSA"s with colder winter climates
and a   larger proportion of nonwhites in the population. These effects

are presumably due to longer lengths of stay.

       The analysis of hospital admission rates. looks at variables which

have been hypothesized to effect the height of the demand for, or the

price of, a hospitalization. When           hospitals   are more crowded (high

occupancy rate)) the admission rate is lower because hospital administra-

tors are more selective in the cases          that   are admitted in order to

reduce the probability of capacity' utilizatiçn. In addition, admission

rateare higher, the more important is hospital and surgical insurance

and the more numerous are surgeons in the SNSA's population)              The

relative number     of   non—surgical physicians has no effect on the admis—

sion rate. Admission rates are also higher, the lower the median family

income (elasticity at mean = —0.78), the more numerous are nonwhites in

the population, end the colder the          winter   climate. The effect of non-

whites on admissions may be due to the poorer level of health of non-

whites.

        Our third dependent (endogenous) variable is the bed rate. A 10

percent increase in the bed rate results in a 2 percent decrease in the

occupancy rate, a L      percent   increase in the average length of stay and

a tI   percent Increase in the admission rate. This largely supports


        11t is not clear to what extent a larger relative number of surgeons
is   a cause or a consequence of a greater .demand for hospitalization.
Roemer's Law that an increase in beds results in these beds being filled

with little change in the occupancy rate. It is, however, noteworthy

that a 10 percent increase in admissions increases the number of beds by

9 percent. Thus, the effect of admissions on beds is stronger than the

effect of beds on admissions.

      Our model for the randomness of demand for admissions suggests

several other variables as relevant for an analysis of the demand for

hospital beds. Two of these variables, population size and the number

•of hospitals, have no significant effect empirically. Three other

variables, the proportion of beds in federal hospitals, the emergency

death rate and median family income, do have an effect.

      Beds    in federal hospitals are found to be imperfect substitutes for
beds in non—federal hospitals presumably because of the required veteran
status   in   the former. The presence of) say, a 130 bed federal hospital
in   an SNSA   with   a million inhabitants decreases the number of norx—ederal

beds in the SNSA by approximately 40 beds.. The more important are

emergencies in an SMSA's case mix, the greater is the expected cost of

a delayed admission because of capacity utilization, and hence the

greater is the SHSA's demand for beds. The positive effect of income

on the bed rate (elasticity at the mean +0.12) is consistent with

the hypothesis that wealthier SMSA"s buy more excess capacity than

poorer SMSA"S through the construction of more beds.

      •There is an interesting relation between the relative number of

nonwhites in the population and hospital utilization. SMSAOs       with
relatively more nonwhites have higher admission rates and a longer

average length of stay, but there is no compensating difference in the
bed rate. The result is greater hospital crowding and a greater pro-
bability that a desired admission ill be     delayed   (or denied) the larger
the   relative number of nonwhites in the population)

      Our theoretical and empirical analysas of hospital occupancy rates,

admission rates) bed rates and length of stay indicate that these sta-

tistics vary across SNSA'5   and   that this'variation can be related sys—

tematcally to the characteristics of the SMSA.

                                   The Theory


                                1. Introduction


           This chapter presents the theoretical analysis by which we arrive at

     the hypotheses and structural equations for the three dependent variables

     examined in this study: the admission rate, the occupancy rate and the bed

     rate. The equations should not be estimated by ordinary least squares (single

     equation) techniques. In our short run model, the      occupancy rate is deter-

     mined simultaneously with the admission rate since each affects the other. In

     our long run model, the bed rate (beds per thousand population) and the

     admission rate are mutually determined.

fl          Part (2) of this chapter presents the development of the hospital

     occupancy rate equation. A model based on th randomness of admissis suggests

     that .the occupancy rate in an SMSA is related to the admission rate, popu-

     lation size and number of hospitals. This forms the basis of the analysis of

     occupancy rates,   and    proxy variables are entered in some of the analysis

     to control for SMSA differences in length of stay.

            The            admissions equation is developed in part (3). The

     demand for admissions is assumed to be greater) the lower the price of an

     admission, or the easier the non-price rationing by hospitals. Thus, hospital

     and surgical insurance, the presence of physicians, the occupancy rate and

     the number of hospital beds are shown to enter the admissions equation. Other

     variables, mainly to hold constant demographic differences across SMSAs, are

     included.
                                   11-2



       In   Part (4) the bed rate (beds per thousand population) equation is

presented. The equation is developed under the assumption that it represents

  long run supply             The model for the randomness of admissions

suggests that the admission rate, the demand for emergency care, the size of

the population and the number of hospitals are explanatory variables.


2. Hospital Occupancy Rates:'



'The      occupancy rate of a region is the total •number of patient days
in a period of time (e.g., a year) divided by the product of the average
number of beds and the number of days in the time period. Bed occupancy
rates can be greater than lOO7 if some beds (e.g., temporary beds in
passageways) are not counted in the bed census but their occupants are
counted in the total number of patient days.



       A. Introduction:

       The average       occupancy rate in short term general hospitals in an

area is neither constant nor purely random. It may be

determined by the economià and institutional characteristics of the community.

The purpose of this section is to develop a structure which will be used to

obtain hypotheses concerning regional differences in      occupancy rates.

       The maintenance of a hospital bed and its auxiliary equipment and

personnel is costly. A bed is productive when it is occupied. •This does'

not mean, however, that average occupancy rates of less than 100

percent represent wasted resources. If there were a known constant number

of beds demanded each day for each hospital,       occupancy rates less than

100 percent would indeed represent wasted resources. However, since there are

fluctuating demands for hospital services,       the presence of "excess

capacity" on the average day is efficient. That is, up to a point, vacant
                                                                                 )
beds are a productive resource. The extent to which        occupandy rates do

in   fact respond to fluctuations in admissions is a major aspect of our

analysis of occupancy rates.'




     'Other studies have used the randomness of admissions as a basis
for analyzing hospital occupancy rates. See, for example, Hyman Joseph
and Sherman Folland, "Uncertainty and Hospital Costs," Southern Economic
Journal, October 1972, pp. 367—73; William Shonick, "A Stochastic
Model for Occupancy Related Random Variables in General—Acute Hospitals,"
Journal of the Am*ican Statistical Association, December 1970, pp. 1474—1500;
M. Long and P. Feldstein, 'Economics of Hospital Systems: Peak
Loads and Regional Coordination," American Economic Review, May 1967,
pp. 119—129, and references therein. This study differs from the others
in terms of (1) the specification of the randomness model (including
the effects of population size and number of hospitals), (2) treating
the admissions variable as endogenous rather than exogenous, and (3)
the application of the model to regional differences in hospital utiliza—
tion rather than to hospital differences within an area.


B. Fluctuating Demands

         The rate of admission (p) is the number of admissions in a time

period, N, divided by the size of the population (pop). That is, p= N/pop.

Either an individual is a hospital admission or he is not. Using the

binomial theorem, the variance across time periods in the number of hospital

admissions is Var (N) = (pop) p(l-p).

        The number of patient days (PD) of hospital care in a time period is

the sum across patients of all of the lengths of stay (LS) within that time

period.&1' Itcan be thought of as the average length of stay (LS) multiplied



     we know the number of hospital beds (B), the number of admissions in a
time period (N), the length of the time period CD) and the occupancy rate (OR),
by a simple identity we know the average length of stay.  {LS = (OR) (D) (J.]
In this study length of stay is viewed as the redundant variable, andNthe
analysis focuses on the occupancy rate,the bed rate and the admission rate.
For simplicity of presentation of the randomness model, the average length
of stay is assumed constant across time periods.

 the     variance in patient days can be    written as.

 The relative variation in patient days in a time period is smaller, the

constant over time. Let us assuma that across time periods (i) the
average length of stay and the number of admissions are independent.

cV(PD)  isnegatively related to population size and the rate of admission,
and positively related to the coefficient of variation of length of
stay across time periods. These relationships would hold even if
length of stay were not statistically independent of the admission rate,
although the equation would ie far more complicated. See Leo Goodman,
"On the Exact Variance of a Product," Journal of the American
tical Association, December 1960, pp. 708—713.



      Let us assume that the mean             and standard deviation of the number of
patient days that will be demanded in a time .period in a community
were known. If the demand for an admission by one individual were
independent     of that of others, the demand for patient days would be
normally distributed.2 Then, if               the   community wishes to have


'Annual rates of admission are about 15 percent. Assuming independence
of individual admissions, the distribution of admissions for, say,
a week approximates the Poisson Distribution for a small sample (e.g., a
household or .a small work group), but approximates a normal distribution for
a large sample (e.g., a large factory, census tract or SMSA). For a
binomial distribution, if the proportion of successes [in this case
the admission rate (p) multiplied by the sample size (pop)] exceeds 10,
                                                 "-5


   the number of successes (admissions) approximates a normal rather than a
   Poisson distribution. For a population of 100,000 and a weekly admission
   rate of .15/52,                 admissions Z   (100,000). (.15) 300 and
   the normal distribution is a close approximation to the binomial distribution.



   beds to satisfy demands for admissions for, say, 97.5 percent of the time,

   the number of beds should exceed the mean number of patient days by approx-

   imately twice the standard deviation of patient days.V



  21This assumes perfect pooling of beds among the hospitals in the community.
  The effects of a lack of perfect pooling among hospitals in an area and the
  time lag in filling a vacant bed are discussed below. For the normal dis-
  tribution only 2.5 percent of the observations are more than 1.96 ' 2.00
  standard deviations above the mean.



             Let us assume there is no cost in shifting patients within the

   time period of D days. Of course, D may be one day. Let us designate

   Z     as the standardized normal variate which indicates that the number of

   beds is sufficient for all but 100 a percent of occurrences. Then the

   number of beds in the community is

             UR =      OR   + g, p   (pop).

    At   full capacity the use             rate is unity. Differentiating equation (U) with

    respect to the admission rate when the hospitals.are operating at full capacity,


(11-12)                =             +( +        )    pop      0.


    Thus, at full capacity (UR= 1.0), the marginal effect of adwissionson the

    occupancy       rate is

(11-13) = -. (1+€)                        (pop),
    where        is the elasticity of the lag per admission () with                            respect to

    the    admission rate. If the lag exists ( 2.> 0) but is invariant                         with respect

    to   admissions (€-                 0), at full capacity the measured occupancy rate will
•   be less than unity, and               a higher admission rate implies a lower occupancy
    rate.     Àè long as the            elasticity of the lag with            respect to admissions is

    larger    in algebraic value than minus unity                      (i.e., -1 <
                                                                                     ci),   occupancy rates

    decrease with an increase in admissions at full capacity (UR                              1.0).

       Thus, the effect of the adr1ission rate on the bed occupancy rate is
expected to be positive for utilization at less than full capacity,. but it

may be negative at or near use rates equal to unity. Since high occupancy

rates may imply capacity utill:ation, the admission rate may have a negative

effect on occupancy rates at very high levels of occupancy.


B. Bed Rate

       If an SMSA experiences an increase in its bed rate (beds per thousand

population), and the SMSA's admission rate and average length of stay remain

constant, the occupancy rate will fall."1 The exogenous increase in the bed

                           (365) Beds ) 2LnBeds


rate also tends to increase the admission rate. Therefore, SMSAs with larger

bed rates may have higher admission rates and lower occupancy rates.' If

      effect of an increase in the bed rate on admission and occupancy
rates is referred to in the literature as "Roemer's Law". Roemer's Law
says that exogenous increases in bed rates affect primarily admissions
and length of stay, and leave occupancy rates virtually unchanged. That
is, patients fill the available supply of beds. (For example, see M.I.
Roemer and M. Sham, Hospital  ljtilizationUnder Insurance, Hospital
Monograph Series, No. 6, Chicago, American Hospital Association, 1959).

across SMSAs is considerably smaller than the coefficient of variation in
admission rates and bed rates. (See Appendix A.)



the bed rate is not held constant in the occupancy rate equation, we could

observe a negative partial effect of admissions on occupancy rates. The bed

rate is hypothesized to have a negative effect on the occupancy rate.


E. Communication Among Hospitals

       Suppose two cornmunities'have the same population, admission

  rate    and desired a .          The communities differ in that Community A has one

  hospital (HA = 1), whereas Community B has k identical hospitals (HB =                              k),
  each serving () (100) percent of the population, with no communication of

  vacancies among hospitals. It can be shown that community B is expected to

  have more beds and a lower                            occupancy rate.

           By substituting equation (3) into equation (4), for community A,

(11—14) BA(D) = E(PD) (1 + z CV ('PD) ) = E (PD) (1 + z
                                                                               ,/_i_

  For   Community B,

  That is, ceteris paribus, because of less efficient pooling of                           beds, occupancy

  rates    are lower in SMSAs with         more hospitals.

           If a bed in one hospital were a perfect substitute •for a bed in

    another hospital, the number of hospitals would have no effect on the bed

    rate or the occupancy rate. Thus, holding the bed rate and admission rate

    constant the inclusion of a variable for the number of hospitals in an

    analysis of occupancy rates tests for the lack of perfect substitution of

    beds among hospitals.


    F. Demographic    Control Variabins
           Holding   cOnstant the   admission rate and   bed rate, the occupancy rate

    is, by definition)a function of the average length of stay. The average

    length of stayis a function of the SMSAs case mix and the demographic

    structure of the population. Although case mix data cannot be included,

    some of the empirical analysis does control for demographic variables. These

    variables include the sex, age, and race distributionSof the population, the

    live birth rate and the rate of growth of the population.

•
           There is evidence that nonwhites have a longer ,average length of stay

    than whites.' This suggests that, ceteris paribus, occupancy rates are

because of a shorter length of stay. The shorter length of stay may be due

 to both thebetter health of Tnigrants, and the greater attractiveness

to migrants of healthier environments.


C. Climate

        Thus far the analysis has assumed that the variables under study do

not vary systematically over the year. Given an admission, however, climate

may affect the length of stay)-' It seems reasonable to hypothesize that,



'The effect of seasonality on admissions is examined explicitly in the
admission rate equation.

longer lengths of stay for two reasons. First, since admission rates are

rate,   the case mix is expected to be more heavily weighted toward more

serious cases in the SMSA with the lower mean January temperature. More

serious cases have longer average lengths of stay. Second, holding case

mix constant, patients are likely to be kept in the hospital longer, the less

amenable is the non-hospital environment to recuperation. Non-hospital care

is presumably less productive than hospital care for recuperative

purposes in a colder winter climate than in a warmer climate. Since longer

lengths of stay increase the occupancy rate, holding the admission and bed

rates constant, the partial effect of mean January temperature on occupancy

rates is hypothesized to be negative.

H.   Summary

         Table 11-1 contains the regression equation for the occupancy rate

analysis.      If hypotheses as to the sign of a variable have been presented

above, the sign is indicated.

         All but one of the explanatory variables may be viewed in the short

run as being "caused" independently of the dependent variable, LN(OR). The

one exception is the admission rate (p). The admission, rate isjin part, a

function of the occupancy rate. At high levels of. hospital occupancy, the cost

to society of admitting a patient to fill a bed is the sum of the resources

consumed because the bed is occupied plus a measure of the cost because a

potential patient is denied access (or is granted delayed access) to a bed.

This latter cost component does not exist when occupancy rates are low. Thus,

we expect admissions to be more selective when occupancy rates are high}-'

2.   Admission Rate

      Economic, demographic and institutional variables are used in

this section to generate a model to explain SMSA differences in the

rate of admission to short term general hospitals.


(A) Hospital Occupancy Rate

      Hospitals appear to be more selective in the cases they admit when

beds are scarce       than    when vacant beds are abundant. Medical

conditions for which delay in treatment or alternative treatments are

less costly are put •lower down on the admissions queue during periods

of high occupancy rates. To the extent that higher occupany rates

increase the delay before a desired admission can take place, alternative

sources of medical treatment (including spontaneous cures) or death may

reduce the total number of actual admissions. Alternative sources of

medical treatment include home care, specialized hospitals, nursing

homes, and hospitals outside of the SMSA. Thus, we expect anegative

partial effect of the occupancy rate on the admission rate.


 (B) Bed Rate

      An alternative hypothesis (Roemer's Law)   is   that communities maintain a constar

occupancy rate and admissions and length of stay are a function of the

number of beds in the SMSA.(1) To test a "beds effect" on admissions,


      'The coefficient of variation across SMSAs is much.sra1ler for the

occupancy rate than for the admission rate and bed rate.

the bed rate is entered as an explanatory variable.
     It could be argued that a positive partial correlation between the

admission rate and the bed rate is not due to more beds causing more

admissions, but rather is due to a higher demand for admissions

causing more hospital beds to be constructed. This suggests that the bed

rate should be viewed as an endogenous variable (determined within the

model) not an exogenous variable (determined outside of the model) in our

analysis of hospital utilization.                -



     In,the   short run the bed rate (Beds*)     is   viewed as

fixed, and the hospital admission rate and occupancy rate as interacting

simultaneously. In the' long run, the bed rate' is not fixed and the

three variables ——   p,   BEDS* and LnOR—-' are interdependent. As the number

of beds adjusts to long run conditions, the occupancy rate variable may

lose some of its variab!lity. In the next section a model is developed

for predicting the bed rate in an SMSA. The analysis of inter—SMSA

differences in admission rates is performed for both a short run model,

using predicted LnOR and observed BEDS* as explanatory, variables, and

a long run model, using predicted BEDS*.
                                  II-7

(C) Hospital Insurance

     It   is often argued that the effect of more extensive hospital and

surgical insurance coverage is to increase the amount of hospital care

and surgery demanded by patients and their physicians. The effect of

insurance is a change from a "fee for service" pricing system to an

annual lump sum payment independent of the amount of services to be

consumed and (usually) a smaller fee for service. By lowering the

direct cost tothe patient of an additional unit of medical services

the patient has an incentive to purchase more medical services than

otherwise. This may be done directly by the patient either through

requesting more services or by searching for a doctor who will prescribe

these services. The increased use of medical services may also occur

if the patient's doctor, seeing the lowered direct price to the patient,

suggests or provides more medical care. The additional medical care may

show up, in part, as a higher rate of hospital admission. Thus, a greater

hospital and surgical insurance coverage is expected to. be associated with

a higher rate of hospital admission.


(D) Physicians

     The number of physicians per capita in an SMSA can be associated with

the utilization of their services in several ways. First, the greater the

relative number of physicians, holding the demand for their services constant,

the lower would be the cost, and consequently the greater the use of their

services.' Second, if we hold fixed the supply schedule of physicians


     1The cost of physician's services include the direct price (fee),

the waiting room time, and the costs incurred due to a delay in

receiving care.
                                       11—18



     services, communities with a higher demand for health care have a larger

     number of physicians per capita.2 Finally, it has been alleged that

          2ThiS   suggests that the number of physicians.is an endogenous

     variable. However, in this study the observed number of physicians is

     used in the empirical analysis.


     physicians create their own demand:   the larger the number Of physicians

     per capita, the greater           the amount of medical care received

     per capita because "consumer ignorance" results in patients placing a great

     deal of faith in the physician's advice as to the amount and type of

     medical care that should be purchased and physicians wish to "fill upt'

     their day.

          The effect on hospital admissions of an increase in the purchase of

     medical care due to the presence of a larger number of   physicians   depends

:
     on whether physicians' services are complementarywjth or substitutable

     for hospital services. Surgeons' services are hospital using. It is

     not clear a priori whether hospital services are substitutes or comple-

     ments for the medical care provided by non—surgical out—of—hospital

     physicians. Thus,                         the number of surgeons per thousand

     population(SURG*) should have a positive partial effect on            admission

    rates, but the partial effect of non—surgical out—of—hospital physicians

     per thousand population (GENMD*) is not clear.

          It might be asked, "Does the effect of the presence of a larger

     nuinler of physicians depend on the extent of hospital insurance coverage?"

    This question is answered            by ihcluding two linear interaction

    variables for hospital insurance and physicians per thousand population.1


         'These variables are (a) (HI)(GENND*) and (b) (HI)(SURG*).



    (E) Income

         The variable median family income serves several inter—related

    functions. First, income may be a proxy variable for health status.2


•

         2There is evidence that income and good health are negatively

    correlated among whites but positively correlated among norihites. See

    Michael Grossman, The !)emand for Health   (BER,   Occasional Paper 119, 1972)

    and Morris Silver, "An Econometric Analysis of Spatial Variations in

    Mortality Rates by Age and Sex," V.R. Fuchs, ed., Essays in the Economics

    of Health and Medical Care (NBER, 1972) pp. 161—227.


    Second, it is not clear a priori whether, ceteris paribus, hospital

    admissions increase or decrease with income, holding an initial Level

    of health constant.3 Thus, no prediction is offered as to the effect


         3For a given initial level of health, if preventive or early curative

    care are less hospital using than cure at later stages, those with higher

    incomes may have a lower admission rate. On the other hand, there may

    be a positive income elasticity of demand for hospital using curative

    medicine.

F. Climate

     Hospital admission rates appear to be'seasonal; they tend to be

higher in the fall and winter than in the spring and summer.1 Thus, if


     'For example, see Helen Hershfield Avnet, jsician Service Patterns

and Illness Rates (Group Health Insurance, Inc. 1967) Table 42, p. 110.



all other variables that influence hospital admissions were held constant,

communities wiLh more severe winters would tend to have higher

admission rates. Nean January temperature is used as a measure of the

severity, of the winter.


(G) The SNSA as a Nedical Center          .




     The dependent variable, the admission rate,, is defined as the number

of admissions in the short term general hospitals located in the SMSA

in 1967 divided by the population of the SMSA in 1966. An admission rate

obtained in this manner is a biased estimate 'of the hospital admission

rate of the population of the SNSA. To obtain the populationt s admission

                                                                                  -
rate, the admissions of non—residents who used the SMSA"s hospitals           .



should be subtracted from the data, while the admissions of residents who
entered short term general hozpita1s outside of the SMSA should be

included in the data. Unfortunately, it is' not possible to make these
                                              .

adjustments.     .




     An alternative procedure is to obtain a proxy for the net in—migration

 of patients. The net in—migration would be greater, the greater. the ex-

 tent to which the SMSA serves as a health center. An SNSA is more likely

 to serve as a health center if it has a medical school, and, if a medical

 school exists, the larger its size. The number of medical school students

                                                                                      C)

per hundred thousand population is entered for this purpose.'


     'The variable is defined to be zero for SMSA s without medical

schools.




(II) Demographic Variables

     The probability of a hospitalization in a year is related to the

person's age, sex and race. Thus, admission rates by SMSA will vary

with the age, sex and race composition of the population. Seven

variables are included to capture the effects of sex and age

differences.2 The live birth rate (LBR) is included to control for


     2The seven variables are the percent of the population female

(ZFENAL),   and the perceñtof males and females separately, in the age

groups 10 to 39, 40 to 54 and 55 years of age andover.


SMSA differences in fertility. Holding the birth rate constant, the sign

of %FEMAL is expected to be negative as women tend to be more healthy

than men of the same      age.   The percent of the population who are nonwhite.

(%NWHT)    is   hypothesized to have a positive effect on the admission rate

since nonwhites have a lower level of health than whites.

     It would be desirable to hold constant a measure of the "healthi—

ness" of the SNSA's environment. The mean January temperature captures

some of this effect. Holding constant the median family income and the

sex, age, and race distributions of the SMSA, the health status of the

environment may be highly correlate4 with the mortality rate. The number
                                      11—22


    of deaths per thousand population (MORT*)                   J

    ii is   expected to have a positive effect on admissions.

4. Bed Rates

      A. Introduction

              Although -—------- the number of hospital beds in an SMSA

on January 1 comes prior in time sequence to the number of admissions

in that year, this is not a sufficient reason for treating the bed rate

as exogenous (determined outside of the model). The number of hospital
                                                          future
beds is a function of past demands and       expectations of/demandS

for these beds, and there is a strong time series correlation in the

demand        for hospital care. The larger the demand tor hospital care,
the greater are the economic and political incentives for the government,
andreligious, other not—for—profit and for—profit organizations to increase
the   number of hospital beds. This section develops a theoretical model

to explain SMSA differences in the bed rate.                         -




         B.     Admission Rate and the Randomness Model

         If we divide both sides of equation 11—15 by the             size   of the

population (in terms          of      thousands of inhabitants) and D,


(11-19) Beds* =                                    +    Z\!_i) ]
The bed rate       indicated          in equation (11—19) is composed of a mean predicted

demand               plus a demand due to the stochastic nature of admissions

    L°                        2
I   (—) (Z) —--(p —       p       )   ]   The mean predicted demand in our simplified

model is proportional to the admission rate and the length of stay.
                                    II —25


The   "stochastic demand" is proportional to length of stay, inversely
proportional to the square root of the population size, proportional
to the square root of the number of hospitals, and positively
related to the admission rate (for p < .5).
       We can test the effect of density on the substitutability of
hospital beds. If a greater density increases the substitutability
among hospital beds, an SHSA with a smaller land area (holding
constant population, admissions and number of hospitals) will have
a smaller bed rate.
C. Hospital   Administration

       If beds under different administrative control (government, voluntary,

proprietary) were equally, good substitutes for each other, the fraction

of beds under a given administration should have no effect on the SMSA's

overall bed rate. However, if only veterans can use federal short—term

general hospitals, tfie addition of federal hospital beds has a smaller

 and indirect effect on bed availability for non—veterans than for

veterans. This is expected to increase the number of beds (but by

less than the increase in fedral beds) and the proportion of beds in

federal hospitals. It seems reasonable to assume that state and local

government short—term general hospital beds are               good

substitutes for beds in voluntary hospitals. Although proprietary

hospitals charge higher fees than non—profit non—federal hospitals, there

are no other special barriers to patient entry. The proportion of

proprietary beds in the total bed census is so small)it is unlikely that

SMSA variations in proprietary hospital beds have a statistically

                The parameter Z    is the standardized normal variate indicating

        the proportion of occurrences (a) for which, the demand for beds exceeds

        the available supply. There are no direct measures of Z      ,   but we can
        postulate that it is a function of two variables, the relative importance

        of emergencies in the SMSA's case mix and, median family income.

              The more important are emergencies in an SMSA's case mix, the

and consequently the larger the bed rate.'




         'The emergency variable (E!.ERG) is the sum of deaths from six causes.
Thevariable is entered as emergency deaths per thousand population (EMERG*).
These six causes are:
            (a) Arteriosclerotic heart disease, including coronary conditions (HEART)
            (b) Vascular lesions affecting the central nervous system (STROKE)
            (c)   Motor Vehicle accidents (MOTOR)
            (d) Other accidents (OTHACC)
            (e) Suicide (SUIC)
            (f) Homicide (HOMIC) .                    .




       If    the availability of a hospital bed is viewed as a superior good,

 higher income SMSA's would prefer a smaller a (larger Z) to reducE the

 probability that a desired hOspital admission would be delayed. This impljes

 a positive effect of income on the bed rate.


E.    Percent Nonwhite

        Since nonwhites have been subjected to disèrimination in the

 provision of other public services,2 they may            have been subject to


 2For discrimination in public schoo1 expenditures see Richard Freeman,

 "Labor Market Discrimination," paper presented at Econometric Society

 Meeting, December l972ór Finis Welch, "Black—White Differences in Returns

 to Schooling," American Economic Review (forthcoming).



 past (and perhaps also current) discrimination in the provision of hospital

 services. In addition, since non—profit hospitals are financed to a

 large extent by voluntary contributions from wealthy individuals and

 foundations, discrimination by these sources against nonwhites implies

 that SNSAs with a larger fraction of the population nonwhite have a smaller

 bed rate. To test these hypotheses, a variable for the proportion of

 noni.thites in the SMSA's population is added to the bed rate analysis.
                                   11—28



F. Other Variables

       ilbiding the admission rate and number of hospitals constant, SMSAs

which serve as medical education centers are likely to have a larger bed

rate. This can be due to both a longer average length of stay and a larger

Z   (to reduce the probability of rejecting an "interesting't case) in hospitals

affiliated with medical schools.

           number of medical students per hundred thousand population (MST*C)

is used to capture the medical center effect on the bed rate.

       The bed rate in an area is a function of the way its denominator,

population, changes. If hospital construction lags behind population

growth, the greater the increase in population, the smaller the bed rate.

If the community anticipates future demands on the basis of current

population growth rates, a positive partial relation would exist between

the bed rate and the rate of growth of population (%CHPOP). In terms of

equation (19), holding the admission rate constant, the population growth

rate effect would appear as short—rurL variations in Z-.




G. Summary

       Table 11—3 presents a listing of the variables which enter the

bed rate analysis and the hypothesized effects of these variables. The

empirical analysts uses a predicted admission rate (rather than the

observed admission rate) since the admission rate and the bed rate are

simultaneously determined in the long run.

we can write equation 11—17 as

If    the assumptions of the model are valid, the regression of the natural

log of the occupancy rate on the structure of the randomness model (V)

will not have an intercept but will      have   a negative slope coefficient.

Using the normal distribution, the slope coefficient indicates the average

proportion of occurrences for which the denand for beds exceeds the avail-

able supply (a).

       1Because of th.e simultaneous determination of the admission rate
and the   occupancy rate, the predicted admission rate is used. The
variables used to obtain the predicted admission rate are the exogenous
variables in Tables Bjand 3 —ifQ,

When an intercept is allowed, it is insignificant (t— 1.58). Thus,
we accept the hypothesis that the intercept is zero. When the regres-
sion is forced through the origin, the slope coefficient is highly
significant, has a negative signand its magnitude indicates that

       The findings in Table 111—1 provide emp1rical support for the
randomness      model developed in Chapter II. The regression in Table III—,

which    uses a looser form of the randomness    model variables as well

as other     control variables, provides additional 3upport for our
theoretical analysis of occupancy      rates.

the observed admission rate) explains over 40 percent of SMSA variation

      When   hospital   admissiors are viewed as random events, larger popu—

lations have a more stable relative demand for hospital beds and, there-

fore, are able to maintain a higher occupancy rate. The variable SP0P66,

the   square root of the inverse of the population of the SMSA(            ),    has

a significant    effect on the occupancy rate. Going from an SMSA of one—
quarter   of   a million to one of one ml1ion inhabitants      increases   the

occupancy rate by six percentage     points.2

       The randomness model also predicts that                if   beds in different

hospitals are not perfect substitutes for each other, the larger the

number of hospitals in an SMSA, the lower the occupancy rate. The

model suggests the variable SR.HOSP = \'tumber                of   general hospitals,

which has a significant negative effect on the occupancy rate. Coing

from four hospitals to sixteen hospitals decreases the bed occupancy

rate by 2.5 percentage points.1

           Note   that a four fold increase in the number of hospitals and in

the population size leaves unchanged the number of hospitals per capita,

but the occupancy rate need aot be unchanged. An increase in the number

of       hospitals from 4 to 16 and an increase in populadon size from one—

quarter million to one million results in a net increase in occupancy

that an increase in the bed rate results in these beds being filled,

with no change in the occupancy rate. Since the admission rate is

significantly different from minus unity, length of stay increases

             The   empirical analysio of SMSA differences in occupancy rates
    permits a test of the hypotheses developed in Chapter II, Part 2.
    The findings confirm the predictions of the randomness model. There

    size and maintain a higher occupancy rate. A larger number of hospitals

    ciecre2ses the occupancy rate, presumably because of a poorer referral

:   system between than within hospitals. Cormunication does occur

    across hospitals, as shcwn by the higher occupancy rate whenpopula—

    tion siza and nuuiber of hospitals are increased proportionately.

             Hoidng the admission rate constant, a higher bed rate implies

    a lower occupancy rate (the elasticity is —0.2). Thus, an nerease

    in beds is associated with both an increase in length of stay

    (elasticity is +0.3.9) and a decrease in the occupancy rate. This

    is only partial support for Roemerts law that when more beds are

    available they tend to be               filled.

             Longer lengths of stay explain the findings that occupancy rates
    are higher in SNSAs in colder wintef climates and with a larger fraction

        The empirical analysis

    indicates that occupancy rates vary across SNSAs and that this

    variation can be related systematically to the characteristics of

    the SMSA.

           a. Introduction:

               The second dependent variable examined theoetical1y in

    Chapter II is the hospital admission rate. The admission rate is

    defined as the total number of admissions in a year in the SMSA's

     short   term generil   hospitals divided by the population in thousands

     of   the SMSA.           The mean and standard deviation of the admission
                                                                           1/
    rate   are 170 and 40 respectively, and the range is from 60 to 290.H




    'The data are f or 192 SMSAS.        See Appendix A.


               The regression equation developed in Chapter II for explaining

    SMSA differences in the hospital admission rate is estimated simultaneously

    with the occupancy rate in our "short run" model (Table III—), and simul—

:   taneously with the bed rate in our "long run" model (Table iii—4)--".




                                                      The model explains 68 percent

    of lnter—SMSA variation in     th2   admission rate in the ordinary least squares

    regression analysis (See Appendix B).

hospitals   (higher bed occupancy rate), for a fixed number of beds,

the more likely it is that accepting an admission precludes (or delays)

accepting another patient with a more "urgent" demand for hospital care.

          As expected, the predicted natural.log of the occupancy rate

has a significant negative effect on the admission rate. A one per-

centage point increase in          occupancy rates, ceteris paribus, decreases

the admission rate by over four admissions per thousand .population per year):!

                        OR
Thus, a one percentage point increase in the occupancy rate (OR = 0.01)',

in the neighborhood of the mean OR, results in a decrease in admissions

per thousand population by 4.44.


     Holding the predicted occupancy rate constant, a larger bed rate (Beds*)

implies a larger absolute number of vacant beds per capita. A larger absolute

number of vcant beds per capita implies a lower probability that an admission

will preclude or delay the admissiun of a patient with a more serious illness.

The variable Beds* does indeed have the expected significant positive partial

effect on the admission rate (Table III—). An increase of one bed per

thousand population is associated with an 11.2 per thousand population

increase in the admission rate.'

'The   mean and standard deviation of bed rate are 5.22 and l.44,respectively.

A one bed per thousand increase represents nearly a 20 percent increase in the

stock of beds.

 physicians per thousand population. Non—surgical M.D.s (CENMD*) and

 surgical M.D.s per thousand population (SURG) are entered separately.

 It is argued in Chapter II that it is not clear a priori whether more non—

 surgical M.D.s per thousand population increases the use of hospitals (since the

 cost of medical care is cheaper and more of all medical care is purchased) or

 decreases the use of hospitals (since hospital care and   out—of—hospital non—

care provided by medical doctors specializing in surgery is hospital—using,

a   larger   SURC* is expected to be associated with a greater admission rate.

Surgical     and non—surgical hospital treatment are less expensive to the
patient, the greater the extent of insurance coverage.




             Insurance (HSB/C) and surgeons (SURG*) have significant positive
effects      and the insurance—surgeon interaction variable has a significant

negative effect on the admission rate. The number of non—surgical M.D.s

has no effect on hospital admissions. The significant negative slope for

the insurance—surgeon interaction variable says that the effect on the

admission rate of an extra surgeon:per thousand population is smaller

the greater the amount of insurance. That is, the more insurance benefits

the SMSA receivcs the greater the amount of hospitalization; but this

incremental effect is sma1le the larger the number of surgeons per capita.

Thisnegative effect is contrary to our expectations. The effect on admissions

of the number of surgeons is positive at the mean level of insurance)'

                There are two possible interpretations of the nonwhite effect.

First, since nonwhites are on the average poorer than whites, for two

           While   it may be appropriate for a short—run model to view the
bed rate as exogenou5 this is clearly not correct for a long—run model.
Economic theory predicts that in the long run the bedrte is a positive

function of the admission rate. Using the observed bed rate rather than

the predicted bed rate biases the effect of beds on the admission rate.

           Table iii—/ presents the estimated admission rate equation for

the long—run model using the predicted bed rate and without the occupancy

on the admission rate. A one bed per thousand increase in the bed rate


41The interpretation of the statistical significance and            direction   of effects

of the other (exogenous) variables is the same as in Table iii—3, except that

percent nonwhite becomes statistically insignificant.

mean more patients (admissions) will occupy the beds. Since the elasticity

is less than unity,           the occupancy rate decreases, or the length of stay

increases             in response to an increase in the bed rate not due to

an increase in admissions.

the bed rate on the admission rate)-



-J'Recall from Part2 of this chapter that the elasticity of admissions

with respect to beds was 0.41 in the long run model.


            The model of the randomness of demand for hospital admissions

predicts positive partial effects on tha bed rate of our measure of

population size,V , and pur measure of the number of hospitals,
             In spite of the significance of these variables for explaining

SMSA differences in occupancy rates, they play no role in determinthg the

bed rate.

            The randomness model of admissions also hypothesizes that the

number of beds in a community is a function of the probability that patients

will have to be granted a delayed or denied admission. The greater the

cost of a de1ayed'admissionthe greater the demand for beds, ceteris paribus.

            The cost of a delayed admission is greater, the more important are

emergencies in the SMSA'S health picture. An emergency variable (Emerg*),.

measured as the death rate from        "emergency" causes per thousand population,

is included in the bed rate equation.-' It has a significant positive effect

       The three explanatory variables for administrative control

(the proportion of beds in federal, state and local, and proprietary

hospitals) would have insignificant effects on the bed rate if beds

in these hospitals were perfect substitutes for beds in voluntary hospi-

tals. Explicit barriers to admission or imperfect referral systems would

result in positive effects. The effects are insignificant for state and

local and    proprietary hospitals,    but positive and highly significant for

federal hospitals. This presumably reflects the required veteran status

for entry into federal hospitals.1 A one percentage point increase in

        the bed rate. Recall, however, that SMSAs with more nonwhites have higher

        admission rates and occupancy rates. The higher occupancy rate in SMSAs with

        more nonwhites (holding the admission rate and bed rate èonstant) appears

        to be due to a longer length of stay of nonwhites. The two remaining

        variables, the rate of growth of the population and the area of the SMSAJ

        appear to play no role in explaining SMSA differences in the bed rate.

    systematically across SMSAs. The (predicted) hospital admission rate,

    the importance of emergencies in the SMSA's case.mix and the proportion

•   of beds in federal hospitals are the most important variables and have

    positive effects on the bed rate. SMSAs which are wealthier or serve

    as medical centers tend to have larger bed rates, but these variables

    are of lesser overall importance.

       Table A-i, The Variables, presents a listing of the variables used

in this study, their symbols, and a code for the source of the data.

Table A—2,   Sources,   has the detailed bibliographic information   on the
sources.     Table A—i also presents the mean, standard deviation and

coefficient of variation for each of the variables for the sample of

192 Standard Metropolitan     Statistical    Areas.

       The empirical analysis. is performed for the samples of 192 and

201 SFISAs. Although the data exist for all 2.01 SMSAs, nine are

excluded to form the smaller sample because of either an excessively

large fraction of beds in     federal hospitals or very long    computed

lengths    of stay.1 Either   variable suggests the presence of long term

care   facilities in the data.

     Data on hospital and surgical insurance coverage per capita or per
household do   not exist on an SMSA     basis.   State data are used to predict

the   SMSA insurance variable. The insurance variable is "total hospital
and surgical insurance benefits" in the state divided by the population
of   the state (HSB/C). States without SMSAs and       across   which there

is considerable commutation are exOluded from the state regression.

This leaves a sample of 41 states. The equation used to predict

SI4SA values for HSB/C is an inter—state weighted regression (see

Table A—3          -
                       and   is the   "best" equation obtained after experi-

roenting   with the data. The explanatory variables are the percent of
the state's labor force employed, (a) by local governments, (b) by
the   federal government, Cc) in manufacturing and (d)in white collar

jobs. The coefficient of determination adjusted for degrees of free-
