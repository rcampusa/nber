Is the Supply of Charitable Donations Fixed? Evidence from Deadly Tornadoes

                                         ABSTRACT

Do new societal needs increase charitable giving or simply reallocate a fixed supply of
donations? We study this question using IRS datasets and the natural experiment of
deadly tornadoes. Among ZIP Codes located more than 20 miles away from a tornado's path,
donations by households increase by over $1 million per tornado fatality. We find no negative
effects on charities located in these ZIP Codes, with a bootstrapped confidence interval
that rejects substitution rates above 16 percent. The results imply that giving to one cause need
not come at the expense of another.

1      Introduction

Charitable donations are an important source of funding for many public goods. For
example, U.S. charitable giving makes up about 2 percent of GDP (List, 2011). Devolved
funding responsibility creates costly competition for such funds, though, prompting many
to ask whether charitable solicitations increase total giving or simply displace donations
that would have gone to other causes. Indeed, the ratio of charitable donations to income
has been fairly constant over time (Andreoni and Payne, 2013) and across income cate-
gories (Meer and Priday, 2020), and many laboratory experiments find that incentives to
donate to one of a set of charities reduces giving to the others.1 However, there are no
estimates of such displacement effects that identify causal effects among a broad set of
causes and a large share of annual donations.
     We estimate whether exogenous increases in demand for donations created by fatal
tornadoes--which vary over both space and time but are generally limited in their ge-
ographic scope--reduce other donations. Using ZIP-Code-level individual income tax
data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which include all income tax deductions
claimed for donations to any registered charity, we find that lethal tornadoes significantly
increase total charitable donations by individuals. In particular, conditional on a host of
fixed effects, a tornado fatality increases total donations by more than $1 million from in-
dividuals living in ZIP Codes located 20­100 miles away from a tornado's path. Because
total giving increases, we can rule out perfect substitution between charitable causes and
conclude that the supply of donations is not fixed.
     We then test whether some donations made by donors in the areas surrounding a
tornado's path come at the expense of these donors' local charities. To do so, we use
data from information returns that charities file annually with the IRS. We show that
contributions received by charities within 20 miles of a tornado's path increase by more

than $1 million. We then turn to our main question by testing for negative displacement
effects on charities located more than 20 miles away. We find no statistically significant
effects. The lack of effects cannot be attributed to insufficient precision, as we demonstrate
by bootstrapping the ratio of the effects on local charities to the effects on total donations.
The 95-percent confidence interval from our bootstrapping exercise rules out substitution
from other charities in excess of 16 percent of the transfer to tornado victims. Finally, we
use machine-learning methods to estimate treatment-effect heterogeneity among donors'
local charities. We find no predictable negative effects on any particular types of charities.
    Our study contributes to an active debate on the extent to which individuals substitute
donations to one charity for donations to another.2 In theory, increases in the number
of charities or in the number of people served by a charity have ambiguously signed
effects on donations (Rose-Ackerman, 1982, 1987). The supply of donations could also be
completely fixed if giving exhibits "mental accounting" (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981;
Kahneman and Tversky, 1984; Thaler, 1985, 1999). Field-study findings differ regarding
whether intertemporal displacement does (Landry et al., 2010)) or does not occur (Landry
et al., 2010; Bekkers, 2015)) and whether displacement between causes does (Chatterjee et
al., 2020) or does not occur (Meer, 2017).3 In a review of this literature, Gee and Meer
(2019) conclude that "the evidence is decidedly mixed on whether the altruism budget is
fixed or flexible."
    Our paper addresses the question of substitution in giving with an unparalleled com-
bination of strong internal validity and broad coverage of donors and causes.4 Studies of
   2 Research has also provided highly credible experimental evidence about factors that increase charitable

giving to a particular cause. Prominent examples include (List and Lucking-Reiley, 2002; Landry et al., 2006;
Karlan and List, 2007; Shang and Croson, 2009; Huck and Rasul, 2011; DellaVigna et al., 2012; Garbarino et
al., 2013; Huck et al., 2015; and Andreoni et al., 2017.
    3 Petrova et al. (2020) find substitution between political giving and charitable giving, and Lacetera et al.

(2012) find that incentives to give blood in one location reduce giving in other locations. Adena and Hager
(2020) find marginally significant displacement between related causes.
    4 Our use of individual income tax data follows the literature on the tax-price elasticity of charitable

giving (Randolph, 1995; Auten et al., 2002; Bakija et al., 2003; Bakija and Heim, 2011). Our use of the
information returns that nonprofit organizations file with the government follows studies estimating the
effects of government grants on charities' fundraising efforts (Andreoni and Payne, 2003, 2011).



                                                       3
giving to international disasters (e.g. Brown and Minty, 2008; Scharf et al., 2017) have nec-
essarily relied on time-series variation because there is no untreated control group at any
point in time, whereas the local nature of tornadoes allows us to define treatment and
control groups and estimate relative changes among the treated. Experimental studies
provide strong internal validity but have estimated substitution patterns only between a
small set of charities. Experimental estimates may also not generalize if patterns of do-
nating from an experimental endowment differ from patterns of donations from general
income (Cherry et al., 2002; Reinstein and Riener, 2012; Carlsson et al., 2013; Drouvelis
et al., 2019) or if subjects are induced to adjust the donations they make outside of the
experiment. In contrast, we observe donations to the full spectrum of causes, allowing us
to detect a wide variety of substitution patterns, if they exist. Our paper is the first to em-
ploy datasets that contain the majority of dollars donated across the U.S. and the first to
identify effects using a natural experiment with both geographic and temporal variation.
   We also contribute to the empirical literature on financial assistance in the aftermath
of natural disasters. Charitable giving for natural disasters is common, with a nation-
ally representative survey indicating that about 30 percent of U.S. households made such
donations in each of 2017 and 2018 (Bergdoll et al., 2019). Nearly 80 percent of these
households claim that their disaster giving did not affect their giving to other causes,
but survey respondents may be reluctant to admit that they reduced charitable giving
to other causes. Yet much of the literature focuses on the determinants of domestic or
foreign disaster aid (e.g. Besley and Burgess, 2002; Garrett and Sobel, 2003; Drury et al.,
                      ¨
2005; Eisensee and Stromberg,          ¨
                              2007; Stromberg, 2007; Healy and Malhotra, 2009; Cole et
al., 2012; Deryugina and Kirwan, 2018). To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the
first to quantify the charitable response to tornadoes and the first to quantify donations
for any type of disaster using administrative data.5
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe our data. In
  5 Fong   and Luttmer (2009) study donations to victims of Hurricane Katrina in an experimental setting.

Section 3 we lay out our empirical strategy for estimating the effects of tornadoes near
the locations in which they strike and in locations that are further away. In Section 4 we
report our results. We conclude in Section 5.



2     Data

2.1     Tornadoes

Tornadoes are rotating columns of air that form during strong thunderstorms. Winds can
reach up to 300 miles per hour, causing catastrophic damage to structures with which
a tornado comes in contact. Tornadoes are common in the U.S., but most are local and
short-lived, have much weaker winds, and do not harm people or buildings. While the
majority of tornadoes affect regions of the South and Midwest known as "Tornado Alley,"
tornadoes have been observed in every U.S. state.
    Our data on tornadoes come from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
tration's (NOAA) Tornado Database, which tracks the path of every known tornado since
1950.6 In addition to providing the starting and ending coordinates of each tornado along
with the date and time when it occurred, the database contains the number of reported fa-
talities and injuries for each tornado. We use the number of fatalities to identify tornadoes
that are likely to generate a charitable giving response.7
    Figure 1 displays the paths of every tornado that formed in 2002­2017 and caused
at least one fatality. It also displays the total number of fatalities by state. Three key
patterns emerge. First, fatal tornado strikes are concentrated in the Midwest and the
South. Second, deadly tornadoes have struck across a wide range of most of the states in
which they have occurred. Third, tornadoes are local events, with even the most lethal
    6 Available   from http://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/#data.
    7 The database also provides estimates of damage, but these are very imprecise and are thus much noisier

measures of severity than fatalities. For example, uncertain damage is recorded as zero damage and there is
no way to distinguish it from true zeroes. While injuries may also indicate severity, no distinction is made
between minor and major injuries, making them less comparable to each other than fatalities.

tornado casualties occur throughout the year but are most prevalent in April and May.8

2.2    Income tax data on charitable donations to all causes

Annual data on charitable donations come from the IRS.9 The data are based on indi-
vidual income tax returns, including all Forms 1040, 1040A, and 1040EZ. They report
deductions claimed for charitable donations in 2002 and in 2004­2017. Returns are com-
piled by filing year, providing totals based mostly on the preceding tax year but including
some late returns for the previous tax year. Data are aggregated by the ZIP Code listed
   8 Scharfet al. (2017) find that natural disasters have short-run time-shifting effects on donations to other
charities but find no net effect over a 20-week period. That most deadly tornadoes occur in first half of the
year therefore suggests that our estimates using annual data should capture full net effects.

on the return, which is usually the ZIP Code of the taxpayer's home address but could
alternatively be the address of a lawyer, accountant, or place of business.
   The IRS has taken varying steps to avoid disclosure of information about individual
taxpayers. ZIP Codes with fewer than a threshold number of returns (ten returns in most
years) were excluded. We restrict our sample in all years to satisfy the most stringent
threshold of at least 250 returns.
   The main variable of interest is the total amount of charitable contributions claimed
for tax deductions. We also make use of the number of tax returns that include such
deductions, the total number of returns, and total Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). Because
IRS disclosure rules prevent us from distinguishing true zeroes in the data from censored
values, we restrict the sample to ZIP Codes for which charitable contributions are always
strictly positive.



2.3       IRS Form 990 data on receipts of charities

The data for charities have been collected by the IRS using Form 990, the annual infor-
mation return that most charities are required to file.10 Data are available for the years
1998­2016, but we drop years prior to 2002 for comparability with the individual income
tax data. Our main variable of interest is contributions, which is the sum of donations
from individuals, gifts, and grants.
   These data are known to contain many duplicates. Therefore, we keep only one entry
when we find matches on the Employer Identification Number (EIN) and fiscal year that
also match on any of assets, contributions, expenses, or gross receipts. Whenever the
financial variables disagree in such cases, we keep the entry from the most recent data
file. We also address location discrepancies that are likely to be errors. If a charity's ZIP
Code in year t - 1 matches that in year t + 1 but not in year t, we replace the ZIP Code
in period t so that it is consistent over time. We then replace the ZIP Code with our time-

invariant "super-ZIP", which we discuss below. Finally, we replace the reported state
with the state to which the super-ZIP belongs using the 2010 Esri ZIP Code centroids file.
    We also address likely reporting errors. First, we drop observations with reported
gross receipts (i.e. contributions) that are zero or negative. We also determine each or-
ganization's maximum absolute-value year-over-year change in log contributions, and
we drop the one percent of organizations that exhibit the largest changes. This step ad-
dresses reporting errors such as reporting in thousands of dollars instead of dollars or
writing values on the wrong line of the form.
    Because the fiscal cycles of public charities do not always overlap with calendar years,
we match the tornado data to each charity's fiscal cycle by month and ZIP Code and then
aggregate to the annual level using the year in which the fiscal year ends.



2.4    ZIP Codes

Our geographic unit of analysis is a ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA). ZCTAs are a
trademark of the U.S. Census Bureau and provide a spatial representation of the mailing
areas covered by ZIP Codes.11 Hereafter, we simply refer to ZCTAs as ZIP Codes. For the
latitudes and longitudes of their locations, we use the 2010 Esri ZIP Code centroids file,
which corresponds to the median year in our donations data.
    We use data from the U.S. Postal Service to account for changes in the coverage of ZIP
Codes over time. Each month, the USPS produces a Postal Bulletin that includes a table
of changes to ZIP Code delivery areas.12 The most common changes are creations of new
ZIP Codes for part of an area previously covered by another ZIP Code and elimination
of ZIP Codes when a post office is closed. Each change reports two ZIP Codes, which
we combine with each other and with all other ZIP Codes to which they are connected
  11 For     details,      see      https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-
areas/zctas.html.

through one or more changes, to create a set of time-invariant "super-ZIPs." We aggregate
our other datasets to the super-ZIP level by summing all financial variables over the ZIP
Codes included in the super-ZIP. For the latitude and longitude of a super-ZIP we take
the average of the values of the included ZIP Codes, a simplification that suffices for our
designs, which do not require that we distinguish between distances of less than 10 miles.
Hereafter, we simply refer to these super-ZIPs as ZIP Codes.
    We calculate the distance between ZIP Codes and tornadoes using latitude and lon-
gitude. These coordinates are available for both the start point and end point of each
tornado. We therefore calculate the shortest distance, in miles, between each ZIP Code
and the line segment connecting the starting and ending points of the tornado.13 This
will create some degree of mismeasurement because tornadoes do not necessarily travel
in straight lines, but our design does not depend on finely measured distances. Similarly,
we do not know the exact locations of fatalities, but we can sum all fatalities caused by
tornadoes that passed within a range of distances, such as between 10 and 20 miles from
a given ZIP Code.14



2.5    Summary statistics

Table 1 provides summary statistics for each of our main datasets. Panel A displays statis-
tics for deadly tornadoes in the United States that occurred between 2002 and 2017. On
average, a fatal tornado injured 34 people and caused property damage of almost 1.2
million dollars. Tornado severity varies considerably; the worst tornado in our sample
period killed 158 people, but the median lethal tornado killed two people.
    Panel B of Table 1 shows summary statistics for the individual income tax data at the
ZIP-Code-year level. Each observation includes at least 250 tax returns, reflecting the
  13 More   precisely, we create 1,000 points between the start and end points of the tornado and use the
minimum of the distances between these points and a ZIP Code centroid.
  14 Fatalities are reported at the tornado level. If a tornado affects multiple states, we divide fatalities

equally among the affected states (usually two). In some cases, this yields fractional fatalities.

ber of returns with charitable donations was roughly one quarter of the total number of
returns.15 On a per-return basis, charitable donations average about $1,000, or roughly 2
percent of the average income of $55,000, consistent with the common finding that chari-
table giving accounts for 2 percent of income in the U.S. (e.g. Andreoni and Payne 2013).
On average, there are about 1.3 fatalities caused by tornadoes that struck within 100 miles
of ZIP Codes for which we have income tax data and another 1.3 caused by tornadoes
that struck other parts of the state that are at least 100 miles away.
     Panel C of Table 1 displays summary statistics for charity-year observations. Contri-
butions exceed $1 million on average but are closer to $100,000 at the median. Total rev-
enues, which include contributions, are several times larger than contributions and are
highly variable across observations. Expenses are roughly 70 to 80 percent of revenues.
The mean values of the tornado variables are slightly smaller than the means displayed
in Panel B, indicating that the average charity is located in an area near somewhat fewer
serious tornadoes than the average taxpayer, though they also experience an average of
one fatality per year caused by tornadoes passing within 100 miles.



3      Empirical strategy

3.1     Conceptual framework

The IRS collects data on the amount of charitable donations but not the causes to which
households give. This makes it impossible to test how tornadoes affect giving from par-
ticular households to particular causes. For areas that are not themselves struck by tor-
nadoes, though, the two IRS datasets described above allow us to recover the share of
tornado-related donations that would have been made to other causes if not for a deadly
    15 Whether   a return claims any charitable deductions was not reported in 2008.




                                                       11
tornado.16
    Consider individuals in location j. Denote by Fj the number of tornado fatalities oc-
curring within a distance band of that location, such as 20­100 miles. Individuals in j give
an amount      j       Fj to local charities in or near j and give n j Fj to national charities and
charities in the locations of tornado victims. Denote the effects of one additional tornado
fatality as        j   :=   j   Fj + 1 -           j   Fj and   n j := n j Fj + 1 - n j Fj .
    In the income-tax data, we observe donations from households in j to all causes, al-
lowing us to estimate              j   +          n j . In the information returns filed by charities, we observe
donations to charities located in j, which will include                     j   Fj and possibly donations from
individuals in other locations k = j. We assume that if location j is far enough from a
tornado such that its local charities are plausibly not involved in relief efforts, then the
tornado does not increase donations of individuals in k to charities that are local to j.
Displacement effects of tornadoes are therefore less than or equal to                               j,   which can be
estimated using changes in donations received by charities in location j. The ratio of the
change in receipts of these charities to the change in donations on individual tax returns
                                       j                                                 j
yields an estimate of                      nj ,   which is easily transformed into      nj ,   the (negative of the)
                                  j+

share of dollars going to support tornado victims that otherwise would have been given
to local charities.
    While our research design improves on those used in prior studies, in which subjects
can often choose between only a limited number of charities, it does have some limita-
tions. Regarding the income tax data, the primary limitation is that not all donations are
claimed for tax deductions, primarily because not all individuals itemize their deduc-
tions. Income tax data will therefore likely underestimate the total change in individual
donations in response to tornadoes, making our estimate of the substitution ratio an up-
  16 We focus on areas that are not themselves struck by tornadoes because charitable-giving responses in
directly affected areas are difficult to predict. For example, tornadoes may have negative income effects in
areas where they strike and/or generate a large in-kind giving response, which we cannot measure with
our data.




                                                                12
per bound.17 We acknowledge several caveats for working with the charity data. First,
our estimates will be biased against finding displacement if organizations located more
than 20 miles from a tornado serve its victims. While we think this is unlikely to be the
case for relatively small charities, we also test for this issue by dropping larger organiza-
tions that may operate in multiple locations and by testing for heterogeneity by charity
type. Second, our spatial design will not capture any negative effects on national orga-
nizations that are not serving tornado victims. Similarly, while donations to religious
congregations can be deducted and so should appear in the income tax data, congrega-
tions are not required to file information returns. Even if there are displacement effects on
either of these types of organizations that differ from those we can measure, our design
still provides unbiased estimates of the displacement effect for local charities. Third, a
portion of the literature has examined substitution between donating and volunteering
(e.g. Brown et al. 2019), and we do not capture volunteering or informal giving that does
not pass through charitable organizations. However, we expect that volunteering for and
informal giving to tornado victims living more than 20 miles away is limited.


3.2    Estimation approach

Even for locations in "tornado alley," tornadoes are unpredictable (Simon, 2019). Based
on this unpredictability, our identification assumption is that, conditional on location and
time fixed effects, the number of fatalities caused by tornadoes is unrelated to other de-
terminants of charitable giving. To estimate the effects of tornadoes on charitable giving,
we estimate the following equation:




                                                        b
                      asinh(dit ) =   asinh( f atalitiesit ) + X it + i + t +  it .                  (1)
  17 Alternatively,
                we might overestimate the total charitable response by individuals if tornadoes cause in-
dividuals who would have given but not claimed deductions to start claiming deductions. Appendix Table
A.1 shows, however, that we do not find significant effects on the number of returns claiming charitable
deductions.

                                                     13
In this equation, t is the year, and the unit of observation i is a ZIP Code when using the
income tax data and a charity when using the charity data. The outcome is asinh(dit ), the
inverse hyperbolic sine (asinh) of charitable donations for unit i in year t. The variable of
                              b ), the inverse hyperbolic sine of fatalities caused by tornadoes
interest is asinh( f atalitiesit
that struck within a band of distances indexed by b.
    The variation in tornadoes would not be plausibly random if we did not estimate
effects within a location. Equation (1) therefore includes controls for unit and year fixed
effects, i and t , respectively. Time-varying controls X it improve the precision of our
estimates. We include 3-digit-ZIP time trends in all regressions. When using the charity
data, we control for EIN-by-ZIP Code fixed effects. When using the income tax data, we
control for cubic functions of the number of tax returns and total AGI, both of which we
show to be unaffected by tornadoes (Appendix Table A.2). We also control for year fixed
effects for each ventile of AGI.18
    Donors may have greater affinity for victims in their own states. To allow for this, we
use three measures of f atalitiesit : Fatalities caused by tornadoes that struck (a) 20­100
miles away, (b) 20-100 miles away and within the same state, and (c) 20+ miles away and
within the same state. Throughout, we report standard errors that are clustered at the
state level.

4.1    Donations made to all causes

The results reported in Table 2 show that deadly tornadoes significantly increase total do-
nations to all causes. Our first measure is the number of fatalities caused by tornadoes
that struck within 20­100 miles of donors' ZIP Codes (columns 1­2). We obtain a larger es-

cases of ties.

timate and a larger t-statistic when estimating the effects of only the tornadoes that struck
within a donors' own state (columns 3­4), suggesting heightened affinity or media expo-
sure. The point estimate is smaller for fatalities caused by tornadoes that struck at least
20 miles away but within the same state (columns 5­6)--consistent with a response that
declines as distance increases--but this measure also produces a large t-statistic. Results
reported in even-numbered columns show that controlling for tornado fatalities within
20 miles has little effect on our estimates and does not reduce the AIC.
    The coefficients from the asinh-asinh specification can be interpreted as approximate
elasticities, where elasticities evaluated at mean values would be somewhat smaller than
the estimates because the regressor has a smaller mean than the regressand (Bellemare
and Wichman, forthcoming). Thus, a one percent increase in fatalities increases dona-
tions by up to 0.003 percent, depending on the measure of fatalities. Elasticities are small
because we are studying changes in giving to all types of organizations, most of which


                                                    15
do not serve tornado victims.
   To provide a clearer measure of the size of the response, we perform a calculation to
convert our estimates into an average dollar value per tornado fatality. To do so, we use
the estimate to determine the predicted change in contributions if each of the fatal torna-
does in the sample were to have caused one additional fatality. This procedure accounts
for the fact that deadly tornadoes are not evenly distributed across the country and that
ZIP Code exposure may be correlated with ZIP Code mean annual charitable donations.
We average the effects of these counterfactual tornadoes to obtain a per-fatality estimate
and include these dollar-valued effects (along with standard errors calculated using the
delta method) at the bottom of Table 2.
   We find that the charitable response to deadly tornadoes is sizeable. Each fatality
increases donations from ZIP Codes that are 20­100 miles away by roughly $1 million.
If we include the entire state that was struck, as in column (3) of the table, we find that
the response is nearly $2 million dollars. For context, each tornado fatality in our sample
is associated with roughly 8.2 injuries and reported property damage of $18.5 million.
We can also benchmark the estimated charitable response against the amount of federal
disaster aid received for tornado-related disasters in the years 2004­2017.19 Dividing the
total state-year disaster aid by the corresponding number of fatalities, we obtain a mean
amount of aid of $13.3 million per fatality and a median of $2.98 million per fatality (2008
dollars).
   Appendix tables present additional robustness tests of our analysis with the income
tax data. The results of a placebo test reported in Appendix Table A.3 show no evidence of
any effects of the lead of the fatalities measures. As can be seen in Appendix Table A.4, the
results are not affected by restricting the sample period to years prior to 2017, for which
we have data from charitable organizations. Because giving to tornado victims may affect
future giving, which could affect our estimates of concurrent effects, we test whether lags
  19 These   data were obtained from https://www.fema.gov/disasters.



                                                  16
of the tornado severity variable are themselves significant or alter our estimates of the
contemporaneous effect. The results reported in Appendix Table A.5 show that tornadoes
have persistent effects in areas within 20 miles, but estimates for greater distances are not
statistically significant.
   Without any further evidence, we can conclude that deadly tornadoes increase giv-
ing and do not merely divert it from other causes. If individuals merely shifted money
between charities, then we would find no effects on the total amount donated. The signif-
icant effects on total giving in the income tax data therefore bound the substitution rate
below one. To estimate whether any substitution between causes occurs, we now turn to
the data for contributions received by charities.



4.2   Contributions received by charities

In this section, we estimate equation (1) using the charity data. We do so first for charities
that are local to a disaster site to confirm that charitable responses can be detected with
the charities dataset. We then test for negative effects on charities that are located further
away, in locations in which we observed an increase in donations in the income tax data.
   In Table 3 we report the estimated effects on charities near a tornado site. We find
significant positive effects on charities located within 10 miles of a tornado. The estimate
for charities located 10­20 miles away is also positive but is not significant, and it does
not lower the AIC. We find this same pattern whether we consider all tornadoes (columns
1­2) or simply those that struck within the state where a charity is located (columns 3­4).
The results indicate that most of the charities whose contributions increase are located
within 10 miles of a tornado, but to be conservative in our subsequent analysis of more
distant areas, we restrict our attention to distances of at least 20 miles, as we did with the
income tax data.
   Calculating dollar-value effects as we did with the income tax data, we find that, on
average, an additional fatality increases donations to local charities by $1.2 million. The

magnitude of this effect is comparable to what we find in the individual income tax data,
corroborating our earlier finding.20
    Having estimated an increase in contributions to charities near a tornado, we turn to
our main question regarding the degree to which contributions decrease among chari-
ties located further away from a tornado. Our estimates appear in Table 4. For each of
the measures of severe tornadoes that predicted a significant charitable response in the in-
come tax data, we find that effects on donors' local charities are insignificant and the point
estimates are positive rather than negative. Thus, it does not appear that these charities
lose out to those serving tornado victims.
    The results reported in Appendix Table A.6 show that our results are similar when we
drop observations from 2003, for which charitable giving is not reported in the income
tax data. For another robustness check, we drop larger charities that are more likely to
serve individuals outside of their own areas. Appendix Table A.7 shows that the results
are consistent across samples restricted by size.
    We also test for heterogeneous treatment effects to see whether some charities are neg-
atively affected. First, we interact our tornado variables with dummy variables for charity
missions, as categorized by the National Taxonomy of Exempt Organizations (Appendix
Table A.8). If mission similarity were to make charities closer substitutes, we might find
negative effects on charities in the "Human Services" or "Public Safety, Disaster Prepared-
ness Relief" categories. We find no negative effects in these categories. Second, we con-
duct a more general test of heterogeneous treatment effects using machine learning, fol-
lowing Chernozhukov et al. (2018). We allow treatment effects to vary across charity mis-
sions or size and across ZIP Code demographics. Details and results appear in Appendix
B. We find no evidence of predictable heterogeneity.
  20 We would not necessarily expect the two effects to be the same because the income tax estimate includes

donations to national organizations, and the estimate for charities includes local donations and may include
grants from foundations or governments.

4.3    Substitution ratio

We find no significant negative effects of deadly tornadoes on charities in surrounding
areas, but this statistical zero could reflect a lack of statistical precision rather than a true
lack of substitution. We address this concern by bootstrapping and subsequently exam-
ining the distribution of the ratio of the effects in the charity data relative to that in the
income tax data.
    Because of likely spatial correlation in the receipts of charities and the donations of
nearby individuals, we use a cluster bootstrap approach. That is, we draw with replace-
ment from the 49 contiguous "states" (including Washington, D.C.) and include all obser-
vations in each dataset and all years for these states. We estimate the effects of tornadoes
in each dataset using a specification that includes state time trends, which provide most
of the precision obtainable with 3-digit-ZIP time trends but are less computationally in-
tensive. For our measure of lethality, we use in-state fatalities from tornadoes that struck
20­100 miles away, which is the variable that yielded the most precise results. As before,
we calculate the dollar-value effects of a one-fatality increase in each dataset, for each of

                                                     20
10,000 bootstrap draws. We then divide each estimate of dollar-value effects on charities
by the effect on total donations for the same sample of states.
     Appendix Figure A.2 displays the distribution of bootstrapped donation ratios.21 Our
                                                          jt                             jt         -0.1888
5th-percentile estimate is -0.1888. If                                = -0.1888, then   n jt   =   1+0.1888   = -0.159,
                                                   jt +        n jt

implying that we can rule out substitution between causes that exceeds 16 percent of the
charitable response. Fewer than 12 percent of the estimates are negative. We therefore
conclude that our failure to find displacement effects cannot be attributed to a lack of
statistical power.



5      Conclusion

The social value of charitable giving and the optimal subsidies to donors and charitable
organizations depend on whether increases in giving to one cause come at the expense
of other causes. We use comprehensive annual tax return data to estimate whether tor-
nadoes increase total charitable giving, and we find that each tornado fatality increases
total donations by over $1 million. Therefore, we can rule out that individuals choose a
set amount to donate to charity and then apportion this between charities. Using annual
tax return data from charities, we additionally find that there are no significant negative
effects on charities in the locations from which increased donations to fatal tornadoes
originate. Our results are sufficiently precise to rule out an average displacement effect
that is greater than 16 percent of the total charitable response.
     There is an active debate in research regarding the extent of donor substitution be-
tween charitable causes. Our paper is the first in this literature to employ a natural exper-
iment with both geographic and temporal variation and the first to employ datasets that
contain the majority of dollars donated across the U.S. Our finding that deadly tornadoes
increase charitable giving and do not simply redirect donations from other causes seems
    21 Becausethe goal of this exercise is to assess the precision of our charity data estimate relative to the in-
crease in total giving, we drop 352 draws in which the estimated effects in the income tax data are negative.


                                                               21
likely to generalize to other situations in which new needs arise. Whether displacement
arises in cases where there are no new needs remains a question that would benefit from
further research.

Appendix B: Heterogeneous Effects on Charities
While we find no displacement effect on average, there may be particular types of char-
ities that lose donations as a result of increased donations to tornado victims and their
service providers. To assess the answer to this question, we employ the machine-learning
method proposed by Chernozhukov et al. (2018) (hereafter "CDDF") to estimate hetero-
geneous treatment effects.


Methodology

CDDF propose a method for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in the context of
randomized controlled trials, and this method has been applied to a quasi-experimental
setting by Deryugina et al. (2019). The basic approach is to first train a machine-learning
algorithm to predict the outcome of interest separately for treated and control observa-
tions as a function of covariates. Conditional on these covariates, differences between
the predictions of the treated outcome and the control outcome form a proxy predictor,
which can then be used to characterize the distribution of treatment effects and to com-
pare the characteristics of groups that are affected to a greater extent with those of groups
that are affected to a lesser extent. Any machine-learning algorithm can be used for the
prediction, and we use Lasso Tibshirani (1996). To avoid overfitting, we first randomly
partitioned the data into an auxiliary sample and a main sample. The algorithm is trained
on the auxiliary sample and then applied to the main sample to provide predicted treat-
ment effects, and these can then be compared with the results of regressions using the
main sample. The partitioning of the data into these two samples introduces additional
variation that can be addressed by repeating the entire procedure to obtain confidence
intervals. Following the recommendation of CDDF, we repeated the procedure 100 times.
    Our setting is amenable to the CDDF method with some changes from our main speci-
fication. We restrict the sample to exclude observations within 20 miles of a fatal tornado,
as before, but to speed computation and make the control group more similar in sample
size to the treatment group, we also exclude organizations that are never located within
100 miles of a fatal tornado. Then, because the treatment must be binary, we study an
indicator for having any fatalities caused by tornadoes that struck between 20 and 100
miles away in the same state-year (rather than the number of such fatalities). The results
reported in Appendix Table A.9 show no significant average treatment effects with this
binary variable, just as with our continuous measures, implying that the estimates of the
average treatment effects are robust to the restriction to the subsample of charities that
are ever located within 100 miles of a fatal tornado. This yields 1,391,445 observations, of

                                             37
which 15.1 percent are treated with proximity to a fatal tornado and 84.9 serve as the con-
trol group. As our covariates, we use ventiles of organization size, indicators for the major
NTEE categories describing organizational mission, and the ZIP Code shares of several
demographic groups in the year-2000 decennial Census.22 We include fixed effects for the
state, the year, and the month in which the fiscal year ends.23
    Unlike in a randomized controlled trial, the propensity score in our setting is not
known. We therefore estimate it using Lasso and the same set of predictors used to train
the main machine-learning models. To reduce noise, we omit observations with propen-
sity scores below 0.05 or above 0.95. We then use the main sample to estimate regressions
of the form

asinh(contit ) =  +  1 ( Tit - p
                               ^ ( Zit )) +  2 ( Tit - p                      ¯
                                                                              ^ +  3 asinh(^contit ) +  it . (2)
                                                                  ^ ( Zit ) - S
                                                       ^ ( Zit )) S

As in previous regressions, the outcome asinh(contit ) is the asinh of contributions re-
ceived. In this regression, Tit is the treatment indicator for a fatal tornado striking be-
tween 20 and 100 miles away in a given state, and p          ^ ( Zit ) is the estimated propensity
score denoting the predicted probability of treatment. S         ^ ( Zit ) is a prediction of the treat-
ment effect for an observation, which is obtained by taking the difference between its
predicted outcome using the treatment-trained model and its predicted outcome using
the control-trained model. S ¯
                             ^ is the average value of S     ^ ( Zit ) across the main sample. We
include the control-group prediction, asinh(^contit ), to improve precision. Observations
                                                           1
in this regression are weighted by w ( Zit ) = p^ ( Zit )(1- p^ ( Zit ))
                                                                         . Estimates of the parameter
 1 describe the average treatment effects that we previously estimated with equation (1).
The parameter of interest here is  2 , which provides a joint test of whether there is hetero-
geneity in the treatment effects and whether that heterogeneity is captured by the proxy
predictor S^ ( Zit ).
  22 Organization    size is measured by expenses at the time of an organization's first appearance in the
data. The Census demographic characteristics are White, Black, urban, minor, senior, college degree holder,
foreign born, and aggregate income in 1999 for the population aged 15 years and over, all of which we
scale by year-2000 population. The NTEE categories are Arts, Culture & Humanities; Education; Environ-
ment; Animal-Related; Health Care; Mental Health & Crisis Intervention; Voluntary Health Associations
& Medical Disciplines; Medical Research; Crime & Legal-Related; Employment; Food, Agriculture & Nu-
trition; Housing & Shelter; Public Safety, Disaster Preparedness & Relief; Recreation & Sports; Youth De-
velopment; Human Services; International, Foreign Affairs & National Security; Civil Rights, Social Action
& Advocacy; Community Improvement & Capacity Building; Philanthropy, Voluntarism & Grantmaking
Foundations; Science & Technology; Social Science; Public & Societal Benefit; Religion-Related; Mutual &
Membership Benefit; and Unknown.
   23 Fixed effects for smaller geographic units, as in our regressions in which we estimated average effects,

were not computationally feasible. As seen in Appendix Table A.9, our main regression estimates become
less precise with state fixed effects, but point estimates remain close to zero.

           asinh(contit ) =  +      [q (Tit - p
                                              ^ ( Zit )) · 1q ] +  asinh(^contit ) +  it .               (3)
                                   q =1


This equation reveals the average treatment effects q among each of the groups signified
by the indicator function 1q for observations falling into quantiles q of the proxy predictor
S^ ( Zit ). If there is predictable heterogeneity in the treatment effects, then the treatment ef-
fects q in the main sample should be increasing in q. Such estimates can be obtained for
any partition of the sample. For our question regarding whether some charities are sig-
nificantly negatively affected, we break the distribution up into five equally sized groups,
i.e. quintiles. The rest of the variables and regression weights are as defined in equation
2.


Results

The machine-learning approach shows little evidence of charities that suffer when donors
give to tornado victims. First, we estimate    ^ 2 = 0.147 (with standard error 0.131). This
estimate indicates that a one percent increase in a predicted treatment effect is associated
with an insignificant 0.11 percent increase in an estimated treatment effect. This implies
that if there are heterogeneous effects of deadly tornadoes on contributions to charities
located 20 to 100 miles away, then this heterogeneity is not predictable based on state,
year, charity size, or charity mission.
    Figure B.1 shows the estimates from equation 3 and their confidence intervals. The
estimates are all close to zero, and none is statistically significant. The estimate for the
most negatively affected fifth of organizations is -0.03, implying that a deadly tornado
strike that occurs 20­100 miles away reduces contributions by less than half of one per-
cent.24 The point estimate for the top fifth of organizations is positive and almost as large
in absolute value as the negative estimate for the bottom fifth.
  24 For
       the asinh-linear specification with large values of the outcome variable, evaluating the elasticity at
the sample mean of 0.151 fatal tornadoes yields   -0.03  0.151  -0.0045 .
