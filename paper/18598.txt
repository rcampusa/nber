There has been a resurgence in research that investigates the efficacy of early investments as a means
of reducing gaps in academic performance. However, the strongest evidence for these effects comes
from experimental evaluations of small, highly enriched programs. We add to this literature by assessing
the extent to which a large-scale public program, Texas's targeted pre-Kindergarten (pre-K), affects scores
on math and reading achievement tests, the likelihood of being retained in grade, and the probability
that a student receives special education services. We find that having participated in Texas's targeted pre-
K program is associated with increased scores on the math and reading sections of the Texas Assessment
of Academic Skills (TAAS), reductions in the likelihood of being retained in grade, and reductions
in the probability of receiving special education services. We also find that participating pre-K increases
mathematics scores for students who take the Spanish version of the TAAS tests. These results show
that even modest, public pre-K program implemented at scale can have important effects on students
educational achievement

Introduction
A number of recent papers—for example, Heckman and Masterov (2007)
and Knudsen, Heckman, Cameron, and Shonkoff (2006)—strongly suggest
that early investments in children are an effective means of reducing gaps in
academic performance between disadvantaged children and their more advan-
taged counterparts. The estimates of the impacts obtained from the study
of model programs, such as the Perry Preschool Program or the Carolina
Abcedarian Project, have fueled the interest in the efficacy of early child-
hood investment. Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, and Yavitz (2010) find
that the social returns to the Perry Preschool Project are on the order of 7
to 10 percent, which is greater than the average return to equity and An-
derson (2008) reports that the Abcedarian Project results in a .45 standard
deviation increase for girls on a summary index of outcomes that include IQ,
grade repetition, special ed., high school, college attendance, employment,
earnings, receipt transfers, arrests, convictions, drug use, teen pregnancy
and marriage.
    The characteristics of these model programs—namely, random assign-
ment and the magnitude of resources directed towards the treatment group—
make them particularly amenable to study, but also limit the policy relevance
of the findings. First, while random assignment bolsters internal validity, the
small samples involved hinder the generalizability of the studies. The Perry
Preschool Program and the Carolina Abcedarian projects started with small
samples—123 children and 111 infants, respectively—of disadvantaged chil-
dren in a single location.
    Second, the treatment that the model programs offered are more inten-
sive than the interventions offered by other early intervention programs. The
Carolina Abcedarian project targeted infants with the treated children at-
tending a preschool center for 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, 50 weeks per
year until reaching schooling age, while the treated children from the Perry
Preschool Program attended the program 5 mornings per week from October
through May and received one 90-minute home visit per week. Given budget
constraints, it is highly unlikely that any new public programs will approach
these levels of investment. Relative to the model programs, the most preva-
lent existing early intervention programs—for example, Head Start and state
funded pre-K programs—attempt to treat a broader audience and offer treat-
ments that are not nearly as intense.
    Recent research on the effects of the more moderate early intervention

                                      1
programs have used both a variety of data sources and identification strate-
gies to investigate the effects of these programs on a number of outcomes. A
number of papers use nationally representative data sets—such as the Na-
tional Longitudinal Survey of Youth or the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
Currie and Thomas (1995) use the National Longitudinal Mother-Child sup-
plement and exploit within family differences in Head Start participation to
determine the effects of the program on a variety of outcomes. They find
that Head Start increases test scores among blacks and whites, decreases
the likelihood that a white child will be retained, and increases access to
health services. Garces, Thomas, and Currie (2002) use the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics and exploit within family variation in Head Start Atten-
dance to determine the effects of Head Start participation on a number of
later-life outcomes and find that, relative to the sibling who did not partic-
ipate in Head Start, whites are more likely to complete high school, attend
college, and have higher earnings in their early twenties, while for blacks
the sibling who participated in Head Start is less likely to be charged with
a crime. Deming (2009) uses the the National Longitudinal Mother-Child
Supplement and, like Currie and Thomas (1995) and Garces et al. (2002),
exploits within family difference in Head Start participation to estimate the
effects of Head Start on a summary index of adult outcomes. He finds that
Head Start participation results in a .23 standard deviation increase for the
sibling who participated in Head Start. Puma et al. (2010) use a randomized
control study to examine the effects of Head Start and find that Head Start
participation increased the scores obtained in the first grade on the Peabody
Picture Vocabulary Test for 4-year old participants and increased the scores
on a test of oral comprehension for the 3-year old head start participants.
    Gormley and Gaye (2005) use eligibility based on the date of birth in
a regression discontinuity research design to estimate the effects of Tulsa’s
universal pre-K program. They find that Tulsa’s pre-K program increased
cognitive scores .39 standard deviations, motor skills by .24 standard devia-
tions, and language scores by .38 standard deviations; moreover, the impacts
are largest for Hispanics and blacks with little impact for whites. The chil-
dren who are eligible for free lunch benefit more from pre-K than their more
affluent peers. Fitzpatrick (2008) uses data from the National Assessment
of Educational Progress in a difference-in-differences framework to evaluate
Georgia’s universal pre-K program. Using other states as a counterfactual,
she finds that the availability of universal pre-K increases the math and read-
ing scores at the fourth-grade level and increases the probability of students

                                      2
being on-grade for their age. Gormley and Gaye (2005) and Fitzpatrick
(2008) are the most comparable to the research here as they consider locally
sponsored early intervention programs that are similar to Texas’s targeted
pre-K program.
    Texas began offering pre-K during the 1985–1986 academic year. The
purpose of state-sponsored pre-K in Texas is to bolster the academic per-
formance of at risk children. The risk factors include the following: free
or reduced-price lunch eligibility, limited English proficiency, homelessness
or unstable housing, foster care participation, or parents who are on active
military duty or who have been injured or killed on duty. In 2011, Texas’s
pre-K program provided services for 6 percent of 3-year old children and 52
percent of 4-year old children, a total that exceeds 224,000 children, while
Head start accounted for 8 percent of 3-year old children and 10 percent of
4-year old children (Barnett et al., 2011).
    The Texas program is large and well established, but the program is not
considered high-quality. The National Institute for Early Education Research
(NIEER) ranks state pre-K programs on numerous criteria. The Texas pro-
gram ranks low in terms of class size, staff-to-pupil ratios, and spending per
capita (Barnett et al., 2011). As such, an evaluation of this program’s impact
on student outcomes can provide guidance on whether modest programs, per-
haps the best that can hoped for in the current budgetary environment, are
worth implementing.
    We exploit the growth of the program over time, using differences in the
availability of pre-K within districts over time to help identify the effects of
pre-K on third grade math examinations, third grade reading examinations,
retention in grade, and assignment to special education. If the change in the
districts’ offering of pre-K is unrelated to other factors that influence the out-
comes under consideration, then our estimates have a causal interpretation.
    We add to the literature that considers the effects of locally sponsored
early intervention programs in several ways. First, as our analysis considers
a large number of heterogenous school districts across the state of Texas,
our results are more generalizable than the single-district results obtained
in Gormley and Gaye (2005). Second, our use of a school district before it
provides pre-K as the counterfactual is a more natural comparison relative
to using other states as counterfactuals for Georgia as is done in Fitzpatrick
(2008). Third, while other studies—for example, Gormley and Gaye (2005)
and Currie and Thomas (1999)—analyze the effects of early interventions
on the subset of Hispanic children who are fluent enough in English to be

                                        3
tested in English, we obtain results for both Hispanic children who are facile
enough with English to take the English version of the examination and
Hispanic children who take the Spanish version of the examination. Given
the demographic changes that this country is experiencing, our ability to
examine Hispanics of varying English ability increases the policy relevance
of our research.
    To preview results, we find that having participated in pre-K is associated
with increased scores on the math and reading sections of the third grade
version of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, reductions in the likeli-
hood of being retained, and reductions in the probability of receiving special
education services. We also find that participating in pre-K increases the
math scores for students who take the Spanish version of TAAS.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The second sec-
tion describes the data. We present our empirical methodology in the third
section. The fourth section discusses the results. The fifth section concludes.


Data
The study uses archival administrative data known as the Texas Schools Mi-
crodata Panel (TSMP) that is administered by the Texas Schools Project
(TSP) located at the University of Texas at Dallas. This longitudinal panel
consolidates individual level student data from several state agencies. The
panel encompasses 13 years of individual data for more than 10 million stu-
dents enrolled in Texas public schools between 1990 and 2002. Enrollment,
attendance, test scores and other public school data is available for grades
pre-K–12, along with key student demographics including age, ethnicity, lan-
guage and economic status (TSP 2006).
    Data is linked via encrypted personal identification numbers. This makes
it possible to follow students, as long as they remain enrolled in a public
school in Texas, throughout their academic career. Grade level and campus
can be identified for each student by year; however, student-teacher links
are not included in the data. Several TSMP files were combined to capture
the student and district characteristics employed in the study. The primary
source of data was the enrollment files from 1992–2002 and the TAAS files
(Texas Assessment of Academic Skills) from 1997–2002. This data was ap-
pended with data characterizing the locale of Texas school districts from the
Common Core of Data (CCD), a program of NCES under the auspice of the


                                      4

    Available files allowed for the construction of five cohorts, capturing five
years of treatment in a mature program. Children are not required to attend
pre-K, so the first time we can observe both those who attended the state-
funded pre-K and those who did not is when they attend kindergarten. Thus,
cohorts are defined by the year a student first attended Kindergarten. We
look two years back in the enrollment files to determine if the child was ever
observed in pre-K. We then look forward to find the students’ thrid grade
test scores and information about retention in grade and special education
placement. Data was not available to measure 3rd grade TAAS scores for
both English and Spanish until 1997; therefore, the first cohort we can ob-
serve enrolled in kindergarten in 1994. The TAAS test was not given after
2002, so 1998 is the last available kindergarten cohort.
    Data was not available to control for the educational experiences of the
students who left and then re-enrolled prior to third grade. Therefore, stu-
dents who were not continuously enrolled were excluded from the sample to
limit treatment to Texas public schools. The sample is further limited to
eligible students, since they are the target population for the program. Our
determination of a student’s eligibility for pre-K is based on eligibility for free
and reduced price lunch and limited English proficiency in the kindergarten
year. While it would be better to determine eligibility in the pre-K year, we
do not observe these characteristics in the pre-K year for non-attenders, since
they are not in the data. The degree of measurement error thus introduced is
likely small, especially for limited English proficiency. Five year old children
are not eligible to enroll in state-funded pre-K and if enrolled are considered
ineligible for state funding since the program was specifically established to
serve children under age five (Jones 2004). Based on this guideline, pre-K
students who were five years or older were also excluded from the sample.
    Thus, all students in our sample were eligible for the program, did not
attend pre-K after age 5, did attend kindergarten, remained continuously
enrolled in Texas public schools until the third grade, and took a standard-
ized test that year. The sample includes 682, 749 students, 49 percent of all
students in Texas attending kindergarten in 1994-1998. The large, heteroge-
neous sample reflects the ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic diversity of
the state, unlike the homogenous groups of participants found in studies of
model programs.
    Fifty-seven percent of these eligible students attended state funded pre-
K. Seventy-five percent of these students were economically disadvantaged,

                                        5
and 30 percent had Limited English proficiency, and 5 percent were eligible
for both reasons. The total sample pool is evenly divided across each cohort;
and nearly 60 percent of the sample participated in pre-K as four year old
children, but only 1 percent participated as three year old children.


Methodology
To evaluate the effects of the pre-K, we first compare students who attend
the program with students who did not, controlling for as many covariates
as possible. We examine five cohorts of kindergarten students who are either
LEP, economically disadvantaged, or both – the target population for the
program – from 1994–1998. This period was marked by a substantial growth
in the Pre-K program.
    Our base model for estimating the effect of Pre-K on student achievement
is as follows:


  Yicj = α + βE P K + βL P K ∗ L + βB P K ∗ B + β20 Xijc + γc + γj + εicj             (1)

    Yicj is any outcome variable, such as a score on the reading section for
the Texas Assessment of Academic skill for student i in cohort c from school
district j.1 α is a constant term, Xicj is a vector of individual, school, and
district controls—for example, gender, socioeconomic status, whether the
district is urban or rural, an indicator for whether full-day kindergarten is
offered. Xicj also includes indicators for the reason for program eligbility:
limited English proficiency only (L), or both limited English proficiency and
economic disadvantage (B); eligibiity due to economic disadvantage (E) only
is the reference category. γc is a cohort fixed effect that accounts for differ-
ences in across cohorts. γj is a district fixed effect that controls for fixed
differences across districts. εicj is an idiosyncratic error term.
    P K assumes a value of one if child i in cohort c in district j attended
pre-K and zero otherwise. βE is the difference between the mean score of
eligible students who attended pre-K and those who did not, controlling for
the covariates and fixed effects specified, for students who were eligible for
   1
     The use of a test score is an example to fix ideas. The discussion that follows holds
for other academic outcomes—for example, retention or assignment to special education
status—that this research will explore. In the case of binary outcomes, we use estimate
logistic regressions and linear probability models.

                                            6
the program due to economic disadvantage only. By interacting the pre-K
indicator with the reason for eligibility indicators (L and B), we allow the
pre-K effect to vary by reason for program elibility. βL and βB indicate how
the program effect varies from the reference group by reason for program
eligibility. βE , βE + βL , andβE + βB are estimates of the effect of the program
on those who participated in the program who were eligible due to economic
disadvantage, limited English proficiency, or both, repectively.
    This estimate may be subject to selection bias, however, if there is a
systematic difference between those who enrolled and those who did not for
which we have not controlled. Students are not required to attend pre-K.
Families with eligible children choose to enroll their children in pre-K if that
option is available to them. If families who enroll their children in the tar-
geted pre-K program are systematically different in ways that the researcher
can not observe and these differences are related to academic performance,
then we can not assert that the pre-K program is the reason that the perfor-
mance of participants and non-participants are different.
    To the extent that the enrollment decision is based on whether the pro-
gram is available in the family’s school district, then enrollment is exogenous
to the circumstances of individual children. When the program is available,
then selection bias may occur. It is not possible to know a priori which direc-
tion this selection bias will operate. On the one hand, it is possible that the
parents most interested in their child’s education may seek out the public pro-
gram. On the other hand, families with other potentially better options—a
stay at home mother, a grandmother, private pre-K through a church, etc.—
may opt out. Given that, by design, we have already controlled for economic
disadvantage, LEP status, key individual covariates, cohort effects, and dis-
trict fixed effects, there may be no systematic selection effects. Technically,
as long as the attendance variable P K is uncorrelated with the disturbance
term, the estimate of the program’s effects are unbiased.
    Nevertheless, as test of the robustness of our findings, we estimate a sec-
ond set of models based solely on whether the student lived (in his or her
kindergarten year) in a district that offered the pre-K program.2 What is
required is a source of variation in targeted pre-K enrollment that is orthog-
onal to εicj . We strongly curtail the potential for selection bias by estimating
the Intent To Treat parameter (ITT). The ITT approach ignores take-up of
   2
    Ideally, we would measure this in pre-K year, but we have no data prior to kindergarten
on the location of students who did not attend pre-K.


                                            7
the program and only estimates what happens to children who have been
exposed to targeted pre-K in the sense that the program was available to
them (Bloom, 1984). Thus, the ITT is not biased by selection at the family
level. Consider the following model:

   Yicj = α + βẼ P O + βL̃ P O ∗ L + βB̃ P O ∗ B + β20 Xijc + γc + γj + εicj       (2)
    Yicj , α, Xicj , γc , γj , and εicj retain the definitions given above. P O is
an indicator variable that assumes a value of one if a student is in a district
that offers pre-K. βẼ represents what we can expect to happen to test scores
for economically disadvantaged students if a district offers targeted pre-K
regardless of who takes up the program. It is a weighted average of the effect
of the program on those who enrolled and the effect of the program on those
who did not.3 Similarly, βL̃ and βB̃ are the differences in the effect of offering
the program to those eligible for limited English proficency or both economic
disadvantage and limited English proficiecy, respectively.
    If the assumption that families who reside in a particular district can not
willfully induce districts into offering pre-K holds, then this indicates that,
conditional on Xijc γc , and γj , P O is orthogonal to εicj , which implies that
variation in program offering is exogenous to unmeasured student character-
istics related to the outcome variable. This assumption is reasonable as it
is unlikely that a given family with eligible children is able to intentionally
alter the population of eligible children such that the district is compelled
to provide targeted pre-K. Estimating the ITT models is a way to assess
whether self-selection into the program at the family level has biased the
program effects estimated based on those who selected to participate in the
program.
    As discussed below, the program was growing during the time period
we study. Thus, given this variation in offering and our assumptions, we can
obtain unbiased estimates of βẼ , βL̃ and βB̃ . These are conservative estimates
of the effect of the program as they represent exposure to treatment and
ignores consideration of who complies with the assignment to treatment, or
as is the case here, we avoid having to consider why certain families elect to
enroll their children in pre-K. Policy makers, however, are likely to be more
interested in knowing the effect of targeted pre-K on children who actually
enroll in the program.
   3
    Those who did not enroll may still benefit from the program due to spillover effects
in grades K-3, given that peer effects are well established in the education literature.

                                           8
    In effect, in the ITT model, the between-district and within-district vari-
ation in the availability of targeted pre-K is an instrument for enrolling in
targeted pre-K. That is, these estimates only use the variation in the likeli-
hood of enrolling in pre-K that is correlated with a district providing pre-K.
If the variation in pre-K provision is uncorrelated with εicj , then we obtain
unbiased estimates of the effect of the program at the expense of the lack of
precision introduced by ignoring the information on actual program partici-
pation. While unbiased, the ITT estimator is obviously less precise then the
estimator based on actual program participation, and provides a weighted
average of the effect for those who attend with those who did not.
    Our estimated program effects, whether based on program participation
or the offer of the program, should be understood in the context of the
other options avialable to families. With our data, we can determine if a
student was exposed to targeted pre-K and if a child participated in targeted
pre-K. A value of zero for P K, does not mean that the child received no
early intervention. There are three possibilities that lead to P K = 0: 1)
the child stays in the home and does not participate in any sort of early
intervention; 2) the child participates in a private pre-K, which includes, for
example, church-based care or informal care by neighbors; and 3) the child
participates in another public option—such as, Head Start. Absent Texas’s
targeted pre-K, these are the counterfactual states for an eligible child, as
these states represent what the child would have done had there been no
targeted pre-K.
    The introduction of targeted pre-K in Texas results in the crowding out
of students from these alternative states. Conceptually, there is an implicit,
unobserved treatment effect for going from no intervention to targeted pre-
K, a treatment effect for going from private pre-K to targeted pre-K, and a
treatment effect for going from Head Start to the targeted pre-K. As we don’t
observe these three states, the program effects estimated here are weighted
averages of the three aforementioned effects where the weights are the per-
centages of the children that would be in each of the three unobservable
states absent the newly available public option. This means that we can
potentially find any result depending on whether targeted pre-K is of higher
or lower quality than the other options. Still, the program effects estimate
here are policy relevant parameters as they gives you the effectiveness of in-
troducing another option given the existing alternatives available to parents.
Careful consideration of ”crowd out” offers a more nuanced understanding
of the sources of variation that produce the parameters that we estimate.

                                      9
Results and Discussion
Table 1 presents evidence of the variation that we exploit to identify the
effects of targeted pre-k on academic outcomes. During the time period that
we consider, the number of districts in Texas that offered targeted pre-K grew
from 688 districts to 784 districts and the number of campuses—i.e. school
buildings that housed a pre-K program—grew from 1,944 to 2,287. When a
district offers pre-K in any school, students from the whole district are eligible
to attend. To the extent that the enrollment decision is based on whether
the program is available in the family’s school district, then enrollment is
exogenous to the circumstances of individual children. When the program is
available, selection bias may occur. However, a non-trivial proportion of the
variance in program participation is due simply to whether the program was
offered in a given district in a given year.
    Table 2 presents the regression results for the English language version of
the 3rd grade TAAS Reading and Math tests. The key variable is P K which
indicates that the student attended the public pre-K program. The reference
case consists of students who did not attend the program, which includes
those who stayed at home with relatives, informal care arrangements, Head
Start, and private child care programs.
    For the 3rd grade TAAS reading test, the OLS model reveals a statisti-
cally significant effect of 0.0552 for public pre-K attendance for those with
economic disadvantage only. In other words, economically disadvantaged
students who participated in public pre-K scored about 0.06 standard de-
viations higher on their third grade reading test than students who did not
attend the program. For students whose reason for eligibility was limited En-
glish proficiency only, the effect is 0.0874 (obtained by adding the base level
effect and the coefficient of the appropriate interaction term); the difference
in the effect sizes for the two groups, 0.0295, is statistically significant. The
largest effect size was experienced by students eligible for the program due to
both economic disadvantage and limited English proficiency, 0.1107; again,
the difference in the size of the effect compared to students with economic
disadvantage only was significant.
    A rule of thumb in education research is that one tenth of a standard
deviation is considered a large effect. Thus, these effect sizes are substantively
meaningful, particularly for an intervention that occurred four years prior to
the outcome measure. The fact that the program’s effect was largest for
the students with two forms of disadvantage is also an encouraging result.

                                       10
While these effects are smaller than those reported for model programs and
resource-intensive programs, they indicate that even a modest program can
help to boost student achievement.
    Other covariates, included in the models but not shown in Table 2, serve
as controls. These include indicator variables for race and gender, whether
the student changed districts at any time, whether their kindergarten was
full day, whether the student’s district was rural or suburban, and a set of
dummies identifying the students cohort year. The results are generally in
line with expectations. The full model results are not shown, but are available
from the corresponding author upon request.
    Districts vary enormously in terms of their resources, institutional ar-
rangements, demographics, and neighborhood characteristics. Many of these
district level variables could affect the achievement of third graders and could
also be related to whether or not the district offers a pre-K program and
whether a given family chooses to use a program given that one is offered.
Thus, we augment our basic model with a model that includes district fixed
effects. This model implicitly controls for factors common to all the students
within a district. The inclusion of district fixed effects slightly attenuates the
estimated impact of public pre-K, but does not materially affect the results.
The estimated effects for reading, shown in the second column of Table 2, are
0.0417 for economically disadvantaged students; 0.0657 for limited English
proficiency students, and 0.0871 for students with both eligibility conditions.
While the program impact is significantly greater than zero for all students,
the difference in the size of the effect between the economically disadvan-
taged and limited English proficiency students is not significant in the fixed
effect model, although the point estimate is similar in size to that estimated
in the OLS model.
    The story is quite similar for 3rd grade math test scores. The effect for
students with economic disadvantage only is 0.0523 in the OLS model, and
larger for LEP and students who are both economically disadvantaged and
LEP. The main effect is slightly smaller when district fixed effects are added,
0.0394, but remains statistically significant. The differences in the effect
sizes by eligibility class are significant in the OLS model and for students
with both forms of disadvantage in the district fixed effects model.
    The results discussed above are for tests conducted in English, even for
those students classified as LEP. The TAAS tests are also administered in
Spanish for students who English is so limited they would not be able to
take the test in English at all. The sample size is smaller, at about 54,000,

                                       11
compared to the 493,000 who took the tests in English. Nevertheless, public
pre-K was found to be effective for this group as well, with an effect of
0.0503 for reading and 0.0882 for mathematics in the OLS models. When
district fixed effects are added, the reading effect drops to 0.0413 and is not
significant at conventional levels (p=0.093); the reading score drops to 0.0620
but remains significant. In this group, no statistically signifcant difference
was found between those who were LEP only compared to both LEP and
economically disadvantaged.
    The effects of the program were not limited to higher scores on stan-
dardized tests. We also estimate models for the probability of retention and
special education designation. For grade retention, we analyze the probabil-
ity that a student is retained in grades 1, 2, or 3 as a function of public pre-K
controlling for covariates. Repeating of kindergarten is not considered reten-
tion, because kindergarten is voluntary and the decision to hold a student
back in kindergarten is usually made by the parent, not the school.
    Logit regression results reported in Table 4 indicates that attendance in
public pre-K, relative to the alternatives, significantly reduces the probability
of retention. The logit coefficient of -0.279 indicates that odds of retention are
24 percent lower for those who attended public pre-K. The odds of retention
for students who qualify for the program due to limited English proficiency
are 40 percent lower for those who did not attended public pre-K than for
those who do not. The difference in retention among those who qualified due
to both LEP and economic disadvantage were between those two. All the
program effects were significantly different from zero, and the difference in
the program effects by eligibility classes were also significant. These are large,
substantively meaningful effects with important educational consequences for
the students and for the costs of education in the state.
    As in the case of the results for standardized tests, it is desirable to control
for factors that are constant within district that could be correlated with
pre-K availability or attendance. However, in the case of a logit regression
estimated with maximum likelihood, more than one thousand fixed effects
makes the analysis intractable. One issue is the sheer size of the maximization
problem in estimating the logit, with close to one half million students. A
second issue concerns that fact that within many districts, especially smaller
ones and ones that did not offer public pre-K, there is no or very little within-
district variation in the dependent variable, which is coded either one or
zero indicating grade retention. To get around this, we estimate a linear
probability model with OLS that is comparable to the logit model. The

                                        12
coefficient on public pre-k is -0.032, indicating the probability of retention
is 3.2 percentage points lower for an economically disadvantaged student
who attended public pre-k relative to a similar student who did not. (The
logit equation produces a similar marginal effect when the probability of
retention is 13 percent.) We then added district fixed effects to the OLS
linear probability model. The resulting coefficient are nearly identical to
the logit equation, confirming that these results are robust with respect to
control of district-level factors.
    Special education designation is a controversial dependent variable. On
the one hand, pre-K might serve to provide earlier and better evaluation
of students, leading to a higher level of appropriate placements. On the
other hand, in some cases students who are borderline may be designated as
special education if they perform very poorly or behave disruptively; if pre-K
improves performance, emotional maturity, or social skills, it could reduce
special education assignment. The results in Table 4 show that students who
attended the Texas pre-K program were less likely to be assigned to special
education in third grade; the odds of assignment were 13 percent lower for
those who attended public pre-K other things equal. This result is confirmed
in the comparable OLS model and the OLS model with district fixed effects.
    So far the results indicate substantial positive benefits for students who
participated in Texas public pre-K program. The greatest threat to the
validity of these results resides in the selection of students into the program.
Given that the selection into the program includes students choosing no child
care and those choosing private child care, and given that care in the home
by a relative can be a good option depending on the home situation, there is
no way to tell a priori how this selection would bias the results, if at all.
    The ITT results based on Equation 2 address this concern by removing
all effects of selection, at the expense of losing information about actual
participation in the program. Table 5 presents the results for the English
language versions for third grade TAAS math and reading tests. For the
reading test, the offer of pre-K is positve in both the OLS and fixed effects
model, although it is only significant in the later. The effect size of 0.0509 for
economically disadvantage students in the fixed effects model is similar to the
estimate of the effects on those who actually participated. No statistically
significant differences in the effect of pre-K are observed depending on reason
for eligibility.
    In mathematics, the effect for economically disadvantaged students is
postive and signifcant in the OLS model but not in the fixed effect model.

                                       13
The effect for students eligible due to limited English proficiency or both
economic disadvantage and limited English proficiency are even larger than
those eligible due to economic disadvantage only, and the differences are sig-
nificant in the OLS model but no the fixed effects model. For those taking
tests in Spanish, there is a large and statistically signifincant effect for math-
ematics, but not reading, and not when fixed effects for districts are included
as shown in Table 6. In summary, despite the huge loss of information due
to discarding knowledge about which students actually took the test, the
ITT results are broadly consistent with the estimates based on Equation 1
in terms of the direction of the effect on student achievement, although the
level of significance of the coefficients is lower as would be expected when
information about program participation is discarded.
    Table 7 presents the ITT results for grade retention and assignment to
special education. Again, these results are broadly consistent with the es-
timates from the estimates based on actual program participation. The re-
sults from the ITT models do not support the notion that self-selection into
program participation, for those student living in districts that offered the
program, produced any significant bias in one direction or the other in the
models based on actual program participation.


Conclusion
Evaluation of experiments is considered by many to be the gold standard
in education research. However, experimental studies have limitations as
well. For example, the experimental evaluation of the Tennessee Star pro-
gram showed important effects of classroom size on student achievement.
To implement this proposal at a large scale, however, requires hiring many
new, inexperienced teachers. The new teachers are those who were at the
margin and would not have been hired before the change. On average, they
may be less skillful than the teachers already in the system. Moreover, the
large expenditure on new teacher salaries may displace expenditures on other
resources and alternative policy intiatives. Due to these macro effects, the
experimental results on class size reductions may not be acheived in a large
large scale implementation. To understand the effect of an educational in-
tervention as actually implemented, it is important to conduct evaluations
based using administrative data on programs in the field.
    This paper has shown that targeted pre-kindergarten programs, even a


                                       14
mediocre program implemented state-wide, can have a positive impact on a
number of academic outcomes even if they lack the resources or intensiveness
of the model programs that have featured so prominently in the literature on
pre-K. We found consistent effects on math and reading test scores of eco-
nomically disadvantage and LEP students ranging from 0.05 to 0.1 standard
deviations, depnding on reason for eligibility. Similar effects were found for
students whose English was so poor they were tested in Spanish, a group of
particular concern to policymakers. We also found reductions in the proba-
bility of retention in grade and assignment to special education. The results
are robust to the inclusion of district fixed effects, and the ITT estimates
suggest that the results are not driven by selection bias.
    Given the importance of early intervention and the difficult fiscal envi-
ronment that many states are experiencing since the 2008 recession, it is
encouraging that Texas’s Targeted Pre-Kindergarten program demonstrates
such promise. Even modest programs can achieve important gains for eco-
nomically disadvantaged and limited English proficiency students. States
should strive for excellent, resource-intensive programs, but programs that
fall short of this goal are still worthwhile for many students.
