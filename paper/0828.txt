I. Introduction

     Much of the debate surrounding the enactment of President Reagan's tax

plan was concerned with the short run   effects   of macroeconomic stimulation.

With existing combinations of high inflation and high unemployment, most of

us were concerned with using tax cuts to encourage business investment and

employment without causing unacceptable budget deficits. Now that the

Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 has become law, it is appropriate to

look again at the long run effect of these tax cuts. This paper estimates

the likely effects of the new Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) on

revenues, investment, long run growth, and capital allocation among industries.

We will investigate whether attempts to stimulate total investment have had

adverse effects on the use of that investment. We find significant welfare

gains from ACRS, but we find larger welfare gains from alternative plans that

were not adopted.

      The general approach of this paper is really a combination of two

approaches. The first uses a Hall—Jorgenson (1967) cost—of—capital formula

to look at the incentive effects of alternative tax rules. The second

approach uses a general equilibrium model in the tradition of Rarberger (1962)

to calculate tax incidence and welfare effects of discriminatory taxes on

capital. Both of these approaches have advanced over the years, however,

and we will combine more recent formulations of these two models in this

paper. In doing so, we will abstract entirely from short run issues of

macroeconomic stabilization. In particular, we assume a constant and

correctly anticipated inflation rate. We also assume full employment of

productive factors. There is no involuntary unemployment in our model,

but there is a labor—leisure choice on the part of individuals. This

"voluntary unemployment" depends on expected after—tax earnings.      Similarly,
                                —2—


there is no underutilization of industrial capital, but there is a savings—

consumption decision on the part of individuals. The growth of the capital

stock thus depends on the expected after—tax return to capital.

      The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (also referred to here as the

Reagan tax plan) changes two key provisions for capital cost recovery,

depreciation allowances and the investment tax credit. Under the new

Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS), any depreciable asset falls into

one of four classes and is given a tax life of 3, 5, 10, or 15 years. Autos,

light—duty trucks, and R & D equipment will be depreciated over 3 years,

and most other equipment will be depreciated over 5 years. A 10—year

life for depreciation purposes will be granted to relatively short—lived

public utility property, and a 15—year life will be granted to other public

utility property and most structures. These recovery periods replace the

previous system of basing tax lives on expected useful lives. For most

assets, the new tax lives are considerably shorter than their economic lives.

      Although these shorter lives are effective innnediately, the depreciation

schedule is less accelerated during a five year phase—in period. After 1985,

equipment can again be depreciated by double declining balance with a switch

to sun—of—the—years—digits. All structures immediately receive a 175 percent

declining balance rate, replacing both the 150 percent rate for nonresidential

property and the 200 percent rate for new residential property. Structures

can still switch to straight line.

      The Reagan plan has also increased the investment tax credit. Equip-

ment with a recovery period of three years is now eligible for a six percent

credit, and all longer—lived equipment receives a ten percent credit.

      These depreciation and investment tax credit provisions have implications

for the effective tax rate on a marginal investment in each type of
                                —3—


equipment or structure. In tiis paper we will calculate and compare effective

tax rates under the old law and under the new law, along the lines suggested

in papers by Jorgenson and Sullivan (1982) and by Hulten and Wykoff (1981).

These papers were written before the law was enacted, however, and they

evaluated cost recovery proposals that were somewhat different from the

15—10—5—3 plan with tax credit changes that was actually adopted. Our method

also differs from theirs by comparing tax rates under the assumption of tax-

minimizing depreciation choices by firms. We take this approach because we

are unable to consistently compare actual depreciation practices under the old

law and under the new law: actual practices are not yet available for the new

law. Finally, since we want long—run effects of these changes, we evaluate only

the post—1985 depreciation rules for new investments.

     Both the Hulten—Wykoff (H) study and the Jorgenson—Sullivan (JS) study

conclude that the adoption of a 10—5—3 approach drastically reduces effective

tax rates. Because depreciation is accelerated rather than indexed, a

reduction of inflation would send effective tax rates negative. They differ,

however, in their conclusions about interindustry distortions. JS find that

the new capital recovery system would widen the gaps among tax rates in

different industries, implying less efficient allocation of capital than

under the previous law.   11W find that that the 10—5—3 proposal would make

interindustry tax distortions lower among non—residential sectors.

     The major difference between our study and the other two is that we go

on to measure the size of efficiency changes associated with the new

depreciation law. We capture not only iritersectoral misallocations

associated with tax rate differences, but also the intertemporal misalloca-

tion of resources associated with the overall level of capital taxation.
                                 —4—

    Efficiency effects are nasured with the use of a computational general

equilibrium model of the U.S. economy and tax system. This model is capable

of second—best evaluation with simultaneous distortions due to corporate

taxes, personal taxes, and property taxes. It encompasses tax advantages on

owner—occupied housing, observed differences in the extent to which firms of

each industry are incorporated, and observed differences in the financial,

policies of the firms in each industry. These existing distortions are

important for measuring the interindustry effects of the Reagan capital

cost recovery plan, because nonneutralities of the new tax code may reinforce

or offset existing nonneutralities.

     Finally, our study includes evaluation of other investment incentive

plans that were not adopted. The Auerbach—Jorgenson (1980) first year

capital recovery plan gives finns a depreciation deduction at the outset

equal to the expected present value of economic depreciation. This proposal

effectively indexes depreciation allowances to inflation, as discussed by

Jorgenson   and Sullivan (1982) and by Nulten and Wykoff (1981). We also look

at the effects of indexing capital gains taxes.

     Following this introduction, Section II derives the formulas for effec-

tive marginal tax rates. The Reagan plan is described in more detail, as is

necessary to demonstrate the calculation of present values for depreciation

allowances in each asset category. Our 37 assets include twenty types of

equipment, fourteen types of structures, residential housing, land, and

inventories. Section III proceeds to do those calculations, presenting tax

lives, investment tax credit rates, and overall effective marginal tax rates

for each tax scheme we consider.

     Section IV presents the major features of the Fullerton—ShovenWhalley

(FSW) general equilibrium model used to simulate the above tax changes.
                                       —6—

the asset to (l—k)q. Second, the firm receives a reduction In taxes due

to depreciation allowances. The present value of this deduction per

dollar of investment will be denoted by z, so the total tax reduction is

uzq. The particular value for z will reflect the tax lifetime for the

asset, the depreciation formula, and the basis (historical or replacement

cost) on which the depreciation allowances are taken. It will also

reflect the discount rate.

     With the inclusion of all these features of the tax code, the equilibrium

condition is expressed as:



          (l—k)q =
                      J
                           (1_u)ce     )T e          dt + uzq.                (1)




The gross of depreciation rental rate, c/q, is then a function of the tax

parameters as well as i, ó, and r



          cIq
                  1(1—u) —   r     +
                                       (l—k—uz).                              (2)
                       1—u



We will denote by p the real rate of return net of depreciation:



          P     c/q — 6.                                                      (3)




     The concept of the effective corporate tax rate refers to a measure of

the difference between p, the real rate of return net of depreciation, and s,

the opportunity cost to the corporation. To measure s, we note that the

corporation arbitrages between real capitaland bonds yielding 1(1—u) —

It is therefore a borrower or lender at the real after—tax interest rate.
We thus take s = 1(1—u) —     iT   as the corporation's net of tax return to saving.
                                  —5—

Since this model specifies 18 private industry categories, we convert the

vectors of 37 asset tax rates to vectors of 18 industry tax rates by using

unpublished data from Dale Jorgenson on the stock of each asset used in

each industry. However, these marginal tax rates by industry are not

directly applicable to the FSW model which requires tax rates based on the

ratio of taxes paid to capital income. Section V describes our procedure

to convert the marginal tax rates into rates appropriate for that model.

      The resulting simulations of each tax plan are described in Section VI,

and   Section VII is a brief conclusion.



II. Effective Tax Rates on Capital

       To calculate effective tax rates for different assets, we start with

the cost of capital formula developed by Hall and Jorgenson (1967).      The

underlying premise behind this formula is that the profit maximizing     firiL


will undertake a marginal investment project if it earns a return net of

tax   such that the present value of cash flows is at least equal to the initial

           Under competitive equilibrium conditions the two will be exactly

equal. Denote the acquisition cost of the asset by q.       Assume that the

rental rate is initially equal    to   c, but that it grows at the rate of

inflation, ¶.    Further   assume that the quantity of capital embodied in the

investment declines at the economic depreciation rate 6. If the statutory

marginal corporate income tax rate is u, the net of tax rental receipts
                                                     —
from the investment at time t    will
                                   equal (1 —      u)ce      To derive

the present value of such a stream, these nominal cash flows would be

discounted at the nominal after—tax interest rate, i(l —      u).
                                           affect the rental rate in two ways.
       Capital cost recovery provisions

First, an investment tax credit at rate k lowers the acquisition cost of
                                               —7—

      It is common to express the difference between p and s as a proportion

of p, the gross of tax return. Under this approach, the "gross" corporate

tax rate is



              = (p—s)/p              .                                     (4)


      For investments outside the corporate sector, the statutory income

tax rate for the corporation, u, is replaced by the marginal income tax

rate for the proprietor, m. It is then straightforward to rederive

equations (1) through (4), identical except for the use of in in place of u.

      We turn next to the measurement of z, the present value of depreciation

allowances on a dollar of investment. The easiest case to consider is that

of the Auerbach—Jorgenson proposal, where firms receive a first year deduction

equal to the expected present value of economic depreciation, using replace-

ment cost as a basis. Given a constant economic depreciation rate 6 for

either equipment or structures, the value of this allowance is:



                      —6t           —(1(1—u) — n)T
                  I
                                e                  dt
            zjoe
              0
                                                                           (5)



                            6
              —
                  i(1—u)   —        it +   6




The Auerbach—Jorgenson proposal treats all assets symmetrically. It

thus provides a high first year deduction for equipment with a high 6,

a   low deduction for structures with a low 6, and no deduction for land
and inventories which do not depreciate. In contrast, both the old tax
law and the Reagan plan have separate depreciation rules for equipment

and   for structures.
                                          —8—


    For equipment, both the old and the new tax laws allow double

declining balance (DDB), with a switch to sum_ofthe—years'digitS (SYD).

This combination is used here as tax—minimizing practice because it can be

shown to provide the earliest possible depreciation deductions.2' Define

L as the asset's lifetime for tax purposes,an integer number of years.

Define C as the time of the optimal switch, and B as the declining balance

rate (equal to 2.0 for equipment). We can then define b E B/L as the

exponential rate for the first part of the asset's life.             Since DDB starts

out with higher depreciation allowances, and since SYD on the remaining

basis must eventually exceed DDB, the optimal switching point can be

found by equating depreciation under the two methods:



           L-C     —
                       2                                                             (6
          S(L—G)       L


where the S function is defined by



          5(x) =           (x   -   j)                                               (7)
                   j=0


if x is an integer. As seen below for cases where x is not an integer,

the summation goes from zero to the integer part of x.

     Normally the firm would use DDB in the first year, would be indifferent

in the second year, and would switch to SYD by the third year of the asset's

life. However, both the old and new tax laws make           use   of the half year

convention, assuming that all assets were bought on July 1. The firm thus

uses DDB for C = 1¼ years, and SYD afterwards. Take, for example a one—

dollar asset with L=5, B2, and           b.40.   Then the firm would deduct .2

(half of b) in the year of purchase and .32 (b times .8) in the first full
                                       —9—

taxable year. Switching to SYD for the .48 remaining basis over 3.5 years,

the firm would use numerators of 3.5, 2.5, 1.5, and .5 respectively. The

su of those figures for the denominator is 8.0, as defined by S(L—C) in

equation (7) where L—G is not an integer. These depreciation charges are

discounted at the nominal after tax rate of return because allowances are on

a historical cost basis. The general expression for the present val o

depreciation deductions under the old law is:




z = b    e_t_T di        + b(l -
                                   )   I'e_iu_T di                      (8)




     + (1
            F(l_b).      J=2
                               L-(J
                                       c     Je)t      dT




The integration is not performed here to save space.

     The new tax law is based on the same principles, but it incorporates

two interesting differences. First, depreciation of the last half year is

moved up. As a result, the 3 year class is depreciated in only 2 years.

the five year class in 4½ years, and the 10 year class in 9½ years.

For the five year asset example, depreciation deductions are .2 in the first

half year and .32 in the first full year, but the remaining .48 basis is

given SYD treatment over only 3 remaining years. Second, the taxpayer is not

given the choice of when to switch. If the firm selects a 5 year life for

equipment, the law actually provides a table requiring deductions of .2,

.32, .24, .16, and .08, starting in the year of purchase. The general

expression for z under    the new law is thus:
                                                      —10—

            Finally,       for structures, both laws specify a declining balance rate

with a switch to straight line. The swiçch time G is again found where the

two methods provide the same deductions. Since continued exponential

deductions would allow B/L of remaining basis, and since straight line would

allow 1/(L—G) of the same remaining basis, we can set these two expressions

equal to each other and solve for G as:



                                                                                                      (10)

 III.    The Marginal Tax Rates Under Each Tax Regime

        This section presents marginal tax rates for 37 assets under the

 provisions of the old tax code, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981,

 and the Auerbach—Jorgenson first year capital recovery plan. These tax

 rates, for each version of the law, are then combined with information

 on the use of each asset by each of the 18 private industries to derive

 marginal effective corporate tax rates for each industry.

        Equations (1) to (4) express the tax rate as a function of u, 1, n,

 6, k, and z. We viii discuss u, i, and n first because those parameters

 do not vary by asset. The corporate tax rate u is taken as .46, the top

 statutory rate on corporations. The great bulk of corporate investment

 is undertaken by firms in this bracket.

        To obtain the nominal interest rate i, we start with the assumption

 that the after tax rate of return would be .04 in the absence of inflation.

 The before tax interest rate with no inflation, i, would be .041(1—u).           The

 interest rate with inflation then depends on how 'i    affects   i. Empirical

 evidence in Feldstein and Summers (1978) and in Summers (1981) supports a

 "strict" version of Fisher's Law,   where   inflation adds point for point to

 nominal interest:



             i =   i
                   0
                       + 71   .                                            (12)


 In   this formulation the real after tax interest rate s, which equals i(i—u)—.

 would fall with n. Alternatively, evidence in Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1980)

• supports a "modified" version of Fisher's Law,   where   inflation adds more

 than   point for point to nominal interest, enough to maintain the .04 real after
              4/
 tax return:—
                                — 12 —




                                                                     (13)



We use both (12) and (13) to obtain alternative values of i.

     For the expected inflation rate n, we use .07 in the standard case.

This value reflects the gross private domestic product deflator between

1970 and 1980. For sensitivity, we also discuss some results with

inflation rates of four and ten percent.

     Other parameters vary across the 37 asset categories listed in column

1 of Table i.--" Economic depreciation rates   are taken from Hulten and

Wykoff (1982), as shown in column 2 of Table 1. These rates range from a

low of .015 for housing to a high of .333 for automobiles. Inventories

and land are assumed not to depreciate.-"

     The rate of investment tax credit k varies not only by asset but also

according to the tax law being simulated. For the old law, in column 3 of

Table 1, we use the statutory rates of .10 for public utility structures

and equipment with at least a 7 year tax life, .067 for equipment with at least

a 5 year life, and .033 for equipment with at least a 3 year life. Though

other studies have shown lower effective ITC rates due to insufficient tax

libability and incomplete carryover provision, our use of statutory rates

is consistent with the assumptions of our steady state equilibrium xrodel.

In such a model, no firm would have abnormal profits, but all would have

normal profits and tax liability.

     Finally, the present value of depreciation allowances also varies by

asset and tax law. Equations (8) to (11) express z as a function of the

tax lifetime L and the declining balance rate B, as well as the nominal

discount rate 1(1—u). For the old law, guideline lifetimes for each asset

          the midpoints of the Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) system.      We
provide
take these lifetimes from Jorgenson—Sullivan (1982) and ignore the ossibi1ity

of shorter lives substantiated by facts and circumstances.     Most structures

are assigned these lives directly, but the ADR system allows 20 percent

longer or shorter lives for equipment and public utility structures. Because

of our optimizing tax practice assumption, these assets are assigned lives

that are 80 percent of ADR midpoints, except where the use of a longer life

would reduce effective taxes through eligibility for a higher investment ta>:

credit. The resulting vector of lives, shown in column 4 of Table 1, is
                                                                       and
consistent with the ITC vector in that 3 and 5 year assets get a third

two—thirds of the full investment tax credit, respectively.

     Equipment (assets 1—20) and public utility structures (assets 27—31) use

double declining balance (B      2.0) and sum_of_the_years_digits in equation

(8) to obtain z under the old law.     Other structures use B =   1.5   with a

switch to straight line in equation (11). Housing

        Not shown in Table 1 are the tax rates resulting from alternative i
and ,    combinations.   With Strict Fisher's Law (SFL), the tax rates appear

to have even more variance. In all cases, however, both p and s are reduced.

As a result, the tax or subsidy as a proportion of p can appear large even

when the wedge (p—s) is small. As shown in Bradford—Fullerton (1982), t8

can    even have the wrong sign when an asset is so subsidized that the before

tax return is negative in the denominator. Such anomalies occur for several

assets under SFL, but we use only industry tax rates in the model.

These are defined by (p—s)/, where p is the asset—weighted average of p

for each industry.        Since    is always positive, and since s is positive,

t5 by industry are always well defined.

       Column 1 of Table 2 shows the eighteen industries of our model, while

column 2 shows their effective corporate tax rates under MFL. Land

intensive industries such as real estate and agriculture are weighted

towards the .46 effective tax rate on that asset. The low rate on trans-

portation, communications and utilities reflects the tax credits for public

utility structures as well as the low rate for the aircraft example mentioned

above. Next, effective tax rates of column 3 portray the same tax regime,

but under the assumption of Strict Fisher's Law. Because of lower gross of

tax returns p, these tax rates are both higher and more variant than under

NFL.

       Turning now to effective tax rates under the Accelerated Cost Recovery

System (ACRS), we begin with the statutory credits shown in column 6 of

Table 1. Five—year equipment and public utility structures all get ten

percent credits while three—year assets receive a six percent credit.

Because of our equilibrium model with no carryover problems, both sets of

tax rates reflect statutory credits and do not reflect any increase in

availability     of the credit through the new law's extended carryover and

leasing provisions.

      Column 7 displays lifetimes of each asset under the new law, assuming

again that each asset is homogeneous. The law assigns a three year life to

autos, light trucks, R &D equipment, certain racehorses,           and personal

property with an ADR midpoint of four years or less. Our level of aggrega-

tion shows autos with a three year life, but none of the other assets has

an (average) ADR     midpoint   of four years or less. Thus, all other equipment

gets a five year life. Similarly, for public utility structures, we assigned

a ten year life to any asset category with an ADR      midpoint   between 18 and

25 years, as provided in the law. All other structures have a 15 year life,

except mining, shafts, and wells which we reduced from 6.8 to a 5 year life.

      The lives for equipment and public utility structures are combined with

B =   2.0   in equation (9) to calculate z and effective tax rates. The lives

for other structures are combined with B =      1.75 in equation (ll).-" Result—
            are shown for Modified Fisher's Law in column 8 of Table 1.    Effective
ing

tax rates are clearly and consistently negative for all types of equipment

and positive for all types of structures. There is no a priori reason to

believe that inter—asset distortions would be reduced by this tax change.

       Notice also how sensitive tax rates are to lifetimes and credits.       As

the lifetime for computers (asset 11) changes from 8 to 5 years, the effective

tax rate changes from plus 16 to minus 63 percent. As the credit for

autos (asset 15) changes from .033 to .06, its effective tax rate changes

from plus 20 to minus 33.5 percent.

      The corresponding industry tax rates are shown in column 4 of Table 2.

The fact that all these rates exceed zero reflects comparatively high

weights on structures, inventories and land in all industries. Because

tax   rates are all lower than under the old law, intertetnpOral distortions

 tax system. This section first

then provides detail on the treatment of capital taxation)

        1. An Overview of the Model

        The modeled economy is divided into eighteen profit maximizing producers,

two government sectors, fifteen consumption commodities, and twelve consumers

differentiated by income class. Each industry has a Cobb—Douglas or Constant

Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function, where the elasticity of

substitution between capital and labor is chosen as a "best—guess" from

evidence in the literature. Each output can be used as an intermediate input

through a fixed coefficient input—output matrix. Outputs can be purchased

by government, used for investment, or converted into consumer goods. There

is also a simple foreign trade sector.

        Each consumer has initial endowments of labor and capital services which

can be sold for use in production. Because of perfect factor mobility and

competition, the net—of—tax return to each factor is equal among industries.

A consumer can also choose to buy some of his own    labor   endowment for leisure.

The capital stock is fixed in any one period, but the dynamic version of the

model   allows   the savings response to augment the stock in later periods. De—

inand functions are based on CES utility functions with double nesting. The

elasticity of substitution between present and future consumption is based

on an estimate of the uncompensated saving elasticity with respect to the net—

of—tax rate of return. For this value we use 0.4 as found by Boskiri (1978).

The elasticity of substitution between consumption and leisure is based on an

aggregate estimate of 0.15 for the unconipensated labor supply elasticity with

respect to the net—of—tax wage.

        The entire spectrum of Federal, state, and local taxes are typically

modeled as ad valoreni tax rates on purchases of appropriate products or

factors. Corporate income taxes and property taxes are modeled as different
                                  — 20 —




effective   rates of tax on use of capital by industry. Social security,

workmen's compensation and unemployment insurance appear as taxes on each

industry's use of labor. Personal income taxes operate as different linear

schedules for each consumer group, with marginal tax rates increasing from

an average of 1 percent for the lowest income group to an average marginal

tax rate of 40 percent for the highest income group.

     The model is parameterized for 1973 using data from the National Income

and Product Accounts, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expendiure

Survey, and the Treasury Department's merged tax file. These data are adjusted

for known inaccuracies of government collection procedures and for general

equilibrium consistency requirements. This "benchmark" data set is used to

solve backwards for relevant preference parameters and tax rates, so that

model solution can replicate the benchmark equilibrium. Tax rates cn be

altered to calculate a simulated equilibrium with different resource allocations

for comparison with the benchmark. The model is solved using a variant of

Scarf's (1973) algorithm for an equilibrium price vector where excess deipans

and profits are zero.

    The model does not include involuntary unemployment, endogenous inflation,

or other aspects of disequilibria. It measures real effects without a money

equation, expressing all prices in relative terms. Voluntary unemployment

is captured through the labor/leisure choice, however, and the effects of in-

flation are modeled by adjusting effective tax rates appropriately.

     Finally, the model requires that government run a balanced budget. Thre—

fore, when policy changes generate alterations in the tax equations and para-

meters, the implied revenue gain or loss cannot be recorded as a government

surplus or deficit. It would be possible to balance the budget by changing

expenditures, but any change in government spending on transfer progrtns or
                                  — 21 —




public   goods would affect each consumer group's welfare in a manner that cannot

be adequately captured in this model. Since we are not trying to evaluate

Reagan's planned expenditure reductions, we will abstract from expenditure

changes. Consequently, any loss of government purchasing power must be

compensated in the model by an offsetting tax increase.

       In previous uses of this model, we have offset revenue losses by scaling

up personal income tax rates. In the context of Reagan's tax plan, however,

this option does not seem appropriate. Instead, we will generally maintain

an equal yield through additional taxes on consumer expenditure. This replace-

ment can be considered an additional state or local sales tax, or a Federal con-

sumption—type value added tax. Either may yet be used to replace lost revenues.

As an alternative, we also consider a lump—sum tax (or rebate) in proportion

to the twelve consumers' original after—tax incomes. Though not a viable

policy option, this replacement serves to isolate the   efficiency   properties of

each   simulated change in effective corporate tax rates.


       2. Taxation   of Capital
       As stated above, the modeled industries face different tax rates on

their use of capital. Specifically, the total capital tax paid by each

industry is the sum of its liabilities under the corporate income tax (CIT),

the property tax (PT), the corporate franchise tax (CFT). and the persona].

income tax on income from capital of that industry. This personal tax

component, which we call the "personal factor tax" (PFT), includes personal

taxes paid on dividends, retained earnings, and all income from noncorporate

business in the industry. Its value takes into account not only the marginal

personal income tax rate averaged over owners of capital, but also such

features as the partial exclusion of dividends and the value of capital

gains tax deferrals. The calculation of the personal factor tax is also
                                     — 22 —




dependent on the expected inflation rate, in order to measure taxation of
nominal rather than real capital gains. To obtain t, the "cash flow"

tax rate for each industry, capital tax payments are divided by total net

capital income of the industry (EN):



               cf —   CIT + PT + CFT + PFT                              (14)
           t




Each of these variables have industry subscripts which are suppressed for

notational simplicity.

     The Fullerton—Shoven—Whalley model obtains these tax rates for the bench-

mark calculations by using observed corporate income taxes and other taxes

paid in 1973 in the numerator of this expression. These average tax rates are

appropriate for simulating income effects and government tax receipts.     In


a steady state equilibrium model, they are also appropriate estimates of

marginal   tax rates since the two sets of rates will be equal. Alternative

tax regimes are simulated with appropriate adjustments to (14). Integration,

for example, is modeled by removing CIT and adjusting the personal factor

tax to account fully for corporate source income. With the integration examnie,

cash flow tax rates are still equal to tax rates for incentive purposes.

     With changes in depreciation or investment tax credits, however, only new

investments will be subject to the new marginal rates.      Previous investments

will continue to pay taxes based on old lives and schedules, affecting tax

receipts as long as they generate capital income. Cash flow tax rates,

will gradually approach incentive tax rates,   t,   as   a higher proportion of

capital is covered by the new law. The Fullerton—ShoVeflWhalleY model
                                                                      now

includes this capability. Each industry's factor demand functions depend on

factor prices gross of incentive tax rates, as these will affect all capital
                                    — 23 —


allocation     decisions at the margin. On the other hand, cash flow tax rates

are used to determine tax receipts and the after—tax incomes of capital

owners. In the benchmark sequence of equilibria, cf and t for each

industry are equal, but in a tai c;ar.ge simulation the two sets of rates

can be specified separately.
       The ne:\t section describes our conversion of ACRS into model—equivalent

form, that is, the derivation of t and            With a switch to shorter lives,

cash flow rates will exceed incentive rates for a time, resulting in revenues

that exceed the new steady state revenues as a proportion of income. This lump—

sum tax effect will capture the efficiency properties of accelerated deprecia-

tion and investment tax credits. In particular, expensing of ne investments

is more efficient than corporate tax elimination, because more revenue can be

obtained   with the same marginal   rates.




V.    The Model—Equivalent Form of Each Tax Regime
      The standard version of the FS1    del, as just described, uses observec

corporate     taxes in the numerator of (14) to obtain cash   flow and incentive

tax   rates   for the benchmark calculations. On a steady state growth path

with correctly anticipated inflation, no risk,no measurement problems, and

no transitory profits or losses, the two sets of rates would be equivalent.

However, when we compared different formulations of the marginal tax rates

byindustry under the old law with different formulations of the average

tax rates by industry from Commerce Department data between 1973 and 1978,

we never obtained a correlation coefficient higher than 0.3. This lack of

resemblance between average and marginal tax rates poses an interesting

research question, but one which lies outside the scope of this paper. For

now we can appeal to the existence of unanticipated inflation, risk, measure-

ment problems, and transitory profits or 1osses.--'
                                    — 24 —




     If we accepted the FSW assumption that average tax rates are suitable
for use as marginal tax rates in the benchmark, then the new rates appropriate

for ACRS would not be immediately obvious. Instead, we assume that marginal

tax rates from Table 2 are suitable as average tax rates in the benchmark.

This procedure satisfies the steady state requirement that average and marginal

tax rates be equal in the benchmark, and it provides appropriate new margin1

rates for ACRS from Table 2.    It has the further advantage of updating the 1973

general equilibrium model to 1980 tax law for comparison with the Economic

Recovery Tax Act of 1981.

     We thus changed the nde1 by rejecting CIT data in favor of



          CIT* =   t8(BTP* + INT) — u(INT),                            (15)




where INT are the corporate interest payments of each industry and BTP* are

the before—tax profits that would have to be earned under marginal tax rates

to yield the observed after—tax profits ATP. Taking the latter as fixed data

for the counterfactual, BTP* equals ATP plus CIT*, so algebraically



          CIT* =            ATP —            INT   .                   (16)
                   l—tgc                c


     Only u does not vary by industry. These expressions account for the

fact that debt financed investments qualify for the same investment tax

credits and depreciation deductions as equity financed investments.     The

gross of tax return on both forms of finance (BTP* + INT) corresponds to p

and is taxable at t. Interest payments are deducted by corporations at the

statutory rate u, but are then included by individuals later at the individual

rate m-'
                                      — 25   —




        A similar treatment of noccorporate business closes the model.

Marginal    tax rates are calculated for each asset and industry using a

 statutory personal rate m, equal to .278, the average personal marginal

tax rate on capital income in the model. All rental income in each industry,

noncorporate interest payments, and noncorporate profits are assumed to be taxable

at these calculated effective rates, while noncorporate interest payments are

both    deducted by business and included by individuals at rate m.
        Once the benchmark sequence has been calculated, we are ready to

specify cf and t' for simulations. First,             from the new law in Table 2

are used in equation (16) to get CIT*. Second, noncorporate effective rates

under the new law are used to adjust personal factor taxes. Then. eqt1aticv (1LL)

provides t      for   all future periods.

        The cash flow rates, however, will begin at exactly the old cash f1o

rates,    since all capital income will initially be generated by assets put in
place    before the tax change. These older assets will depreciate at an average

rate , while    the total     capital stock will increase at approximately the

steady state growth rate n. The ratio of old capital to total capital after

N years will be


                          N
            R= l+n                                                        (17)




The cash flow tax rate for each period is calculated from (16) and (14) as

before, but where t is based on a weighted average of p from the old law

and p from the new law. The weights after N years are R and (1 — R) respec-

tively. The FSW model can then still simulate its fifty years by calculating

six equilibria that are ten years apart. Suitable terminal conditions account

for years beyond fifty.

        These procedures furnish de1—equivalent tax rates that account for

industry    differences   in the use of many assets, state and local taxes on

capital, the degree of incorporation, and the financial decisions of firms.

On the other hand, these behaviors are not allowed to change with the tax

law. Each industry continues to use the same mix of assets, the same

proporLii: of corporate activity, and t1e same proportions of capital income

accruing to debt and equity. With no risk in the model, these procedures

imply a fixed debt/equity ratio for each industry. We thus concentrate on

capital intensity decisions in this paper)-'



VI. Simulation Results

        The FSW model provides complete descriptions of each equilibrium in the

base and revised sequences. In Table 3, we select key results for discussion

in this paper. Column 1 contains a list of simulated tax regimes, categorized

by alternative assumptions. In Part I of this table,effective corporate tax

rates       are calculated using Modified Fisher's Law of equation (13). The

corresponding industry tax rates for the old law and for ACRS are shown in

columns 2 and 4 of Table 2 above. When the new lower tax rates are imposed, we

abstract from expenditure changes or budget deficits by raising some other tax

to replace the lost revenue. The revised equilibrium includes either (A.) a

lump—sum tax on each group in proportion to their orginal after tax incoine,

or (B.) a consumption—type value added tax (VAT), equivalent to a sales tax.

In either case, the additional tax is at a rate just high enough so that

government can make the same real purchases as in the corresponding period

of the benchmark sequence.

        The present value of welfare gains, in billions of 1980 dollars, is shown

in column 2 of Table 3. These are the sums of consumers' compensating variations,

and can be expressed as a percentage of $97 trillion, ithe present value of

consumers' incomes in the benchmark sequence.2-" That is, the $311.9

billion gain for ACRS with lump—sum tax replacement represents 0.32 percent

of base income.

     A substantial portion of the recent ACRS debate concerned growth effects

and revenue effects of alternative policies. Tax cuts can provide incentives

for additional investment, increasing total capital, and the future tax base.

As an indicator of the eventual effects on capital,we show in column 3 the

ratio of the capital stock after fifty years in the simulation to the capital

stock after fifty years in the baseline. In the same ACRS example, the

capital stock is 2.9 percent higher than in the baseline. Then, in column 4.

we indicate whether this feedback effect was sufficient to offset the reduction

in tax rates. This column shows, after fifty years, the proportion of revenue

that must come from the replacement tax,as necessary for government to make

the same real purchases. Since ACRS reduces revenue by 1.25 percent, feed-

back effects were not sufficient to increase revenues.

     Since lump—sum taxes are not generally available, the VAT provides a

more realistic replacement tax. It does not distort intertemporal decisions in

this model,   but   does affect the labor/leisure choice. Welfare gains of ACRS

are then smaller, at $264.1 billion, as shown in column 2 of Table 3. Note

that cash flow rates exceed incentive rates for a time, providing some non—

distorting revenues on previous investments.

    Next, we simulate three versions of the Auerbach—Jorgenson first year

recovery plan. The basic plan provides a uniform .46 effective corporate

tax rate, higher than all industries' former tax rates under the assumption

of MFL as shown in Table 2. The increased intersectoral efficiency is Over'-

powered by reduced intertemporal efficiency, for a net loss of $221.6 billion.

The simulated capital stock after fifty years is lover than in the baseline, but
                                               -

revenues are higher.

      The next simulation combines the AJ first year recovery with an E.
                                                                         Cary
Brown investment tax credit such that the uniform      is .345, three—fourths

of the statutory .46 rate resulting from AJ alone. This particular combination

 (.75AJ) implies incentive tax rates for the FSTI model that are at the same

overall level as those for ACRS. It will thus imply the same intertemporal

distortions and allow us to isolate intersectoral effects. Since the $286.3

billion welfare gains exceed the $264.1 billion of ACRS under the same assump-

tions, the difference can be attributed to intersectoral misallocations11

associated with the differing      under ACRS.-"

    First year recovery schemes effectively index depreciation since inflation

cannot affect the present value of deductions. The FSW model also al1o's

indexing of capital gains by appropriate changes in the personal factor tax

of equation (14). This construct includes taxation   of all inflationary
increases   in the value of capital in each industry, but at reduced personal

rates to account for deferral and the 60 percent exclusion. "Indexing" in

Table 3 refers to eliminating any tax on purely nominal capital gains. In

combination with (.75 AJ), indexing provides substantially larger welfare

gains, at $642.4 billion.

     Finally, for the baseline with Modified Fisher's Law, we resimulate the

integration plus indexing plan which formed the major topic of earlier papers.1

The CIT* is eliminated from the numerator of (14), but dividends and retained

earnings become fully taxable at the personal level. Noncorporate capital

income taxation is unchanged,but nominal capital gains cease to be taxed. In

combination, these policies imply reduced intertemporal and intersectoral

distortions. This plan does not have the advantage of lump—sum revenues on

previous investments, since separate taxation of all corporate capital is

eliminated. Integration reduces capital tax revenue, encourages savings,
                                 — 30 —



increases   the capital stock by eleven percent, and provides a $916.3 billion

welfare gain, equal to 0.94 percent of baseline iticorne.

     In the second part of Table 3, t     are   calculated using Strict Fisher's

Law of equation (12). The old law and ACRS tax rates for this case were

shown in columns 3 and 5 of Table 2. Since the old         were often greater

than .46, all of these capital tax Cuts imply greater intertemporal gains

than under NFL. ACRS provides a full one percent of baseline income as a

gain in consumer welfare. This time, however, the uniform AJ rate of .46

represents an effective tax reduction. It provides iritersectoral gains

together with some intertemporal gains.

     Welfare gains in column 2 suggest substantial sensitivity to the assump-

tions about nominal and real interest rates that are embodied in NFL and SFL.

However, the ordering of the tax regimes is robust. The intertemporal gains

from the lower tax rates of ACRS still dominate the intersectoral gains frort

the uniform tax rates of Auerbach—Jorgenson. Both are still dominated by thç

combined intertemporal and intersectoral gains of AJ with credit, the uniform

.345 effective corporate tax rate. Indexing capital gains still provides

further welfare gains, while integration still provides the largest gain of

all plans considered. A major force in these results is that any overall

capital tax reduction increases welfare, because of the efficiency properties

of a consumption tax in this ndel. The VAT replacement is superior on

efficiency grounds, but has its own distributional implications that are not

considered here.

     Other simulations were performed to test the sensitivity of our results.

A lower inflation rate implies lower       effective corporate tax rates for

every industry in the benchmark. As a result, welfare gains from ACRS are

lower than those in Table 3. A higher inflation rate implies higher initial
                                        — 31 —



       and greater welfare gains from ACRS.   When inflation erodes the real value
   C
 of    depreciation deductions, acceleration makes more of a difference. Indexing,

 however, is still more efficient than acceleration. Results are also

 aensitive to other parameters in the model. In particular, the capital stock

 responses and welfare gains in Table 3 depend on the 0.4 savings elasticity

 assumed    earlier   in the description of the model. The revenue impact also

 depends on this assumed elasticity. The present value of these welfare gains

 depends on the assumed elasticities of substitution between capital and labor

 in production. Fullerton, Henderson, and Shoven (1952) discuss more fully the

 sensitivity of results to these and other model specifications.



 VII. Conclusion

        This paper has provided a courehensive study of the cost recovery pro-

 visions in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. We have measured, for 37

 assets and 18 industries, the reduction in the cost of capital and effective

 tax rates resulting from acceleration of depreciation allowances and expansion

 of the investment tax credit. We then used these revised measures of capital

 cost incentives to simulate the long run effects on investment and growth.


     Our principal finding is that, although the Accelerated Cost
                                                                  Recovery
System (ACRS) moves the economy toward
                                       increased output in the long run by
reducing tax biases against capital, economic
                                                 efficiency might be further
enhanced by other reforms that were not selected. ACRS lowers tax rates

on capital, but it leaves large differences in tax rates among corporations

in different industries. With these
                                        discrepancies, capital will tend to he
allocated less efficiently
                           among its alternative uses. It would be possible,
as an alternative, to enact a reform that reduces overall effective tax

rates by the same amount as under ACRS, hut that tends to equalize tax
                                                                       rates
across industries. Adoption of
                                — 32 —




the Auerbach—Jorgenson first year recovery plan in combination with an
investment tax credit would move in this direction by indexing allowances

at economic rates of depreciation.

    More importantly, however, both the ACRS and the first year recovery plan

fall short of alleviating further distortions in U.S. tax policy toward capital.

First, nominal capital gains are subject to tax, so inflation raises the

effective tax rate on income from real capital gains. Second, businesses

in the corporate sector are taxed differently from those in the noncorporate

sector. Integration of the personal and corporate income tax systems could be

used to eliminate this differential. Results in this paper indicate that the

efficiency gains associated with integration in combination with indexation of

capital gains would be far larger than the gains from ACRS or from the first

year recovery plan. However, such a reform would create a larger revenue

shortfall. We did not investigate distributional implications of any tax

plan, nor did we investigate efficiency or distributional implications of any

government expenditure reduction.

1/ Certain structures are treated as equipment for depreciation purposes,
    including public utility property and single purpose agricultural
    structures. Under the old law, residential structures receive double
    declining balance, but under the new law they are grouped with other
    structures at 175 percent of declining balance with a switch to straight
    line.

2/ See Shoven and Bulow (1975). If a firm expects a steady stream of
    positive taxable profits, it would always take depreciation allowances
    as early as possible. Under other circumstances, however, the firm
    may prefer later deductions. Under the old law, the firm could delay
    its depreciation deductions by delaying the switch or by using straight
    line. The new law is less flexible, however, because it mandates the
    switchover time that would be optimal for the firm wanting the earliest
    deductions. Both laws allow the flexibility to combine just straight
    line depreciation with longer tax lives, but this decision can be made
    only at the time of acquisition. Our analysis abstracts from these
    details by using an equilibrium model where all firms expect positive
    taxable profits (but no abnormal profits).

3/ Many studies simplify the first two terms in equations (8) to (11)
    by using b as an exponential rate over C years:



                            l—u)i   di
            Gbe_bt e_


   This expression inaccurately assus a continuously declining basis, and
   it inaccurately leaves ebG as the remaining basis. Instead, equations
   (8) to (Ii) follow the law by specifying yearly adjustments to basis.
   Furthermore, many studies simplify the third term of these z expressions
   by using discrete time:


                               L L—(J-)               r        1
            (1 -
                   )(l-b)     J=2        S(L-G)            +
                                                      Li       i(l_u)j


   Instead, equations •(8) to (11) discount depreciation deductions at
   the end of a year by more than those at the beginning of the year. This
   procedure explicitly recognizes that depreciation deductions are "coincident
   with the associated earnings and tax liability of equation (1).
                                — F2 —




4/   Fisher's original argument ignored taxes to find that equation (12)
     would maintain real interest rates in the presence of inflation. With
     taxes, the same logic would suggest that (13) would maintain the real
     after tax return. However, taxes are not neutral to inflation, due to
     historical cost depreciation and the taxation of purely nominal capital
     gains. Bradford and Fullerton (1982) demonstrate the sensitivity of
     tax rates to the choice between (12) and (13), or more generally, to the
     choice of i and T.

5/   The corporation also earns Income on intangible assets such as knowledge
     acquired through research, or goodwill acquired through advertising.
     Because we do not have adequate estimates for the stock of these assets
     in each industry, they are excluded from this study.

6/   For assets 27 through 31, the depreciation rates come from Jorgenson and
     Sullivan (1982). They use the }iulten—Wykoff methodology to obtain esti-
     mates for these additional assets. The rate for housing is an unpublished
     estimate of Hulten and Wykoff.

7/   Lifetimes for many of the 37 assets are actually averaged over more diverse
     asset categories. As a result, only some of the assets in one of our
     categories may need their lifetimes adjusted to receive higher credits.
     Since the aggregation to 37 assets provides considerable detail, however,
     it seems appropriate to treat each asset as individually homogeneous. One
     example of where this treatment may be less appropriate is in mining,
     shafts and wells. The 6.8 year life here reflects an average of intangible
     drillingwith a zero life and other structures with a longer life.

8/   Inventories could be effectively taxed at more than 46 percent with FIFO
     accounting in times of inflation. Because of our optimizing assumption,
     however, all firms would use LIFO to minimize taxes.

9/   For weights, we use Dale Jorgenson's unpublished data on the 1977 stock
     of each asset used in each industry. See Jorgenson and Sullivan (1982)
     and Fraumeni and Jorgenson (1980) for more detail. Briefly, they use
     Commerce Department investment series, a capital flow table, and an RAS
     scaling routine to estimate an investment matrix for every year. Then
     they use Hulten—Wykoff depreciation rates and the perpetual inventory method
     to obtain the capital stock matrix for 1977.

10/ As mentioned above, the new law provides tables with depreciation amounts
     rather than specifying DDB with a switch to SYD. The derivations of (9)
     and (11) make clear the equivalence, however. Thus we are effectively
     putting the tables of the law directly into present value calculations.

11/ If actual depreciation rates differ from the Hulten—Wykoff rates used in
     the first year recovery provisions, then actual effective tax rates could
     differ from 46 percent. Thus the uniformity of AJ effective tax rates
     depends on the accuracy of depreciation rate estimates.

12/ Brown (1982) suggests an investment credit that is proportional to the
     difference between the acquisition cost of the asset and its first year
     allowance. This particular choice of asset—dependent credits and first
     year write—of fs results in a uniform effective tax rate.

 13/    More detailed descriptions of this model may be found in Fullerton,
        King, Shoven, and Whalley (1980, 1981). These papers used the model
        to simulate integration of the personal and corporate income tax systems.

 14/ By considering the expected future tax on a hypothetical dollar of invest-
       vent, the marginal tax rate depends on expected inflation. If inflation
       turns out to be higher than expected, the use of historical cost deprecia-
       tion will increase tax payments and thus average tax rates. Indeed,
      Jorgenson and Sullivan (1982) argue that inflation rates have been higher
      than expected, acting as a lump—sum tax on investments already in place.
      Also, if some of the return to capital is treated as a risk premium,
      and if losses on marginal investments can be used to offset profits on
      other investments, then the corporate tax can be viewed as risk—sharing
      by the government. As such, at least part of the tax receipts would not
      reflect any marginal investment disincentives. Fullerton and Gordon (1982)
      have argued that marginal tax rates are considerably less than average or
      cash—flow tax rates for this reason as well. Finally, if capital income
      contains abnormal profits or is measured with error, then cash flow taxes
      could again exceed the expected future taxes on a competitive marginal
      investment. Indeed, actual tax practices are not the tax minimizing
     practices assumed in this paper, firms can affect tax receipts by taking
      charitable deductions, and the marginal tax rate calculations can err
     by excluding intangible assets, depletion deductions, and other detailed
     features of tax code.

15/ In a few cases, where (16) implied negative corporate tax payments, we
     set CIT* to zero. An asset can have anegative effective tax rate as in
     Table 1, but only when we assume that the firm has a taxable return on other
     assets. It would be difficult for a firm, or especially an entire industry,
     to have negative taxes in the long run setting of our model. Note, however,
     that the leasing provisions of the 1981 Tax Act may make negative taxes
     more likely.

1.6/ As mentioned above, Gravelle (1982) considers changes in the mix of
     assets. Sleinrod (1982) includes debt/equity decisions, explained by
     clientele effects. Fullerton and Gordon (1982) include debt/equity
     decisions, explained by bankruptcy costs at the margin. They also include
     considerations of risk, with a powerful effect on marginal tax rates and
     welfare costs. Finally, Fullerton—Gordon suggest that local property taxes
     are not disincentives at the margin to the degree that mobility ensures
     compensating local public benefits. We abstract from these phenomena
     here.

17/ The discount rate is .04, the consumers' after tax rate of return in the
     model. Because the FSW model uses 1973 data, we multiply aU values by
     1.95, the ratio of 1980 to 1973 national income.

—
18/ Intersectoral uiisallocations of ACRS are probably understated because
     we assume that producers in each industry cannot substitute among
       assets. Table 1 tax  rates by asset vary much more than Table 2 tax
       rates by industry, because the latter are all averages of the former
       with different sets of weights given by columns of the capital matrix.

19/   Even when t are all the same, corporate taxes as a proportion of
      profits can differ due to different financial policies. Equation (15)
      captures ttie fact that debt financed investments are taxed at t while
      interest is deductible at rate u. Equation (14) captures the subsequent
      tax on interest income of individuals in the "personal factor tax". It
      also captures the differing property taxes and corporate franchise taxes
      by industry.

20/ See Fullerton, King, Shoven and Whalley (1980, 1981). These papers used
     observed CIT in (14) for both average and marginal tax rates. When
     corrected for the difference between 1973 and 1980 prices, those integra-
     tion results with VAT replacement fall directly between the MEL and SFL
     results reported here.
