                                             ABSTRACT

Estimates using admissions lotteries suggest that urban charter schools boost student achievement,
while charter schools in other settings do not. We explore student-level and school-level explanations
for these differences using a large sample of Massachusetts charter schools. Our results show that
urban charter schools boost achievement well beyond ambient non-charter levels (that is, the average
achievement level for urban non-charter students), and beyond non-urban achievement in math. Student
demographics explain some of these gains since urban charters are most effective for non-whites and
low-baseline achievers. At the same time, non-urban charter schools are uniformly ineffective. Our
estimates also reveal important school-level heterogeneity in the urban charter sample. A non-lottery
analysis suggests that urban schools with binding, well-documented admissions lotteries generate larger
score gains than under-subscribed urban charter schools with poor lottery records. We link the magnitude
of charter impacts to distinctive pedagogical features of urban charters such as the length of the school
day and school philosophy. The relative effectiveness of urban lottery-sample charters is accounted
for by over-subscribed urban schools' embrace of the No Excuses approach to education.

I    Introduction
A growing body of evidence suggests that urban charter schools have the potential to generate
impressive achievement gains, especially for minority students living in high-poverty areas. In a
series of studies using admissions lotteries to identify causal effects, we looked at the impact of
charter attendance in Boston and at a KIPP school in Lynn, Massachusetts (Abdulkadiroğlu et
al., 2009, 2011; Angrist et al., 2010a, 2010b). Boston and Lynn charter middle schools increase
student achievement by about 0.2 standard deviations (σ) per year in English Language Arts
(ELA) and about 0.4σ per year in math, relative to traditional public schools. Among high
school students, attendance at a Boston charter school increases student achievement by about
0.2σ per year in ELA and 0.3σ per year in math. Outside of Massachusetts, lottery studies
of charter schools in the Harlem Children’s Zone (Dobbie and Fryer, 2011) and a Washington
DC charter boarding school (Curto and Fryer, 2011) document similarly large gains. Studies of
Chicago and New York charter schools also report positive effects (Hoxby and Rockoff, 2004;
Hoxby, Murarka and Kang, 2009).
    While these results are encouraging, they come from schools operating in traditional (for
charters) urban settings. Although interest in charter schools is growing in school districts
outside central cities (see, e.g., the discussion of New York area charters in Hu, 2011), results
for more diverse sets of charter schools are also more mixed. In a recent report evaluating
roughly two dozen Massachusetts charter schools from around the state, we find little evidence
of achievement gains at schools outside of high-poverty urban areas (Angrist et al., 2011). Some
of the estimates for non-urban Massachusetts charters show significant negative effects. These
results echo findings from a multi-state study of 36 charter middle schools using admissions
lotteries (Gleason et al., 2010). Here too, charter schools outside of urban areas seem to do little
for achievement, though, as in our earlier work, urban schools with high-minority, high-poverty
enrollment generate some gains. Other studies using statistical controls rather than entrance
lotteries also document heterogeneity in the effects of charter schools. Hoxby (2004) and Zimmer
et al. (2009) find that newly opened schools are less effective than older schools. Imberman
(2011) reports that among charter schools in a large urban school district in the Southwest,
schools that began as charters have large effects on discipline and attendance, while converted
schools do not.
    Our analysis focuses on heterogeneity in the effects of charter schools across demographic
groups and between urban and non-urban areas. This breakdown is motivated by our earlier
findings for Massachusetts, and by research showing similarly heterogeneous effects for other
education alternatives. Using data on cohorts of students graduating in the early 1980s, Evans
and Schwab (1995) and Neal (1997) show that Catholic school attendance leads to increases


                                                 2
in high school graduation and college attendance. Both studies find larger benefits for black
students and for students in urban settings. Grogger et al. (2000) and Altonji et al. (2005)
report similar results on Catholic schooling for more recent cohorts. For example, Grogger et
al. report that Catholic high school attendance increases the probability of graduation by 18 to
24 percentage points for urban minority students; estimates for other groups are less than 10
percentage points and mostly insignificant.
   The analysis here reveals similar heterogeneity for charter schools in Massachusetts and
develops a framework for interpreting this heterogeneity using both student- and school-level
explanatory variables. We begin with a semiparametric analysis of heterogeneous potential
outcomes that assigns a role to variation in no-treatment counterfactuals and to charter ap-
plicants’ demographic characteristics and baseline scores. This investigation also includes a
Oaxaca-Blinder (1973) style decomposition of the urban charter advantage.
   We then turn to an analysis that attempts to isolate school-level characteristics that might
explain differences in charter school effectiveness. Our school-level investigation of charter effect
heterogeneity is built on a set of observational (i.e., non-lottery) estimates that rely on statistical
controls to eliminate selection bias. We show that in the sample of schools for which lotteries
can be used to capture causal effects, the observational analysis does a good job of replicating
lottery-based findings. At the same time, the observational analysis suggests that the sample of
urban schools for which a lottery-based analysis is feasible, that is, over-subscribed schools with
good historical lottery records, boost scores more than other urban charter schools. Our school-
level analysis explains the difference in effectiveness between lottery and non-lottery schools as
well as the urban charter advantage.
   The next section details school participation, describes the data, and outlines our empirical
strategy for the lottery analysis. Section III presents the findings that motivate our investi-
gation of charter effect heterogeneity. Section IV outlines the econometric framework used to
investigate this heterogeneity and reports the results of our investigation. These results show
that students at urban charters in the lottery sample are typical of the urban student popula-
tion, and that urban charter attendance boosts achievement well beyond ambient non-charter
levels. Student demographics and baseline scores play a role in this – urban schools work best
for minority students and students with low baseline scores – but non-urban charters are largely
ineffective. Section V compares observational and lottery-based estimates in the subsample for
which a lottery-based analysis is possible and discusses a school-level analysis of the observa-
tional estimates. Urban and lottery-sample charter effectiveness can be explained by adherence
to a No Excuses approach to urban education that emphasizes instruction time, comportment,
and focuses on traditional math and reading skills. Conditional on No Excuses status, factors
such as time in school and teacher characteristics have little predictive value for school-specific


                                                  3
effects. Finally, consistent with the No Excuses explanation of the urban charter advantage, we
show that urban charter attendance boosts the likelihood that charter applicants are subject to
disciplinary action, while non-urban charter attendance has no effect on this outcome.


II       Lottery Analysis: Data and Empirical Strategy
We attempted to collect lottery data for the set of Massachusetts charter schools serving middle
and high school grades and meeting a set of pre-specified eligibility criteria.1 The school selection
process is detailed in Table 1. To be eligible for our analysis, schools had to accept students
in the relevant entry grades (4th-7th grade for middle school and 9th grade for high school).
We excluded closed schools and alternative schools serving non-traditional populations (usually
students at risk of dropping out). We also excluded schools that opened after the 2009-2010
school year. The resulting set of eligible schools includes 27 of the 54 charters serving middle
school grades and eight of 37 schools serving high school grades.2 Three eligible schools serve
both middle and high school grades, so there are 32 eligible campuses.3 Some eligible schools
are not included in the lottery analysis; some were under-subscribed, while others failed to
keep sufficient lottery records. The final sample of over-subscribed schools with usable records
includes 16 middle schools and six high schools. These schools are listed in Table A1. Nine of
the lottery-study participating middle schools are in urban areas, with seven of these in Boston,
one inside Interstate Highway 495, and one near the Rhode Island border. The other seven are
in non-urban areas, three in the center of the state, one on Cape Cod, two inside I-495, and one
near the New Hampshire border. Four participating high schools are in Boston. One non-urban
high school in the lottery sample is on Cape Cod, and the other is near Springfield.
       Much of our analysis focuses on differences between charter schools in urban and non-urban
areas. This distinction is motivated by the evidence, reported here and elsewhere, that charter
schools serving heavily minority, high-poverty student populations in urban areas are more likely
to boost achievement than are other sorts of charter schools, and by similar findings for Catholic
schools (Gleason et al., 2010; Grogger et al., 2000).4 To document differences in charter school
   1
       We focus on middle and high schools because data for elementary school lotteries are much less widely
available. Moreover, pre-lottery test scores – a key component of the observational analysis – are unavailable for
elementary school applicants.
   2
     Many charters extend through the high school grades but do not have entrance lotteries for high school.
   3
     Schools are classified as both middle and high if they have entrance lotteries at both levels, or if lottery
records at the middle school level were available early enough for participants to be observed in high school. Our
universe includes 69 unique schools.
   4
     We define urban areas to be those in which the local district superintendent participates in the Massachusetts
Urban Superintendents Network. In our sample, the distinction between urban and non-urban charter schools is
essentially identical to splits based on fraction eligible for free lunch or fraction minority.


                                                           4
practices across areas, we surveyed the full set of eligible charter schools, regardless of the
quality of their lottery records. Among 32 eligible schools, 28 school administrators completed
this survey; we received a total of 30 responses since two surveyed schools are eligible at both
the middle and high school levels.
   Our survey revealed important differences between urban and non-urban charter schools.
Table 2 summarizes the survey responses. Urban schools are younger than non-urban schools;
in Spring 2010, the average urban school had been open for 8.2 years, while the average non-
urban school had been open for 11.4 years. Urban charter schools also run a longer school day
and year than do non-urban schools. The average urban charter year lasts 189 days and has a
school day of 464 minutes, compared to 183 days and 422 minutes at non-urban schools. The
additional time appears to go to increased math and reading instruction; urban schools spend
35 extra minutes per day on math and 40 extra minutes per day on reading. Urban charter
schools are also 38 percent more likely to have Saturday school.
   Our survey also covers aspects of school philosophy and organization. Urban charter schools
are more likely than non-urban charters to require parents to sign a contract (82 percent com-
pared to 46 percent), to require students to sign a contract (71 percent compared to 55 percent),
and to use uniforms (88 percent compared to 73 percent). Urban charter schools are also much
more likely to use a formal reward and punishment system to shape student behavior; 65 per-
cent of urban schools use such a system, while only 18 percent of non-urban schools do so. The
survey results reveal a sharp division between urban and non-urban charters with respect to
the No Excuses approach to education. As discussed by Thernstrom and Thernstrom (2003)
and Carter (2000), No Excuses principles include a strict disciplinary environment, an emphasis
on student behavior and comportment, extended time in school, and an intensive focus on tra-
ditional reading and math skills. Seventy-one percent of urban charter administrators identify
somewhat or fully with No Excuses, while no non-urban charter identifies with this approach.
   The bottom rows of Table 2 compare the inputs and resources used by urban and non-urban
charter schools. Urban schools are more likely to be eligible for Title I status and have somewhat
higher per-pupil expenditures than non-urban charter schools ($14,095 compared to $11,090).
On the other hand, student/teacher ratios at urban and non-urban charters are similar. Urban
schools have younger teachers as measured by proportions under age 32 and over age 49, and are
more likely to hire paid tutors to work with their students. Teacher departures, requirements
to take student calls after hours, and the use of unpaid tutors and volunteers are similar across
the two types of schools.

Student Data

The student-level data used in our analysis comes from an administrative record-keeping sys-
tem with complete coverage of the students enrolled in Massachusetts’ public schools.5 Our
coverage period runs from the 2001-2002 school year through the 2009-2010 school year. The
administrative records include information on student race/ethnicity, gender, special education
status, limited English proficiency status, free/reduced-price lunch status, town of residence,
and school(s) of attendance, as well as raw and scaled scores on Massachusetts Comprehen-
sive Assessment System (MCAS) exams. The MCAS is a set of high-stakes standardized tests
given to students in Massachusetts’ public schools in grades 3 through 8 and 10. The primary
outcomes analyzed in our study are MCAS scores in math and English Language Arts (ELA).
Outcomes are post-lottery test scores in grades 4 through 8 for middle school and 10 for high
school. The data appendix provides details on the availability of outcomes for each applicant
cohort. For the purposes of this project, raw MCAS scores were standardized to have mean zero
and standard deviation one by subject, grade level, and year.
       Our data processing protocol assigns students to a single school for every year they appear
in the data, even if they attended more than one school in a given year. Typically, students
appearing on the roster of more than one school were assigned to the school they attended
longest, though students with any time in a charter school in a given year are coded as having
been a charter student for the year. If a student attended more than one charter, the student
was assigned to the charter he or she attended the longest.
       The analysis sample for the lottery study was constructed by matching applicant records from
the 16 participating middle schools and six participating high schools to administrative records
using applicants’ name, year, and grade. Where available, information on date of birth, town of
residence, race/ethnicity, and gender was used to break ties. Ninety-two percent of applicants
were matched. Applicants were excluded from the lottery analysis if they were disqualified
from the lottery they entered (this mostly affected applicants to the wrong grade level). We
also dropped siblings of current students, late applicants, and out-of-area applicants.6 Students
missing baseline demographic information in the state database were dropped as well.
   5
       This is known as the Student Information Management System, or SIMS. See the data appendix for details.
   6
       Charter schools typically give priority to sibling applicants, as well as to students in the local school district
(or sometimes region) in which they are located. Our applicant risk sets (discussed in the next section) distinguish
between in-area and out-of-area applicants for schools that take substantial numbers of both. At schools with
fewer than five out-of-area applicants, those out-of-area were dropped.

Descriptive Statistics

We begin with a statistical picture of the Massachusetts student population in traditional public
and charter schools. Table 3 shows descriptive statistics for students enrolled in traditional
public schools, students enrolled in eligible charter schools, and the sample of students who
applied to oversubscribed charters participating in the lottery study, separately for urban and
non-urban areas. Traditional schools are defined as those that are not charters, alternative,
special education, exam, or magnet schools. For the six groups described in the table, we
report average demographic characteristics, program participation rates, and average baseline
test scores. Baseline scores are from 4th grade for middle school and 8th grade for high school.
   Traditional urban students look very different from traditional students in the rest of the
state. Specifically, urban students are more likely to be black or Hispanic, to be English language
learners (or of limited English proficiency, LEP), to participate in special education, and to
receive a subsidized lunch. Urban students also have much lower baseline test scores than other
public school students: urban students score 0.43σ and 0.46σ below the state average on math
and ELA tests at the middle school level, respectively, and they score 0.42σ and 0.39σ below the
average at the high school level. In contrast, non-urban students score 0.21σ and 0.23σ above
the average at the middle school level; the corresponding non-urban advantages in high school
are 0.27σ and 0.28σ.
   Eligible charter school students who live in urban and non-urban areas are more similar
to their peers in regular public schools than to one another. There are, however, important
differences by charter status as well. Urban charter schools serve a much higher fraction of black
students than do urban public schools. Urban charter students are also less likely to be limited
English proficient, to participate in special education, or to qualify for subsidized lunch. Charter
school students in both urban and non-urban areas have slightly higher baseline test scores than
their public school counterparts. Applicants to charter schools with observed entrance lotteries
are similar to the population of enrolled charter students in both urban and non-urban areas.


Empirical Strategy

The lottery-based identification strategy captures causal effects for applicants to over-subscribed
charters with high quality lottery records. The second-stage equation in this context is
                                              X
                         yigt = α2t + β2g +       δj dij + Xi0 θ + τ sigt + igt ,              (1)
                                              j

where yigt is a test score for student i in grade g in year t, α2t and β2g are year and grade
effects, Xi is a vector of pre-lottery demographic characteristics (race, special education, limited



                                                   7
English proficiency, subsidized lunch status, and a female-minority interaction), and igt repre-
sents random fluctuations in test scores. The set of dij includes a separate dummy variable for
every combination of observed charter school lotteries (indexed by j) entered by students in the
lottery sample. In what follows, we refer to these as “risk sets.” The variable of interest, sigt ,
measures years spent in charter schools between application and test dates.7 The parameter τ
captures the causal effect of charter school attendance.
       OLS estimates of equation (1) may be biased because students do not choose to attend
charter schools randomly. We therefore use a dummy variable, Zi , indicating lottery offers as
an instrument for time spent in charter school. The first stage for our 2SLS procedure is
                                                    X
                               sigt = α1t + β1g +         κj dij + Xi0 µ + πZi + ηigt ,                        (2)
                                                      j

where π is the effect of a lottery offer on charter attendance. As in the second stage equation,
the first stage includes risk set controls and baseline demographic characteristics, as well as year
and grade effects. Over-identified models introduce risk-set-specific first-stage effects (πj ∗dij Zi ).
       Because lottery offers are randomly assigned within risk sets, they are likely to be indepen-
dent of family background, student ability or motivation, and any other unobserved charac-
teristics of charter applicants. The appendix presents evidence in support of our lottery-based
identification strategy. Specifically, Table A2 shows that conditional on risk set, winning the
lottery is uncorrelated with student characteristics, which suggests that randomization was suc-
cessful. Table A3 shows that we find followup scores for 91 percent of middle school applicants
and 78 percent of high school applicants. In middle school, we are one percent more likely to
find followup scores for lottery winners, but this imbalance is unlikely to explain the treatment
effects discussed below.
       Equations (1) and (2) describe a just-identified system with one endogenous variable and
one instrument. The 2SLS estimate of τ can be obtained by taking the ratio of the reduced
form effect of Zi on yigt and the first stage effect of Zi on sigt . The reduced form has the same
data structure and regressors as equation (2), replacing sigt with yigt on the left-hand side. In
an effort to increase the precision of our estimates, we also estimate overidentified models that
allow the first stage effect to vary by risk set. In regressions for high school, only 10th grade test
scores are included, and we cluster standard errors at the school-grade-year level. In regressions
for middle school, we include the full set of non-repeat post-lottery test scores through 8th grade
and add a second layer of clustering at the student level.
   7
       Our definition of sigt includes years spent at any charter school, including those without available lottery
records. This specification is based on a simple benchmark with homogeneous treatment effects across charter
schools. We investigate school-level heterogeneity in Section V.




                                                           8
   Differences in effectiveness between urban and non-urban charter schools are a primary focus
of our analysis, so we also generate separate estimates for these two groups. These estimates
are produced using equations of the form
                                         X
                    yigt = α2t + β2g +       δj dij + Xi0 θ + τu suigt + τn snigt + igt ,      (3)
                                         j

where suigt and snigt are years in urban and non-urban charter schools. The first stage for urban
attendance can be written
                                         X
                   suigt = α1t + β1g +       κj dij + Xi0 µ + πu Ziu + πn Zin + ηigt ,          (4)
                                         j

where Ziu and Zin indicate offers from urban and non-urban lotteries, with a similar specification
for non-urban attendance.


III    Lottery Estimates
Charter school lottery offers increase the average duration of charter school attendance sharply.
The first stage estimates reported in column (1) of Table 4 show that among applicants to
charter middle schools, students who win a charter school lottery spend about 1 more year in a
charter before being tested than do students not offered a seat. Applicants who win high school
lotteries spend about half a year more attending a charter school than applicants who lose the
lottery before taking MCAS tests. These first stage estimates are similar to those reported in
Abdulkadiroğlu et al. (2011) for a smaller sample of charter schools in Boston.
   Middle school lottery winners outscore lottery losers by 0.06σ in ELA and 0.21σ in math.
These reduced form estimates can be seen in column (2) of Table 4. High school lottery winners
outperform lottery losers by about 0.11σ in ELA, 0.16σ in math, 0.16σ in Writing Composition,
and 0.14σ in Writing Topic Development. These estimates, like the middle school results, are
precisely estimated and significantly different from zero.
   Because the middle school first stage is close to one, middle school 2SLS estimates differ little
from the corresponding reduced form estimates. The estimates shown in column (3) of Table 4
imply that a year of attendance at a lottery sample charter middle school increases ELA scores
by 0.07σ and math scores by 0.21σ. Column (4) reports 2SLS estimates from overidentified
models that include a full set of risk set and offer interactions as instruments. The results here
are close to the just-identified estimates in column (3), though estimates from the overidentified
models are slightly more precise.
   The high school 2SLS estimates imply larger causal effects than those found for middle
schools. The score gains generated by time spent in charter high schools are on the order of

                                                    9
0.22σ per year for ELA and 0.32σ per year for math. Writing gains also are estimated to be
substantial; a year of charter attendance increases Writing Topic scores by 0.30σ and Writing
Composition scores by 0.27σ. As in middle school, the high school results from overidentified
models are close to the corresponding just identified estimates.
   Estimates for the pooled state sample mask considerable heterogeneity by school type, a
pattern documented in Table 5. Although first stage effects at urban and non-urban middle
schools are similar, second stage middle school estimates differ sharply. The 2SLS estimates for
urban middle schools, reported in column (3) of Table 5, suggest these schools generate gains
of about 0.14σ in ELA and 0.34σ in math per year. By contrast, the estimates for non-urban
charter middle schools are negative. In particular, as can be seen in column (6), charter students
at non-urban middle schools are estimated to lose ground relative to their public school peers
at a rate of 0.16σ per year in both ELA and math. Not surprisingly, the high school lottery
results for urban schools are similar to the statewide results (since only two of the high schools
in the state sample are non-urban). The 2SLS estimates for non-urban charter high schools are
uniformly negative, but too imprecise to be conclusive.
   Subgroup variation in charter effects is documented in Tables 6 and 7, separately for urban
and non-urban schools. These tables report the results of estimating equation (3) by 2SLS in
various subsamples of students. Urban charter schools boost scores for most subgroups, though
not uniformly. Girls realize larger gains in math, while boys see larger ELA gains. Black and
Hispanic students benefit considerably from urban charter attendance in middle school, but the
estimated math gains for whites are smaller and there is no increase in whites’ ELA scores.
Urban charter middle schools appear to produce especially large achievement gains for students
eligible for a subsidized lunch and for those with low baseline scores. Attendance at urban
charter high schools increases math scores in every group and raises reading scores for everyone
except whites, though positive high school effects on reading are not always significantly different
from zero.
   Non-urban charter attendance fails to raise scores for any of the subgroups examined in
Table 7, apparently reducing achievement for girls, whites, and students with low baseline scores.
Estimates for black and Hispanic students are not significantly different from zero. A year of
non-urban charter middle school reduces free-lunch students’ ELA scores by 0.20σ, and reduces
math scores in this group by 0.17σ, though the latter estimate is not statistically significant.
Most of the estimates for non-urban high school charters are negative, though effects here are
imprecise (estimates for black and Hispanic students are omitted due to small samples sizes in
these non-urban groups).

IV     Differences in Students
We investigate student- and school-level explanations for the striking difference in causal effects
at urban and non-urban charter schools. The student-level analysis is cast in a semiparamet-
ric framework with heterogeneous potential outcomes, indexed against a Bernoulli treatment,
Di ∈ {0, 1}, to indicate charter attendance. The Bernoulli setup focuses on heterogeneity while
abstracting from nonlinearities that seem second-order in this context (since the first stage effects
of lottery offers are similar in the two settings for middle school, yet the effects there differ most
dramatically). Let Y1i and Y0i denote potential test scores for student i in and out of charter
schools, and let Ui ∈ {u, n} indicate residence in an urban or non-urban area. The observed
outcome for student i is
                                        Yi = Y0i + (Y1i − Y0i )Di .

In other words, we observe Y0i for applicants who don’t go to charter school and Y1i for those
who do.
   Although our empirical work uses data from many lotteries, the analysis of heterogeneity is
explained with reference to a single lottery. Offers in this lottery are indicated by Zi , as before.
Potential treatment assignments, denoted D1i and D0i , tell us whether student i attends a
charter school if he wins or loses the lottery. Offers are randomly assigned and assumed to affect
test scores only through charter attendance, so the potential outcome vector (Y1i , Y0i , D1i , D0i )
is independent of Zi . We also assume that winning an entrance lottery can only make charter
attendance more likely, so that D1i ≥ D0i ∀i, with strict inequality for some students.
   Under these assumptions, instrumental variables estimation using Zi as an instrument for Di
in the sample of lottery applicants produces a local average treatment effect (LATE; Imbens and
Angrist, 1994). Here, LATE is the effect of charter attendance for students induced to enroll in
a charter school by winning an admissions lottery (the compliers, who have D1i > D0i ). When
computed separately for urban and non-urban students, IV estimates identify

                                   El [Yi |Zi = 1] − El [Yi |Zi = 0]
                            τl ≡
                                   El [Di |Zi = 1] − El [Di |Zi = 0]
                                   = El [Y1i − Y0i |D1i > D0i ], l ∈ {u, n};

where l indexes location and El denotes an expectation over students in location l. This is LATE
in each setting.
   We analyze three sources of student-level heterogeneity that might account for the difference
between τu and τn . The first is the urban/non-urban difference in treated and non-treated
counterfactuals (that is, distinct differences in average Y1i and Y0i ). This investigation tells us
whether the urban charter advantage reflects high scores in the treated state, low non-treated


                                                    11
outcomes, or both. The second is variation in Y0i across charter and non-charter students
within each area. This tells us whether lottery compliers are unusual in either setting. Finally,
we decompose the difference in charter effectiveness across urban and non-urban areas into a
component due to differences in student populations and a component due to differences in
effectiveness conditional on characteristics.


The Urban Gap in Treatment and No-Treatment Counterfactuals

The urban charter advantage can be broken down into two parts, the first capturing differences in
potential outcomes in the treated state (differences in Y1i ) and the second capturing differences
in potential outcomes in the non-treated state (differences in Y0i ). Specifically, we have

                          τu − τn = Eu [Y1i |D1i > D0i ] − En [Y1i |D1i > D0i ]                                  (5)
                                    |                    {z                  }
                                                           γ1

                                         − (Eu [Y0i |D1i > D0i ] − En [Y0i |D1i > D0i ]) .
                                           |                     {z                    }
                                                                     γ0

Here, γ1 measures the difference in treated outcomes for compliers at urban and non-urban
charter schools, while γ0 measures the difference in non-treated outcomes between these two
groups.
       Pooling urban and non-urban charter applicants, we estimate γ0 using
                                                                                        X
                     Yi (1 − Di ) = ψ(1 − Di ) + γ0 (1 − Di ) · 1{Ui = u} +                 δj dij + i ,        (6)
                                                                                        j

with first stage
                                                 X               X
                                     1 − Di =         κj dij +       πj dij Zi + ηi .                            (7)

The first stage equation for the interaction between 1 − Di and urban status uses the same
specification as equation (7).8 For a model without covariates, Abadie (2003) shows that 2SLS
estimation of this type of system produces estimates of marginal mean counterfactuals for com-
pliers; in this case, the 2SLS estimate is the mean of Y0i for compliers. (We estimate γ1 using
a model that replaces (1 − Di ) with Di in equations (6) and (7).) Our parameterization differs
from Abadie’s in two ways. First, we are interested in the difference in marginal mean outcomes
between urban and non-urban compliers: ψ equals the average of Y0i for lottery compliers in
non-urban areas, while ψ + γ0 is the average of Y0i for compliers in urban areas. Second, our
estimating equation includes a saturated model for risk sets. In this case, the 2SLS estimands
are weighted averages of mean Y0i for compliers across risk sets, with weights proportional to
   8
       Since applicants to urban and non-urban charter schools are disjoint sets, the main effect for urban status is
collinear with the dij and therefore omitted.

the variance of the first-stage fitted values in the risk set (this is a consequence of Theorem 3 in
Angrist and Imbens 1995).9
       Our analysis of counterfactuals is limited to middle schools since the sample of non-urban
high school charter students is too small to produce useful estimates of γ1 and γ0 . Columns (1)
and (2) of Table 8 show 2SLS estimates of urban and non-urban charter effects using scores one
year after application. Column (3), which reports τu − τn , shows that the difference in charter
effects by urban status is 0.37σ in ELA and 0.72σ in math. Columns (4) and (5) show that
differences in non-charter fallback can account for the full urban charter advantage in math and
most of the advantage in ELA. The estimates of γ0 imply that in public schools, non-urban
compliers outscore urban compliers by 0.71σ in ELA and 0.63σ in math. In charter schools,
non-urban compliers outscore urban compliers by only 0.33σ in ELA, and urban compliers score
0.09σ higher in math (though this estimate is not statistically significant).
       Figure 1 presents a schematic representation of the results in Table 8. Urban charter middle
schools serve populations with very low non-charter achievement, well below that of students in
non-urban charters. The charter treatment pulls these students up to a level close to that of
non-urban students (beyond these students in math, below them in ELA). Thus, it seems fair to
see urban gains as recovery from a low base, though as we show next, this level is typical of all
urban students in the state. By contrast, while non-urban charter students start out well ahead
of their urban counterparts, the non-urban charter treatment pulls them back.


Non-treated Gaps in Urban and Non-urban Areas

Instead of comparing the no-treatment outcomes of urban compliers to the corresponding out-
comes of non-urban compliers, we can benchmark achievement in each area using the local
non-charter mean. This tells us whether the urban charter advantage is driven by unusually low
no-treatment outcomes for compliers, or whether urban lottery compliers are, in fact, typical
of their milieu. Figure 2 illustrates the alternative scenarios we have in mind: the left panel
describes a situation in which the achievement of untreated urban students is comparable to
ambient non-charter achievement, while the right panel describes a situation in which the urban
fallback is unusually low.
       The econometric analysis of within-area counterfactuals begins with a decomposition of urban
   9
       For example, the probability limit of the 2SLS estimate of ψ in equation (6) is
                                  X  Nj ·π2 ·V ar(Zi |dij =1) 

and non-urban LATE as follows:

                        τl = El [Y1i |D1i > D0i ] − El [Y0i |Di = 0]                                                       (8)
                             |                {z                   }
                                                  λl1

                                    |                 {z                    }
                                                          λl0


The term λl0 is the difference in average Y0i between lottery compliers and the general population
of non-charter students in the relevant area. The term λl1 is the difference between the treated
outcomes of compliers and ambient non-charter achievement. In urban schools, for example,
large λu1 and small λu0 mean that urban charters push their students beyond typical non-charter
achievement in cities.
       The decomposition in (8) is estimated using equations of the form
                                                                     X

                                                                      j

estimated separately for urban and non-urban students, with the same first stage specification as
equation (7). Here, the 2SLS estimand is a weighted average of Y0i for lottery compliers across
risk sets. To estimate E[Y0i |Di = 0, Ui = l], we omit risk set controls and estimate equation
(9) by OLS in a sample of students that includes both applicants and non-applicants. The OLS
estimand is thus a simple average of Yi for non-charter students in location l. Assuming that
mean Y0i is constant across risk sets for compliers, λl0 is the difference between the 2SLS and
OLS estimates of ∆. λl1 is estimated by replacing (1 − Di ) with Di in equation (9).10
       Estimates of equation (9) for urban middle and high schools appear in Table 9. Columns (2)-
(4) show results from regressions that include non-applicants. Specifically, column (2) reports
the average Y0i for non-charter students, while column (3) shows λu0 , the difference in average
outcomes for compliers and non-charter students. Estimates of λu1 , the difference between the
treated outcomes of urban compliers and the ambient level of urban achievement, appear in
column 4.11 The estimates of λu0 suggest that urban lottery compliers are positively selected
from the urban middle school population, but the estimated gaps are small, and marginally
  10
       Standard errors for the difference between the 2SLS and OLS estimates were constructed using a stacked
data set that includes two copies of each observation. Let h ∈ {1, 2} index halves of the data, and define
Eihk = 1{h = k} for k ∈ {1, 2}. We estimate
                                                                                             X

     Middle school scores are from the year after the lottery for applicants and 6th grade for non-applicants; high
school scores are from 10th grade as always.

significant only for middle school ELA (λu0 for high school is virtually zero in both subjects).
Because urban charter compliers have non-charter achievement levels that are fairly typical
of students in urban areas, the large score gains generated by urban charter schools can be
attributed to high scores in the treated state.
   The last three columns of Table 9 compare the scores of urban compliers with a non-charter
benchmark computed excluding students who do not apply to charter schools. The resulting
estimates of λu0 , reported in column (6), are even smaller than those in column (3). Thus, among
applicants to charter schools, the non-charter achievement levels of compliers and non-attenders
are virtually identical. Urban charter schools therefore push the scores of compliers well beyond
the average non-charter achievement levels of all of their applicants.
   Table 10 reports estimates of λn0 and λn1 for students at non-urban middle schools. As in
urban areas, the non-charter achievement level of non-urban compliers is slightly higher than
that of students in the surrounding public schools. The ELA scores of non-urban compliers
in public schools exceed the ambient non-urban achievement level by a statistically significant
0.12σ, while the estimate of λn1 for ELA is a precisely estimated −0.08σ. This implies that non-
urban charter middle schools move their students from atypically high ELA achievement levels
down to levels that are slightly below those of non-charter non-urban students. Non-charter
math achievement of non-urban compliers is statistically indistinguishable from the ambient
non-charter level, while non-urban charter attendance pulls compliers 0.19σ below the non-
charter mean. As with urban applicants, the average level of Y0i for non-urban compliers is very
close to that of applicants who do not attend charter schools; both estimates of λn0 reported in
column (6) are statistically insignificant and small. Since positive selection on Y0i is reduced
when non-applicants are excluded, the estimates of λn1 in column 7 show sharper declines than
the corresponding estimates including non-applicants in column 4.
   Combined with the estimates of γ0 and γ1 in Table 8, these results paint a consistent picture
of the urban charter advantage. Urban middle school charters push the scores of their students
from a typically low level up to a level much closer to the average level of achievement among
non-urban charter students (the scenario sketched in the left panel of Figure 2). Non-urban
charter middle schools reduce the scores of their students, in some cases markedly so. The
non-urban high school sample is too small for precise comparisons of the outcomes of urban
and non-urban compliers, but the results for urban charter high schools look broadly similar
to those for middle schools: charter high schools raise the scores of urban students by pushing
them beyond the level of high school achievement typical of urban areas.




                                                  15
Accounting for Student Demographics

We explore the role of student demographics in generating the urban charter advantage with
the help of a decomposition in the spirit of Blinder (1973) and Oaxaca (1973). The first step
uses the methods of Abadie (2003) to identify a linear local average response function for lottery
compliers conditional on a vector of observable demographic variables, Xi . Specifically, we have
                                                                                 X
            El [Yi |D1i > D0i , Di , Xi , dij ] = Xi0 θl + ωl Di + Di Xi0 ρl +       δj dij , l ∈ {u, n}.   (10)
                                                                                 j

This equation has a causal interpretation because conditional on being a complier, treatment
(charter enrollment) is ignorable. Abadie (2003) shows that 2SLS using Bernoulli instruments
for a Bernoulli treatment consistently estimates this sort of linear model for local average causal
response.
   Equation (10) generates the following parameterization of the urban/non-urban difference
in charter school attendance effects:

                          τu − τn = (ωu − ωn ) + X̄n0 (ρu − ρn ) + (X̄u0 − X̄n0 )ρu ,                       (11)

where
                                            X̄l ≡ El [Xi |D1i > D0i ].

The last term in equation (11) captures the part of the urban charter advantage explained by
differences in demographics. In particular, this term tells us how much smaller the effects of
urban charter schools would be if they served the same mix of students as do non-urban schools.
The first two terms capture the component of the urban advantage attributable to differences
in effects within demographic groups.
   Here, as always, Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions can be presented in two ways. In this case,
the urban/non-urban difference in charter school effects can be decomposed with differences in
means weighted by non-urban charter impacts instead of urban. Specifically, we can write

                          τu − τn = (ωu − ωn ) + X̄u0 (ρu − ρn ) + (X̄u0 − X̄n0 )ρn .                       (12)

Like equation (11), this expression includes components associated with differences in demo-
graphics and differences in effectiveness conditional on demographics. The last term measures
how much more effective non-urban charter schools would be if their students were demograph-
ically similar to the urban charter population.
   We construct these decompositions by estimating
                                                                    X

and dummies for performance at the advanced, proficient, or needs improvement level on baseline
math and ELA tests.12 Complier means for each component of Xi are estimated using the kappa-
weighting procedure described in Abadie (2003).
       Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions suggest that favorable demographics enhance urban charter
effectiveness, but differences in student populations do not fully account for the urban charter
advantage. This can be seen in Table 11, which reports the components of equations (11) and
(12) for middle schools. (The non-urban high school samples are too small to admit meaningful
investigations of effect heterogeneity using this approach.) Column (1) shows the difference in
charter middle school treatment effects by urban status.13 Columns (2) and (3) report the com-
ponents of decomposition (11), which multiplies the urban/non-urban difference in demographics
by treatment effects for urban schools. Column (2) shows how urban effectiveness might change
if urban schools were to serve the non-urban population. These results suggest that 63 percent
of the urban advantage in ELA (0.25/0.40) can be explained by student demographics. The
corresponding estimate for math is 49 percent. Urban schools are especially effective for poor
and minority students, and they serve more of these students than do non-urban schools. On the
other hand, column (3) shows that even with the same student mix as non-urban charter schools,
urban charters would be more effective than non-urban charters, especially in math. The urban
charter advantage can therefore be attributed to a combination of student demographics and
larger treatment effects within demographic groups.
       At the same time, columns (4) and (5), which report the results of estimating decomposition
(12) using non-urban treatment effects to load covariate differences, show that the urban char-
ter advantage would shrink little if non-urban schools served an urban demographic: student
characteristics account for only 14 percent (0.06/0.40) and 37 percent (0.25/0.68) of the urban
advantages in ELA and math, respectively. The results here are much less precise than those
based on decomposition (11), reflecting the fact that ρn is estimated less precisely than ρu . Still,
this juxtaposition provides a useful summary of the underlying finding that non-urban charter
schools are largely ineffective across subgroups.
  12
       These score categories are used to determine whether schools in Massachusetts meet the Adequate Yearly
Progress (AYP) standard under No Child Left Behind (NCLB).
  13
     These differences differ slightly from those reported in Table 8 because equation (13) imposes first stage
coefficients that are constant across risk sets, while the earlier estimates allow the first stage coefficients to vary.

V     Differences in Schools
Our exploration of school-level heterogeneity in achievement effects is founded on observational
estimates. Specifically, controlling for observable student characteristics, we estimate nonexper-
imental treatment effects for every eligible charter school in the state (that is, for middle and
high schools serving traditional students, open during the relevant time period, and meeting
the entry grade restrictions described in Section II). This observational identification strategy
is first validated by comparing observational and lottery-based estimates in the lottery sample.
    The validated observational analysis serves two purposes. First, an observational identifica-
tion strategy allows us to compare effects for eligible charter schools with and without lottery
records. If oversubscribed schools with usable lottery records differ systematically from other
schools, then our lottery analysis may give an incomplete picture of charter effectiveness. Second,
since the observational analysis includes schools and cohorts without available lottery informa-
tion, we can use this approach to generate more precise school-specific estimates.


Observational Framework

Our observational estimates use a combination of matching and regression to control for observed
differences between students attending different types of schools. Specifically, students attending
lottery-eligible charters are matched to a control sample with the same baseline school, baseline
year, sex, race, limited English proficiency status, special education status, and subsidized lunch
status. Charter students are matched if they fall into a cell that includes at least one regular
public school student; likewise, regular public school students are matched if they fall into in
a cell that includes at least one student in an eligible charter school. Therefore, every charter
student in the matched sample is compared to at least one demographically similar student from
the same cohort and sending school. This procedure yields matches for 77 percent of students
in eligible charter schools.
    Within the matched sample, causal effects (denoted τo ) are estimated using the following
model for student i from cell c, observed in grade g in year t:

                               yigtc = αt + βg + ιc + b0i θ + Sigts
                                                               0
                                                                    τo + igts                (14)

Sigtc is a vector of years spent in schools of various types (eligible charter schools, ineligible
charter schools, alternative schools, and exam schools in urban and non-urban areas) for student
i from baseline through year t, and bi is a vector of student i’s baseline scores on math, ELA, and
(in high school) Writing Topic and Writing Composition tests. Importantly, these models also
include fixed effects for the cells constructed in the matching procedure (represented by ιc ), so
that the observational regressions implicitly compare the outcomes of demographically similar

                                                     18
students from the same sending schools and cohorts who later spend different amounts of time
in charter schools. The middle school analysis looks at effects on test scores in grades 5 through
8, while the high school analysis looks at 10th grade scores. Standard errors are clustered as in
the lottery analysis.
   The comparison of observational and lottery-based estimates is encouraging. Table 12 re-
ports estimates of a version of equation (14) that distinguish between eligible charter schools
with and without usable lottery records. As shown in columns (1) and (2), observational esti-
mates for schools in the urban lottery sample are strikingly similar to the lottery results. For
example, the observational regressions suggest that a year in an urban lottery school increases
middle school scores by 0.17σ and 0.28σ in ELA and math; the corresponding lottery-based
estimates are 0.14σ and 0.34σ. The observational and lottery estimates for urban charter high
schools are also close. These results suggest that the combination of matching and regression
accounts for much of the selection into charter attendance in urban areas, an important find-
ing in its own right. Interestingly, estimates for non-lottery urban schools are smaller than
the corresponding estimates for lottery schools; for middle school, the estimates for non-lottery
schools are negative and statistically significant. This is further evidence of the importance of
school-level heterogeneity in charter attendance effects.
   Among estimates of attendance effects at eligible non-urban charter schools, the match be-
tween lottery estimates and observational results for schools with lottery records is not as good
as for urban schools, though the two research designs generate qualitatively similar conclusions.
For middle schools, estimated effects are negative using both lottery-based and observational
techniques, but the observational estimates are considerably smaller. Observational estimates
for high schools suggest small positive effects of non-urban charter attendance, while the lot-
tery estimates are negative (though imprecise). Observational estimates for non-urban middle
schools are reasonably similar across the lottery and non-lottery samples. Since both of the eli-
gible non-urban high schools are part of the lottery sample, estimates for non-urban non-lottery
high schools are not reported.


Explaining School-Specific Effects

Lottery and observational identification strategies generate broadly similar estimates in the
sample of schools where they can be compared. This finding motivates an analysis of school-
specific treatment effects estimated with observational techniques. The school-specific estimates
come from a version of equation (14) that includes separate variables measuring years spent in
each eligible charter school. These estimates are then linked to school policies and characteristics




                                                19
using the following school-level regression:

                                 τ̂s = φ0 + φ1 Us + φ2 Ls + φ3 Hs + Ps0 φ4 + us ,                              (15)

where τˆs is an observational estimate of the effect of charter school s, Us is an urban dummy,
Ls is a lottery sample dummy, Hs is a high school dummy, and Ps is a vector of school policies
and characteristics measured in our survey. The estimates of this equation are weighted by
the reciprocal of the standard error of the estimated treatment effect. Standard errors are
clustered at the school level to account for the fact that some schools contribute both middle
and high-school estimates to the sample.
       Not surprisingly given our earlier findings, estimates of equation (14) show substantially
larger treatment efffects at urban and lottery sample schools. These effects are reported in
columns (1) and (5) of Table 13, which show estimates of equation (15) including only Us ,
Ls , and Hs on the right-hand side. Eligible urban schools produce achievement gains that are
0.20σ and 0.12σ larger than the effects of non-urban schools in math and ELA; lottery-sample
schools generate gains that are 0.15σ and 0.10σ larger than the effects of non-lottery schools.
Columns (2) and (4) add instruction time (minutes per day and in the relevant subject) and per-
pupil expenditures to the model. Increased time in the classroom is increasingly promoted as a
means of increasing student achievement; in 2006, the Massachusetts state legislature approved
a program to extend the school day by two hours in a small set of schools, motivated in part
by the long days at successful charter schools (Pennington, 2007). The achievement effects of
per-pupil expenditures are of longstanding interest to researchers and policy-makers; increasing
per-pupil expenditures in regular public schools is often seen as an alternative to more structural
reforms (Hanushek, 1997). School-environment variables can indeed account for a substantial
fraction of the larger treatment effects produced by urban and lottery sample charter schools:
urban and lottery coefficients fall substantially for both subjects, though the urban ELA and
lottery math coefficients remain statistically significant. On the other hand, only the total time
variable generates a marginally significant effect, while the expenditure coefficient is essentially
zero.
       Extended learning time is one of a number of features of the No Excuses approach. The
estimates in columns (3) and (7) of Table 13 come from models that swap a dummy for schools
that subscribe to No Excuses for the school environment variables used to construct the esti-
mates reported in columns (2) and (6).14 No Excuses status fully accounts for the urban and
lottery advantages in both math and ELA, without controlling for other features of the school
environment. No Excuses charter schools generate math and ELA gains that are 0.31σ and
  14
       The No Excuses variable used for this exercise is coded as one for schools described by survey respondents as
fully or somewhat No Excuses. Results using a dummy for full No Excuses status only are similar.


                                                          20
0.17σ larger than the effects of other charters. As shown in columns (4) and (8), the addition of
school environment variables pulls the No Excuses effects down somewhat, but their inclusion
does not change the basic story, and these variables do not themselves generate statistically
significant effects conditional on No Excuses status.


Discipline

Comportment and discipline are often said to be defining features of No Excuses charter schools;
if urban charter effectiveness is due to the No Excuses approach, we might therefore expect to
see a marked impact on disciplinary outcomes. Table 14 reports 2SLS estimates of equation
(1) for suspensions and truancy in the year following applicant lotteries. The results for urban
schools, reported in columns (1) through (3), are striking. Urban charter attendance is estimated
to increase suspensions by 0.88 days in middle school and more than a full day in high school.
These treatment effects exceed mean suspension rates in the lottery sample (0.62 days for middle
school and 0.44 days for high school). The estimates for both middle and high school show
significant increases in out-of-school suspensions, and smaller (though still substantial) increases
in in-school suspensions. Though less precise, the results for truancy suggest that attendance
at an urban charter high school reduces days of unauthorized absence – the truancy effect is
statistically significant in models that include baseline test score controls. The truancy estimates
for middle school are not significantly different from zero.
       In contrast with the estimated effects of urban charter attendance on discipline, the estimates
for non-urban charter schools show little effect. Non-urban estimates, reported in columns (4)
through (6) of Table 14, are small, and none are significantly different from zero. These results
sharpen the distinction between urban and non-urban charters. Attendance at urban No Excuses
charter schools produces large effects on discipline as well as achievement; attendance at other
charter schools has little effect in either domain.15


VI         Conclusions
Massachusetts’ urban charter schools generate large achievement gains, while non-urban char-
ters appear to be largely ineffective and appear to reduce achievement for some. Candidate
explanations for this constellation of findings include the fact that urban charter schools serve
larger shares of minority students in districts where the surrounding achievement level is gen-
  15
       Observational estimates of effects on discipline closely match the lottery estimates for schools in the lottery
sample. Observational estimates in the sample of all eligible schools suggest that urban non-lottery schools have
much smaller effects on suspensions than do urban lottery schools, though discipline effects at non-lottery schools
are also positive.

erally low, keep their students in school longer, spend more money per-pupil, and are much
more likely to identify with the No Excuses instructional approach than are non-urban schools.
Our analysis examines the contribution of these student- and school-level factors to the urban
charter advantage.
   Massachusetts’ urban charter schools, including the over-subscribed schools at the heart of
our lottery analysis, serve a typical urban population with non-charter achievement below the
average in non-urban areas. On average, urban charters push their students well beyond ambient
non-charter achievement in central cities, while non-urban charter schools leave their students’
achievement essentially unchanged or diminished from a higher starting point. Urban charter
schools are most effective for minorities, poor students, and low baseline achievers, so part of
the urban charter advantage can be explained by student demographics. On the other hand,
non-urban charter schools fail to boost achievement for any group.
   Our analysis also reveals important heterogeneity within the set of urban schools. The
over-subscribed schools with well-documented admissions processes that make up our lottery
sample appear to be more effective than other urban charters. An analysis of school-specific
treatment effects suggests that adherence to the No Excuses paradigm can account for both the
urban and lottery-sample charter advantages. Learning time and per-pupil expenditures are not
strongly correlated with school-specific impacts and do not explain differences in effectiveness
after accounting for No Excuses status. Consistent with a No Excuses explanation of the urban
charter advantage, the large achievement gains generated by urban charter schools are mirrored
by substantial effects on disciplinary outcomes in the urban sample.
   The large negative estimates of non-urban charter impacts reported here raise the question of
why, despite their unimpressive achievement effects, many of these schools are over-subscribed.
One possibility is that parents misjudge the consequences of non-urban charter attendance.
In a related setting involving school choice, Rothstein (2006) argues that parental choice is
driven primarily by peer characteristics rather than school effectiveness. Of course, it’s also
possible that non-urban charter schools generate gains that non-urban families value more than
the skills measured by the MCAS, especially in view of the fact that most non-urban students
do reasonably well in any case. Still, it seems unlikely that non-urban parents would see a
deterioration in basic skills as desirable. In ongoing work, we’re looking at a variety of post-
secondary outcomes in an effort to determine whether the heterogeneous findings for achievement
reported here have longer-term consequences. We also hope to investigate the effectiveness of
No Excuses education for non-urban students by drawing new samples of students and schools
from other states.

Notes: This table reports the number of middle and high charter schools in Massachusetts and their participation in the observational and lottery studies. The
numbered notes below describe the schools included in each column. Columns (2)-(4) exclude middle schools that have their main admissions lottery in elementary
school (e.g., K-8 schools) and high schools that hold their main admissions lotteries in elementary or middle school (e.g.,K-12 or 6-12 schools). MATCH Charter
Public School, Boston Collegiate Charter School, and Four Rivers Charter Public School are counted twice: once as a middle school and once as a high school
(lotteries from each level participate in the lottery study). Edward Brooke Charter School is counted as a middle school (it became K-8 in 2006, only lotteries from the
middle grades participate in the lottery study). "Urban" towns are defined by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education as the towns
where the district superintendents participate in the Massachusetts Urban Superintendents Network. These towns include: Boston, Brockton, Cambridge, Chelsea,
Chicopee, Everett, Fall River, Fitchburg, Framingham, Haverhill, Holyoke, Lawrence, Leominster, Lowell, Lynn, Malden, New Bedford, Pittsfield, Quincy, Revere,
Somerville, Springfield, Taunton, and Worcester.

Notes: This table reports results from a survey of Massachusetts charter schools with entry in middle (4th-
7th) or high school (9th) grades. The survey sample excludes schools closed prior to 2010, schools that
were not open before Fall 2010, and schools serving non-traditional student populations. Twenty-eight of
32 eligible schools responded to the survey.

Notes: This table reports estimates of the effects of years in charter schools on test scores. The sample is restricted
to students with baseline demographic characteristics who attended a Massachusetts public school when tested, and
excludes students with sibling priority and late applicants. Columns (1)-(3) are produced by a 2SLS procedure
using a lottery offer dummy as an instrument for years spent in charter schools. Column (4) uses risk set and offer
interactions as instruments. All models control for race, sex, special education, limited English proficiency,
subsidized lunch status, and a female by minority dummy. Year of birth, year of test, and risk set dummies are also
included. Middle school regressions pool post-lottery outcomes from 4th through 8th grade and cluster by student
identifier as well as school-grade-year. High school regressions include only scores for 10th grade and cluster by
school-grade-year.

Notes: This table reports estimates of the effects of years in urban and non-urban charter schools on test scores. The sample is restricted to students
with baseline demographic characteristics who attended a Massachusetts public school when tested, and excludes students with sibling priority and late
applicants. Estimates are produced by a 2SLS procedure using urban and non-urban lottery offers as instruments for attendance at urban and non-urban
charter schools. All models control for race, sex, special education, limited English proficiency, subsidized lunch status, and a female by minority
dummy. Year of birth, year of test, and risk set dummies are also included. Middle school regressions pool post-lottery outcomes from 4th through 8th
grade and cluster by student identifier as well as school-grade-year. High school regressions include only scores for 10th grade, and cluster by school-
grade-year.

Notes: This table estimates the components of the difference in charter treatment effects by urban status due to differences in non-charter
"fallback" and differences in treated outcomes. Outcomes are test scores the year after the lottery. Columns (1) and (2) display urban and
non-urban charter treatment effects, respectively, and column (3) gives the difference. Column (4) shows an estimate of the difference in
average non-treated outcomes between urban and non-urban compliers, computed as described in the text. Column (5) shows an estimate
of the difference in treated outcomes between these two groups.

Notes: This table decomposes the difference between urban and non-urban charter treatment effects. Outcomes are test scores the year after the lottery.
The treatment is a dummy for charter attendance. Column (1) shows the difference in urban vs. non-urban treatment effects, computed as described in the
text. Columns (2) and (3) report the components of the urban/non-urban difference due to differences in covariate levels and differences in covariate-
specific effects, respectively, weighting the difference in covariate levels by the urban treatment effects. Columns (4) and (5) report a decomposition that
weights the difference in covariate levels by the non-urban treatment effects. The covariates used in the decompositions are race, sex, special education,
limited English proficiency, free/reduced price lunch, and baseline score categories (advanced, proficient, needs improvement, warning) in math and ELA.

Notes: This table reports estimates of the effects of years in charter schools on test scores. Eligible charters are schools with entry grades 4-7 (middle) or 9 (high), and
that meet the other restrictions from Table 1. The sample is produced by matching charter students to students in traditional public schools on cells defined by sending
school, baseline year, and baseline demographics (race, sex, limited English proficiency, special education status, and free lunch status). All models control for cell fixed
effects, year effects, grade effects, and baseline test scores. Middle school regressions pool outcomes from 5th through 8th grade and cluster by student identifier as well

Data Appendix
The data used for this study come from charter school lottery records, student demographic and
school attendance information in the Massachusetts Student Information Management System
(SIMS), and test scores from the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS)
database. This appendix describes each data source and details the procedures used to clean
and match them. The steps used here are an updated version of the methods described in the
data appendix to Angrist et al. (2010).


A     Data Sets

A.1    Charter School Entrance Lotteries

Data description and sample restrictions
Our sample of applicants is obtained from records of lotteries held at 19 Massachusetts charter
schools between 2002 and 2008. The participating schools and lottery years are listed in Table
A1, along with schools eligible for the lottery study that did not contribute records. A total of
84 school-specific entry cohorts are included in the analysis. Lotteries at three schools contribute
observations to both the middle and high school samples.
    The raw lottery records typically include applicants’ names, dates of birth, contact infor-
mation, and other information used to define lottery groups, such as sibling and out-of-area
status. The first five rows in each panel of Table A4 show the sample restrictions we impose
on the raw lottery records, separately by lottery cohort and school level. We exclude duplicate
applicants and applicants listed as applying to the wrong entry grade. We also drop late appli-
cants, out-of-area applicants, and sibling applicants, as these groups are typically not included
in the standard lottery process. Imposing these restrictions reduces the number of middle school
lottery records from 10,799 to 9,247 and reduces the number of high school records from 7,326
to 7,044.
Lottery offers
In addition to the data described above, the lottery records also include information regarding
offered seats. We used this information to reconstruct indicator variables for whether lottery
participants received randomized offers. At each school, records were sufficient to determine the
students who were offered seats before the start of the school year following the lottery, including
initially waitlisted students who received offers after others declined. Some of the records also
indicate students who were initially offered seats on the day of the lottery; since this “initial
offer” information is not available for all schools, we code our offer variable to include offers
received by waitlisted students. The instrument Zi used in our analyses is one for any student


                                                39
who received an offer from a school included in our lottery sample at any time during the year
she applied. Offer rates were 66 percent and 64 percent in our middle and high school samples,
respectively.


A.2    Student Information Management System Data

Data description
Our study uses SIMS data from the 2001-2002 school year through the 2009-2010 school year.
Each year of data includes an October file and an end-of-year file. The SIMS records information
on demographics and schools attended for all students in Massachusetts’ public schools. An
observation in the SIMS refers to a student in a school in a year, though there are some student-
school-year duplicates for students that switch grades or programs within a school and year.
Coding of demographics and attendance
The SIMS variables used in our analysis include grade, year, name, town of residence, date of
birth, sex, race, special education and limited English proficiency status, free or reduced price
lunch, and school attended. We constructed a wide-format data set that captures demographic
and attendance information for every student in each year in which he or she is present in
Massachusetts’ public schools. This file uses information from the longest-attended school in
the first calendar year spent in each grade. Attendance ties were broken at random; this affects
only 0.007 percent of records. Students classified as SPED, LEP, or free/reduced price lunch in
any record within a school-year-grade retain that designation for the entire school-year-grade.
   We measure charter school attendance in calendar years. A student is coded as attending a
charter school in a particular year when there is any SIMS record reporting charter attendance
in that year. Students who attend more than one charter school within a year are assigned to
the charter they attended longest.


A.3    Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System Data

Data description and sample restrictions
We use MCAS data from the 2001-2002 school year through the 2009-2010 school year. Each
observation in the MCAS database corresponds to a student’s test results in a particular grade
and year. We use math and English Language Arts (ELA) tests in grades 3 through 8 and
10, as well as Writing Topic and Writing Composition scores in grades 4, 7, and 10. The test
score variables are standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation one within a subject-
grade-year in Massachusetts. Repetitions of the same test subject and grade are dropped. In
cases with multiple records within a year and grade, ties are broken at random; this affected
0.09 percent of MCAS records.


                                               40
    In the lottery-based middle school analysis, all post-lottery test scores through 8th grade are
used as outcomes. High school outcomes are from 10th grade. The most recent pre-lottery score
in a subject defines a student’s baseline score. For the observational analysis, outcome grades
are 5th through 8th for middle school 10th for high school; baseline scores are from 4th grade
for middle school and 7th or 8th grade for high school.


B     Matching Data Sets

B.1    Match from the MCAS to the SIMS

The processed SIMS and MCAS files were merged by grade, year, and a state student identifier
known as the SASID. Scores that could not be matched to the SIMS were dropped. This
restricted eliminated 0.7 percent of MCAS scores statewide.


B.2    Match from the Lottery Records to the State Database

Match procedure
Lottery records were matched to the state SIMS/MCAS database by name, application year,
and application grade. In some cases, this procedure did not produce a unique match. We
accepted some matches based on fewer criteria where the information on grade, year, and town
of residence seemed to make sense.
Match success rate
Our matching procedure successfully located most applicants in the SIMS database. Table A5
reports cohort-specific match rates from the lottery records to the combined SIMS/MCAS file,
separately for middle and high school. The overall match rates for middle and high school were
92.0 percent and 94.3 percent, respectively. Table A5 also reports separate match rates for
offered and non-offered students. In middle school, offered students were slightly more likely
to be matched (93.8 percent compared to 89.3 percent). Offered and non-offered applicants to
charter high schools were matched to the SIMS at almost identical rates (94.1 percent compared
to 94.8 percent).


C     Construction of the Outcome Data Sets

C.1    Lottery Sample

Further sample restrictions
Once matched to the SIMS, each student is associated with a unique SASID; at this point,
we can therefore determine which students applied to multiple schools in our lottery sample.


                                                41
Following the match, we reshape the lottery data set to contain a single record for each student.
If students applied in more than one year to lotteries at a particular school level (middle or
high), we keep only the records associated with their first year of application. In our basic
lottery analyses, we also exclude students without baseline demographics in the SIMS; in effect,
this rule limits the sample to students in Massachusetts’ public schools at baseline. Rows 6-9 in
each panel of Table A4 report the impact of these restrictions on sample sizes for middle and
high school. The set of matched first-time applicants with baseline demographics includes 6,214
middle school students and 4,207 high school students.
Final set of outcomes and students
To generate the middle school analysis file, the matched lottery/SIMS/MCAS file is reshaped
to long format, with each observation referring to a test score outcome for a student in a
particular year. The high school analysis file uses only 10th grade outcomes, so it includes a
single observation for each student. Table A6 summarizes the analysis files for middle and high
school. Columns (1) and (2) list the application and outcome grades for each cohort, and column
(3) lists the number of applicants satisfying the sample restrictions from Table A4. In middle
school, 5,773 of 6,214 students contribute at least one test score to the analysis. In high school,
3,322 of 4,207 students have at least one score. Middle school applicants contribute different
numbers of scores to the analysis depending on their years and grades of application; math
and ELA tests were not given in every middle school grade until 2006, and some cohorts are
not observed through 8th grade. Table A7 lists the grades and years in which math and ELA
subjects were administered. As shown in columns (5)-(8) of Table A6, we find 12,346 out of
14,180 expected scores for middle school math, 12,126 of 13,904 for middle school ELA, 3,255
of 4,206 for high school math, and 3,303 of 4,206 for high school ELA. These outcomes are used
to produce the 2SLS estimates reported in Tables 4-7.


C.2    Observational Sample

To produce the analysis file used for the observational analysis, we begin with the matched
SIMS/MCAS state database. As described in Section V, we define cells based on baseline
school, baseline year, race, and sex, separately for middle school and high school. We then
count the number of students in each cell who go on to spend time in eligible charter schools
and regular public schools in the relevant range of grades (5th through 8th for middle school
and 10th for high school). Observations in cells that do not include at least one student who
attends eligible charter schools and one student who attends regular public schools are dropped.
We then produce a long format data file containing the full set of test score outcomes for the
remaining sample of matched students at the relevant school level, as well as variables counting
years of attendance at each eligible charter school. This file is used to produce the observational

                                                42
estimates. Our matching procedure excludes 23 percent of students who attend eligible charter
schools in middle or high school.

Notes: This table reports coefficients on regressions of the variable indicated in each row on an indicator variable equal to one
if the student won the lottery. Regressions include risk set dummies and baseline grade dummies and exclude students with
sibling priority and late applicants. Samples in columns (1) and (3) are restricted to students from cohorts where we should
observe at least one test score. Samples in columns (2) and (4) are restricted to students who also have baseline test scores. F
tests are for the null hypothesis that the coefficients on winning the lottery in all regressions are all equal to zero. These test
statistics are calculated for the subsample that has non-missing values for all variables tested.

Notes: This table reports coefficients on regressions of an indicator variable equal to one if a student has a followup
test score on an indicator variable equal to one if the student won the lottery. Regressions in columns (2) and (3)
include risk set dummies as well as demographic variables, year of birth dummies, year of baseline dummies, and
baseline grade dummies. Regressions in column (3) add baseline test scores. The sample is restricted to students who
participated in an effective lottery from cohorts where we should observe follow-up scores. High school students who
take Writing Topic exam must also take Writing Composition.

Notes: This table summarizes observed test score outcomes for charter school lottery applicants. The sample is restricted to randomized applicants matched to
baseline SIMS demographics. Expected test scores are post-lottery scores in grades 4-8 for middle school and grade 10 for high school that would be taken in Spring
2010 or earlier given normal academic progress after the lottery. Table A1 lists the schools participating in each cohort and their entry grades. Table A7 lists the
availability of math and ELA tests by year.
