Do School Entry Laws Affect Educational Attainment and Labor Market Outcomes?
Carlos Dobkin and Fernando Ferreira
NBER Working Paper No. 14945
May 2009
JEL No. I20,I21

                                            ABSTRACT

Age based school entry laws force parents and educators to consider an important tradeoff: Though
students who are the youngest in their school cohort typically have poorer academic performance,
on average, they have slightly higher educational attainment. In this paper we document that for a
large cohort of California and Texas natives the school entry laws increased educational attainment
of students who enter school early, but also lowered their academic performance while in school.
However, we find no evidence that the age at which children enter school effects job market outcomes,
such as wages or the probability of employment. This suggests that the net effect on adult labor market
outcomes of the increased educational attainment and poorer academic performance is close to zero.

1. Introduction
         Recently there has been substantial interest in the choice that parents face as they decide at
what age to enroll their children in kindergarten. Several papers have documented the adverse
effects on academic performance of being the youngest student in a classroom in the United States.
Bedard and Dhuey (2006) use data from OECD to show that the youngest members of fourth and
eighth grade classes have standardized test scores that are 2-12 percentiles lower than the oldest
students in the same cohort. Similarly, Datar (2006) used variation in school entry cutoff dates to
document that children that start kindergarten later get higher test scores.1 Elder and Lubotsky
(2008) used the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study to document that a one year increase in the age
at which an individual enters school reduces the probability they will be held back a grade at some
point in elementary school by approximately 13 percent. They also find differences in test scores,
but this outcome is largely driven by accumulation of skills prior to kindergarten and declines rapidly
as children age. Studies focused on other countries found more mixed effects.2 Overall, these
findings have lead to substantial concern among both parents and educators about the effect of the
age based school entry laws, and legislators in several U.S. states have changed their school entry
dates in order to increase the age at which children enter kindergarten.3
         All these results from the literature suggest that enrolling children in kindergarten as soon as
they are eligible may be adversely affecting them. However, as we document in this paper, there is at
least one positive effect of enrolling in kindergarten at the earliest age possible. The youngest
students in a class complete high school at higher rates than their older peers as noted by Angrist
and Krueger (1991).4 This suggests that there is an important tradeoff to consider. This paper
provides estimates of the net long run impact of these opposing mechanisms on labor market
outcomes in the United States. In addition to getting at the net effect of the tradeoff described

  A current debate in the education literature tries to understand if the cause of this academic disadvantage for young
kids is due to their relative age to peers or due to their absolute age at which they are exposed to a material. For a review
of this debate see Stipek (2002).
2 Allen and Barnsley (1993) report that oldest boys in a cohort in Canada are more likely to thrive in professional sports,

and Fredriksson and Ockert (2006) found a negative impact on wages for the youngest individuals in a cohort in
Sweden. However, Black, Devereux and Salvanes (2008) find that being relative older at the start of kindergarten has no
effect on educational attainment and earnings in Norway.

  Angrist and Krueger (1991) originally showed that individuals born in the 1st quarter of the year have lower education
attainment than individuals born in the 4th quarter of the previous year. Such difference was arguably due to the
interaction of compulsory schooling laws with school entry laws, which makes individuals born in the first quarter more
likely to start school later and therefore more likely to quit formal education before completing a high school degree.
Angrist and Krueger (1992) also pointed out that they only used quarter of birth because a large data set with both exact
day of birth and education attainment did not exist at that time, and therefore they could not explicitly examine the
impact of school entry laws on education attainment.

above, labor market outcomes of adults are arguably of greater interest than the intermediate
outcomes, such as academic performance, that are typically considered in the literature.
        To conduct our analysis we use the restricted access Decennial Census Long Form Data for
the states of California and Texas.5 Unlike the publicly available micro sample (PUMS), the
restricted-access data has the exact day of birth for each individual for a 15% random sample of the
population of each state. Our research design uses state school entry laws that regulate the
minimum age at which students are eligible to enroll in school as a source of exogenous variation in
the timing of school entry. The state of Texas requires that a child must be at least 5 years old by
September 1st in order to enroll in kindergarten that academic year, while the threshold date is
December 2nd in California for most of the age groups we examine. We take advantage of these
threshold dates to implement a regression discontinuity (RD) design. The RD approach lets us
estimate the long run consequences of early school entry, by comparing individuals who are similar
on all dimensions, but enter school at different ages on account of the school entry laws.6
        The analysis focuses on adult outcomes of individuals over the age of 30 as they are more
likely to have completed their education. We find that the school entry laws have a modest effect on
educational attainment: Adults born right before the cutoff for school entry in Texas and California
are about a percentage point more likely to complete high school. They are also about a half
percentage point more likely to complete 9th, 10th and 11th grades. Evidence from contemporary
cohorts shows that though school entry laws have a very pronounced effect on the timing of school
entry a substantial part of the difference is undone through retention. Data from recent cohorts also
show that youngest students have lower academic performance, as measured by retention rates.
        Interestingly, we find no evidence that school entry laws and the additional education that
results from them leads to differences in employment rates, wages, or in any of the other outcomes
we observe in the Census, such as family income, house ownership, house value and marital status.
We find no evidence that early school entry has an impact on adult outcomes for any of the age,
gender and race subgroups we examine, not even for Hispanics who have the largest difference in
educational attainment of any of the contemporary cohorts.
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we discuss the empirical model and
data sources. In section 3 we examine the impact of school entry laws on educational attainment.
In section 4 we present evidence on adult labor market outcomes. In section 5 we show educational

6Cascio and Lewis (2006) used a similar design to estimate the impact of schooling on AFQT performance. Early
applications of RD design can be found in Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960) and Cook and Campbell (1979). We
discuss the details of the RD model and the most recent literature in the next section.

attainment and labor market outcomes by subpopulation. Section 6 presents estimates of the impact
of school entry laws on contemporary cohorts. Section 7 concludes.


2. Econometric Methods and Data
         In this section we describe the regression discontinuity design model we use to estimate the
effect of school entry laws on adult educational attainment and labor market outcomes. A complete
review of the RD method can be found in Imbens and Lemieux (2008); and Lee and Lemieux
(2009). Here we just focus on the econometric specification used to estimate the parameters of
interest. Following Lee (2008) and Lee and Card (2005), we use a parametric rather than a
nonparametric approach since the threshold for school entry laws is based on the discrete variable
age, which is measured in days.7
         The first outcome we examine is educational attainment in the adult population. We
estimate the impact of the school entry laws on this outcome by fitting the following equation:
(1) Educi = δ 0 + δ1Cuti + δ 2 Bdayi + δ 3Cuti * Bdayi + δ 4 Bday 2 + δ 5Cuti * Bday 2 + ΨX i + ε i


where Educi is an indicator variable that takes on a value of 1 if individual i has completed more than
a particular number of years of education. For example, the 10th grade indicator variable is equal to
1 if the individual has completed at least 10th grade, and zero otherwise. We run separate regressions
for each possible level of educational attainment between 7th grade and college completion. The use
of indicator variables for completed years of education makes it possible to determine at what points
in the distribution of educational attainment the school entry laws have their impact.8 The variable
Cuti is an indicator variable for being born after the cutoff date, Bdayi is the number of days from

the individual’s birthday to the cutoff date, Xi is a set of covariates, and ε i is an idiosyncratic error
term. We run separate regressions for each cutoff between 7th grade and college. The primary
parameter of interest in equation (1) is δ1 which is the size of the discrete change in the

outcome Educi at the cutoff date for the school entry laws.
         For each outcome we create a figure, over the support of age, with the fitted model from
equation (1) superimposed over the unconditional means of the outcome. The figure lets us visually
check to be sure that there is a discrete break in the outcome and that the regression model is

7
  See Hahn, Todd and Van der Klaauw (2001) for non parametric estimation of the RD model when the discontinuity
occurs on a continuous variable.
8 Another common way of defining education attainment in the literature on the returns to education is by calculating

the number of years of formal schooling. However, the high retention rates observed in the data makes this variable
difficult to interpret.

                                                         4
correctly specified. We experimented with higher order polynomials and found no visual evidence
that the second order polynomial from equation (1) is under fitting the data. We also found no
statistical evidence in favor of models with higher order polynomials, as the inclusion of such higher
order terms did not improve the fit of the model.
         Finally, we estimate the relationship between school entry laws and labor market outcomes
using a similar equation:
(2)       Yi = γ 0 + γ 1Cuti + γ 2 Bdayi + γ 3Cuti * Bdayi + γ 4 Bday 2 + γ 5Cuti * Bday 2 + ΣX i + ν i


where Yi is an adult outcome, such as wages or employment. This reduced form equation provides
estimates of the net effect of school entry laws on long run outcomes without the need to specify
any structural relationship that includes the channels through which early school entry affects the
adult outcome. If educational attainment were the sole channel through which early school entry
laws affected the adult outcome then γ 1 / δ1 would be an unbiased estimate of the impact of
educational attainment on the outcome for people who comply with the law.9 We do not construct
this statistic because the school entry laws result in differences in relative age, retention rates and test
scores. These are all very likely to affect adult wages which violates the exclusion restriction under
which the instrumental variable estimate is identified.10
         One appealing property of the RD strategy is that it is possible to assess the probability of an
omitted variables problem fairly directly. All potential confounders must evolve smoothly across the
discontinuity for the RD to generate consistent estimates. We test for discontinuities in the
observable variables by estimating a set of regressions of the form of equation (1), for each of the
covariates in our data set. Though of course it is not possible to check the unobservable
characteristics directly it is likely that if the observable characteristics do not change discretely at the
school entry cutoff date, then the unobservable characteristics are not changing discretely at the
threshold either and that therefore omitted variables bias is not a problem. We have the additional
advantage that in this setting most kinds of selection would result in a sorting of the sample around
the discontinuity. To make sure that this is not occurring we check that the number of individuals
born on a given day does not change discretely at the threshold for school entry.
         All equations above are estimated using the 2000 Decennial Census Long Form data for the
states of California and Texas (approximately 15% of the population in each state). In addition to all

9 For a detailed discussion of the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) see Imbens and Angrist (1994).
10 We do not estimate the instrumental variable returns to education in this paper since there cannot be any other direct
association between day of birth and labor market outcomes for day of birth to be a legitimate instrument for education
attainment. See Bound, Jaeger and Baker (1995).

                                                          5
the variables available in the IPUMS, these restricted access data also have the exact date of birth for
every individual in the sample. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that precisely
estimates the impact of school entry laws on educational attainment and labor market outcomes
using exact day of birth in the United States.
         One limitation of the Census data is that we do not know what state an individual lived in
when their parents were facing the school enrollment decision. This is important as the school
enrollment cutoff date varies across states. We deal with this issue by restricting the sample to
individuals born in California and Texas who are still living in their state of birth. Although it is
possible that someone born in California attended school outside California and then returned to
California this is probably not a very common occurrence. Another more plausible concern is that
there is selective migration by people on one side of the discontinuity or the other. To make sure
neither of these is a significant problem we check that to be sure that neither the migration rate nor
the population count changes discretely at the cutoff date for school enrollment. We also eliminate
all Census records where date of birth, educational attainment or school enrollment are imputed,
since measurement error in the first variable will result in attenuation bias and measurement error in
the other two variables will reduce the precision of our estimates.


3. Effect of School Entry Laws on Adult Educational Attainment
         In this section we examine the effect of school entry laws on adult educational attainment.
The two states we focus our analysis on have different cut off dates for school entry. The Texas
Education Agency informed us that the September 1st threshold was first implemented in 1915 and
it has remained the same since then. The State of California has used the cutoff date of December
2nd since 1987. Between 1951 and 1987 the statute read 'be four years and 9 months of age on or
before September 1st', which in practice means a threshold date of December 1st. Because of this in
California we eliminate people born December 2nd from our estimates, and compare individuals
born December 1st with those born December 3rd. Finally, there is some variation in the cutoff
date prior to 1951 which makes it impossible to ascertain which cutoff date people faced without
knowing which school they attended, something we do not observe in the Census.11 Given this


11 Prior to 1951 not everyone in California faced a December 1st cutoff date. In 1917 the Political Code Ch 552 Sec 9

states that to enroll in first grade children had to be 6 years old at the end of the third month of the school term (in this
period the focus was on first grade because kindergarten enrollment was very low). This is likely to fall near December
1st. But in 1941, section 3.122 of the School Code was amended so that in schools with one term children had to have
their birthday by March 1st. In schools with two terms they had to have their birthday by December 1st to be admitted
for the first term, and by May 1st to be admitted to the Second term. In 1945 the education code was amended so that
children in schools with either one term or two terms had to turn five by March 1st to be eligible for kindergarten. In

                                                            6
ambiguity for older cohorts in California, we first present the results for all adults in Texas, and then
complement the analysis with estimates for California, and also for various cohorts in both states.
         In the figures we deal with the variation in the cut of date for school entry by setting the
cutoff date for each cohort at 0 and measuring the number of days from the individual’s birthday to
the cutoff date that was in force when they were 5 years old. For example, an individual born in
California on November 22rd 1975 would have a relative age of -10. We then plot the proportion
with a particular level of educational attainment over the support of this running variable. To make
the figures less noisy the proportion enrolled has been computed for fifteen day blocks rather than
for individual days. The fitted values from the regression model specified in equation (1) are laid
over the means.12
         In Figure 1 we present the profile of educational attainment by birthday for Texas natives
between the age of 30 and 79. In each panel of the figure we plot the proportion of Texas natives
born in a fifteen day period that have completed a particular grade or higher. Surprisingly, the figure
reveals that there is pronounced seasonality in educational attainment.13 Despite the fact that the
seasonality makes the figure harder to interpret, we see evidence of a seam in educational attainment
in Texas. Adults born just before the school entry cutoff are slightly more likely to have completed
9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grade, and received a H.S. diploma than those just born after the cutoff. We do
not find compelling evidence that the school enrollment laws increase college attendance though the
estimates are fairly imprecise.
         In Table 1A we present regression estimates of the impact of school entry laws on the
educational attainment of Texas natives. Each regression is estimated off the micro data and
includes each individual’s demographic characteristics.14 The regression results are robust to the
inclusion of covariates and confirm that the increases in grade completion probabilities that we
observed in the figures are statistically significant. The school entry laws resulted in an increase in
the proportion of adults completing 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grade and receiving a H.S. diploma. The
respective increases at the discontinuity are: 0.4%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9% and 0.8%.
         In Figure 2 we present the profile of educational attainment for adults in California. As can
be seen in the graph, adults who were just barely eligible to enter school are slightly more likely to


1951 the Education Code was amended so that Children who had turned five by December 1st were eligible for
Kindergarten. See Cos (2001) for more details.
12To maximize the precision of the estimates the regression line is estimated from the day level data rather than from the

nine day means in the figure. The regressions in the figures do not include individual level covariates though the
regressions in the tables do.
13 This seasonality is also observed for birth outcomes - see Lam and Miron (1991).
14 The unconditional regressions used to plot the lines in Figure 5 have similar discontinuity estimates, and are available

upon request.

                                                           7
have completed 11th grade, 12th grade or received a H.S. diploma. As with the results for adults in
Texas there is no compelling evidence of differences in rates of college entry or completion of an
Associate degree. These results are confirmed in Table 1B. The discontinuity estimates for 10th
grade, 11th grade, 12th grade and H.S. diploma are all statistically significant. The largest difference
in educational attainment is for H.S. diploma and it is slightly under one percentage point. The
other effects are slightly smaller than the ones observed in Texas, particularly for the lower grades.
        That the coefficients in the regressions conditioned on covariates are the same size as the
ones from the unconditional regressions presented in the figures is indirect evidence that the
observable characteristics are distributed smoothly across the discontinuity. As a more direct test of
this we check to make sure that there are no abrupt changes in the proportion of the population that
is male, white, black, Hispanic, or that immigrated to the state in the last five years. We present the
results of this exercise in Tables 2A and 2B which reveal that these observable characteristics evolve
smoothly through the cutoff for school entry.
        There are a couple of possible explanations for the abrupt jump in educational attainment
observed around the school entry cutoff. One possibility is that we are seeing an interaction
between the school entry laws and the mandatory school attendance laws. That we do not observe
an impact on the probability of attending college is consistent with this story, but it is not clear why
the laws would generate discontinuities at so many points in the distribution of educational
attainment (from 9th grade through High School completion). Another possible explanation is that
for some individuals the probability of dropping out is a function of biological age so that people
who enter school early will on average get slightly more education. In either case, on average the
students that enroll in school at a younger age stay in school longer.


4. Effect of School Entry Laws on Labor Market and Other Long Run Outcomes
        In this section we examine the impact of the school entry laws on employment rates, wages,
and several other outcomes available in the Census including family income, house ownership,
house value and marital status. There are a couple of ways in which the early school entry laws
could have an impact on labor market outcomes. One mechanism is through the increase in the
educational attainment documented above, which would have a positive impact on wages for
individuals born right before the threshold date. However the school entry laws could also have a
negative impact on the wages of these individuals because as has been extensively documented in




                                                   8
the literature the youngest students in a class on average have poorer academic performance.15 We
estimate the net long run effect of these opposing mechanisms by comparing the labor market
outcomes of individuals born right before the cutoff date with the outcomes of individuals born
right after the cutoff date for school entry.16 We find no evidence that the laws had a net impact on
labor market outcomes such as employment rates and wages, or in other outcomes such as the
probability of homeownership.
         In Figure 3 we document the effect of the school entry laws on labor market outcomes, such
as employment and wages, and also on home ownership and house prices. We find no evidence the
laws have an effect on any of those outcomes. RD estimates for Texas are presented in Table 3A
and corroborate what we observe in the figures. In the tables we also include the results for
household income and marital status for which we also find no effect. The estimates for all
outcomes are statistically and practically insignificant. For example, the change in log wages at the
cutoff date is only 0.0009, while the change in the probability of employment is -.0006. The results
for California displayed in Table 3B and Figure 4 show similar patterns, although we should be
cautious about those estimates given the uncertainty related to the school entry cutoff for older
cohorts in that state. Overall, these results indicate that the net impact of school entry laws on labor
market outcomes is negligible. Given the strong first stage relationship between the school entry
laws and the timing of school entry that we document in section 6 it is clear that being the youngest
in ones class has no discernable long-term effect on labor market outcomes. This null finding is
striking given the extensive literature documenting the substantial adverse impact on academic
performance of being the youngest student in a cohort.


5. Variation in Effect of School Entry Laws by Gender, Race and Age
         In this section we examine how the differences in educational attainment and labor market
outcomes induced by the school entry laws vary by gender, race and cohort. Though splitting the
sample into subgroups reduces the precision of the estimates it is worth pursuing because the laws
have a larger impact on some subgroups than others. In Tables 4A and 4B we present the
educational attainment results by gender and by race for individuals 30 to 79 years of age in Texas
and California respectively. The seams are slightly larger for females than males in California though

15 Our sample corroborates this, as we observe higher retention rates for the youngest students in a cohort. We show

these calculations in Section VI.
16 One caveat is that early school enrollment could also lead to differences in the number of years of labor market

experience if we had full compliance with the law and no differences in retention rates. Given that we do not observe
full compliance and that retention rates are much larger for the youngest students, the differences in potential labor
market experience are very small at the time of high school completion. In addition for the age groups we examine the
returns to an additional fraction of a year of experience is likely to be quite modest.

                                                         9
the differences are not statistically significant. In Texas most of the effect sizes for men and women
are fairly similar and for most levels of educational attainment slightly larger than the effects we saw
in California.
        The results by race for Texas and California also show a considerably larger seam in highest
grade attained for Hispanics than for whites. In both states the seam for 11th grade, 12th grade and
H.S. diploma is on the order of 1.5 to 2 percentage points for Hispanics, which is 3 to 4 times the
respective seam for whites. Though in both states some of the results for blacks have perverse signs
all of the coefficients are statistically insignificant.
        Next we turn to comparing educational attainment across the age cohorts 30-39, 40-49, 50-
64 and 65-79 year olds respectively. The regressions for California reveal that the seams in
education attainment around 12th grade are between 0.6% and 0.8% for the youngest cohorts, zero
for the cohort of 50 to 64 year olds, and between 1.6 and 2.8% for the 65-79 year olds. The
corresponding results for Texas are very similar. There are modest seams in educational attainment
for the two youngest cohorts, slightly larger effects on the cohort of 65 to 79 year olds and no
evidence of an effect on the cohort of 50 to 64 year olds. Overall, these results indicate that the
school entry laws have smaller effects on the educational attainment of younger cohorts.
        The corresponding labor market and long run outcome estimates for all the subgroups are
presented in Tables 5A and 5B. Although there is some variation in the magnitude and sign of the
coefficients they are typically fairly small and statistically insignificant. Overall these results are
consistent with the results for the full sample, i.e., school entry laws do not lead to statistically
significant differences in adult outcomes other than educational attainment.


6. School Entry Law Effects on Contemporary Cohorts
        In this section we examine the impact of school enrollment laws on school age children of
contemporary cohorts. Because the data are not available we are unable to directly estimate the
effect of school entry laws on the timing of school entry for the adult cohorts we examined above.
However, the impact of school entry laws on more recent cohorts sheds light on the magnitude of
this treatment, and how it varies by race, gender and parental education.
        We start by documenting that though compliance with the law is not perfect, the laws do
induce a large discontinuity in the age at which children enter school. In four panels of Figure 5A
and the four panels of and 5B we present estimates of the proportion of individuals in Texas and

California who are enrolled in public kindergarten, first grade, fifth grade or ninth grade.17 The top
left panels (kindergarten panels) for both states reveal that there is less than perfect compliance with
the law: About 20% of individuals born immediately after the cutoff for school entry are enrolled
one grade higher than they would be if compliance with the law was perfect. We also see that a
considerable number of individuals born before the cutoff date delay enrolling in kindergarten until
the year after they are eligible. As can be seen from the figure this phenomenon is most pronounced
among children who are barely eligible for kindergarten. Nonetheless, the law still has a
considerable effect and most individuals born before the cutoff date for kindergarten enrollment are
a grade ahead of individuals born just after the cutoff date.
         The remaining panels reveal that the size of the gap induced by the school entry laws shrinks
as children get older. The gap in enrollment for ninth graders is about two thirds the size of the gap
at kindergarten. This is consistent with the very youngest students in a particular grade being held
back more often than their older peers. In fact, implied retention rates vary substantially, while 31%
of the students born just before the cutoff date are retained at some point between kindergarten and
ninth grade only 11% of those born 180 days before the cutoff date are retained.18
         In Tables 6A and 6B the first column of each pair presents the regression discontinuity
estimates corresponding to the appropriate line in the figures. The second of each pair of columns
contains the same regression run on the underlying micro data with covariates added. Table 6A
reveals that the inclusion of the covariates has no statistically significant effect on the estimates for
Texas. The regression estimates of the discontinuous change in grade enrollment induced by the
school entry laws confirm what we saw in the figures. In Texas we find a difference of 62 percentage
points in kindergarten, 59 percentage points in first grade, 50 percentage points in fifth grade, and 43
percentage points in ninth grade. Table 6B shows that though the discontinuity in enrollment in
kindergarten is smaller in California than in Texas, by ninth grade the discontinuity in enrollment in
Texas is approximately the same size as the discontinuity in California.
         One concern about the results presented above is that some of the differences in the grade
in which individuals are enrolled in may be due to demographic factors that change abruptly at the

17 Due to the limited categories for the grade enrolled question in the Census we are constrained to examining four
cutoffs for school age individuals: kindergarten (age 5), first grade (age 6), fifth grade (age 10) and ninth grade (age 14).
For the adult population we are able to analyze the complete distribution of education attainment since there is no need
to look at enrollment rates. We restricted the sample to public school enrollment because the cutoff dates are only
supposed to be enforced by public schools. However, estimates that also include private schools do not present very
different results, in part because less than 10% of the students are enrolled in private schools.
18 The 31% retention rate was calculated by dividing the proportion of students enrolled in 9th grade at the relevant age

right before the cutoff date (55%) by the proportion of students enrolled in kindergarten at the relevant age right before
the cutoff date (80%). A similar calculation was done for students born 180 days before the cutoff date. This calculation
ignores the possibility that there are significant differences across cohorts.

                                                            11
school enrollment threshold rather than the legislation. That adding covariates to the regressions
has no impact on the estimates implies that the changes we observe at the discontinuity are due to
the school enrollment laws. In addition, we examined the data to see if there are discrete changes in
any of the observable characteristics of the children at the cutoff date for early school entry. We see
no evidence of this for a range of variables, such as gender, race, household income, and house
ownership. Moreover, the variable state of residence in 1995 is also continuous around the
threshold, indicating that selective migration is not a problem.19
         On account of how much compliance with the law varies across demographic groups, we
conduct a separate examination of the enrollment patterns for each group. In Table 7A we show
how the discontinuity in school enrollment in Texas evolves as children age. We do the analysis
separately by gender, race and parental education. The first noticeable pattern is that all groups
experience a large reduction in the estimated discontinuity as they get older, which is consistent with
the results observed for the whole population. Second, the ranking of groups by the size of the
discontinuity is preserved across grades: whites and children of parents with more than a college
degree have the lowest compliance rate and therefore the smallest discontinuities in the grade they
are enrolled in. Hispanics and parents with less than a college degree have the largest discontinuities.
Girls also comply with the law at higher rates than boys, but the largest difference is between whites
and Hispanics. Results for California are displayed in Table 7B and show similar patterns, although
the differences between groups seem to be slightly more pronounced.20
         The main conclusion from examining the tables and figures above is that blacks and
Hispanics are much more likely than whites to enroll in school as soon as they are eligible, and they
are also less likely to be held back. The net result is that black and Hispanic children are on average
exposed to academic material at a considerably younger age than white children. It is unlikely that
blacks, Hispanics and children with less educated parents are at a higher grade level than the children
of whites and of parents with more education because they are outperforming them. A more
plausible explanation is that black and Hispanic parents are less likely to make the decision to have a




19
   These estimates are available upon request. The only discrete change we observe is that children born after the cut off
for school entry are 7 (12) percentage points more likely to be enrolled in private kindergarten in California (Texas)
when examined at age 5. One possibility is that this difference is due to parents using private schools to work around
the school entry laws. This difference almost completely disappears by age 6 as most of the children in private
kindergartens enter the public school system for first grade.
20
   The pattern of retention rates within a cohort also varies substantially by race. Minorities are much less likely to be
held back; by ninth grade blacks and Hispanic born right before the cut off data are only 16 percentage points more
likely to be retained then those born 180 days before the cutoff date. Though we also observe differences by gender and
parental education, the most striking differences are across race. These calculations are available upon request.

child who is struggling held back a grade.21 However, as shown in Sections 4, there is no discernable
effect on labor market outcomes, at least for older cohorts.


7. Conclusion
         In this paper we documented that though students that enter school at a younger age due to
the school entry laws have poorer academic performance on average they also have slightly higher
educational attainment. When we examine the net impact of this tradeoff on adult outcomes we
find no evidence that the timing of school entry affects wages or any of the other outcomes that we
observe in the Census. Though the educational attainment of Hispanics is substantially more
affected by the school entry laws than any of the other groups we find no evidence of any effect on
labor market outcomes even in this subpopulation. These result suggests either that the increase in
educational attainment induced by the school entry laws is offsetting the poorer academic
performance of children who start school at a younger age or that variation in academic
performance that is due purely to relative age, and not adjusted away through retention, does not
affect labor market performance.
         We also found that contemporary cohorts of students born right before the cutoff date for
school enrollment are significantly more likely to enroll in kindergarten a year earlier than similar
students who were born right after the cutoff date. One third of these initial differences disappear
by 9th grade since the youngest children in a cohort are held back more often than their older
classmates. Minorities are more likely to comply with the law than whites and they are held back less
frequently; therefore they make up a disproportionate share of the youngest students in a cohort.




21It is also possible that the patterns we observe in retention rates are due to systematic differences in the schools these
groups are attending. It should also be noted that we do not examine other out-of-school alternatives available for
minority children, some of which may be worse than attending school as the youngest student in a cohort.

Notes: Tables 3A and 3b were estimated using the 2000 Decennial Long Form Census Data. Each coefficient estimates the impact of
being born just after the state entry law cutoff day on adult outcomes, relative to being born just before the cutoff. Each coefficient
was estimated separately, from a quadratic polynomial regression variable as specified in equation (2) in the text. The regressions
include the following covariates: gender, race, urban area, housing ownership, number of people in the house, number of rooms,
household income, parental education and lived in the same state 5 years ago. Standard errors shown in parentheses are clustered at
the exact date of birth.

Notes: Tables 4A and 4b were estimated using the 2000 Decennial Long Form Census Data. Each coefficient estimates the
impact of being born just after the state entry law cutoff day on educational attainment, relative to being born just before the
cutoff. Separate samples were created by gender, race, and age cohorts. Each coefficient was estimated separately, from a
quadratic polynomial regression variable as specified in equation (1) in the text. The regressions include the following covariates:
urban area, housing ownership, number of people in the house, number of rooms, household income, parental education and
lived in the same state 5 years ago. Standard errors shown in parentheses are clustered at the exact date of birth.

Notes: Tables 5A and 5b were estimated using the 2000 Decennial Long Form Census Data. Each coefficient estimates the
impact of being born just after the state entry law cutoff day on adult outcomes, relative to being born just before the cutoff.
Separate samples were created by gender, race, and age cohorts. Each coefficient was estimated separately, from a quadratic
polynomial regression variable as specified in equation (2) in the text. The regressions include the following covariates: urban
area, housing ownership, number of people in the house, number of rooms, household income, parental education and lived in
the same state 5 years ago. Standard errors shown in parentheses are clustered at the exact date of birth.

Notes: Tables 6A and 6b were estimated using the 2000 Decennial Long Form Census Data. Each coefficient estimates the
impact of being born just after the state entry law cutoff day on grade enrolled, relative to being born just before the cutoff.
Each coefficient was estimated separately, from a quadratic polynomial regression variable as specified in equation (1) in the text.
The unconditional regressions are estimated at the date of birth level of aggregation, using 180 days of birth before and after
each cutoff date. The conditional regressions use the microdata, and include individuals born 180 days before and after the
cutoff date. For example, relative age equals to zero for kindergarten corresponds to a child exactly 5 years old on the day of the
cut off for school entry (6 years old for 1st grade, 10 years old for 5th grade and 14 years old for 9th grade). A relative age of -10
corresponds to a person born ten days before the cutoff. These regressions include the following covariates: gender, race, urban
area, housing ownership, number of people in the house, number of rooms, household income, parental education and lived in
the same state 5 years ago. Standard errors shown in parentheses are clustered at the exact date of birth.

Notes: Tables 7A and 7b were estimated using the 2000 Decennial Long Form Census Data. Each coefficient estimates the
impact of being born just after the state entry law cutoff day on grade enrolled, relative to being born just before the cutoff.
Separate samples were created by gender, race, and parental education. Each coefficient was estimated separately, from a
quadratic polynomial regression variable as specified in equation (1) in the text. The unconditional regressions are estimated at
the date of birth level of aggregation, using 180 days of birth before and after each cutoff date. The conditional regressions use
the microdata, and include individuals born 180 days before and after the cutoff date. For example, relative age equals to zero
for kindergarten corresponds to a child exactly 5 years old on the day of the cut off for school entry (6 years old for 1st grade, 10
years old for 5th grade and 14 years old for 9th grade). A relative age of -10 corresponds to a person born ten days before the
cutoff. These regressions include the following covariates: gender, race, urban area, housing ownership, number of people in the
house, number of rooms, household income, parental education and lived in the same state 5 years ago. Standard errors shown
in parentheses are clustered at the exact date of birth.
