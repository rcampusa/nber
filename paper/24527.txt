                                          ABSTRACT

In a stylized model, firms differentiate their products to escape import com- petition. Facing a
nested CES demand, each firm chooses between a nest with competitors and its own nest under
higher costs. The profit from differentiation is an inverted U-shaped function of firm productivity.
It increases with import competition and is lower than the social benefit. Differentiation increases
the gains from trade. In establishment data from China spanning its 2001 WTO accession, tariff
cuts are associated with increases in productivity, introduction of new goods, switches to skill-
intensive sectors. Markups in the model explain the large increases in revenue productivity
among small firms and input suppliers.

1       Introduction
Policy makers and trade economists generally agree that trade reforms improve the per-
formance of domestic competitors in developing countries. While this view is mostly
supported by empirical work, it is at odds with standard theories of international trade.1
Based on increasing returns to scale, theories such as Melitz (2003) and its extensions with
endogenous innovation predict that tightening competition decreases within-firm produc-
tivity by decreasing the scale of production and the rents from innovation.2 We propose
a short extension of Atkeson and Burstein (2008), a commonly used model in trade, in
which domestic firms respond to reductions in trade costs by innovating to escape foreign
competition. We then provide supportive evidence for the model using a panel of Chinese
firms spanning the years of China’s accession to the WTO in 2001.
    In practice, domestic firms escape foreign competition by catering to domestic tastes,
offering greater customization, and bundling products with non-tradable services. For
example, the cell phone company Xiaomi prevented the expansion of Apple in China by
offering Chinese language options and a superior integration of its software with local
apps. Chery Automobiles introduced several new, small car models with many optional
features, and it made replacement parts readily available. Not only do small and fuel-
efficient cars appeal to Chinese consumers, but it is difficult for firms producing cars
abroad to offer customized accoutrements and a wide range of replacement parts because
they have long lead times.3
    We model this type of strategy as a shift toward an unexploited market niche insulated
from foreign competition. Demand is nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES).
There’s a continuum of sectors, each with a finite number of heterogeneous firms. In
decreasing order of productivity in a sector, each firm chooses whether (1) to exit, (2)
to produce a variety in a nest with other competitors, or (3) to incur a higher (fixed
or variable) cost and produce in a new nest where it is a monopolist. All firms then
simultaneously set prices. The choice of product differentiation, between (2) and (3), is
our only departure from Atkeson and Burstein (2008).

     Tybout (2003) surveys studies of trade liberalizations in developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s,
and Shu and Steinwender (2019) surveys more recent studies. Recent papers, such as Amiti and Konings
(2007), Fernandes (2007), Gorodnichenko et al. (2010), Eslava et al. (2013), DeLoecker et al. (2016) find
either positive or insignificant results. As we see below, revenue productivity is not a good proxy for
innovation in the model because pro-competitive effects on markups decrease measured productivity.
   2
     These extensions focus on export expansion and imported inputs, which increase firm size. They
include Lileeva and Trefler (2010), Aw et al. (2011), Bustos (2011) and Bøler et al. (2015). In Caliendo
and Rossi-Hansberg (2012), improvements in efficiency occur through the reorganization of the firm.

(2015) for case studies from China.



                                                    1
    Section 2 studies a closed economy. The incremental profit from differentiation is a
non-monotonic function of the firm’s productivity. If the firm is very unproductive, its
profit is small in any nest. If the firm is much more productive than its competitors, it
will hold near monopoly power and charge a high markup even in the common nest. The
benefit from further differentiation is then small. This simpler, closed-economy setting is
also useful to derive results later applied to understand international trade.
    Section 3 introduces international trade and input suppliers to the model to suit our
empirical context. Foreign firms can only sell varieties in the common nest, an assumption
in line with the interpretation of differentiation as a shift toward a less-tradable market
niche. A reduction in trade costs in a sector increases exit and differentiation among
import-competing firms. Markups increase for firms that differentiate and decrease for
other firms. If two firms, originally in the common nest, make the same discrete choice
after the shock, the markup of the smaller firm increases relative to the larger firm.
Intuitively, the small firm’s price is closer to cost. So, it has a limited scope to decrease
markups in response to tighter competition in the common nest, but it increases its
markup by more than the large firm if they both differentiate.
    Less-differentiated inputs are only used to produce less-differentiated downstream out-
put. The trade shock downstream increases exit, differentiation and markups among input
suppliers. This markup increase contrasts with the ambiguous change in the markups of
import-competing firms.4
    We prove that a firm’s profit from differentiation is always smaller than the social
welfare gain. If differentiation doesn’t require large fixed costs, it increases with large
reductions in trade costs widespread across sectors. Then, the welfare gains from trade
in the model are larger than in a standard model without the differentiation option.
    Section 4 provides reduced-form evidence using a panel of Chinese firms from 1998 to
2007. During the period, China joined the WTO, average tariffs on manufacturing fell
from 18 to 9.4 percent, and imports as a share of GDP doubled from 14 to 28 percent.
    In the data, tariff cuts are associated with firms’ introduction of new goods and with
switches to more skill-intensive sectors.5 These patterns are broadly consistent with the
model, since the predicted product differentiation changes a firm’s output and may in
practice shift it to more skill-intensive tasks. For example to increase its offerings of car
   4
     The markup result, in Section 3, arises because markups in Atkeson and Burstein (2008) depend
on relative costs, not on total sales. This feature also holds in Bernard et al. (2003) and Melitz and
Ottaviano (2008). See Arkolakis et al. (2017) for a general model of trade and variable markups.
   5
     To mitigate the problem of endogeneity, we follow the literature in using initial tariffs as instruments
for tariff changes. See Goldberg et al. (2009), Amiti and Konings (2007), Attanasio et al. (2004). We
cannot observe changes in skill intensity because we only observe skill intensity in one year.



                                                     2
parts and models, Chery Automobiles invested in research and development, and in skill-
intensive technologies such as modern machinery amenable to production in small batches
and integrated computer systems that enable just-in-time inventory controls. While shifts
to skill-intensive tasks often occur within sectors, some may imply a switch in the firm’s
four-digit sectoral classification. Common sector switches in the data include from cotton
and chemical fibers to textile and garment manufacturing, and from steel rolling processing
to metal structures. They suggest upgrading to higher value-added sectors with a greater
scope for differentiation.
    Tariff cuts in the data are also associated with increases in revenue productivity within
import-competing firms and their input suppliers. The effect is larger for small firms
(significant in some specifications) and it is five to ten times larger for input suppliers.6
Although puzzling at a first sight, these asymmetries conform to the predictions of the
model on markups. And since revenue productivity is an estimate of the ratio of revenue
to cost, it maps better to markups in the model than to firms’ decision to differentiate.7
    Section 5 tests the robustness of the empirical results, and Section 6 concludes.
    Holmes and Stevens (2014) also observe that firms with customized products are more
insulated from foreign competition. We extend their model to account for endogenous
product differentiation and markups (their focus is firm size). Consistent with our find-
ings, Brandt and Thun (2010, 2016) describe the increased market segmentation in China
during the period of our analysis.8 The welfare question on optimal variety appears in
Spence (1976a,b), Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) and Dhingra and Morrow (2018), although
our approach differs from the later two papers, which study monopolistic competition
settings.
    In Aghion et al. (2005, 2015) and Akcigit et al. (2018), import competition also spurs
innovation by decreasing the profit from inaction, and the gains from innovation are
non-monotonic in firm productivity. But in these models, competition comes from less-
productive firms, and accordingly, they are used to study firms in rich countries facing
competition from poor countries. These models also feature homogeneous goods within
sectors and only the most productive firm produces. We bring their results closer to
quantitative models with co-existing differentiated varieties. Other mechanisms, such as
technology diffusion, agency problems within firms and offshoring, may also be at work
in the data, but they generally cannot account for all the empirical regularities above.9
   6
     Brandt et al. (2017) and Chen and Steinwender (2019) find similar results on firm size.
   7
     See Section 4.4 for further discussion and references. Methods to decompose productivity into TFPQ
and markups are inconsistent with our model.
   8
     The notion that firms escape competition by seeking market niches where they are monopolists is
common in the business literature (Porter (2008)) and in interviews with entrepreneurs (Rose (2015)).

     See Sampson (2015), Perla et al. (2015), Buera and Oberfield (2016) for technology diffusion and

    Brandt et al. (2017) previously document the relation between tariff cuts and within-
firm productivity in China. We complement their results with other firm outcomes and
indirect input linkages. Goldberg et al. (2010) also link trade shocks to the introduction of
new goods, and Goldberg and Pavcnik (2004, 2007) survey studies on import competition
and demand for skills in developing countries.10 The indirect effect of a shock on input
suppliers appears in the context of foreign direct investment (Javorcik (2004)), imported
inputs (Eslava et al. (2015)), export expansion (Linarello (2018)), and regional disparities
(Acemoglu et al. (2016)).


2     A Closed Economy
We set up the model here. Sections 2.1 and 2.2 present the positive and welfare results,
respectively. Households inelastically supply labor, the unique input into production, to
a perfect labor market. We normalize the total labor endowment to one and take wages
to be the numeraire. There is a continuum of sectors S ∈ [0, 1], each containing a finite
and exogenous set of heterogeneous firms. Each firm produces a single variety. Firms’
discrete choices partition the set of non-exiting varieties into nests, and consumers have
standard nested CES preferences.

Firms Each firm i chooses among three discrete choices: (i) to exit, (ii) to produce a
less-differentiated variety, or (iii) to produce a differentiated variety. If the firm exits, it
gets zero profits. All less-differentiated varieties in sector S are in the same nest, denoted
with LS . Each differentiated variety i has its own nest {i}. If firm i is less-differentiated,
it pays a fixed cost fL and a per-unit cost ciL to produce. If it is differentiated, its fixed
cost is fD and its unit cost is ciD .

Demand We write i ∈ n whenever firm i is in nest n and n ∈ S whenever nest n is in
sector S. The demand for a variety with price p in nest n is

                                                  η−1
                                    q(p, n) = P         Pnσ−η p−σ y                              (1)

trade, and Holmes and Schmitz (2010) and Chen and Steinwender (2019) for agency models. Offshoring
does not explain why our results all hold in a subsample with only non-exporting firms. Firms respond
to competition by switching specialization in Nocke (2006) and Lim et al. (2019), but like the models
above, competition must come from below in order to increase firm markups.
  10
     For recent work on trade and labor, see Topalova (2010), Autor et al. (2013), Dix-Carneiro and
Kovak (2017). Only a small fraction of firms in China engage in R&D and patenting, common proxies
for innovation in developed countries.

y is total spending and pi is the price of variety i. The elasticity of substitution between
nests is η irrespective of whether nests are in the same sector or not for simplicity. The
elasticity of substitution between varieties within a nest is σ. Assume σ > η > 1. For a

Game within a Sector In ascending order of costs ciL , each firm in sector S decides
among the three discrete choices above (i) exit, (ii) less-differentiation, and (iii) differen-
tiation. Once all discrete choices are made, firms simultaneously set prices. Production
and trade take place, and payoffs are realized.11
    We consider the subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) and solve it by backward induc-
tion. After all discrete choices are made, each firm chooses the price that best responds
to other firm’s prices. From (1), firm i in nest n with unit cost c solves

      Name the mS firms in sector S so that c1L ≤ ... ≤ cmS L . Denote an action of
firm i with gi ∈ G = {exit, less differentiation, differentiation}. A vector of actions
(g1 , ..., gmS ) determines the sets of exiting, less-differentiated, and differentiated firms.
By backward induction, starting with the least productive firm, for i = mS , ..., 1 and all
possible actions (g̃1 , ..., g̃i−1 ), firm i chooses among three subgames with starting nodes
(g̃1 , ..., g̃i−1 , gi ) for gi ∈ G. Since it anticipates the actions of firms i + 1, ..., mS following
(g̃1 , ..., g̃i−1 , less differentiation), it anticipates its competitors’ costs c−iL in LS . The firm
then picks max{0, πL (ciL , c−iL ) − fL , πD (ciD ) − fD }. These decisions are unique in every
node up to a perturbation of parameters, and so the SPE is also unique up to a pertur-
bation. Throughout, we ignore these cases of indifference and cases in which two or more
firms have the same unit cost ciL or ciD .

Aggregation and Equilibrium Sector S is characterized by unit costs {ciL , ciD }i∈S .
Assume these cost vectors are bounded below by some c > 0, and ordering firms in
ascending ciL , they are continuous in S ∈ [0, 1] in all but at most a finite number of
sectors in which the number of firms in the sector may change.
    All sectors are in SPE. Let DS be the set of differentiated firms in sector S. The set
of nests in sector S is one nest {i} for each i ∈ DS plus LS if LS 6= ∅. Let cSL be the
vector of unit costs in the less-differentiated nest LS , and take PL (cSL ) = ∞ if LS = ∅.

all sectors are in subgame perfect equilibrium, and equations (8) and (9) hold.


2.1    Positive Results in the Closed Economy
Exit Because more productive firms move first, if firms in sector S can be ranked in
terms of costs, ciD < ci0 D if and only if ciL < ci0 L , then there exists cS > 0 such that firms
in S produce if and only if ciL ≤ cS . (See proof in Appendix A.1.)

Productivity and Differentiation The effect of changes in unit costs on the profit
gain from differentiation is straightforward: An efficient firm disproportionately gains if
ciD < ciL and loses if ciD > ciL .12 So to isolate the novel mechanism, assume for the
moment ciD = ciL ≡ (φ)−1 and fD > fL (to make the firm’s choice non-trivial). Fix the
cost of firm i’s competitors in LS , c−iL , and vary the firm’s productivity φ.
    Figure 1 illustrates this exercise. It plots the net profit from differentiation πD (1/φ) −
πL (1/φ, c−iL ) − (fD − fL ) in Panel A and markups in Panel B as functions of φ. The net
profit is (fL − fD ) < 0 when φ = 0 because limφ→0 πD (1/φ) = limφ→0 πL (1/φ, c−iL ) = 0.
Appendix A.2 proves convexity of the set of productivities φ with a positive net profit.
    The limit φ → ∞ is more didactic. It’s less straightforward because the markup gain
from differentiation goes to zero but sales go to infinity. Let piD = η/[(η − 1)φ] be the
price under differentiation, and P−iL be the CES price index in nest LS excluding firm i
from the sum, where we omit its argument (1/φ, c−iL ).13 Then

In words, the profit gain from differentiation is bounded above by the profit from acquiring
the residual demand of competitors in nest LS . Since this residual demand goes to zero
as the firm’s own productivity goes to infinity, the gain must also go to zero.
  12
    Innovation is often modelled as a fixed cost to decrease unit costs—e.g, Lileeva and Trefler (2010)
and Bustos (2011). Differentiation involves the same considerations in the special case fD > fL and
ciD < ciL . We deal with the cases ciL ≷ ciD in Appendix A.2.

Shocks to Competition in a Sector Sector S is initially in SPE. A shock decreases
the unit cost ciL of some firm i ∈ S. The sector moves to a new SPE.
    In profit function (4), the key statistic summarizing the level of competition that firm
i faces in the less-differentiated nest is
                                                                                !1/(1−σ)

where pi0 are implicit functions of costs through (5). We refer to a decrease in ciL as large
if it decreases P−,L (ci0 L , c−i0 L ) for all i0 6= i and i0 ∈ S. With a finite number of firms per
sector, it’s always possible to construct large shocks.
     A large decrease in ciL increases differentiation and exit among firms i0 6= i and i0 ∈
S. Among surviving firms, the shock decreases the markup of firms that remain less
differentiated, and it increases the markup of newly-differentiated firms.
     Take two firms a, b ∈ LS in the initial equilibrium with caL < cbL . If both firms survive
and make the same discrete choice after the shock, then the markup of b increases relative
to a. This result holds when both firms differentiate because firm a initially has a higher
markup than b, and their markups both go to η/(η − 1). Appendix A.3 proves the case
in which firms a and b remain in LS , and they best respond to the shock and to other
endogenous price changes. Intuitively, firm b has less scope to decrease its markup, which
is closer to the lower bound σ/(σ − 1).14
     Appendix A.4 uses a numerical example to show that a small decrease in ciL has an
ambiguous effect on the discrete choice of firms in S due to strategic interactions among
firms. The example has three firms. Firms 1 and 3 are initially less-differentiated. Firm
2 is differentiated because its entry into nest LS is not enough to induce firm 3 to exit
and πD (c2D ) > πL (c2L , {c1L , c3L }). A shock decreases cost c1L to c01L < c1L . Firm 3 then
prefers to exit then to compete with both firms 1 and 2 in nest LS . In response to the
change in firm 3’s strategy, firm 2 switches from differentiation in the initial equilibrium
to less differentiation, because πD (c2D ) < πL (c2L , {c01L }). In this example, P−,L (c2L , c−2L )
in (10) increases with the shock as c−2L goes from {c1L , c3L } to {c01L }.

Shock to Competition in a Non-Zero Measure of Firms.                 Let I be a set of
firms and S be the smallest subset of sectors containing I. Assume S has a non-zero
measure. An economy is in equilibrium. The unit cost ciL of all firms i ∈ I decreases.
The assumptions on continuity and boundedness of the cost vectors hold before and after
  14
     This result extends Amiti et al. (2014) who prove that markup responses are increasing in firm size
for a marginal shock to a firm’s cost in the Atkeson and Burstein (2008) model.

    Assume that the shock is large enough to decrease P y and to decrease P−,L (ciL , c−iL )
                                                          η−1
for all firms i ∈ S \ I. A large shock decreases P y because the profit share of the
economy is bounded, and the shock can make P arbitrarily small. It satisfies the second
condition because the number of firms in each sector is finite.15
    For firms i ∈ S \ I, the shock increases exit, and it increases differentiation if fD ≤ fL .
The effect of the shock on the ratio πD (ciD )/πL (ciL , c−iL ) is the same as in the single-sector
shock above. The condition fD ≤ fL arises because profits πD and π0 both fall with the
          η−1
fall in P y. Then, the incentives for firms to make costly investments decreases, as in
standard models.
    In sum, firms in the model have an option to escape competition by creating a new
nest. The net profit from this option is not necessarily monotonic in firm productivity,
and it increases with large shocks to competition among less-differentiated varieties. Next,
we compare this private profit to social welfare.


2.2     Welfare Results in the Closed Economy
It is well-known that heterogeneous markups lead to factor misallocation. Appendix B.1
proves that, given a set of discrete choices, the planner allocates relatively more labor than
the market to differentiated than to less-differentiated varieties, and to more productive
varieties within less-differentiated nests.16 Here, we focus on novel results on discrete
choices. We evaluate the marginal welfare effects of a single variety in Section 2.2.1 and
of a non-zero mass of firms in Section 2.2.2.

2.2.1    Marginal Welfare Effect of a Firm’s Discrete Choice

Removing a variety from the market frees up labor to the rest of the economy. The
marginal cost of labor in the economy is C = K/Q where Q is the standard aggregate
  15
     A large shock may drive all firms out of the market in some sectors, including firms directly hit with
                                     η−1
the shock, due to the reduction in P     y. This possibility does not affect any of the claims below.
  16
     See Edmond et al. (2015) for misallocation in the Atkeson and Burstein (2008) model (with exogenous
nests). From standard CES maximization, labor allocations of any i, i0 ∈ LS satisfy

So, the planner allocates more labor to the variety with the higher markup µiL compared to the market.
The proof for allocation of labor between nests follows a similar reasoning.

The first inequality holds because when variety i is taken out of nest LS , the consumer’s
valuation of other varieties in LS increases. The second inequality is area between qL and
q̃ in Figure 2(b).17 Both inequalities are strict if LS 6= {i}.
     Since µD ≥ µiL , inequalities (12) and (14) imply that the marginal social benefit of a
differentiated variety is always greater than the private profit, whether the comparison is
to exit or less differentiation. Compared to exit, the social benefit of a less-differentiated
variety is smaller than the private profit if the firm is sufficiently less productive than its
competitors for µiL < µ.
     In sum, there are three reasons for the planner to value differentiated varieties more
than the market. First, less-differentiated varieties steal business from each other (in-
equality (13)). Second is the wedge between the two curves in Figure 2(b). Third, the
consumer surplus is calculated on the basis of prices and quantities, but the planner values
labor. And for a given revenue, the differentiated variety uses less labor because it has a
higher markup (inequality (12)).

2.2.2     Welfare and the Discrete Choices of a Large Set of Firms

An economy is in equilibrium. A planner selects a set of differentiated firms I, with
non-zero mass, and shifts them to less-differentiation. The planner maintains other firms’
discrete choices. The conditions on continuity of costs hold conditional on new discrete
choices. Simultaneously after the change, all firms reset prices and general equilibrium
variables (P , y) adjust to satisfy (8) and (9).
    We prove that welfare is lower in the counterfactual than in the original equilibrium.
                                                               η−1
Suppose not. Suppose that real income y/P increases. Then, P y must decrease because
y decreases by construction.18 Then, for any firm i,

       πL (ciL , c−iL ) − πD (ciD ) =                                                            (15)

                         η−1
decreases because P y decreases and there are (weakly) more elements in c−iL for all
i. But in Section 2.2.1, we proved that the marginal gain from transferring a firm from
differentiation to less-differentiation was larger for the firm than for the planner. So, the
only way for the planner to benefit from the counterfactual is if the profits from less-
differentiation increase with general equilibrium effects for a non-zero measure of firms.
This contradicts the movement in (15).


3       A Small Open Economy with Intermediate Inputs
We introduce international trade and input suppliers to the model. For exposition, we
present a highly stylized, partial equilibrium model here and its results in Section 3.1.
Appendix C proves these results in general equilibrium and with free entry. In Section
3.1, we describe these extensions and discuss other assumptions.
    Home is a small country that trades with large Foreign. Home households sell their
one unit of labor in a perfect labor market. There is a continuum of sectors S ∈ [0, 1].
Sector 0 produces a homogenous good using only labor and the same constant returns
to scale technology in Home and Foreign. This homogeneous good is traded at no cost.
We take wages in Home and Foreign to be the numeraire. Since our empirical focus is on
import competition, not exports, we assume that the homogeneous good is used only for
  18
     The markup strictly decreases for all firms in I and for their competitors in less-differentiated nests
LS . Since the price indices of these nests decrease relative to firms that remain differentiated, labor shifts
from differentiated firms to LS .

            Figure 3: Summary of firms choices and flows in the Home market




exports to balance trade, not by Home firms or consumers.
    Each sector S ∈ (0, 1] is endowed with three finite sets of firms: A set of downstream
Foreign firms SF , a set of downstream Home firms SH , and a set of upstream Home firms
SU . As before, firms’ discrete choices partition the varieties used for final consumption
into nests. Consumer demand over these varieties is in (1).

Firms in sector S ∈ (0, 1]. Figure 3 summarizes firm choices when servicing the Home
market. Each Foreign firm i ∈ SF chooses between (i) exiting or (ii) supplying Home with
a less-differentiated downstream variety. A Home firm i ∈ SH ∪ SU chooses among (i) ex-
iting, (ii) producing a less-differentiated variety, or (iii) producing a differentiated variety.
For simplicity, all differentiated varieties in SH ∪ SU are used for final consumption and
each has its own nest. All less-differentiated downstream varieties, foreign and domestic,
are in the same nest LS . All less-differentiated upstream varieties are in nest LSU and are
used for the production of Home less-differentiated varieties in LS ∩ SH .
    Firms that exit get zero profits. Foreign firm i ∈ LS ∩ SF pays a fixed cost fL∗ and
a cost ciL for each unit of its variety delivered in Home. A Home differentiated firm
i pays a fixed cost fD and its unit cost is ciD . A less-differentiated upstream variety
i ∈ LSU has a fixed cost fU and unit cost ciU . Less-differentiated domestic downstream
varieties, in LS ∩ SH , have a fixed cost of fL units of labor, and they combine labor
with less-differentiated upstream varieties in LSU for variable costs. The unit cost of firm
i ∈ LS ∩ SH is ciL = c̃SU /φi where φi is a firm-specific productivity parameter and c̃SU is

Game in sector S ∈ (0, 1]. The sectoral game has the following stages. (1) In ascending
order of costs ciU , Home upstream firms in SU make their discrete choices. (2) In ascending
order of costs ciL , Foreign firms in SF make their discrete choices. (3) In descending order
of productivity φi , Home downstream firms in SH make their discrete choices. (4) All firms
set prices simultaneously. (5) Production and sales take place, and payoffs are realized.
    The ordering of stages 1, 2, and 3 do not matter for the results. Prices are set last so
that firms cannot commit on prices to manipulate other firms’ discrete choices. We again
consider the subgame perfect equilibrium.
    In the pricing stage, since firms best respond to each other’s prices, downstream firms
take as given input cost c̃SU and the vector of costs ciL for Home and Foreign firms in LS .
The net profit of a firm i ∈ LS is [πL (ciL , c−iL ) − fL ] if i ∈ SH and [πL (ciL , c−iL ) − fL∗ ] if
i ∈ SF , where function πL is in (7). The net profit of a differentiated firm i is πD (ciD )−fD ,
where πD is in (6).
    The total production cost of all less-differentiated downstream Home firms, in LS ∩SH ,
is YSU c̃SU where
                                                                             !

Endogenous elasticity U is again a weighted average of elasticities. The firm’s market
share in nest LSU is s. If s is small, its elasticity is close to σU , the elasticity of substitution
among varieties in LSU . If s is large, then it competes with labor with an elasticity ηU .
The share of the firm in total costs c̃SU is ssSU . If ssSU = 1 the firm would face an
elasticity zero because it takes sales downstream as given. To eliminate this possibility,
ensure that problem (18) has a solution and that markups increase with differentiation,
assume that cost ciU is sufficiently high that the elasticity U > η whenever s = 1 for all
i ∈ SU and all S ∈ (0, 1].19
    Equation (19) implicitly defines the vector of prices in nest LSU as a function of unit
costs ciU . The operating profit (18) of firm i ∈ LSU is
                                                                                           −σU

where c−iU is the vector of its competitors’ costs, and we omitted the arguments of
functions on the right-hand side. Elasticity U and price indices c̃SU and pSU are functions
of (ciU , c−iU ), and YSU is a function of input cost pSU and of the parameters of downstream
firms in LS , {φi }i∈LS ∩SH and {ciL }i∈LS ∩SF . The firm’s net profit is πU (ciU , c−iU , YSU )−fU .
This completes the derivation of payoffs in all final nodes of the sectoral game.
    Equilibrium discrete choices are again solved by backward induction. Each firm effec-
tively chooses among subgames when making its discrete choice, and the SPE is unique
up to a perturbation of parameters.
    Because upstream firms move first, there may be strategic complementarities among
them. A firm may enter LSU only in subgames with a sufficiently large set of competitors
in LSU to drive down equilibrium cost c̃SU and induce downstream entry into LS .

sumptions on continuity and lower bound of cost parameters ciL for i ∈ SF , and ciU for

In Appendix C.4, upstream firms set prices before downstream firms. Then, they internalize the effect of
their prices on sales downstream, obviating the need for this assumption.

3.1       Shocks to International Trade
Sectoral Shocks An economy is in equilibrium. Trade costs decrease in sector S, and
all firms in S change their strategies to a new SPE.
    A decrease in trade costs in sector S decreases ciL for all i ∈ SF , since these unit
costs include production and trade. For domestic downstream firms in SH , if the shock
is sufficiently large, then it increases exit and differentiation. It increases the markup
of firms that differentiate and decreases the markup of firms that remain in LS . If two
firms a, b ∈ SH with caL < cbL are initially less-differentiated, then the markup of firm b
increases relative to firm a if both firms remain in LS or if they both differentiate.
    To see that these results from Section 2.1 hold even with input suppliers, note that
the cost of the bundle of inputs c̃SU is bounded below by the cost when all upstream firms
i ∈ SU are less-differentiated. Then, it is always possible to decrease ciL for all i ∈ SF
sufficiently for P−,L in (10) to decrease for all domestic firms i relative to the firm’s unit
cost when the input bundle is at its lower bound.
    For upstream firms, the shock decreases the absorption of less-differentiated inputs,
directly through losses in the market share of downstream domestic firms in LS ∩ SH
and indirectly through exit and differentiation downstream. As ciL goes to zero for all
i ∈ SF , the term YSU in (17) and the profit a less-differentiated input supplier also go
to zero. Hence, for a sufficiently large shock, upstream firms also exit or differentiate.
These changes by some firms increase the market share of upstream firms that remain
less-differentiated, in LSU . Hence their markups in (19) increase.

Economy-Wide Shocks A large reduction in Foreign costs in a non-zero measure of
sectors S ⊂ (0, 1] increases exit and differentiation of Home firms in sectors S ∈ S if
fD ≤ fL . Suppose that after the shock, a planner forces downstream Home firms to
switch back to less-differentiation and maintains other firms’ post-trade discrete choices.
The results on welfare in Section 2.2 imply that the economy is worse off after the planner’s
intervention than in the post-trade equilibrium. In this sense, the welfare gains from trade
are larger in the model than in a standard model without the option of differentiation.20
 20
      See Appendix C.2 for the welfare proof in the open economy.


                                                             17
Discussion Two assumptions are worth noting. First, foreign firms cannot differentiate
their variety. Nothing in the model changes if we allow for the existence of nests that
are supplied only by foreign firms, such as market niches with luxuries and high-tech
goods.21 Key is that, for domestic firms, import competition decreases the profit from
less-differentiated relative to differentiated varieties. It is consistent with our interpreta-
tion, in the introduction, of differentiated domestic varieties as more customized, tailored
to domestic tastes, bundled with non-tradable services. Second, less-differentiated inputs
are used only for producing less-differentiated downstream output. If product differenti-
ation is associated with quality upgrades, as in the examples of Xiaomi and Chery, then
the assumption that lower-quality firms use lower-quality inputs is well grounded in the
literature.22
    Appendix C proves the results in general equilibrium. In Appendix C1, there is no
homogeneous sector 0 and firms in sectors S ∈ (0, 1] may export. Appendix C2 considers
the assumptions of C1 with two symmetric countries. Appendix C3 introduces free entry.


4         Data and Evidence
We describe the data in Section 4.1, the empirical specification in Section 4.2, and the
results in Section 4.3. Section 4.4 uses the model to interpret these results. We use a
similar specification and the same data as Brandt, Van Biesebroeck, Wang, and Zhang
(2017, BVWZ henceforth).


4.1       Data Sources
We use an annual survey of industrial establishments collected by the Chinese National
Bureau of Statistics. The survey comprises private enterprises with annual sales of more
than 5 million yuan and all state-owned enterprises (SOEs). We use a ten-year unbalanced
panel from 1998 to 2007. The data contain information on output, fixed assets, total
workforce, wage bill, intermediate input costs, foreign investment, revenue from domestic
and export sales. Price indices by sector are reported annually in the official publication.
See BVWZ, Du et al. (2012) and Aghion et al. (2015) for further details.
    The original dataset has 2,226,104 establishment-year observations. We keep only
firms in manufacturing, the more tradable sector. We drop three sectors with missing
price indices, and observations with missing data on output, labor, capital, or material
    21
       A decrease in the price index of these nests has the same general equilibrium effects of decreasing
    η−1
P       y as decreases in the cost of foreign varieties in a non-zero set of sectors.

inputs. Our main results restrict the sample to firms with zero foreign ownership and
with zero or a minority state ownership. The results with multinationals and SOE’s are
in Section 5. The final sample has 1,037,738 observations.
    Our tariff data set is the World Integrated Trading Solution (WITS), maintained by
the World Bank. We use the 2002 Chinese Input-Output table to construct some variables.


4.2     Empirical Specification
Our main regression specification is:

               yit =β1 log Output Tariffj(i,t)t + β2 log Downstream Tariffj(i,t)t
                     + γ1 Xj(i,t)t + γ2 Xi,t + αi + αt + ε                                     (20)

where the subscripts refer to firm i, year t, and the sector j(i, t) of firm i at time t,
αi are firm fixed effects, and αt are time fixed effects. Appendix D.1 details control
variables. Sector-time controls Xjt include input tariffs, state ownership in sector j, and
foreign ownership in sector j and in sectors upstream and downstream from j. Firm-
time controls Xit include zero-one dummy variables indicating whether firm i received
subsidies, whether it received a tax holiday, and whether it paid below median interest
rates on loans. We cluster standard errors by firm and by the firm’s initial sector.
    The independent variables of interest are tariffs that China imposes on its imports.
Output Tariffjt is the tariff of sector j at time t. Downstream tariffjt are tariffs on the
sectors to which firms in sector j provide inputs:
                                                  X
                        Downstream Tariffjt =            δjk Output Tariffkt
                                                  k6=j


where δjk is the share of sector j’s production supplied to downstream sector k in the
2002 Chinese Input-Output table. Weights δjk do not add up to one because part of
output goes to final consumption. Output tariffs are measured at the four-digit level,
while downstream tariffs are measured in 71 sectors because the input-output table has
a coarser sectoral classification than the firm survey. Downstream tariffs are intended to
capture the effect of tariff reductions on the input suppliers of import-competing firms.
For example, for a producer of car engines, the output tariffs are tariffs on car engines
and downstream tariffs are tariffs on cars. We also control for input tariffs in Xjt , but the
effect of these tariffs is well known and not the focus of our analysis.23
  23
    We take input and output tariffs directly from BVWZ. As BVWZ observe, input tariffs are measured
with error in China because its government often refunds tariffs on inputs.


                                                19
     We use instrumental variables to mitigate the concern that firms endogenously in-
fluence tariffs through lobbying. Similar to other trade liberalizations, China reduced
both the level and the heterogeneity in tariffs. Following the literature, we instrument
for input, output and downstream tariffs using the corresponding tariff for the firm in
1998 interacted with a dummy variable equal to one after China entered the WTO.24
BVWZ document a strong negative correlation between initial tariffs and changes in tar-
iffs in China, and they confirm that changes in tariffs are uncorrelated with initial sector
characteristics and trends in the establishment survey (Figure 3 and Table 1 in BVWZ).
     Dependent variables yit are firm outcomes often associated with innovation or quality
upgrading in the literature: Revenue total factor productivity (TFP), introduction of new
goods, and skill intensity.
     For TFP, we estimate separately for each 2-digit sector the production function

           log Xit = α0j(i,t) + αLj(i,t) log Lit + αM j(i,t) log Mit + αKj(i,t) log Kit + µit           (21)

where X is output, L is number of employees, K is capital, M is material inputs, and
α0j , αLj , αKj and αM j are sector-specific parameters to be estimated. We deflate output
and cost variables with the sectoral price indices.25 We estimate (21) using the standard
two-stage procedure in Olley and Pakes (1996), with OLS and time fixed effects, and
following Ackerberg et al. (2015) in Section 5. The estimated T F Pit is the predicted value
of log Xit − α̂Lj(i,t) log Lit − α̂M j(i,t) log Mit − α̂Kj(i,t) log Kit . When TFP is the dependent
variable in (20), we add sector fixed effects since TFP is not comparable across sectors.
    For the introduction of new goods, we use the share of new products in total sales,
reported in the survey, and a dummy variable equal to one if firm i introduces a new
product in year t and zero otherwise.
    Unfortunately, we only observe the composition of the workforce in the 2004 survey.
We define skilled workers as those with a senior-high degree, or a three- or four-year
college degree.26 We rank sectors according to the share of skilled workers in their labor
force in 2004 and use the ranking of sector j(i, t) as the dependent variable yit in (20).
Of the 450 sectors in the data, the least skill-intensive is the production of packaging and
bags, and the most skill intensive is a subsector of aircraft manufacturing.
  24
      See Goldberg et al. (2009), Amiti and Konings (2007), and Attanasio et al. (2004). We can’t use the
initial tariffs alone as an instrument because our regressions have firm fixed effects.
   25
      Output value is deflated by the 29 individual sector ex-factory price indices of industrial products.
To deflate material inputs, these 29 sector price indices are assigned to output data using the Chinese
input-output table. Capital is defined as the net value of fixed assets, which is deflated by a uniform
fixed assets investment index, and labor is a physical measure of the total number of employees.
   26
      Changing the educational cutoffs in the definition of skill intensity yields highly correlated measures.



                                                     20
4.3    Empirical Results
The main coefficients from regression (20) are in Table 1, and the coefficients on control
variables are in Appendix D.1. The coefficients on output tariffs are all negative. They are
statistically significant and larger (in absolute value) in the IV than in the OLS specifica-
tions, possibly due to firms responding more to the large tariff cuts of the WTO accession
than to smaller cuts in other years. The coefficients are also negative in the subsample
of only non-exporting firms in columns (5) and (6). So, greater import competition is
associated to within-firm increases in revenue TFP, the introduction of new goods, and
shifts toward skill-intensive sectors.
    Using the IV specification with all establishments in Panel A, a one standard deviation
in log of tariffs, around 0.5, is associated with an increase in revenue TFP by about 2.5
percent (0.5 × 0.5). In Panel B, it is associated with an increase of 0.8 percentage points
in the share of new products in total sales (0.5 × -0.0157), and with an increase of 2
percentage points in the probability of introducing a new product (0.5 × -0.0405).
    In Panel C, the dependent variable is the ranking of sectors in ascending order of skill
intensity. Since all specifications include firm fixed effects, the identification stems from
firms switching sectors, approximately 15 percent of firms in the sample. With point
estimates ranging from -18 to -26, a one standard deviation reduction in log tariffs is as-
sociated with a movement up the rank of 9 to 13 sectors. Among non-exporting firms, the
sector switches with the largest number of firms include switches from cotton and chemical
fibers (1761) to textile and garments manufacturing (1810), from steel rolling processing
(3230) to the manufacture of metal structures (3411), and from non-ferrous rolling process
(3351) to optical fiber and cable manufacturing (3931). All these switches are from lower
value-added products or stages of production to higher value-added products, where the
scope for differentiation is arguably greater.
    The coefficient on downstream tariffs is negative in all IV specifications of Table 1, sug-
gesting that the suppliers of inputs to import-competing firms also respond to tariff cuts
by increasing revenue TFP, introducing new goods, switching to skill-intensive four-digit
sectors. When the dependent variable measures the introduction of new goods or sectoral
skill intensity (Panels B and C), the coefficients are either close to the coefficient on out-
put tariffs, or they are less robust and flip signs in some OLS specifications. Plausibly,
input suppliers seem to respond less to tariff cuts than import-competing firms, directly
hit with the shock. But when the dependent variable is TFP (Panel A), the coefficients
on downstream tariffs are about seven times larger than the coefficients on output tariffs
in all IV specifications. This result is robust to numerous checks in Section 5.

The table repeats the results of Table 1 substituting the independent variable tariff for an interaction of
tariff with a dummy indicating the firm’s quartile of sales in the sector and lagged year (q1, q2, q3, q4)
                                                    23
plus the lagged quartiles q1, q2, q3, q4 by themselves. Standard errors are clustered by firm and initial
sector. Tariffs and TFP are in logs. Appendix A.1 reports the coefficients on control variables.
Firm Heterogeneity To investigate whether the responses to tariff cuts differ across
firms of different sizes, we split firms in each sector-year into quartiles of sales, and
we repeat the regressions in Table 1 replacing log Output Tariffj(i,t)t with the log Out-
put Tariffj(i,t)t interacted with dummies indicating the firm’s quartile of sales within its
sector in year t − 1. We also add these quartile dummies as independent variables.
    Table 2 reports the coefficients on the interaction terms. The dependent variable
measures revenue TFP in Panel A, the introduction of new goods in Panel B, and the
ranking of sector skill intensity in Panel C. While there is no systematic difference across
quartiles of sales in Panels B and C, the coefficient on tariffs increases with quartile of sales
in Panel A. It is 40 to 160 percent larger in absolute value in the smallest relative to the
largest quartile of sales. This difference is statistically significant in most specifications,
as the p-value indicates.27


4.4     Discussion: Data and Model
Our empirical results exploit cross-sectoral variation of large tariff cuts in China during
its WTO accession. We interpret these sector-specific tariff cuts as a reduction in the
cost of Foreign varieties ciL in a single sector S in the model. A large reduction increases
exit and product differentiation in Home. Since differentiation is not directly observed,
we take the introduction of new goods and shifts to skill-intensive four-digit sectors as
proxies. Consistent with the model, these variables increase with output tariff cuts in
Table 1. In Appendix Tables D.7 and D.8, tariff cuts are associated with exit from the
survey and with switches in four-digit sectors (significant in some specifications only).28
    Revenue TFP in equation (21) is an estimate of the ratio of revenue to costs which
corresponds to markups in the model. In Table 1, tariff cuts are associated with smaller
increases in the TFP of import-competing firms, directly hit with the shock, than in the
TFP of their input suppliers. This result, puzzling at a first sight, is consistent with the
model, where import competition downstream increases the markup of upstream firms
and has an ambiguous effect on the markup of downstream firms.
    In Table 2 Panels B and C, tariff cuts are associated with similar increases in the prob-
ability of switching to skill-intensive sectors or of introducing new goods across quartiles
of firm sales. This finding suggests that firms of heterogeneous sizes may make similar
  27
     The coefficients on downstream tariffs almost don’t change from Table 1 to 2 (Appendix D.1). In
separate regressions, we checked for interactions between quartile of sales and downstream tariffs but
found no discernible pattern.
  28
     The model doesn’t have sharp predictions on the relation between output tariffs and sales, but the
relation is generally negative in the data (Table D.9) as predicted by standard models. Table D.10
confirms for our data the well-known positive relation between TFP and sales within sector and year.


                                                  24
discrete choices in response to tariff cuts. The model then predicts that the markup of
smaller firms increases relative to larger firms, precisely the monotonic pattern of coeffi-
cients across quartiles of sales when the dependent variable is TFP in Panel A.
    This interpretation of TFP is valid as long as revenue TFP is correlated with the true
unobserved revenue to cost ratio in the data. But two points are in order. First, measures
of TFP generally assume a Markov path for productivity, Hicks neutrality, and product
homogeneity. These assumptions are all violated in the model and arguably in the data
as import competition reshapes firms’ residual demand and innovation changes output
and production processes.29 The usual decomposition of revenue TFP into quantity TFP
and prices is not applicable because varieties in the model are differentiated and costs ciL
and ciD are quality-adjusted like in Melitz (2003).30 Second, even if revenue productivity
perfectly measured the ratio of revenue to cost, it would still confound the positive effect
of differentiation on markups with the negative effect of tighter competition on firms that
do not differentiate.
    The Chinese accession to the WTO was a large trade liberalization. Average tariffs on
manufacturing in China fell from 43 percent in 1992 to 9.4 percent in 2004. In Table 2,
small firms in sectors with larger tariff cuts increased revenue productivity, the introduc-
tion of new goods and switches to skill-intensive sectors relative to small firms in other
sectors. The model can only rationalize these findings if differentiation doesn’t involve
large fixed costs, fD ≈ fL . This condition is sufficient for large and widespread decreases
in trade costs to increase differentiation in the model. So, through the lenses of the model,
the WTO accession increased overall product differentiation in China, not just in some
sectors relative to others.
    A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that gains from trade due to differentiation
may be sizable. In Table 1 Panel B, a one standard deviation reduction in log output
tariffs is associated with an increase in new products of 0.8 percentage points in total sales
(0.5 × -0.0157). If we set η = 2 and σ = 10 the welfare gain from increasing the mass
of differentiated products by 0.8 percent and decreasing more substitutable products by
the same share increases welfare by 0.7 percent, a significant value relative to standard
estimates of gains from trade.31
  29
     Harrison (1994), De Loecker (2007) and De Loecker and Warzynski (2012) make similar points on
changes in demand during trade reforms. DeLoecker et al. (2016) allow for vertically-differentiated goods,
but maintain the other assumptions above. Bøler (2019) and Harrigan et al. (2019) relax Hicks neutrality
and allow for skill-biased technical change. We can’t use their measurement of TFP because we don’t
observe worker skills.
  30
     As Foster et al. (2008) explain, these methods apply to sectors with homogeneous goods, where
quantity TFP is meaningful.
  31                                                                             1   0
     Using the definition of P in (1), the estimated decrease in price is P /P ≈ 1.0081/(1−η) ∗

5     Robustness of Empirical Results
Appendix D.3 presents the results and detailed the procedures of the robustness checks
summarized here. Checks on Table 1 are in Appendix Tables D.11 (TFP), D.12 (introduc-
tion of new goods), and D.13 (sectoral skill intensity). In each table, row 1 has a sample
of all firms, including multinationals and SOE’s. Rows 2 and 3 check for collinearity by
dropping one tariff measure at a time. Rows 4 and 5 check for selection. Row 4 uses only
a balanced panel of firms that survived in all ten years of data. Following Wooldridge
(2010), we estimate a selection equation with a probit using the accounting profit share
of the firm in the previous period as the selection variable. Row 5 repeats the main spec-
ification controlling for the estimated Mills ratio. In row 6, we follow Pierce and Schott
(2016) in measuring and controlling for the uncertainty in the United States policy toward
its imports from China. Row 7 excludes textiles and apparel, the sectors affected by the
expiration of the multifiber agreement (MFA) in the period of our data. Row 8 excludes
computers and peripherals, which experienced a large growth in offshoring. When the de-
pendent variable is TFP (Table D.11), row 9 includes tariffs in the first stage of the TFP
estimation following De Loecker (2007), and row 10 estimates TFP following Ackerberg
et al. (2015).
    Consistent with Table 1, the coefficient on output tariffs is negative and statistically
significant in our preferred specifications, the IV with only non-exporters. When exporters
are included, the coefficient loses statistical significance in the specification with multi-
nationals when the dependent variable is TFP (Table D.11, row 1) and with a balanced
panel when the dependent variable measures the introduction of new goods (Table D.12,
row 4). Both of these results are reassuring. Exporting multinationals are generally not
as affected by the domestic market and may have a comparative disadvantage in tailoring
their goods to domestic tastes. Firms that survive all ten years of the sample likely have
successful products and may be less prone to introduce new ones.
    Also consistent with Table 1, when the dependent variable is TFP, the coefficient on
downstream tariffs is about seven to eight times larger than the coefficient on output
tariffs in all IV specifications with only non-exporters.
    Tables D.14, D.15, and D.16 repeat these robustness checks for the specification in
Table 2. The coefficient on output tariffs increases systematically with quartile of sales
0.9921/(1−σ) = 0.993. The value η = 2 is between Edmond et al. (2015)’s estimate η = 1.28 and
Broda and Weinstein (2006)’s median elasticity of 5-digit SITC codes, estimated to 2.7. To get a sense
magnitude for the standard gain from trade, imports as a share of GDP increased from 14% to 28% in
the period of our data. Then, the welfare gain in Arkolakis et al. (2012) with an elasticity σ = 5 (between
2 and 10, and no intermediate inputs) is (0.72/0.86)−1/5 − 1 = 3.6 percent.



                                                    26
in the TFP regressions, but like Table 2, the difference between the smallest and largest
quartile is not always statistically significant. The robust finding is the negative coefficient
on output tariffs interacted with the smallest quartile of sales for all dependent variables.
As previously explained, the model only rationalizes these results if the fixed cost to
differentiate is small, a sufficient condition for large and widespread decreases in foreign
costs to increase differentiation overall (not just in some sectors relative to others).


6        Conclusion
We set out to narrow the gap between the academic literature and the prevailing view
among policy makers and economists that tariff cuts are good for the performance of
import-competing firms. We develop a stylized extension of Atkeson and Burstein (2008),
in which import-competing firms escape foreign competition by specializing in new market
niches (nests). Since these product-differentiation strategies to escape import competition
improve welfare in the model, they provide a rationale for policy makers’ view.
    Revenue productivity, the standard measure of firm performance in the empirical liter-
ature, is a poor measure of product differentiation because it confounds the positive effects
of import competition on innovation with negative pro-competitive effects on markups.
We circumvent this difficulty using data on new goods and sectoral skill intensity which
are comparable across time even in periods of large changes in demand, technologies and
output, such as trade liberalization episodes.
    Our proposed mechanism may be relevant in other contexts. Firms innovating to
escape competition in established market segments may spur economic growth in a closed
economy. Fort et al. (2018) associate import competition in the United States to shifts of
manufacturing firms to the service sector, suggesting that strategies to escape competition
may accelerate structural change.32 Differentiation may also factor in a multinational’s
decision to serve a foreign market through exports or an affiliate, if the affiliate is better
positioned to offer non-tradable services and greater customization.
