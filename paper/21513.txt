Does Health Plan Generosity Enhance Hospital Market Power?

                                              ABSTRACT

We test whether the generosity of employer-sponsored health insurance facilitates the exercise of market
power by hospitals. We construct indices of health plan generosity and the price and volume of hospital
services using data from Truven MarketScan for 601 counties from 2001-2007. We use variation in
the industry and union status of covered workers within a county over time to identify the causal effects
of generosity. Although OLS estimates fail to reject the hypothesis that generosity facilitates the exercise
of hospital market power, IV estimates show a statistically significant and economically important
positive effect of plan generosity on hospital prices in uncompetitive markets, but not in competitive
markets. Our results suggest that most of the aggregate effect of hospital market structure on prices
found in previous work may be coming from areas with generous plans.

Introduction

       Since Feldstein's (1970, 1973) early work, economists have been interested in

whether the generosity of health insurance coverage facilitates the exercise of market

power by sellers of health services. Even a perfectly competitive insurance market makes

demand for insured services more inelastic by protecting consumers against financial

risk. More inelastic demand for services, in turn, makes it profitable for providers to

charge higher prices. The problem is that each individual consumer creates a negative

externality for the others when deciding how generous of a health plan to buy because he

does not account for the market-wide consequences of his actions on prices.

       Assessing the importance of this phenomenon is essential to current health policy

debates. Market power is endemic in the health sector. Health services are highly

complex, differentiated products that are not priced transparently. Because many

providers are non-profit organizations, courts have been reluctant to attack their

anticompetitive practices on the grounds that they would use their pricing power to

subsidize charitable activities (Havighurst and Richman 2011). The Affordable Care Act

has given hospitals and physicians powerful incentives to integrate into Accountable Care

Organizations, which has the potential to further enhance their bargaining power with

private purchasers (Rosch 2011; Bacher et al. 2013). Taken together, these factors have

given some providers, especially large hospital systems, growing power to obtain steep

payment increases (Ginsburg 2010; Berenson et al. 2012). This has wide-ranging effects

beyond allocative inefficiency, including redistribution from patients to providers,

reduced insurance coverage rates, and public-sector deficits.




                                                                                          1
       Yet, despite this, few studies have investigated whether the generosity of

insurance leads to higher prices in imperfectly competitive markets for insured services.

Although some work has estimated the effect of the design of public-program and

prescription drug insurance on drug prices, the results from these papers do not

necessarily apply beyond the particular settings that they examine. In addition, none of

these papers investigate the extent to which coverage generosity interacts with market

power in markets for hospital services, even though lack of hospital competition poses a

serious public policy problem (Berenson, Ginsburg, and Kemper 2010).

       One reason for the lack of work on this topic may be the difficulty in identifying a

causal effect. Although more health insurance may enable providers to raise prices,

higher prices may also affect the scope of insurance. The direction of the reverse

causality is theoretically indeterminate. On one hand, high prices might increase the

demand for insurance; high prices mean that there is more financial risk associated with a

given episode of illness. On the other hand, high prices might reduce the demand for

insurance; high prices increase the cost of moral hazard. Because low deductibles and

coinsurance rates increase demand for health services that have relatively low value

(Newhouse and the Insurance Experiment Group 1993), the deadweight loss from more

generous insurance increases as prices rise.

       We use an insight from Freeman (1981), updated by Buchmueller, DiNardo, and

Valetta (2002), to solve this endogeneity problem. Numerous studies have shown that

industry and union membership affects the generosity of fringe benefits, including health

insurance. We use unique information on the union status and industry composition of

insured workers in 601 large US counties to identify the effect of health plan generosity




                                                                                            2
on hospital prices and utilization. We measure generosity by the average actuarial value

of coverage for a sample of large self-insured employers. We estimate the effect of

county-average actuarial value on the price and quantity of hospital services by

instrumental variables, holding constant county- and time-fixed effects and time-varying

county characteristics, using county-level unionization and industry structure as

instruments.



I.     Previous Literature

       In an early empirical paper, Feldstein (1970) estimated the relationship between

insurance coverage rates and physician prices based on national aggregate data from

1948-1966. He finds that physician prices rise, holding constant other factors, when the

fraction of households with private insurance coverage rises. He later went on to

demonstrate that reductions in insurance coverage might actually be welfare-improving

because the utility loss from decreased risk protection might be more than

counterbalanced by gains from lower prices and the reduced purchase of excess care

(Feldstein 1973). Chiu (1997) and Vaithianathan (2006) extend this work to show more

generally the conditions under Feldstein's result obtains.

       A more recent wave of empirical work examines how reimbursement for

prescription drug spending affects drug prices. Pavcnik (2002) evaluates a policy

experiment from Germany, in which the country's statutory health insurance scheme

implemented reference pricing, and finds that making consumers responsible for the full

cost of drugs above the reference price rather than just a flat fee led to price reductions of

10 to 26 percent. Duggan and Scott-Morton (2006, 2010, 2011) estimate the effect of




                                                                                             3
Medicaid and Medicare Part D market shares on drug prices, and show that prices are

significantly positively related to Medicaid's market share, but negatively related to

Medicare' Part D's market share. As they point out, the effect of Medicaid market share

is consistent with Feldstein's (1970) classical result.

       Although these studies have provided many important insights, they focus on how

particular changes to benefit design affects drug prices. As the differences between the

findings of the Duggan and Scott-Morton papers show, each paper's result depends at

least in part on the specific features of the insurance programs that they analyze. As

such, they do not directly identify the more general effect of plan generosity on health

spending: as private health plans become more generous, does the market respond as it

did to an expansion of Medicaid, or to the rollout of Medicare Part D? In addition, none

of the studies examine how generosity interacts with the competitiveness of markets for

hospital services, which are characterized by a very different price determination process

and represent a far larger share of overall health spending than drugs.

       Our paper is most closely related to new work by Robinson and Brown (2013)

and Gowrisankaran, Nevo, and Town (2013). Robinson and Brown (2013) evaluate the

impact of reference pricing on the use of and prices paid for knee and hip replacement

surgery. They compare enrollees in the California Public Employees Retirement System

(CalPERS) to enrollees in another plan that did not use reference pricing, after versus

before the change in CalPERS benefit design. They found that CalPERS members

shifted from high- to low-priced facilities, and that the prices paid by CalPERS members

at high-price facilities declined significantly, relative to enrollees in the comparison

group. Gowrisankaran, Nevo, and Town (2013) specify and estimate a model of the




                                                                                           4
bargaining process between hospitals and managed care organizations (MCOs). Based

on data from four large MCOs in Northern Virginia from 2003-06, they find that MCOs'

bargaining leverage partially (but not completely) offsets the price insensitivity induced

by insurance. These papers suggest that consumer cost-sharing is likely to affect prices

in a broader setting, the question to which we now turn.



II.    Data and Variable Construction

       We use data from Truven MarketScan from approximately 2.1 million hospital

claims from privately-insured individuals enrolled in a fee-for-service self-insured

employer-sponsored health plan between 2001 and 2007. These claims include only the

facility portion of the payment; professional claims (i.e., from physicians) are excluded

from our analysis. Though (as we discuss below) these data are not representative of the

entire U.S. population, the areas they span are sufficient to characterize patterns of

hospital price variation.

       For each claim, we analyze what is commonly referred to as the allowed

amount—the amount that the plan allows the hospital to be paid for the service, after the

application of contractual discount provisions and other plan rules, but before adjustment

for patient copayments or deductibles. The hospital may receive part of this amount from

the insurance plan and part of it from the patient in the form of copayments or

deductibles. The allowed amounts are not charges or a function of charges. Instead, they

are the actual transaction payments under contracts with health plans, including payments

made by both the patient and the insurer.




                                                                                             5
          We use the allowed amounts to calculate indices for county i during year t of the

price per hospital admission (Pit), the number of hospital admissions per enrollee (Qit),

the coefficient of variation of hospital prices (CVit), and the actuarial value of inpatient

coverage (AVit), where AVit is the share of inpatient spending paid by plans (rather than

enrollees or other sources) on behalf of enrollees who live in county i during year t. AVit

therefore captures the average generosity of health plans among enrollees in a

county/year, weighted by enrollees' spending. We normalize Pit, Qit, and CVit by the

national average value of each variable in each year so that each has mean 1 in every year

by construction; this enables us to interpret percentage-point changes in the value of each

variable as percent changes. Thus, if Nit is the number of hospital admissions in

MarketScan for county i during year t, Pit is defined as follows:

           1
Pit   
           Pt
                    allowed amount
                hospital
                                        lit   / N it ,   Pt           allowed amount
                                                                  hospital
                                                                                           lit   / Nt ,
                admissionsl                                       admissionsl ,
                                                                  countiesi



with Qit and CVit defined similarly.

          We use MarketScan information on enrollees to calculate county/year level

characteristics of the insured population, including its age and gender distribution (with

indicator variables for the proportion of the population aged 18-34, 35-44, 45-54, and 55-

64, omitted group age < 18), industry of employment (with indicator variables for

mining/manufacturing/transportation/services and retail trade(omitted group all other

industries), and proportion union.1



1
  Ideally, we would obtain data on proportion union from an external source that captured the unionization
rate in the county as a whole. However, the only annual source of union coverage data of which we are
aware is the Current Population Survey, and the public-use version of it does not contain county identifiers.
We used the MarketScan unionization data because we could not merge county-level restricted-use Current
Population Survey to our (county-level restricted-use) MarketScan data.


                                                                                                            6
         We follow the approach in Kessler and McClellan (2000) to measure the

county/year density of several hospital characteristics, including ownership status (for-

profit or nonprofit, omitted group public), size (<100 beds, >300 beds, omitted group

100-300 beds), system membership, teaching status, and bed capacity. We define the

density of each hospital characteristic H in county i at year t, ZitH, as

                        Z itH        c
                                    j serving
                                             ijt             b     kjt

                                                                                   a
                                                                                  j serving
                                                                                              jkt   AHA Hjt ,
                                    county i                  to j                zipcode k



where j and k index hospitals and zip codes, respectively; ajkt is the share of elderly

Medicare patients who live in zip k admitted to hospital j; bkjt is the share of patients

admitted to hospital j who live in zip k; cijt is the share of patients who live in county i

admitted to hospital j ; and AHAjtH is an indicator variable that is equal to 1 if the hospital

has characteristic H according to the American Hospital Association (AHA) survey.2

The bkjt-weighting in ZitH assumes that the characteristics of hospital j's market depends

on the weighted average of all of the zip-code patient residence areas that it serves; the

cijt-weighting defines a county's characteristics as the weighted average of all of the

hospitals that serve patients who live in county i. To measure the extent of hospital

market power, we construct a Hirschman-Herfindahl index (HHI) of hospital services

analogous to ZitH, where

                            HHIit            c
                                            j serving
                                                     ijt            b     kjt
                                                                  k admitting
                                                                                         a
                                                                                        j serving
                                                                                                      2
                                                                                                      jkt   .3
                                            county i                 to j               zipcode k



         Finally, to obtain information on other time-varying characteristics of counties,

we use the Area Resource File (ARF, for population, the number of Medicare

Medicare enrollment files.

  In what follows, we treat market structure (ZitH and HHIit) as exogenous.


                                                                                                                 7
beneficiaries, the number of physicians, and median household income) and the Medicare

hospital wage index (to measure hospitals' labor costs).



III.    Models

        Our basic model specifies Pit, Qit, and CVit as a function of county- and year-

fixed-effects; whether the average health plan's actuarial value is above the median or

75th percentile level, HIAVit; whether the hospital market is uncompetitive (above the

median HHI, HIHHIit); hospital market characteristics Zit ; and other time-varying county

characteristics Xit:

                Pit
                Qit      i  t  HIAVit  HIHHIit  Z it  X it   it .            (1)
               CVit

        We also estimate a model with an interaction between HIAVit and HIHHIit to test

whether the effect of plan generosity varies in different market environments:

 Pit
 Qit     i  t  HIAVit  HIHHIit   ( HIAVit * HIHHIit )  Z it  X it   it .   (2)
CVit

        We begin by estimating (1) and (2) by ordinary least squares. However, as

discussed above, although HIAVit might affect Pit, Pit might also affect HIAVit. For this

reason, we estimate (1) and (2) by instrumental variables (IV). We identify the

interaction effect in (2) using the method in Wooldridge (2010, Section 21.4): we regress

HIAVit on the (excluded) unionization rate and industry dummies and all the other

exogenous variables; construct the fitted value of HIAVit, HIAVHATit; and then estimate

(2) using HIAVHATit and HIAVHATit*HIHHIit as instruments.




                                                                                             8
        As we discuss below, the consistency of our IV estimates depends on the

assumption that the unionization rate and industry structure only affect prices through

plan generosity. Because the most likely channel through which these variables affect

hospital prices directly is labor costs, we control explicitly for this factor in Xit with the

Medicare hospital wage index. The Medicare wage index is based on hospitals' Medicare

cost reports, Occupational Mix surveys, payroll records, contracts, and other wage-related

documentation. In computing the wage index, CMS derives an occupation-weighted

average hourly wage for each county in each year (total wage costs divided by total hours

for all hospitals in the area) and a national average hourly wage in each year (total wage

costs divided by total hours for all hospitals in the nation). A county's Medicare wage

index value is the ratio of the area's average hourly wage to the national average hourly

wage.



IV.     Results

        Table I presents descriptive statistics on the variables used in our analysis.4 The

left panel of the table presents means and standard deviations for the control variables

that we derived from Medicare, the AHA survey, and the ARF. The first column presents

means and standard deviations for the control variables for all US counties that had the

controls present in every year 2001-07. As the table shows, we had control variables

present for 2,454 of the approximately 3,100 US counties with residential population,

covering around 94 percent of the US population (= 279.7 million / 296.4 million total

population in 2005 [not in any table]). The second column presents means and standard


4
 We also present the average price per admission, number of admissions per enrollee, and coefficient of
variation of prices for background although we do not use any of these variables directly.


                                                                                                          9
deviations for the subset of counties that had at least 100 MarketScan enrollees and a

price index between 0.5 and 2 in every year 2001-07. Although we only have valid

MarketScan data for around a quarter of the counties with control variables (601 / 2,454),

these counties cover around 60 percent of the US population. Comparing the first and the

second columns shows that analysis counties are representative of the country as a whole

in most (although not all) dimensions. Analysis counties are larger on average (300,000

population as compared to 114,000), and more likely to be in midwestern and southern

states, but with mostly similar health care market characteristics. Although analysis

counties have a higher density of for-profit hospitals and have slightly fewer beds

(reflecting their regional distribution), they are similar in terms of the number of

Medicare beneficiaries, physicians per capita, wage index, and market competitiveness

(HHI for the analysis counties is 0.455 [standard deviation 0.122], compared to 0.481

[standard deviation 0.151] for the US as a whole [not in any table]).

       The right panel of the table presents means and standard deviations for variables

derived from MarketScan. The indices of price, quantity, and price variation are all 1 by

construction. The remainder of the right panel shows how the MarketScan sample

resembles and differs from the US workforce as a whole. Our computed actuarial value

is virtually identical to that computed by the Actuarial Research Corporation for self-

insured employers based on the 2005 National Compensation Survey (0.867 versus

0.886; Yi and Mays 2009). The unionization rate is slightly higher than the 2005

coverage rate in the CPS for private nonagricultural employees (0.104 versus 0.085;

Hirsch and Macpherson 2005), reflecting the relatively greater unionization of (large)

self-insured employers. The industry distribution does not reflect the US workforce; it is




                                                                                          10
much more highly concentrated in manufacturing, reflecting the composition of firms that

report to MarketScan.

       Tables II and III show the source of identification of our IV models: differences

in trends in unionization and industry of employment across counties. Table II presents

trends in health plan generosity, hospital market, and demographic characteristics in

counties that have declining versus rising or stable unionization and manufacturing

employment from 2001-07. The generosity of health plans in our sample was rising over

this period, reflecting national trends that have been documented elsewhere (e.g., Gabel

et al. 2006). The first column shows that the proportion of MarketScan enrollees in the

235 counties with declining unionization (accounting for around two-thirds of

MarketScan enrollees in 2007) who had generous health plans rose by 17.2 percentage

points. By comparison, the proportion of enrollees in the 366 counties with rising or

stable unionization who had generous plans rose by 40.8 percentage points. Similarly,

the proportion of enrollees in the 354 counties with declining manufacturing employment

(accounting for around 84 percent of MarketScan enrollees) who had generous plans rose

by 23.9 percentage points, but the proportion in the 247 counties with rising or stable

manufacturing employment rose by 48.5 percentage points.

       Trends in hospital market and demographic characteristics are much more similar

across type of counties than trends in health plan generosity. For example, in counties

with declining unionization, hospital market concentration (as measured by the HHI)

declined by 0.062; in counties with rising or stable unionization, market concentration

declined by 0.045. Although counties with declining unionization were significantly




                                                                                          11
larger, trends in population growth in these places were within one percent of the trend in

places with rising or stable unionization.

          Table III presents the coefficients on the excluded instruments from the first-stage

regressions of plan generosity. Counties with rising rates of unionization show

differential growth in the proportion of enrollees with generous plans, as do counties with

rising rates of employment in manufacturing and services, and falling rates of

employment in retail trade. Although the F-statistic on the excluded instruments in the

75th percentile model is above the rule-of-thumb threshold of 10 suggested by Staiger and

Stock (1997), we investigate the possibility of bias due to the weakness of our

instruments in greater detail below.

          Table IV presents estimates from models (1) and (2) of the effect of health plan

actuarial value and hospital market competitiveness on hospital prices. The left panel of

the table presents OLS estimates; the right panel presents IV estimates. The first two

columns of each panel present estimates that define a county/year as high-actuarial-value

if the enrollment-weighted value is above the median (= 0.894); the second columns

define a county/year as high-actuarial-value if the value is above the 75th percentile (=

0.918).

          According to the OLS estimates, more generous health plans lead to lower

hospital prices, holding constant county- and year-fixed effects and other time-varying

characteristics of health care markets; there is no significant interaction between actuarial

value and hospital market competitiveness. The IV estimates, in contrast, show no

significant average effect of actuarial value on prices but significantly higher prices in

uncompetitive markets. Counties with high plan generosity and uncompetitive hospital




                                                                                             12
markets have approximately 8.6 percent higher prices than counties with low generosity

and competitive markets (model (2c)). The total effect of hospital market

competitiveness on prices in counties with generous plans -- the sum of the direct effect

of hospital HHI and the interaction between actuarial value and HHI -- is 6.2 percent

(standard error 2.6 percent). By comparison, the effect of hospital market

competitiveness on prices in counties with low plan generosity is small and statistically

insignificant. The magnitudes of the interaction and total effects grow as the cutoff for

high generosity is raised from the median to the 75th percentile. Counties with above-

75th-percentile plan generosity and uncompetitive hospital markets have approximately

10.6 percent higher prices than counties with below-75th-percentile generosity and

competitive markets, with a total effect of hospital market competitiveness conditional on

high plan generosity of 9.7 percent (standard error 4.2 percent, model (2d)).

       Table V presents estimates from models (1) and (2) of the effect of health plan

actuarial value and hospital market competitiveness on hospital admissions per enrollee.

The interaction between actuarial value and market competitiveness is small and

generally statistically insignificant in both OLS and IV models. In contrast, the average

effect of plan generosity is large and statistically significant, especially in the IV models.

Using the median as the cutoff for high plan generosity, counties with high generosity

have approximately 18.9 percent more hospital admissions than counties with low

generosity (standard error 6.5 percent, model (1c)); when the cutoff for high generosity is

raised to the 75th percentile, the effect remains approximately the same.

       Table VI presents estimates from models (1) and (2) of the effect of health plan

actuarial value and hospital market competitiveness on the coefficient of variation of




                                                                                            13
hospital prices. The OLS estimates suggest that, on average, more generous health plans

lead to more variation in hospital prices; the confidence intervals around the IV estimates

of the average effect are so large that they include both the OLS estimates and the null

hypothesis. However, counties with above-75th-percentile plan generosity and

uncompetitive hospital markets have approximately 18.8 percent more price variation

than counties with below-75th-percentile generosity and competitive markets (standard

error 8.2 percent, model (2d)).

         We estimate additional models to investigate the validity of our results. First, we

reestimate model (2) with limited-information maximum likelihood (LIML) to explore

the extent of bias due to the weakness of our instruments, because LIML is less subject to

bias than two-stage least squares (2SLS) in the presence of overidentifying restrictions

(Angrist and Pischke 2009). We find that LIML and 2SLS estimates are virtually

identical, and that formal tests of instrument strength reject the null hypothesis of weak

instruments.5 We also calculate Hansen’s J statistic to test the validity of the LIML

model’s overidentifying restrictions, which fails to reject the null hypothesis that the

instruments are invalid.6 Second, we reestimate model (2) using the 75th percentile HHI

as the threshold above which a hospital market is anticompetitive. We find that the

estimates in this model are very similar to those reported in Table IV.7




5
  For example, the LIML estimate of π corresponding to Table IV, model (2c) is 0.087 (standard error
0.034). In this model, the Kleibergen-Paap (2006) rk Wald statistic is 4.74, which just exceeds the Stock-
Yogo (2005) 5% critical value of 4.72 for bias equal to 10% of the estimator’s size.

  χ(2)2 = 3.89, p = 0.143.

  For example, the estimate of π corresponding to Table IV, model (2c) is 0.090 (standard error 0.047), with
an estimate of π + λ of 0.061 (standard error 0.030).

V.     Conclusion

       To what extent does the generosity of health insurance coverage facilitate the

exercise of market power by producers of health services? Although it has been more

than 40 years since Feldstein first provided suggestive macroeconomic evidence that it

does, and identifying the importance of this effect has become crucial to health policy,

only a handful of papers have sought to investigate this hypothesis. To date, the literature

has mostly focused on the effects of public insurance program and prescription drug

benefit design. This work has contributed much to our understanding of the problem, but

the more general question remains unanswered.

       This paper seeks to fill this gap. It analyzes data from Truven MarketScan from

approximately 2.1 million hospital claims from privately-insured individuals enrolled in a

fee-for-service self-insured employer-sponsored health plan between 2001 and 2007. It

uses data on actual transaction payments to hospitals, including payments made both by

the patient and by the insurer. It constructs three sets of key variables at the county-year

level: the average price of a hospital admission; the generosity of private health

insurance (equal to plans' average actuarial value); and measures of the characteristics of

hospital markets, including market competitiveness. It uses an insight from labor

economics to identify the causal effect of generosity, and the interaction of generosity

with hospital market competitiveness, on hospital prices: that the union status and

industry of workers is correlated with the generosity of their benefits. Under the

assumption that unionization and industry structure in a county is otherwise uncorrelated

with hospital prices, conditional on observable characteristics, this insight identifies the




                                                                                               15
effect of generosity, even though the process determining plan generosity might itself

depend on the level of prices for health services.

       We find a statistically significant and economically important effect of plan

generosity on hospital prices in uncompetitive markets. Defining a county as "high

generosity" when the weighted average actuarial value of plans in it is above the median,

counties with generous plans and uncompetitive hospital markets have approximately 8.6

percent higher prices than counties with low generosity and competitive markets, holding

constant county- and time-fixed effects and other time-varying characteristics of counties,

including their hospital market characteristics. Defining a county as high generosity

when the weighted average value of plans in it is above the 75th percentile leads the

estimated interaction between generosity and competitiveness to rise to 10.6 percent.

These findings suggest that most of the aggregate effect of hospital market structure on

prices found in previous work may be coming from areas with generous plans.

       We also find substantial effects of plan generosity on the hospital admissions rate.

Using the median as the cutoff for high plan generosity, counties with high generosity

have approximately 18.9 percent more hospital admissions than counties with low

generosity. We find no significant interaction between generosity and hospital market

competitiveness on the admissions rate.

       These findings are consistent with other work, like the RAND Health Insurance

Experiment, that seeks to estimate the price elasticity of demand for medical care. To see

this, convert the variation in actuarial values in our sample into percent changes in out-of-

pocket spending at the mean: the difference in actuarial value between plans in counties

above versus below the median is 11 percentage points (in counties with above-median




                                                                                           16
generosity, plans have actuarial value of 92.2 percent; in counties with below-median

generosity, plans have actuarial value of 81.2 percent [not in any table]). Because this

amounts to a 82.7 percent decrease in the patients' share of spending (= 0.11 / 0.133 =

0.11 / (1 - 0.867) [table I]), it implies an elasticity of demand for hospital admissions of

0.23 (= 0.189 [table V] / 0.827). This is of the same order of magnitude as, although

larger than, the arc elasticity of demand for hospital care of 0.17 reported in Manning et

al. (Table 5.1, 1988); the difference is not surprising, given that the use of actuarial value

to approximate the price of medical care generally leads to upward bias in the implied

elasticity (Newhouse et al. 1980).

       The key issue in our paper is whether the instruments are conditionally

exogenous. We show (Table II) that the generosity of employer-sponsored insurance is

increasing more slowly in counties with declining unionization and manufacturing

employment, but is there some other channel through which unionization and industry

affect hospital prices? To make the assumption underlying our models as plausible as

possible, we control for the best available measure of input prices to the hospital

production process: the Medicare wage index. The wage index is designed to measure

how geographic differences in the cost of labor -- including those due to geographic

differences in unionization and industry structure -- affect the cost of producing hospital

services, independent of hospitals' market power. We show that the wage index has a

large and significant impact on hospital prices, and the estimated elasticity of hospital

prices with respect to the index of around 0.4 is approximately equal to labor's share of

hospitals' accounting costs over our study period (American Hospital Association 2010).




                                                                                               17
       We take three other approaches to investigate the validity of our instruments. If

the estimated effect of generosity on prices is truly causal, it should be more pronounced

in less competitive markets -- which it is. In contrast, the estimated effect of generosity

on quantity should be independent of or declining in the extent of hospital market power.

Generosity leads to increased quantity through moral hazard, whether or not hospital

markets are competitive. If anything, when markets are uncompetitive (and prices are

high), generosity might lead to a smaller effect on quantity. We therefore estimate

models of both price and quantity that include both a direct effect of plan generosity and

an interaction between generosity and hospital market power. We find that generosity

has a large and significant average effect on the hospital admissions rate, but no

interaction effect. Taken together, these findings rule out the hypothesis that unionization

and industry structure are picking up some other unobserved time-varying characteristic

of counties -- such as a taste for intensive medical care by patients or physicians -- that

would affect prices and admissions rates in the same way.

       It is still possible that unionization and industry structure interact with hospital

market competitiveness to affect prices through some other channel -- such as rent-

sharing with hospital staff. To investigate this hypothesis, we reestimated model (2c)

including in Xit an interaction between the wage index and HIHHIit; this approach would

control for rent-sharing as long as it was proportional to the wage level. Adding the

interaction effect as an exogenous variable has virtually no effect on the estimated effect

of HIAVit*HIHHIit, which increases to 0.085 (standard error 0.035).

       It is also possible that our results are due to the interaction of some other

(unobserved) dimension of plan generosity, such as the breadth of provider networks,




                                                                                              18
with hospital market competitiveness; this would be the case if unionization-induced

increases in actuarial value were associated with increases in network breadth. Even if

this were the case, however, it would only affect the interpretation of our estimates as a

causal effect of cost sharing; it would not lead to false rejection of the null hypothesis that

generosity, defined broadly, interacts with market competitiveness to increase prices.

And as Gowrisankaran, Nevo, and Town (2013) observe, the bias could go the other way,

if cost sharing and nonprice efforts to exercise bargaining leverage are substitutes in

equilibrium.

       Finally, we investigate one potential mechanism through which plan generosity

and hospital market power might interact. If plan generosity increases prices by

dampening consumers' incentive to search, then it should affect the variation in prices as

well as the level. We therefore test whether plan generosity and hospital market

competitiveness interact to affect a county-level measure of price dispersion. We find

that it does. Although there is no statistically significant interaction between generosity

and hospital market competitiveness when the cutoff for a generous plan is the median,

there is a significant effect when the cutoff is for a generous plan is the 75th percentile.

Counties in the top quartile of generosity that have uncompetitive hospital markets have

approximately 21.7 percent more variation in prices, as defined by the ratio of the

standard deviation of prices to the mean, holding constant county- and time-fixed effects

and other time-varying characteristics of counties. This is evidence that, at least in

uncompetitive markets with generous plans, reduced search is one reason that hospitals

are more able to exercise market power.




                                                                                               19
       These results have important implications for policy. At current levels, increasing

the generosity of employer-sponsored insurance has three effects: a greater volume of

hospital care, and higher levels of and variation in hospital prices in uncompetitive

markets. Policies that seek to maintain or expand current levels of plan generosity

therefore need to balance its potential benefits against the consequences that we

document. Our results also suggest that there may be advantages to targeting antitrust

enforcement at hospital markets with particularly generous employer-sponsored

insurance, since it appears to be these places where hospitals are most able to exercise

market power.

       Nonetheless, our paper has some limitations. Because we do not observe

enrollees health outcomes or satisfaction, we can not reject the hypothesis that the higher

prices paid and extra hospital admissions attributable to plan generosity were "worth it."

We also can not rule out the possibility that rent sharing with unionized workers (or some

other unobserved process) is responsible for our results, to the extent that it would not be

picked up by the interaction between market competitiveness and the overall wage level.

Finally, we do not explore how generosity affects spending on physician or other

outpatient services. Further investigation of these questions is an important topic for

future research.
