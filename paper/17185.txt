                                              ABSTRACT

We show that a short-term (31 day) reading program, designed to provide age-appropriate reading
material, to train teachers in their use, and to support teachers’ initial efforts for about a month improves
students’ reading skills by 0.13 standard deviations. The effect is still present three months after the
program but diminishes to 0.06 standard deviations, probably due to a reduced emphasis on reading
after the program. We find that the program also encourages students to read more on their own at
home. We find no evidence that improved reading ability improves test scores on other subjects.

I. Introduction

Seven hundred and seventy-five million adults cannot read (UIS, 2011). The poor quality of

public schools in developing countries is a major factor. However, our limited understanding of

the education production function hinders attempts to ameliorate their conditions. We know

providing resources without other inputs rarely improves student performance. We know

resources can affect improvements when paired with a larger array of inputs (Glewwe and

Kremer, 2006). We do not know which inputs are necessary. For reading in particular, studies

have demonstrated the effectiveness of large comprehensive changes. Banerjee et al. (2007),

which studies an Indian remedial education program, is a good example. The intervention causes

students’ reading skills to improve, but because the intervention changes the educational

environment along multiple dimensions—additional teachers, new pedagogical methods, new

curriculum, changes to organization of the classroom, and additional resources—we cannot

identify which components cause the improvements.

        We approach this challenge by assessing the causal effects of a reading program that

changes children’s educational experience along a single dimension common to more

comprehensive reading programs: getting children to actively read age-appropriate books at

school. Schools rarely encourage children to read. Curricula do not emphasize it, and most

schools even lack age-appropriate reading material. Comprehensive reading programs encourage

children to read during the school day by providing age-appropriate reading material, segregating

time for reading, group reading, reading-based classroom games and other pedagogical changes

designed to get teachers to read books with students.2 To better understand the mechanisms


2
  As part of larger programs, this might be combined with professional development for teachers, the creation of
new infrastructure such as school libraries, student reading assessment techniques, changes in personnel (such as the
addition of a reading instruction coordinator or additional instructors), and often the use of new technologies that
provide more functionality than traditional books (eReaders, tablets, or even computer assisted instruction).

                                                       -1-
through which the larger programs operate, we assess a program that only provides teachers with

new materials and trains teachers to use them.

       Using a randomized controlled trial set in Tarlac province of the Philippines, we analyze

the causal impact of the Sa Aklat Sisikat (SAS) reading program for fourth graders. The program

provides age-appropriate reading material, trains teachers to incorporate reading into their

curriculum, and supports these changes through a 31-day reading marathon, during which SAS

supports teachers as they encourage students to read. We randomly assigned, by school, 5,510

fourth-grade students in 100 schools to receive the intervention following a baseline assessment

of students’ reading skills at the start of the academic year. We then administered two follow-up

surveys: after all of the marathons were complete (four months after baseline) and at the end of

the academic year (seven months after baseline).

       Simply enabling and encouraging students to read age-appropriate books in school

quickly creates meaningful improvements in reading skills. On average, reading scores increased

by 0.13 standard deviations by the end of the marathons. However, while the effects did persist,

scores declined by 54 percent over the next three months. This suggests that providing resources

and training alone is a viable short-term strategy for meaningfully improving children’s reading

skills, but by themselves they are insufficient to sustain those improvements.

       The fade-out may have been due to teachers deemphasizing reading. During the

marathons, the implementing NGO ensured that teachers provided time for reading, but while the

teachers retained all of the materials after the program ended, they also regained control over the

amount of time dedicated to the subject. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find the program

increased the number of books children read in school in the last month by 7.17 during the

marathon period, but by 56 percent less at the second follow-up. In fact, if we use the number of



                                                 -2-
books read in the last month as a proxy for teachers’ emphasis on in-school reading, the local

average treatment effect (LATE) estimates of the change in standard deviations per book read is

the same in both periods. This suggests that time spent on reading in school was equally effective

in both periods, but test scores declined because the time declined after the first survey. To

sustain long-term gains, interventions like the read-a-thon may need to be paired with other

components designed to support a long-term focus on reading, such as administrative and

professional development interventions.

           Finally, researchers often prioritized reading, hoping that better reading skills will equip

children to learn other subjects and encourage them to read outside of school. We assess the first

hypothesis by testing children in math and social studies, but we find no effect for either subject.

However, we do find that in-school reading encourages children to read outside of school. For

example, treatment children read 1.24 and 0.89 more books in the last month at the first and

second follow-up surveys.

           The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides an overview of

the intervention. We describe the research design in Section III. Section IV documents the

internal validity of the study, and in Section V, we estimate the effects of the treatment. We

compare the results to those of other studies of reading programs in Section VI. Finally, we

conclude in Section VII.



II. The Sa Aklat Sisikat Read-A-Thon

The reading program evaluated in this study is a core program of Sa Aklat Sisikat,3 a non-profit

organization located in Manila dedicated to building a nation of readers. Since its inception in

1999, SAS has implemented its reading program in every province in the Philippines, reaching
3
    Sa Aklat Sisikat loosely translates as “books make you cool.”

                                                          -3-
over 750 public schools and nearly 150,000 students. The program comprises three

components—providing schools with a set of age-appropriate books, training teachers to

incorporate reading in the curriculum, and through a 31 day “read-a-thon”, encouraging children

to read and supporting teachers as they incorporate reading into their classes. The program

targets fourth grade students because the school system expects students to have developed

sufficient reading fluency to enjoy independent reading by the fourth grade.4

         Because most public schools lack age-appropriate reading material,5 SAS donates 60

Filipino storybooks to each classroom. The books are selected for literary value as well as

student appeal. They also include in both of the country’s official languages, English and

Filipino, so that teachers can match the language of instruction.6

         Prior to receiving the materials, teachers from each school attend a two-day training

session in which they learn to implement the read-a-thon and receive ideas for reading lessons

that incorporate reading in an engaging way. For 31 days after the training, they implement the

read-a-thon. During this period, the students and teachers use the donated storybooks in hour-

long daily reading sessions that include activities such as dramatic storytelling, literary games,

and individual silent reading. Students are encouraged to read as many of the 60 storybooks as

possible, and each keeps track of the number of books read using an SAS supplied wall chart.




4
  Reading fluency is the degree to which beginning readers rely less on the phonemic decoding to recognize
individual words and instead recognize whole words. This change significantly increases reading speed and
comprehension. Meyer and Felton (1999), for example, define fluency as “the ability to read connected text rapidly,
smoothly, effortlessly, and automatically with little conscious attention to the mechanics of reading, such as
decoding.”
5
  For example, during our visits to local schools, we observed a few schools with libraries. However, most of the
books were donated from developed countries. The subjects and writing styles were not age appropriate. It was not a
surprise that teachers used them infrequently.
6
  The Philippines has two official languages, Filipino and English, and under an existing executive order, schools are
allowed to instruct students in either language. In our sample, students were instructed in Filipino. For this reason,
we conducted all evaluations in Filipino as well.

                                                        -4-
Students also write their thoughts about the stories in reading notebooks. Finally, SAS also

monitors schools to ensure program fidelity and to support teachers’ use of the new books.

        While the read-a-thon itself only lasts 31 days, the schools keep the 60 books. SAS leaves

them for the teachers to use at their discretion. Although, they expect the intense read-a-thon

experience will encourage teachers to continue using the books and students to continue reading.



III. Methodology

A. Research Design

The research sample consists of all fourth-grade classrooms at 100 elementary schools in Tarlac

province. Prior to the experiment, Sa Aklat Sisikat had never conducted its reading program

there.7 SAS and the province superintendent selected nine geographically proximate districts,

representing a range of academic performance levels. From the nine districts, 100 schools were

chosen for the experiment; this included all school from most of the districts.

        A baseline survey was conducted in all 100 schools in July 2009. Following the survey,

schools were assigned to the treatment and control groups using a matched-pair stratified

randomization. Schools were divided into pairs within each district using the school level

average baseline reading scores.8 Within each pair, one school was assigned to the treatment

group and the other to the control group with equal probability. The read-a-thon was then

implemented between the months of September and November.9 Two follow-up surveys were

conducted. The first was conducted immediately after the implementation of the read-a-thon in

7
  In addition, relatively few other reading interventions had been conducted in the province.
8
   We have also estimated the primary specifications including fixed effects for the original groupings for the
randomization. The results are consistent with those presented below. These results are available upon request.
9
   During the implementation of the read-a-thon, Tarlac experienced severe flooding that led to the cancellation of
several days of school in many of the school districts. In addition, all-school events such as science fairs, town
holidays, and standardized testing caused schools to take days off from the read-a-thon. However, all treatment
schools completed the 31 day read-a-thon prior to the first follow-up examination.

                                                       -5-
late November 2009 to measure the immediate effects of the intervention. The second was

conducted at the end of the academic year in late February 2010 to determine whether the effects

persisted after SAS ceased interacting with the treatment schools.



B. Data

Each survey round contained a reading skills assessment. These exams were based in part on a

national reading examination created and administered annually by the Philippine Department of

Education.10 The examination comprised sections covering six competencies. In the first part of

the test (referred to as the “Written Test”), students are asked to silently read a written passage

and answer written multiple-choice questions relating to the passage. Next, students were given

one-on-one oral reading tests covering letter recognition, sound recognition, and word

recognition. Finally, students were asked to read a passage aloud (referred to as the “Oral

Reading” Test) and then to answer several questions about the passage orally (“Oral Reading

Questions”). For each section, we normalized students’ scores relative to the control distribution.

Because the values for each section are not measured using the same units, we created a

composite reading score by averaging the normalized scores from each section and normalizing

the average, again relative to the distribution in the control group.

        A local survey firm proctored and graded all of the examinations independently of the

teachers to guarantee their validity. In addition, teachers were not informed in advance of the

content of the exam to prevent them from preparing students for the test. In order to ensure that a



10
   We chose to use sections of the national exam in order to ensure that both treatment and control groups were
assessed using an instrument with which both groups were equally familiar. We wanted to avoid, for example,
choosing an exam that might be geared towards the intervention being tested, which would have favored the
treatment students. The letter, sound, and word recognition sections were added to assess more basic competencies
than typically tested on the official exam.

                                                      -6-
large percentage of students were tested, the survey team returned to many schools multiple

times.

         Each survey also contained data unique to the individual round. In the baseline survey,

we collected children’s age, gender, height, weight, number of siblings, religion, and the dialect

spoken at home. In the follow-up surveys, we collected information on children’s reading habits

as well as tested students in other subjects to investigate possible spillovers from the

intervention. The reading survey asked students about the number of books they read in the last

week and the last month both in and out of school. We also asked students to name the title and

to describe the plot of the last book they read to assess the validity of their responses. For the

alternate subjects, we tested a different subject each round. In the first follow-up survey, we

tested children’s math skills, and in the second one, we tested children’s knowledge of social

studies, the most reading intensive alternate subject.



C. Statistical Models

We utilize three basic models. First, we employ a simple difference specification to directly

compare the treatment and control groups:

                                       Yis = α + β1Ts + εis                                   (1)

where Yis is the outcome of interest for child i in school s; and Ts is an indicator variable for

whether the school received the reading program. Hence, the estimate of the coefficient β1

indicates the differences between treatment and control schools. We utilize this model to

compare baseline differences in socio-demographic characteristics and test scores and to estimate

the effect of the reading program on follow-up test scores and reading habits.




                                                -7-
        Since the reading program was randomly assigned to schools and therefore independent

of baseline characteristics, inclusion of observable baseline characteristics and baseline test

scores as control variables in equation (1) improves the precision of the estimated treatment

effect. We also run the following specification:

                                 Yis = α + β1Ts + β2Xis + ωd + εis                               (2)

where Yis and Ts are defined as in equation (1), and where Xis is a vector of baseline student

characteristics including composite baseline reading test score, gender, age, religion dummies,

dialect dummies, and body mass index (BMI). Since the randomization was stratified within

district, we also include district fixed effects, ωd, in equation (2).

        Finally, we test the validity of the experiment by comparing the effect of the treatment on

the relative characteristics of the children who attrited from the sample between the baseline

survey and the two follow-up surveys. We run the following difference in differences model:

                           Yis = α + β1Ts + β2Attritis + β3Ts*Attritis + εis                     (3)

The variables Yis and Ts are defined as before, and Attritis is an indicator variable equal to one if

student i enrolled in school s was not present in the follow-up data. The estimate of β2 then

provides the average differences between attritors and non-attritors in the control group, and the

estimate of β3 captures the difference-in-differences between attritors and non-attritors in the

treatment and control groups.

        Because outcomes may have been correlated within school, failure to correct the standard

errors could result in an overestimate of the precision of the treatment effects (Bertrand, Duflo,

Mullainathan, 2004). We therefore cluster the standard errors at the school level (the level of

randomization) in all of the above models.




                                                  -8-
IV. Internal Validity

Randomly assigning schools to the intervention ensured that assignment was orthogonal to

student characteristics correlated with the outcomes of interest. If this holds, then any differences

in outcomes between the two groups post-intervention can be causally attributed to the

intervention. To check that student characteristics in each group were indeed similar, we run

regressions of student characteristics from the baseline survey on treatment assignment, and then

we verify that any changes in the sample due to attrition are also uncorrelated with treatment

assignment.

       We present the comparison of students at baseline in Table 1. Column 1 contains the

average characteristics for the control group. Columns 2 and 3 present the estimated differences

between the treatment and control groups. The results in column 2 do not include any controls,

while those in column 3 control for district fixed effects. Panels A and B contain standardized

reading test scores and demographic characteristics, respectively.

       The differences in average characteristics between the control and treatment groups are

all practically small and mostly statistically insignificant. In Panel A, none of the differences in

test scores are statistically significant. Figure 1 shows a plot of the distribution of the

standardized overall reading test score for the treatment group (solid line) and the control group

(dashed line). These distributions almost overlap completely, further corroborating the

comparability of the research groups. In Panel B, the only demographic variables with

statistically significant differences are those related to religion, but these differences are small in

magnitude. For instance, 74 percent of students in the control group were Catholics compared to

69 percent in the treatment group, yielding a minimal difference of 5 percentage points. The

randomization thus appears to have successfully created similar treatment and control groups.



                                                 -9-
       Although the baseline comparisons presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 show that the

treatment and control groups were similar at baseline, it is possible that non-random attrition

from the two groups between the baseline and follow-up surveys may have rendered the two

groups incomparable. Table 2 shows the attrition rates for both groups and the differences

between the two. There are no statistically significant differences between the attrition rates for

the control and treatment groups. For both groups, approximately 5 percent of the students who

were tested during the baseline survey were absent during the first follow-up survey, and 11

percent were absent during the second survey. Comparing the rates across research groups, the

rates were the same in the first follow-up and differ by only 2 percentage points in the second (10

percentage points in the treatment schools and 12 in the control).

       Columns 4 through 6 provide estimates of the attrition rates between follow-up surveys.

Overall, 86 percent of the students were present at both follow-up surveys (column 4), and the

difference in the rates between research groups is small. Similarly, 91 percent of students who

were present at the first follow-up were also present at the second, and of those present at the

second, 97 percent were present at the first.

       Even though the attrition rates were similar for both groups, the characteristics of the

attritors and non-attritors could have still differed. We check this in Table 3 for the first follow-

up survey. The results for the second follow-up survey are similar and presented in the Appendix

(Table A1). Panel A focuses on test scores while Panel B focuses on demographic

characteristics. Columns 1 and 2 contain the average characteristic for non-attritors in the control

and treatment groups, respectively, while column 3 contains the difference between these

averages estimated using equation (1). All of the differences are statistically insignificant with

the exception of the proportion of non-attritors who were Catholic. However, this difference is



                                                - 10 -
small in magnitude (5 percentage points) and is identical to the difference found for the entire

sample during the baseline survey.

       The last three columns of Table 3 show that the differences between the characteristics of

the non-attritors and attritors are similar across the two groups, indicating that there was no

selection in the sample due to attrition. Column 4 presents the difference in average

characteristic between the non-attritors and the attritors in the control group. Column 5 presents

the same statistic for the treatment group, and column 6 presents the difference between the two

statistics using equation (3). These differences are mostly statistically insignificant, and all of

them are small in magnitude. We therefore conclude that the comparability of the control and

treatment groups was sustained throughout the follow-up surveys.



V. Results

A. Effect on Reading Habits

The primary goal of the SAS reading program is to provide children the opportunity and means

to read in-school and to encourage them to do so. As a result, we start by assessing whether or

not students in schools assigned to the program did, in fact, read more in school. Table 4

compares reading rates across the two groups based on survey responses during the first and

second follow-up surveys. Variables include students’ responses to questions on whether or not

they had read a book and the number of books read in the last week and month. To check that

students who claim to have read a book actually did, we recorded whether children could name

and summarize the last book they read.

       The first three columns report results from the first follow-up survey, while the last three

columns report results from the second follow-up survey. For each survey, the first column


                                              - 11 -
provides the average responses for the control group. The second and third columns provide

estimates of the differences between groups without controls (equation (1)) and with controls

(equation (2)).

         During the period in which the read-a-thon was implemented, the program did

significantly increase the amount students read in school. The results in columns 1 and 3 show

that 68 percent of the students in the control group reported reading a book in school in the past

week on the first follow-up survey, and the program increased this by 19 percentage points. The

students in the control group reported reading an average of 1.9 books in school in the past week

and the program increased this by 2.3 books. In the past month, the program increased the

number of books read by 7.2 books.

         Further corroborating these results,11 we find significant differences in the propensity to

read if we only consider a child as having read a book if he or she can provide specific

information about the last book read. If we consider children to have read a book only if they

claim to have read a book and could provide the title, 53 percent of students in the control group

read a book in the last week and the increase due to the program was 30 percentage points. If the

condition is to describe the plot, the program caused 23 percentage points more children to have

read a book. All of these results are statistically significant at the 1 percent level and are basically

the same for the different specifications presented in columns 2 and 3.

         After the program, the effects on student reading seem to have continued, but at about

half of the previous rate. In terms of the probability that a student read a book (row one) or could

11
   One of the concerns with these self-reported numbers is that, knowing that they are generally expected to read,
students might have lied to surveyors about having read a book recently. The additional questions about the books
provide one check. Also interesting in this respect, is the stability of the estimates for the fraction of children having
reported reading a book (and being able to provide the title and description) across the various surveys. For the
control students, for example, the largest difference in rates is for the fraction of students reporting reading a book
and being able to describe the book in Panel A at 9 percentage points. The next largest difference is 6 percentage
points (being able to give the title and reporting having read a book in Panel A). The other five differences between
the surveys are all in the range of 2-3 percentage points.

identify the title (row four) or plot (row five), the effects of the program seem to be the same as

during the read-a-thon period. However, when the questions focus on the number of books rather

than just whether or not a child read any book, the magnitudes decline. The effect on the number

of books read in the last week is a statistically insignificant 0.86 and the effect on the number of

books read in the last month is 3.12, statistically significant at the 1 percent level. This suggests

that the program did have a long-term effect, but that the amount of time children spend reading

declined after the direct support of the program was removed.



B. Effect on Reading Ability

We now explore the extent to which the changes in reading affected students’ reading ability.

Table 5 presents estimates of the differences between the standardized average reading test

scores of the control and treatment groups. We present three estimates: an estimate of the

treatment effect without any controls (column one, equation (1)), an estimate including only

demographic characteristics (column two), and an estimate controlling for demographic

characteristics and district fixed effects (column three, equation (2)).

        Starting with the results from the first follow-up survey, the program had a distinct

immediate effect on students’ reading skills of 0.13 standard deviations. The results are

consistent across the various specifications, highlighting the comparability of the treatment and

control groups. And, in our preferred specification (column three), the results are statistically

significant at the 1 percent level. Consistent with the reduction in the amount of reading children

do at school, we find that the treatment effect declines between the first and second follow-up

surveys to 0.06. The estimate is still consistent across the specifications and statistically

significant at the 5 percent level, but it is 54 percent smaller.


                                                 - 13 -
         To further investigate this relationship, we use the number of books a child reports

reading in the last month in school as a proxy for the time teachers spend on reading. We then

estimate local average treatment effects of reading on students' reading test scores.12 If the

decline in test scores resulted from the reduction in the time teachers spent on reading, then the

coefficient on the LATE estimate should be similar for both surveys. This is, in fact, the case.

The estimates are 0.017 (p-value 0.017) and 0.020 standard deviations per book (p-value 0.056)

for the first and second surveys respectively.13 This suggests that the effect of the curriculum

change remained consistent across the two periods and that the decline in test scores was due to

the reduced focus on children reading after the read-a-thon period.

         We also investigate differences in the observed treatment effects for a number of subsets

of our sample defined through the baseline survey. In results not presented in this manuscript,14

we test for differences in treatment effects by gender, age, language spoken at home, and

baseline reading score. We find almost no evidence of systematically different treatment effects

for different types of students for either follow-up period. The one exception is that we find that,

for the first follow-up period, the treatment effect increases with students’ baseline test scores. In

a regression interacting treatment effect with baseline score, we find that students experienced a

0.12 standard deviation increase at the control baseline mean (statistically significant at the 1

percent level) and then experienced an increased effect of 0.09 standard deviations for each

additional standard deviation they scored at baseline (significant at the 10 percent level). While

both coefficients are still positive at the second follow-up, the magnitudes are much smaller.


12
   It is important to note that this cannot be interpreted as the causal effect of reading a book in school on test scores
because reading in the last month is almost certainly correlated with other activities, such as number of books read
in the previous month. However, these same correlations make it a good proxy for reading emphasis.
13
   We perform the same estimates using the number of books read in the last week and find similar results. However,
the estimates are less precise, possibly because the number of books read in the last week is a weaker proxy than the
number read in the last month.
14
   Results are available upon request.

                                                         - 14 -
They are 0.06 for the effect at the control mean and 0.04 for the interaction effect; only the first

remains statistically significant at conventional levels (5 percent level). It may be that stronger

students were able to utilize the supplied books independently of the teacher than weaker

students, and as a result, they benefited more than their classmates from the opportunity to read

in school. This is consistent with other studies that have observed that stronger students tend to

experience larger treatment effects from self-directed interventions (e.g. He, MacLeod, and

Linden, 2008).

       Finally, Table 6 disaggregates the effect on the reading test by competency. The first two

columns report the results from the first follow-up survey, while the last two columns report the

results from the second. The first column for each of the follow-up surveys provides the

differences between the average test scores of the control and treatment groups using equation

(1). The second column provides the estimates with the full set of controls using equation (2).

Finally, the last two rows of Table 6 report the chi-squared statistic and p-value from a test of the

joint significance of the coefficients on the treatment indicator from the regressions for the

individual components of the reading test, estimated using seemingly unrelated regressions.

       On both the first and second follow-up surveys, the program had a positive effect on most

of the components on the test (the written part was the one exception). In the first follow-up

survey, there are sizable treatment effects on sound recognition, word recognition, and the ability

to answer questions from the oral reading passage. The effects on word recognition and the oral

questions are individually statistically significant at the one and 10 percent levels respectively,

but the effect on sound recognition is not statistically significant at conventional levels. The joint

test of an effect on all skills shows that the results for the different components are jointly

statistically significant with a p-value of 0.013.



                                                - 15 -
        In the second follow-up, the results are generally the same, but with the overall average

diminished in magnitude. In this round, word recognition and oral reading effects are positive

and statistically significant. Word recognition remains the strongest effect of the program. But

again, all components show positive treatment effects except the written test and sound

recognition. Overall, the joint hypothesis of the significance of the effects on each component is

still statistically significant at the 1 percent level.



C. Other Outcomes

In addition to an effect on students’ reading abilities, encouraging children to read in school

could also have effects on other outcomes as well. First, due to their improved reading skills,

students may have been better equipped to study other subjects since it might allow them to read

textbooks or other classroom materials. Table 7, which has a similar format as Table 5, presents

the estimated treatment effects on the other subjects tested during the follow-up surveys. We find

no effect on either subject. However, in the second follow-up survey, the treatment effect for

social studies is of the same magnitude as the effect on the reading test. It is insignificant because

it is measured less precisely.15

        Second, although teachers reportedly never allowed children to take books home,16

reading more in school may also have made children more likely to read outside of school. To

assess this, we asked children the same kinds of questions about their reading activities at home

as at school. Table 8 presents the estimated results. Overall, we find a small, but statistically

significant effect on both surveys. For the first follow-up survey, only the effect of 1.24 on the

number of books read in the last month is individually significant, but jointly, all of the estimates

15
  This may be due to the fact that the social studies test was much less comprehensive than the reading test.
16
  Teachers fear that the children might lose them. For children to read at home, they must have accessed books
independently of the intervention.

                                                   - 16 -
are statistically significant at the 1 percent level. In the second follow-up survey, the standard

errors fall significantly, and although the point estimates are similar to those in the first round, all

but the effect on the probability of reading any book outside of schools (row one) are statistically

significant at conventional levels. This suggests that engaging students in reading in school

increased the number of books read outside of school as well. But like the effect on test scores,

the effect declined after the read-a-thon. 17



VI. Comparisons to Other Programs

At 0.13 standard deviations, the direct effect of the program during implementation is consistent

with the effects of many programs on native language skills.18,19 Machin and McNally (2008),

Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2011), Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2010), and Das et al.

(2010) find effects in this range, for example. This is, however, smaller than the effects observed

for others. Banerjee et al. (2007) find a total effect of 0.187 standard deviations for a remedial

education program immediately after two years of implementation, and He, Linden, and

MacLeod (2009) find a one year effect of 0.695 standard deviations for a pre-school reading

program after a year of implementation.

17
   Verifying that the effect of time spent reading in school is consistent for both periods, as they are for test scores, is
complicated by the imprecision of the estimated effect on reading outside of school on the first follow-up survey.
We find consistent results for the number of books read in the last month, but for the number read in the last week,
the 95 percent confidence interval around the first-year follow-up LATE estimate, (-0.192, 0.903), includes
estimates that are more than twice the magnitude of those estimated using the second follow-up survey.
18
   These comparisons require two important caveats. First, we restrict the set of programs to only those that
attempted to improve students’ native language skills because the effects of these programs are usually much lower
than effects observed for other subjects, such as math and foreign languages (see Banerjee et al. (2007), for
example). Second, we focus on the effect of the program observed directly following program implementation
because these are the effects most often reported. While fade-out after program implementation is an important
issue, few studies estimate such longer-term treatment effects, and those that do, typically find significant fade-out.
For example, Banerjee et al. (2007) find that, while the effects of the remedial education program on reading persist
for the weakest students, the 0.33 standard deviation overall treatment effect of a remedial education program after
two years of treatment declines to a statistically insignificant 0.040 standard deviations a year after students leave
the intervention.
19
   The effect is, of course, larger than those of programs that are found to have no overall average effect such as
Fryer (2011) and Kim and Guryan (2010).

                                                          - 17 -
         One can also take into account the costs of the program. However, it is important to keep

two caveats in mind. First, this program only affects reading skills while many of the other

programs are designed to affect multiple subjects. Second, few studies report treatment effects

for native language skills as well as information on program costs. With these caveats in mind,

the SAS reading program seems to fall in the mid-range of programs. The cost per tenth of a

standard deviation gain per child is 8.52 USD.20 This is higher than the interventions considered

by Banerjee et al (2007), Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2011), Muralidharan and

Sundararaman (2010), and Das et al. (2011), all of which cost between 1.53 USD and 3.11 USD

per tenth of a standard deviation per child for native language skills in India. It is, however,

much lower than Machin and McNally (2009) whose UK-based program costs $46.42 USD per

tenth of a standard deviation per child.21



VII. Conclusion

We demonstrate that a short-term reading program that provides age-appropriate reading

material and trains teachers to use it can have a significant effect on the reading ability of

primary school children. Reading test scores of students increased by 0.13 of a standard

deviation immediately following the intervention. These gains in reading ability were still

evident, albeit smaller at about 0.06 standard deviations, three months after the end of the

intervention. We also find that the additional focus on reading in school causes a small increase

in the number of books children read on their own at home, but we find no evidence that

improved reading skills translated into better performance in other subjects.

20
    All cost information has been adjusted to 2010 USD using the US Consumer Price Index for All Urban
Consumers including all available items.
21
   India, Philippines, and the UK are, of course, very different countries, making it difficult to rank programs based
solely on this measure of cost-effectiveness. However, since there are so few examples of successful reading
programs that report such cost information, we present those that we have found.

                                                       - 18 -
       These results suggest that providing additional resources along with training and support

in their use can improve students' test scores in the short-run, but in order to sustain these gains,

additional support is necessary. We show that while the focus on reading in the curriculum

diminished between the first and second surveys, the effectiveness of reading did not change.

The decline in test scores seems to have been solely due to a reduction in the emphasis on

reading in the curriculum after the direct support of the NGO was removed. This suggests that

teachers retained the ability to teach reading more effectively, but simply chose to do so less

often. To make the additional resources effective, researchers may need to identify additional

supports that can sustain teachers’ focus on reading. This might, for example, be a change in

teachers’ incentives (for example, having principals change the reward structure faced by

teachers to emphasize reading) or strategies for reminding teachers of the importance of

allocating time for reading (such as text messages or even long-term periodic monitoring).

Note: This table presents a comparison of students who took the baseline survey in the control and treatment
schools. Column 1 contains the average characteristics of the students in the control schools. Columns 2 and 3
contain estimates of the average difference in characteristics between the control and treatment students, without any
controls and with only district fixed effects. Panel A contains students' standardized baseline test scores, and Panel B
contains students' demographic characteristics. Standard errors are clustered by school. * indicates statistical
significance at the 10% level, ** at the 5% percent level, and *** at the 1% level.

Note: This table shows the fraction of baseline students who took the first and second follow-up surveys from the
control and treatment schools and an estimate of the difference between the two groups. Column 1 contains the
number of students who took the baseline survey. Column 2 shows the fraction of baseline students who took the
first follow-up survey, while column 3 shows the fraction of baseline students who took the second follow-up
survey. Column 4 contains the fraction of baseline students who took both the first and second follow-up surveys.
Column 5 contains the fraction of baseline students at the first follow-up survey who took the second follow-up
survey. Column 6 contains the fraction of baseline students at the second follow-up survey who took the first follow-
up survey. The estimated differences in the third row are estimated using equation (1). Standard errors are clustered
by school and shown in parentheses. * indicates statistical significance at the 10% level, ** at the 5% percent level,
and *** at the 1% level.

Note: This table displays the estimated effects of the treatment on students' math and social studies test scores. Column 1 reports an estimate of the difference
between the test scores of the control and treatment students. Column 2 reports an estimate of the average difference between the test scores of the control and
treatment students controlling for demographic characteristics, namely age, gender, body mass index (BMI) (and their interactions), number of siblings, religion,
language, and baseline reading score. Column 3 reports an estimate of the average difference between the test scores of the control and treatment students
controlling for the aforementioned demographic characteristics and district fixed effects. The sample includes all students completing the respective follow-up
tests, 5,228 for the first follow-up and 4,887 for the second. Standard errors are clustered by school and shown in parentheses. * indicates statistical significance

Note: This table presents a comparison of the attrition rates between the treatment and control groups for the second
follow-up survey. Column 1 contains the average characteristics of the baseline control students who took the
second follow-up survey, while Column 2 contains the average characteristics of the baseline treatment students
who took the second follow-up survey. Column 3 presents an estimate of the average differences in characteristics
between the baseline control and treatment students who took the second follow-up survey. Columns 4 and 5 present
the average differences in characteristics between the baseline students who took the second follow-up survey (non-
attritors) and those who did not (attritors) for the control and treatment groups, respectively. Column 6 contains
estimates of the differences between the average differences in Columns 4 and 5. Panel A contains students'
standardized follow-up one test scores and Panel B contains students' demographic characteristics. Standard errors
are clustered by school and shown in parentheses. * indicates statistical significance at the 10% level, ** at the 5%
percent level, and *** at the 1% level.
