                                          ABSTRACT

This paper evaluates the effects of the implementation of a structured early stimulation
curriculum combined with a nutritional intervention through public large-scale parenting support
services for vulnerable families in rural Colombia, known as FAMI, using a clustered randomized
controlled trial. We randomly assigned 87 towns in rural areas to treatment and control and 1,460
children younger than 1 year of age were assessed at baseline. The interventions were also
complemented with training, supervision and coaching of FAMI program facilitators. We
assessed program effects on children’s nutritional status, and on cognitive and socio-emotional
development; as well as on parental practices. The interventions had a positive and significant
effect on a cognitive development factor based on the Bayley-III of 0.15 standard deviations. We
also report a reduction of 5.8 percentage points in the fraction of children whose height-for-age is
below -1 standard deviation. We do not find any effects on socio-emotional development. We
report positive and statistically significant effects on the quality of the home environment (0.34
SD).

      1. Introduction

      Human capital underpins basic outcomes in the life of individuals, including career,
marriage and even intergenerational outcomes (Becker, 1964). However, the process of
human capital development is particularly problematic amongst deprived populations:
individuals from low income environments typically underachieve in education and in their
subsequent careers, are more prone to ill health, have shorter life spans, and are more often
involved in crime (Britto et al., 2017; Black et al., 2017). Moreover, poor individuals are more
vulnerable and more likely to be exposed to many negative shocks. Delays in the process of
human development may, in turn, lead to a vicious circle of poverty: the underachievement of
individuals from deprived backgrounds leads to an intergenerational persistence of poverty.
These issues are particularly salient in developing countries where many individuals might be
exposed to these problems and where limited human development is likely to be linked to
slow economic growth and therefore to the persistence of poverty.
      It is now widely understood that the process of human capital development starts very
early in the life cycle and that the first few years are crucially important because the brain is
particularly malleable at that time (Cunha, Heckman, Lochner & Masterov, 2006; Engle et al.,
2007; Heckman, 2006; Yoshikawa et al., 2013), and what happens in the early years has
important long run consequences (Almond and Currie, 2011). It is thus important to consider
policies that promote human capital development from very early on. Well-designed
interventions targeted at appropriate ages and populations may be crucial in promoting human
development and breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty. Such interventions may
have to address both nutritional needs and psychosocial stimulation. Understanding how to
design policies to improve the human capital of children is even more urgent in developing
countries where high levels of poverty are prevalent.
      Over the last couple of decades, the scientific evidence on the determinants of early
childhood development (ECD), the types of interventions that improve it and the populations
that most benefit from them, has advanced significantly (Britto et al., 2017; Black et al., 2017).
And yet, the evidence on scalable policies is limited and they are often found or perceived to
be ineffective, in part because they do not address effectively some of the central issues,
namely that developmental deficits accumulate very early, possibly as a result of
unstimulating environments. For example, the curriculum of the Indian Integrated Child
Development Service program addresses (nominally at least) stimulation needs only for
children three to five, while the component targeted to younger children focuses on free rice




                                               1
and occasionally iron supplementation. If we have learned anything from several efficacy
trials is that very early stimulation is key to human capital development.1
       The effectiveness of scalable interventions that can be deployed given the available
financial and human resources as well as the existing institutional structure and which,
therefore, can form the basis of a realistic policy structure is not well explored, and certainly
not in developing countries. And even in developed countries, such as the US or the UK,
where there is evidence on the effectiveness of early years intensive interventions in
generating long term impacts, such as the Perry Preschool Program (Belfield et al., 2006;
Heckman et al., 2010, 2013) and the Abecedarian program (Campbell et al., 2012, 2014;
Ramey et al., 1989), the evidence on programs at scale is still limited and inconclusive. Some
important large interventions, such as Head Start in the US and Sure Start in the UK, both
aimed at improving the process of human capital formation in the early years among poor
families, have been implemented and evaluated. The results on their impact have been,
however, mixed, although, in some cases, promising for deprived sub-populations (Bitler,
Hoynes and Domina, 2014; Kline and Walters, 2016; Carneiro and Ginja, 2014; Melhuish et
al., 2008). Similarly, while the evidence on the long run impacts from a small and intensive
early stimulation and nutritional trial in Jamaica is very strong (Walker et al., 2005, 2006 and
2011, Gertler et al., 2014), evidence on its scalable version is limited (Attanasio et al., 2014).
       In this paper, we address the question of whether it is possible to improve the
development of children in poor communities with a scalable intervention to provide
structured parent support and early stimulation as well as nutritional supplementation. Our
starting point are existing studies (cited above) that show how intensive ECD interventions
delivered through home visits can have large and long-lasting effects on human capital
development. Using this knowledge, we designed, implemented and tested by a cluster
randomized controlled trial a low-cost intervention, organized around an existing government
program, and aiming to improve the quality of early childhood stimulation and nutrition in a
scalable fashion. The fact that we used the infrastructure of a pre-existing government
program and worked closely with the agency running it implies that our program can, almost
by construction, be scaled up. Importantly it required only minimal extra human resources for
training and supervision. The main question we are asking is whether offering better quality
early stimulation and nutrition in poor environments through a scalable intervention can
improve child human capital and ultimately mitigate the effects of poverty.
       The Family, Women and Infancy Program (FAMI, for its acronym in Spanish), which
is the program we build on, was first established in 1991 in Colombia. It aims at improving

                                                       2
pre-and postnatal services for vulnerable pregnant women and their new-born children up to
age two. It is delivered through weekly group meetings and one monthly home visit. However,
the program’s operational guidelines are very vague and the actual content being delivered
heavily relies on the initiative and creativity of the local women running it, known as FAMI
mothers. In practice, the guidelines provide little structure or guidance to the FAMI mothers
on how to offer effective and high-quality parenting support and early stimulation. One of the
key research questions is precisely whether a structured curriculum provides the basis for
high-quality ECD services in this environment, where low-skilled providers have little
training and knowledge about ECD. In many ways this is possibly the most relevant question
of broad interest because simple unstructured programs without any emphasis on stimulation
can be found in many contexts. We answer the question as to whether it is important to
introduce the structure that we do and to provide parenting support over and above such simple
programs.
      We use a curriculum inspired by the Jamaica home vising intervention model, currently
known as Reach Up and Learn (Grantham-McGregor and Walker, 2015) but extensively
adapted for use within the existing FAMI program, which is mainly delivered in weekly group
sessions. Similar structured curricula have been successfully implemented in diverse settings
such as Jamaica, Bangladesh and Colombia, India and Peru (see Grantham-McGregor and
Smith (2016) for a review), using individual home visits.2
      The importance of our study lies in showing that early stimulation and nutrition
programs focusing on the youngest and poorest can form the basis of improved child
development outcomes at very low cost. Our results are directly relevant for understanding
the effectiveness of programs such as Head Start in the US and Sure Start in the UK but in a
developing country context. In addition, we contribute directly to the literature on human
capital formation through improvements in the quality of parenting programs.
      To implement our program, we trained the FAMI mothers that run the existing program
in the curriculum we developed. The fact that they are members of the community is another
important aspect of this research. The success and in particular the sustainability of programs
that aim at changing individual behavior, without necessarily providing beneficiaries with

  Attanasio et al. (2014) implemented a similar home visiting program in Colombia using the Reach Up and
Learn curriculum suitably adapted to the Colombian context. Whilst the intervention was implemented at a
larger scale than the original Jamaican study and used the infrastructure of an existing anti-poverty program for
delivery, both these trials were tightly controlled and supervised by the research team and, what is more
important, they were based on weekly one-hour one-to-one home sessions, which may limit their scalability.
Similarly, Yousafzai et al. (2014) evaluate the integration of an early stimulation intervention into a community-
based health service in 80 catchment areas in four districts in Pakistan. The authors use the Care for
Development (UNICEF) curriculum and rely on Reach Up and Learn materials and play activities. After
randomly allocating each one of the four districts in the study to treatment or control as a cluster, they report
positive effects on cognitive and socio-emotional development.

                                                        3
additional resources, is likely to depend on community ownership and participation. Lastly,
while the emphasis is on promoting early development through group sessions, the
intervention also has a nutritional component and it also includes a home visiting component,
as we describe in more detail below. The former can provide some important synergies to the
operation of the program and an incentive to participation. The latter complements, in a novel
way, group sessions with a more personalized intervention.
      The FAMI improving intervention was randomly allocated across 87 towns in three of
Colombia’s 32 departments and lasted for an average of 10.4 months. We focus both on
outcomes reflecting child development and on how parental investments in their children
change as a result of the intervention. The intervention shows remarkable promise: it had
positive and significant effects on overall child development as measured by the Bayley Scales
of Infant and Toddler Development (0.15 SD, p-value=0.048). Importantly, we also report a
reduction in the fraction of children whose height-for-age is below -1 SD (-0.058, p-
value=0.098) and a corresponding increase in those with height between -1SD and 1 SD
(0.068, p-value 0.046).3 We also find that the impacts are considerably larger for the poorest
beneficiaries. This evidence is consistent with the findings on other programs, such as those
on Head Start in the US, reported by Bitler et al. (2014). Furthermore, as the intervention we
study here aims to improve the quality of an existing program, the counterfactual is
participation in the standard government program (or nothing if the child drops out of the
program). Thus, similar to Kline and Walters (2016), who stress that the impact of Head Start
is estimated relative to other child-care alternatives, we measure the impact of improving an
existing program by changing its content and quality.
       In addition to the main impacts, we present some suggestive evidence of the mechanisms
through which the intervention achieves the impacts we estimate performing a mediation
analysis, focusing, on parental investment, among other mediators. How the intervention
changes parental behavior is important both for the long-run sustainability of the program and
for understanding the channels through which the intervention yields the estimated impacts.
We show that there was a large positive effect on the quality of the learning environment at
home (0.34 SD, p-value=0.000), which indicates that parents are reinforcing the intervention
with their own investments (crowding in). A simple mediation analysis seems to indicate that
a large fraction of the program’s impact is indeed explained by the change in parental behavior
and investment.
       Our paper has direct implications for the importance of safety net programs, such as
Food Stamps in the US (see Hoynes et al., 2016), for child outcomes. These programs can

improve nutrition for children by providing more resources to parents. We show that providing
such nutritional supplementation directly (and in combination with child stimulation) can be
an effective way of improving children’s nutritional status, implying that parents do not crowd
out these additional resources provided for the children, even when these are delivered for use
at home, as in our case. The absence of (complete) crowding out is a key element for
understanding whether such programs can work and the extent to which they do.
      The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the Colombian
context in terms of ECD policy and the intervention we assess. Section 3 discusses the
evaluation design and provides basic descriptive statistics. In Section 4, we present the
empirical strategy and the main evaluation results. Finally, Section 5 concludes and discusses
policy implications.

       2. Background and Intervention
      In this section, we describe the details of the pre-existing program on which our
intervention operated and of the intervention itself.

     2.1 Description of the existing parent support program
     The FAMI program, run by the Colombian Family Welfare Agency (ICBF for its
acronym in Spanish),4 is aimed at supporting families during pregnancy, childbirth and early
childhood with nutrition, health monitoring and childrearing. Beneficiaries are identified by
their score in SISBEN, Colombia’s proxy means test for the targeting of most social policies
and based on household socio-economic characteristics. For the child stimulation component,
which is our focus, the program is delivered through weekly group sessions of about two hours
each, and one monthly home visit that lasts about an hour for parents of children 0-24 months
of age. The program also delivers a nutritional supplement that corresponds to 22%-27% of
the (monthly) recommended nutritional intake. The size of each FAMI unit varies between 12
and 15 beneficiaries. Of these, approximately 75% are parents of children 0-24 months of age
and 25% are pregnant women.
       The program is delivered by women in the community with a high school degree but no
specific training on ECD, necessarily. More importantly, there is no national guideline for the
content (i.e. curriculum) to be delivered during the group sessions or home visits, other than
some general operational guidelines and broad learning standards.5 The average cost of the
FAMI program delivery is 310 US dollars (USD) per child per year (Bernal, 2013).

  The ICBF is a governmental agency that runs most government programs targeted to children in Colombia.

  This applies to all public ECD services in the country. The Board for Early Childhood has emphasized the
principle of curricular freedom, and national standards are intentionally broad. Program providers are expected
to adapt the learning standards to their own programs.

                                                      5
       2.2 Description of the intervention
       The enhancement to the existing FAMI program that we evaluate aims at improving its
quality in a scalable fashion. The main idea is to introduce a structured curriculum,
implementable at scale that offers precise guidelines to the facilitators who, at the beginning
of the intervention, receive specific training on its delivery. The program consists of four
complementary elements: (i) a structured early stimulation curriculum to improve child
development; (ii) accompanying pedagogical materials such as books, puzzles and toys; (iii)
itinerant training, supervision, and coaching for FAMI program facilitators; and (iv) a
nutritional supplement that is larger and of better quality than the one that had been typically
received by FAMI participants, along with nutrition education during group sessions and
home visits, and other materials such as recipe books and cards with age appropriate nutrition
messages.
        The proposed curriculum is based on Reach Up and Learn, although it required
extensive adjustment since the FAMI program is mostly delivered through group meetings
and Reach Up and Learn was designed for home visit delivery. For example, the adapted
curriculum includes several new components such as group discussions, additional language
activities, activities for children aged birth to 6 months, and cards with nutrition information.
It aims to support mothers to provide developmentally appropriate activities for their children
(in particular, activities that promote language, cognitive and motor development), as well as
reinforcing maternal knowledge about feeding and nutrition. The program also aims at training
mothers in sensitive and responsive parenting and appropriate behavior management. The
activities designed for the curriculum include 24 home visiting sessions and 20 group meeting
sessions for children 6 to 24 months of age, and four additional group sessions for babies
under 5 months. It is important to stress that the curriculum was designed to be delivered by
facilitators without specific or specialized knowledge of child development. For this reason,
it is purposefully quite prescriptive.
         Although most of the program content was delivered through the weekly group
sessions, the monthly home visits provided an opportunity to better tailor the activity to the
developmental level of the child, and to introduce other, more difficult activities to handle in
groups, additional language activities, and specific ideas on how to use daily home activities
(care routines and household chores) to promote child development. The curriculum involved
materials to be used during the sessions, including age-appropriate books, puzzles, home-
made toys, pictures, construction blocks and nutrition cards. The cost of these materials was
of about USD 27 (at the 2015-16 exchange rate) per child per year. The intervention also
included sessions to teach mothers how to elaborate home-made toys with recyclable materials

                                               6
that could be used to practice the activities proposed by the curriculum with children at home.
This way, most mothers were able to set up a toy library for home use.
        A team of nine tutors, with college degrees in psychology and social work, trained and
supervised by the research team, trained the FAMI mothers in the intervention before it
started. They also coached them continuously throughout its entire duration by means of on-
the-job observations and feedback sessions, which took place approximately every 6 weeks.
        Finally, the intervention also included a nutritional component, delivering a monthly
nutritional supplement to FAMI participants. The nutritional supplement provided 35% of
daily calorie intake requirements and 54% of daily protein intake requirements for pregnant
women, breastfeeding mothers and children younger than 2 years of age each month. Its
composition directly aimed at improving the height for age indicator, given the provision of
high protein content, as well as, fats, vitamins and minerals. The cost of the package and
delivery was USD 26 per month.6
        The hypothesis that we test is whether these enhancements to the FAMI program had
positive effects on children’s development and maternal knowledge, maternal self-efficacy,
and parental investments in children (or the quality of the home environment). Whether it did
or not depends both on the design and the delivery of the program but also on how parents
react to it. Specifically, the parents may crowd in resources and time if the program turns what
used to be inaccessible goals for their children into realistic targets. On the other hand, they
could redistribute resources amongst household members, leading to crowding out of
household effort and resources by the program. Our data design will only estimate the overall
effect. Appendix 1 provides greater detail on the curriculum, the intervention and its practical
implementation.

       3. Sampling design, descriptive statistics and implementation

      The study took place between September 2014 and July 2016. The intervention itself was
intended to operate for 15 months between the end of 2014 and March 2016. In practice, the
total duration varied by community mainly to accommodate the initial training, lasting 45
weeks on average with a range of 34-58 weeks.
      The study towns were located in three departments in central Colombia (Cundinamarca,
Boyacá, and Santander). They were all chosen to have (i) less than 40,000 inhabitants, to avoid
large urban centers; (ii) at least two FAMI units;7 and (iii) no more than one unit of another

6
  The nutritional component was designed in collaboration with Fundación Éxito (FE). FE’s main strategy,
known as Gen Cero, is aimed at reducing the prevalence of stunting (13%) and risk of stunting, i.e., height for
age between -2 and -1 SD (30%), among children younger than five.
7
  This requirement is associated with the power calculations for the trial, and to facilitate the logistics associated
with training and coaching by tutors who had to travel across various towns.

public parenting program called Modalidad Familiar (MF), launched nationally in 2014.8 Out
of a population of 135 such towns we randomly drew 49 for the treatment group and 47 for
the control. We further assigned the remaining 39 towns of our universe to a randomly ordered
waiting list. When we realized that some towns had made the complete transition to the new
MF program we dropped these towns and drew from this waiting list (whether in treatment or
control). We could successfully replace 10 of the 19 towns that no longer ran the FAMI
program. That yielded a final sample of 87 towns, with 46 in the treatment group and 41 in
the control group.9 Towns in the final sample had an average of four FAMI units (SD of 2.3,
range between 1 and 13), which translates in a total of 171 FAMI units that received treatment
and 169 FAMI units that remained as control. Appendix 3 includes the RCT flow chart
showing how the final study towns were selected.10
      The number of children per FAMI unit varied from one to 11, with a mean of 4.3 and SD
of 1.9. Within each unit, we enrolled in the study all children under 12 months of age at
baseline, leading to a sample of N=1,460 children (17 children per town on average). Overall,
a total of 702 children in 171 FAMI units in 46 towns received the treatment; and there were
758 children in 169 FAMI units in 41 towns in the control group, which continued to receive
the FAMI program as usual. At follow-up, we tried to reach all children in the study sample,
regardless of whether they were still attending a FAMI or not, and regardless of the length of
their exposure to FAMI.

       3.1 Data and child developmental measures
       Our experimental design defined a number of primary outcomes. These include
measures of nutritional status—namely, externally standardized height-for-age Z-scores
following World Health Organization (WHO) standards (WHO Multicentre Growth


8
  The MF is a public parenting program that was introduced during the first half of 2014. MF is similar to FAMI
in that it serves beneficiaries through one monthly home visit and one weekly group meeting but: (1) it serves
children 0-5 years of age while FAMI units serve children aged 0-2; (2) it has infrastructure for group meetings
while FAMI uses other community spaces or the FAMI’s own home; (3) serves, on average, 45 beneficiaries
as compared to 15 in FAMI; (4) is led by a professional and an assistant, as compared to a single person who is
not required to have a college degree in FAMI; (5) offers a nutritional supplement that is five times bigger than
in FAMI; and (6) has access to a group of professionals including a psychologist and a nutritionist who support
MF activities. The presence of MF is balanced between control and treatment samples, so that our RCT
estimates the effect of enhancing the FAMI in the presence of some MF. In our sample, only 7% of the children
left a FAMI to join the MF.

   Power calculations assumed program effects of 0.25 of a SD relative to the control on the Bayley, obtained
using 4 FAMI units per town and 4 children aged 0-12 months of age per FAMI. We assumed an intra-class
correlation within towns of 0.04 (in the Bayley-III scale and conditional on observables), as reported by
Attanasio et al. (2014) for a similar study in Colombia that was implemented in towns with similar
characteristics and targeted to the same population. This sample provided 95% power at the 5% significance
level, allowing for an attrition rate of 10%.

Reference Study Group, 2006, 2007); cognitive, language and motor development, measured
by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition (Bayley, 2006); and
socio-emotional development, as measured by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Socio-
Emotional (ASQ:SE) (Squires, Bricker, and Twombly, 2009a). Height and weight were
collected in both rounds, whereas developmental measures were only collected at follow up.
We chose developmental tests that have been used extensively in evaluations of early care or
education and/or have been recommended for developing countries (Fernald et al., 2017).
These instruments were either available in Spanish, or had been previously translated, as had
been used in Colombia before amongst similar populations. Further details on the measures
used are provided in Appendix 4.
        We always report age-standardized scores to deal with differences in scores across
ages. For the analysis, we use internally age-standardized scores, where raw scores were
standardized using the sample mean and SD calculated from weighted local
smoothing regressions. Using internally standardized scores also allows us to examine each
scale separately. In addition, we assume the existence of a unique cognitive factor that is
measured with noise by the Bayley III subscales. We recover that factor by factor analyzing
the internally age-standardized scores of the five scales. We call this the Bayley-III factor in
what follows. To describe the study population in a more general context, we report the
composite—or externally standardized—scores. These scores are obtained following the
norms provided in the test manual, which use as a reference a population of US children11 and
hence might not be appropriate for Colombia.
       We also collected detailed socio-economic information, including maternal
vocabulary scores—a proxy for maternal IQ—measured by the Spanish version of the
Peabody Picture Vocabulary (PPVT or TVIP, Padilla, Lugo & Dunn, 1986) and a number of
other variables that speak to the mechanisms underlying the effects.12 Specifically, we
consider the quality of the home environment, maternal self-efficacy, maternal knowledge on
child development, and food insecurity. We will discuss these in the empirical results section.
        Finally, background information on FAMI mothers was collected directly from them
in both rounds. In addition to basic socio-demographic characteristics, we also collected their
vocabulary scores and knowledge on child development using the same tests as for mothers.




11
  The externally standardized scores have mean 100 and SD 15 in the reference population.
12
  Child assessments and anthropometric measures were collected by testers with degrees in psychology and
health respectively, and the rest of the household survey variables were collected by interviewers. The
household survey was collected prior to the child assessments.

        3.2 Descriptive statistics
        Table 1 shows some baseline characteristics by treatment status. At baseline, children
were, on average, 5.6 months of age and in about 27% of the cases the father was absent from
their household. Households had two children, on average; maternal average schooling was
8.6 years; and 23% of mothers were teenagers. In 2010, the teenage pregnancy rate was 21%
nationwide and 30% for young girls living in households in the poorest income quintile.

         Average household income was COP 501 thousand per month (US 178) which
represents 81% of the legal monthly minimum wage in 2014. Close to 70% of these
households had answered the SISBEN survey for screening of social program eligibility—a
good proxy for poverty—and 96% of those surveyed were deemed eligible for social programs
(i.e., they scored in SISBEN levels 1 and 2). Similarly, 62% of households in the sample had
a total income below the poverty line adjusted for household size. In 2014, the poverty rate
was 42% in semi-urban and rural areas of Colombia.
         In terms of the home learning environment, on average, these households owned 2.6
books, magazines or newspapers, 1.4 different varieties of play materials for young children
in the household, and the adults report to have engaged in 2.5 different types of play activities
with young children over the past 3 days13. Finally, close to 45% of households in the sample
report to be food insecure. According to data available in the National Nutritional Status
Survey (ENSIN for its acronym in Spanish, 2010), 42% of Colombian households reported to
be food insecure by the same measure.
         Comparing baseline characteristics, we find some statistically significant differences
when we use standard single hypothesis p-values: the proportion of fathers living with the
child is larger in the control group (75% vs. 70%) and maternal verbal raw scores by PPVT
are higher in the treatment group (22.32 vs. 19.76 score points). On the other hand, stunting
is lower in the treatment group than in the control group at baseline (9% vs. 14%) and the
difference is statistically significant at 7.5%. However, once we adjust for multiple hypotheses
testing using the Romano and Wolf (2005, 2016) step-down procedure none of these
differences is significant.
         In Table 2, we show averages for the baseline nutritional status of children. In
particular, we report weight-for-age, height-for-age and height-for-weight z-scores. In
addition, we report a variety of nutritional indicators by deficit or excess by international
standards.
         Stunting is 12% in the sample. For comparison, stunting was about 7.6% in urban areas
in Colombia in 2013 (as measured in the Colombian Longitudinal Household Survey ELCA,
2013) and 14% in the lowest urban socio-economic groups (SES). Bernal et al. (2018)
assessed the effects of another ECD national program using a sample of comparable children
in urban areas of Colombia. In their sample, height for age is -1.03 SD compared with -0.11
SD in our sample, and stunting was 17% compared with 12% in our sample. The Table also
shows that an additional 15% of children are at risk of stunting, i.e., children whose height-
for-age is between -2 SD and -1 SD. These results indicate that children in this sample were

for regions and households with considerable levels of poverty.

 Adjusted p-values using the Romano-Wolf (2005, 2016) procedure (2,000 iterations, clustered by
 town) are included in the last column. All variables in the table are considered as one group of
 hypotheses. Underweight: weight-age < -2 SD; risk of underweight: weight-age between -1 and -2
 SD; wasting: weight for height < -2 SD; risk of wasting: weight for height between -1 and -2 SD;
 stunting: height-age < -2 SD; risk of stunting: height-age between -1 and -2 SD; overweight: weight-
 height between 2 and 3 SD; obesity: weight-height > 3 SD.


        In addition to nutritional status, we would want to characterize the status of this
population in terms of cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes. Unfortunately, these variables
were not measured at baseline, partly because the age of the children made some of these
measurements difficult to obtain and because of funding limitations. Therefore, in Table 3, we
report some statistics on cognitive, language and socio-emotional skills measured at follow
up, at ages 17 to 33 months, in the control group to characterize the population.
        As for the Bayley-III composite scores, we see that the average is 0.6 SD below the
norming sample mean in both the cognition and language scales, and 0.4 SD below in the
motor scale. We also observe that 18% of children score between -1 and -2 SD with respect
to the norming sample in cognition, 23% in the case of language and 15% for motor
development. Only about 2-3% would be considered at risk of developmental delay given that
their composite scores are below -2SD.
        For comparison, children between 18 and 36 months of age in Bogota (Colombia’s
capital) residing in households close to the mean of the income distribution, scored 0.08 SD
below the norming sample in cognition, 0.1 SD below in language and 0.06 SD above in motor

development (Rubio-Codina et al., 2015). These results indicate that the children in our
sample are significantly worse in these three dimensions when compared to children in better
socio-economic conditions. Instead, they are similar to children in samples of comparable
socio-economic conditions.

    Bayley III composites computed based on external standardization provided by test
    developers, the fraction of children at socio-emotional risk by ASQ is computed using the
    thresholds provided by the test developers (Squires et al., 2009b).


       In terms of socio-emotional development, 23% of the children are at risk of
developmental delay according to thresholds defined by the ASQ:SE using the test norming
sample. For comparison, we know from the ELCA (2013) that 22% of children in low SES
urban households were at risk of developmental delay by the same measure, 26% in high SES
urban households and 19% in rural households in 2013.
     Finally, in Appendix 5 we present basic characteristics of FAMI mothers by study group.
On average, they are 42 years of age, have completed 13 years of education, and they have
almost 12 years of work experience in the FAMI program. They have an average of 2.5
children of their own. There are no jointly significant differences between FAMI mothers in
treatment and control towns.

      3.3 Implementation and Compliance
      During the period considered in the study, a family could have attended a total of 44
weekly group sessions and received 11 monthly home visits (if age-eligible throughout the
period). In terms of effective attendance, 74% of all children in the treatment group assessed
at follow-up participated in at least one FAMI activity during the intervention, while the rest
did not attend at all; all children were however followed up for data collection, irrespective of

                                                 13
their attendance status.14 In Appendix 6 (Figures a. and b.), we show the distribution of
children in the intervention group by the duration of exposure to the pedagogical component
of the program. Conditional on having attended at least one session, the median number of
pedagogical activities attended was 28 out of a total of 55. Children with lower program
attendance are older, less likely to live with their fathers, and have younger mothers. On the
other hand, they also exhibit better learning environments at home.
      The curriculum we introduced was intended to add both structure and content to the child
sessions, progressing in difficulty as the child ages. In the control group, the FAMI mothers
were not constrained or directed in how they should run the sessions. The FAMI mothers in
the treatment group found the intervention to be substantially different to what was going on
in the status quo: 57% report to have found the curriculum very different from their usual
practice and 25% found it different. In particular, the issues that seem to be different with
respect to how they had typically worked were: (i) practicing play activities with mothers and
their children, (ii) practicing language activities with babies, (iii) making homemade toys with
mothers, (iv) encouraging parents to play with their children at home, and (v) listening to
parents about their achievements at home. Almost all of them (99%) reported that they would
continue to use the proposed curriculum after the end of the project.
      Regarding, the nutritional component of the intervention, close to 29% of children in the
treatment group did not receive any nutritional supplements and those who received at least
one, received on average, 9.8 (SD=3.6) supplements out of a maximum of 14. Compliance
with both components of the program largely overlapped the same subsamples of children. In
particular, 69% of children in the treatment group received at least one nutritional supplement
and attended at least one session, 19% did not receive any nutritional supplements nor attended
any sessions, 8% attended at least one session but did not receive any nutritional supplements
and 4% received at least one supplement but never attended sessions (see Appendix 6, Figures
c. and d.).

       4. Empirical Strategy

      For each outcome of interest, we estimate Intent to Treat (ITT) effects on children’s
development. To improve efficiency and take into account the minor baseline differences
observed between treated and control towns, we control for various baseline variables and use
the following regression:

dummies indicating the presence or not of the alternative parenting program MF and whether
the town population size is above or below 10 thousand inhabitants (both included due to our
stratified randomization procedure). The presence of alternative programs in the town does
not bias our impact estimates as such incidence is independent of treatment allocation (it was
decided by the government independently). Furthermore, even if the children that attend
FAMI are systematically different from those that attend the alternative program, such
selection occurred before treatment assignment.
      To compute standard errors of the estimates, we cluster at the town level l (the unit of
randomization). We exclude from the analyses a number of children whose measures were
particularly extreme.16 As we discuss below, we also consider heterogeneity of impacts by
interacting the treatment indicator with relevant conditioning variables.
      At baseline, we assessed 1,460 children and surveyed their households, and 340 FAMIs.
The child attrition rate between baseline and follow-up was 8.6% (N=125) across treatment
arms: 74 (10.5%) of the children from the treatment arm were not measured at follow-up and
51 (6.7%) from the control arm, the difference being significant at the 5% level.
      In Appendix 7 we present an analysis of attrition. Children lost to follow-up were older,
less likely to have a resident father at home, and more likely to have mothers with lower
vocabulary (PPVT) scores. To address the possible bias introduced by non-random attrition,
we jointly estimated the outcome equation (1) and a selection model into follow-up where we
use interviewer dummies at baseline and interviewers assigned to the household at follow-up
as exclusion restrictions. The identity of the interviewers (and presumably their quality) were
a good predictor of attrition and, as they were allocated randomly across towns, they constitute

   Item non-response in baseline covariates is not correlated with treatment status. Thus, we imputed missing
covariate values with the average of the non-missing observations and accounted for this imputation with a
dummy variable in equation (1).

and 15 children who were 6 SDs below the mean and 6 SD above the mean of height-for-age (extreme
observations).

a valid instrument. As it turns out, the main impacts of interest, reported in Appendix 8, are
not sensitive to this correction: attrition does not bias the results. We therefore report estimates
that do not correct for attrition in the main text.
      We also use the same specification of equation (1) to assess whether the intervention had
positive effects on intermediate outcomes. All these instruments were also measured at
baseline, so we can control for baseline intermediate outcomes in all cases.
      In addition to the average impacts, we also analyze the possibility of heterogeneous
impacts. We do this in two ways. First, we consider the entire distribution of the outcomes of
interest in the treatment and control samples and test for differences in these distributions
using the Anderson-Darling statistics (Anderson and Darling, 1952). Such a test is considered
more powerful to detect differences in the tails of the distribution than the Kolmogorov-
Smirnoff test (Engmann and Cousineau, 2011). Second, we re-estimate equation (1) for
subgroups in the evaluation sample. In particular, we divide the sample by wealth, as measured
by a wealth index, mother’s education and gender.

         5. Results

    For most outcomes, we measure impacts in terms of standard deviations (SD) of the
variable of interest in the control group. We also include the 95% confidence interval, the
standard p-value for two-tailed null hypotheses and the Romano-Wolf stepdown p-values
adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing for the specific groups of hypotheses presented in
each table.17

        5.1. Main Outcomes
        In Table 4, we report average effects by intent to treat, regardless of whether children
actually attended the program or how many times they attended, i.e., OLS estimates of
equation (1). The measures we use are the Bayley-III factor for a summary measure of
cognitive development, the ASQ:SE for socio-emotional outcomes and the height-for-age Z-
score for nutritional status.
        The effect of the program on the Bayley-III factor was 0.152 SD and it is statistically
significant at the 5%, after adjusting for multiple hypotheses testing. We find no significant
impact of the program on socio-emotional development or height-for-age Z-scores. Socio-
emotional development makes part of the set of potential outcome variables as the program
also aimed at training mothers in sensitive and responsive parenting and appropriate behavior
management. While the program was quite intensive in cognitive stimulation through

     The Romano-Wolf procedure was performed using 2,500 iterations and clustering by town.

instruction and practice in site and at home, responsive parenting was only encouraged
through messages and group discussions. This might explain the lack of effect on socio-
emotional development. We discuss further the results on nutritional status below.

Standard errors clustered by town; D = beta /SD (Controls). P values are computed using Romano-
Wolf (2005, 2016) step-down procedure. We consider 3 hypotheses for children outcomes.
Covariates included: gender, household wealth index, maternal PPVT score, teenage mother and BL
weight-for-age and height-for-age Z-scores. Bayley III factor is the principal factor of the five age-
standardized Bayley III scales. ASQ:SE total score is the age-standardized ASQ:SE score.

       In terms of cognitive development, the intervention thus eliminated 25% of the deficit
in development in the treatment population with respect to the reference population (the US).
This is all the more remarkable if we take into account that the intervention lasted on average
no more than 45 weeks and the attendance rate was quite low (just 75% attended any sessions).
It also compares very favorably to impacts of nearly 0.21 SD obtained in Attanasio et al.
(2014), which was a one-on-one home visiting program that lasted for 18 months – nearly
75% longer.
       We can address the effect of non-compliance by an instrumental variables procedure,
which in this case (where non-compliance is one sided) provides us with the effect of treatment
on the treated. Specifically, we divide the ITT parameter by the effective participation rate in
the intervention. There are many different ways of thinking of the intensity of the program: if
we measure effective participation as the fraction of children who attended at least one
pedagogical activity, which is 77.5%, then the TOT on the Bayley-III factor is 0.20 SD. If,
instead, we measure effective participation as the fraction of children in the treatment group
who attended at least the unconditional median number of sessions (i.e., 21 out of 55 total),
which is 53.2%, the TOT on the Bayley-III factor is 0.29 SD. Finally, if we define effective
participation as the fraction of children who attended the median number of pedagogical
activities conditional on having attended at least one (i.e., 28 sessions), which is 38.6%, then




                                                    17
the TOT effect is 0.39 SD.18 Thus, the potential effects are very large even for such a short
intervention, delivered in groups. To realize such potential compliance, we would need to
improve our understanding of the factors that drive attendance and whether parents miss-
perceive the returns of the program in terms of child development. This is a key area of further
research.
      In Table 5, we look at the scales of the Bayley-III separately to study which dimensions
of cognition are most affected by the intervention. We consider five scales: cognitive
development, receptive and expressive language, and fine and gross motor development. The
largest impact is in expressive language, followed by gross motor and then cognition and
receptive language. Clearly, as we increase the number of outcomes, the power requirements
implied by multiple hypotheses adjustments become more stringent. After correcting for
multiple hypotheses testing, the expressive language scale remains the most significant (0.151
SD, p-value=0.065). This is another important result because expressive language has proven
the hardest to affect; for example, Attanasio et al. (2014) find no effect on that dimension.
Moreover, language is a key conduit for cognitive development and for learning (Bernal and
Keane, 2011; Morgan et al., 2015).

   There is an additional complication in estimating TOT effects from the ITT impacts we report. As we
mentioned above, our estimate represents the impact of the improved FAMI relative to the existing FAMI,
which is attended by the children in the control group. Presumably there are compliance problems in the control
program on which, unfortunately, we do not have data. The TOT estimate we have discussed should be
interpreted as the impact of a fully compliant improved FAMI over the existing FAMI in which compliance
does not change.

       In addition to the mean effects, it is useful to consider the entire distribution of
outcomes. Figure 2 reports the distribution of the outcomes considered in Table 4 by study
group. To obtain each figure, we first regress the outcome of interest on the control variables
included in equation (1) and then plot the distribution of the residuals of this estimation for
the treatment and the control samples separately. In the graph, we also report the p-value of
the Anderson-Darling test for the null hypothesis of identical distributions by groups.19 What
is apparent from the graphs and the results of these tests is that the program had a significant
impact on the entire distribution of the Bayley-III factor and no effect on socio-emotional
development. In terms of height-for-age, the graph also depicts a difference in favor of the
treatment group and the Anderson-Darling test has a p-value of 0.04.
       As we saw in the descriptive analysis, 12% of the children in our sample are stunted
(height-for-age < -2 SD) and 15% are at the risk of stunting (-2 SD < height-for-age < -1 SD).
It is well-established that height at this age is a good indicator of long-term malnourishment
and that malnourishment at this age can have long-run negative impacts on human capital
development (Hoddinott et al., 2013). The program included a rather significant nutritional
component, which, given the nature of our sample, could have both a short and long-term
impact.

We consider 3 hypotheses for children development. Covariates included: gender, household wealth index,
maternal PPVT score, teenage mother and BL weight for age and height for age Z-scores.

       The results in Table 6, indicate that the fraction of children whose height-for-age is
below -1 SD decreased by 5.8 percentage points or 0.13 SD, while the number of children
with normal height increased by a similar fraction (6.8 percentage points). Both results are
statistically significant even after adjusting the p-values for multiple testing. This result is


19
  The Anderson-Darling test focuses more on the tails of the distribution and has been shown to have greater
power than alternative tests, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (Bennet, 2008), which focuses on first order
dominance.

                                                     20
quite powerful as achieving impacts on height-for-age is generally difficult (Andrew et al.,
2016; Bernal, 2015).

       These results are associated with two important facts. First, the program combines the
delivery of a nutritional supplement with nutrition education provided to parents during the
program’s pedagogical activities. In addition, participant mothers received printed materials
with information regarding good nutritional practices at home, and recipe books specially
designed for children in this age range. Second, the program is delivered during the first
thousand days of life, which is a period of rapid growth and development. The nutritional
supplement was specifically designed to take this fact into consideration. Finally, the results
indicate that the nutritional supplementation was actually used by the parents for the subject
children, at least to a reasonable extent. The typical concern with such programs is that they
crowd out parental inputs (Jacoby, 2002). However, this result is a strong indication that the
crowding out is at most partial and that a substantial part of the supplement “sticks” with the
children.

      5.2. Heterogeneous impacts
      Given the overall strong impacts we now consider how these differ across key groups.
This can help us understand whether the intervention helps the most vulnerable and from a
policy perspective it helps improve targeting. We investigate whether the effects of the
intervention on children’s development vary by the child’s gender, household wealth and
maternal education at baseline. In looking at heterogeneous impacts, we focus on cognitive
development20 as measured by the Bayley-III factor.
      For each of the three baseline variables we consider, we divide the sample in two groups:
level of maternal education (less than high school versus more), gender and household wealth
(above or below the sample median).21 The results are reported in Table 7. The level of
maternal education does not seem to affect the impact. Although the point estimates are larger
for mothers with complete high school (0.18 SD v 0.12 SD), this difference is not significant.
Turning to gender, the point estimates suggest that the intervention worked better for boys,
but the differences are, again, not significantly different from zero.
      However, we do find significant effects of wealth on the impacts, even after correcting
for multiple testing, across all the six hypotheses considered jointly. The effects, at 0.22 SD,
are estimated to be much stronger for children originating in poorer households. Moreover,

20
  No significant heterogeneous effects were found in the case of socio-emotional or nutritional outcomes.
21
  The wealth index is computed as the first principal component of a number of dwelling characteristics (such
as the material of walls, floors and roofs, the number of bathrooms and rooms, access to utilities, etc.) and
durable goods ownership.

                                                     21
the difference between the impact on children from poorer households and that on children
from the higher wealth group is significant, with a p-value of 0.042.

      This result is key and contains both a positive and a negative message: the intervention
can indeed improve the outcomes of the most deprived group in this already poor population.
However, the better off children from this group are in no way “well-off” or middle class and
neither do they measure up well in their development against, say even the Bogota middle
class, never mind the international standards. Hence the intervention would need to improve
for this group. These results generally highlight the difficulty with improving ECD programs
for broad populations – targeting interventions to the needs of separate groups is likely to be
important.

     5.3. Effects on intermediate outcomes and mediation analysis

       The intervention can be viewed as a transfer in kind. As such, it can affect the behavior
of altruistic parents in other dimensions. Parents may reduce other forms of investment as a
consequence of the transfer, therefore, mitigating or even neutralizing the effects of the
intervention. In our case, the food supplement could be clawed back by reducing other food
inputs to the subject child; and the additional stimulation of the target children could cause
parents to switch attention to other children or to themselves, therefore mitigating the
                                                 22
intervention’s impact. However, although this possibility has to be considered, we also notice
that it may not be salient in our specific context. It is also possible that poor parents are not
fully aware of the returns to investing in their children (Cunha et al., 2013; Attanasio et al.,
2018) so that the effects of the intervention may have been generated by an increase in
investment induced by a change in these beliefs. Moreover, the marginal return to parental
investment may actually increase when the child is getting better early childhood programs.
Exploring the mediating factors and the mechanisms underlying the effects we observed is a
way of obtaining answers to some of these questions. Moreover, understanding the
mechanisms through which the intervention had its effects is important to improving its design
and targeting.
       In Table 8, we present the effects of the program on a number of intermediate outcomes
described in detail in Appendix 4. The quality of the home environment is a strong indicator
of how much parents are investing in their children. To measure it, we combine information
from the number of magazines, books or newspapers in the home, the number of toy sources,
the number of varieties of play materials in the home and the number of play activities the
child engaged in with adults. We extract the first principal component and age-standardize it.
      The impact on this indicator was of 0.34 SD and statistically significant with a p-value
     22
of 0. This is a very strong result and does indicate that the intervention induces parents to
invest more in their children. However, we do not find any statistically significant program
effects on maternal knowledge about child development, maternal self-efficacy or food
insecurity.

     Having documented the existence of impacts on intermediate outcomes, we perform a
mediation analysis similar to Heckman, Pinto and Savelyev (2013). In particular, we consider
a simple model of mediation that relates the outcome of interest, 𝑌"#$ , to an intermediate
outcome, 𝐼"#$ , in a linear fashion:

                                 𝑌"#$ = 𝛼 + 𝛾𝐼"#$ + 𝑢"#$                                   (2)

where 𝑢"#$ is a residual term which is crucially assumed to be independent of 𝐼"#$ . Given the
random nature of the trial, one can easily estimate the impact of the intervention on 𝑌"#$ and
𝐼"#$ using regression (1), which we reproduce here omitting some of the control variables for
simplicity:

                  𝑊"#$ = 𝛽/> + 𝛽&> 𝑇#$ + 𝜀 > "#$ ;     where 𝑊 = 𝑌, 𝐼;                      (3)

where 𝑇#$ is equal to 1 if FAMI s in town l is assigned to the treatment sample and 0 otherwise.
If we consider equation (3) for 𝑌"#$ , by augmenting it in the following fashion:

                            𝑌"#$ = 𝛽/D + 𝛽E&D 𝑇#$ + 𝛾𝐼"#$ + 𝜀 D "#$ ;                      (4)

        We can then test the hypothesis that the observed impact is generated by a change in
𝐼"#$ , by comparing the estimates of 𝛽E&D in equation (4) and 𝛽&D in equation (3): if the former is
significantly smaller (in absolute value) than the latter, it is an indication that part of the
intervention impact on 𝑌"#$ is generated by the impact on 𝐼"#$ . Of course, this procedure
assumes the linearity of the relationship between 𝐼"#$ and 𝑌"#$ and the fact that 𝐼"#$ is exogenous
relative to 𝑌"#$ . In Table 9, we present the results of this simple mediation analysis.
       In particular, we report estimates of equation (4) to assess the relative importance of the
different intermediate outcomes on the program impacts on the Bayley-III factor. The first
column reproduces the baseline program impact. The following columns add, one at a time,
each of the intermediate outcomes presented in Table 8. In addition, in the last column we add
all the mediators considered at the same time.
       The results seem to suggest that while all intermediate outcomes significantly explain
children’s cognitive outcomes, only the learning environment at home, as measured by
UNICEF’s FCI indicators, absorbs a large part of the program ITT effect. Taking this at face
value implies that half the effect of the intervention operates through increasing the
engagement with and investments of the parents in their children. The other half, at least in
terms of point estimates is attributable to the direct effects of the intervention itself.

      We also note that the direct effect of the intervention, as measured by the first coefficient
in the last column of Table 8, is not statistically different from zero. Of course, this result
needs to be taken with some caution since parental involvement and all other mediating factors
are potentially endogenous; dealing with this issue would require additional sources of
exogenous variation affecting the mediators. Nevertheless, it is also important to note that the
parents did increase inputs to children: this, together with the fact that this short intervention
had such large impacts, implies that, if anything, parents reinforce the activities and there is
no substantial crowding out.

      6. Discussion and conclusions

      Interventions that promote ECD, starting from birth, may well be the key to successful
human capital policies, particularly in poor environments. However, the characteristics of
such programs and their effectiveness at scale are not well understood. It is precisely in this
field where the inputs from both economics and child development can prove crucial for our
understanding.



                                                25
       In this study, we present results from an experiment where we designed a group-based
parenting support and early stimulation intervention, combined with a nutritional intervention,
and implemented it within the infrastructure of an existing parenting program targeted to the
poorest in Colombia. Our intervention is based on a curriculum shown to be effective in
altering the long-run cognitive trajectory of children from deprived environments (Walker et
al., 2011; Gertler et al., 2014). The well-known effective parenting programs with rigorous
evaluations are based on individual home visits (Grantham-McGregor et al. 1991; Olds et al.,
1986a, 1986b and 1994) while the program we work with is mostly based on group sessions.
       To the best of our knowledge, the evidence on the impacts of a quality enhancement
based on the implementation of an early stimulation structured curriculum and a nutritional
intervention, implemented within the context of a standard ECD government program at scale,
is very limited. The fact that we find sizeable impacts is remarkable. The evidence we present
also points to potentially large gains where they are most needed, namely among the poorest.
The importance of these results is even more apparent if we consider the fact that compliance
with the number of sessions actually attended by children and their caregivers was relatively
low and the intervention was relatively short, at least in comparison with the most successful
efficacy trials referred to in this study. And yet our program had an ITT effect of 15% of a SD
and a treatment on the treated effect of up to 39% of a SD in cognitive development, driven
by improved expressive language skills; and moreover, and a reduction in the fraction of
children whose height-for-age is below -1 SD of 5.8 percentage points.
      We should also stress some features of this particular study that makes us believe that
the estimates reported here are lower bounds of the potential of this intervention. First, the
control group had access to the basic program without the quality enhancement—unlike
similar pilot studies in the literature in which the control group does not receive any
intervention. Second, as we stressed, the average impact is a reflection of larger impacts for
the children most in need and a small or null impact for the better off children. Third, and
most importantly, given that the current program was implemented within an already existing
public parenting program, it was not possible to fully control and enforce in its implementation
all the elements that one might expect to have an impact on development.23 In fact, the
implementation of the intervention was far from smooth and faced various challenges.
Examples of the problems encountered included the low duration of exposure to the program.
The implementation problems we document in our context are common to many programs
implemented at scale.


23
  FAMI mothers were strongly encouraged by ICBF to implement the curriculum and attend the study’s training
and coaching. However, they could decide not to use some or all of these elements, and they could continue to
run their FAMI as usual with no practical consequence.

                                                     26
      These issues suggest that implementing at scale interventions such as this one is
challenging. On average, children attended about half the intended number of sessions and
many never attended. Similarly, 70% of children who received at least one nutritional
supplement received 9 out of a maximum of 14. The focus on the scalability of the intervention
under analysis is one of the most salient facts of this study, reflecting the difficulties policy
makers face when moving from small trials to larger studies with reduced control over what
actually happens in the field. At the same time, our results indicate that, despite the
implementation and scalability problems, the intervention had a sizeable effect on the children
most in need. The key issue is whether those at most risk of low development are likely to
drop out from the intervention.
      Attanasio et al. (2014) study a home visiting intervention in Colombia targeted to a very
similar population and in a similar although broader geographical area in central Colombia.
Their estimated impact on the Bayley-III factor was 0.21 SD. The intervention studied in that
paper lasted about 75% more time than the current one (18 months vs 10.4 months), can be
considered more intensive since it consisted of weekly 1-hour individual home visits designed
for the age of the specific child and the attendance by program participants was higher
(effective home visits delivered were, on average, 81% of those intended). Moreover, the
control of the research team over implementation fidelity was significantly higher than for the
program studied in this paper, given that home visitors, whilst also being local women, were
hired and paid directly by the study. The intervention studied here continued to be ran and
funded by the government throughout the duration of the study. Finally, the control group in
Attanasio et al. (2014) was not active, while in the current study received the ‘unimproved’
FAMI. Both interventions included a nutritional component. However, in Attanasio et al.
(2014) this consisted of micronutrients and was shown to have no effect—all the impact of
the program coming from the stimulation component. Here the nutritional intervention is more
comprehensive, with a broad array of suitable food items and education about nutrition.
Despite these differences, it is remarkable that a comparable effect was achieved with an
intervention that was designed to strengthen an on-going program, whose duration was shorter
than that based on home visits, that did not achieve a perfect level of compliance and that was
cheaper than home visits.
      This study offers important new evidence that quality low-cost enhancements of already
existing programs, which leverage local low-skilled human resources, can be effective at
scale. The intervention we have studied costs about $320 per year per child ($28 in
pedagogical materials, $82 in supervision and $212 in additional nutritional supplementation)
plus $12 one-off cost per child for FAMI pre-service training. The cost of the unenhanced
FAMI program is about $310 per child per year. That means that the pedagogical enhancement

                                              27
(excluding the nutritional supplement) corresponds to approximately 40% of the cost of the
unenhanced version of the program. This is equivalent to 1.7 monthly minimum wages per
child per year, or 2.5 monthly minimum wages per year including the nutritional supplement.
For comparison, the cost per child per year in center-based child care in Colombia is
approximately $1,100 or 4.4 monthly minimum wages per child per year. In sum, the evidence
we have presented shows that it is possible to gradually improve the quality of nationwide
programs at scale in a way that is affordable, while maintaining quality and with a reasonably
sized impact on children’s developmental outcomes.
      These considerations make it clear that one of the most important findings of the current
study is the characterization of the impacts of an intervention that can be developed at scale.
For this reason, it is worth comparing its impacts and its cost to other interventions recently
implemented in Colombia, which is what we do in Table 10.
      Bernal (2015) studies the impact of vocational training of the women running the family
nurseries considered. She reports a sizeable impact at a low cost per child. Bernal et al. (2018)
consider the transfer of children from home-based daycare services offered in the provider’s
own home to large childcare centers and find virtually no impacts at a very large cost.24
Finally, Andrew et al. (2016) study the impacts of (1) targeted pedagogical improvements to
center-based care in large cities and (2) staffing of these centers with nutritionists and
psychologists. The impacts are comparable to ours at a slightly higher cost for the pedagogical
component. Incidentally, the hiring of professional personnel in centers had no effects on
children’s cognition.
      This summary highlights the importance of enhancements to what is known in the
specialized literature as process quality (such as the integration of a structured curriculum and
improved interactions between caregivers and children supported by coaching and mentoring)
with respect to changes and improvements in the so-called structural quality alone (such as
infrastructure, as in Bernal et al., 2017; or staffing, as in the second intervention studied in
Andrew et al., 2016). In particular, the former seems to have more cost-effective impacts with
respect to the latter.




24
   The cost reported in the table corresponds to the difference in the cost per child/year in a childcare center and
the cost in a family nursery.

      This study faced some limitations apart from the difficulties associated with offering the
intervention at a large scale. On one hand, we restricted the study sample to a few regions in
central Colombia because of their similarity in terms of cultures, customs and socioeconomic
context. This would make the use of a single curriculum—and associated materials such as
picture books—more feasible, which was particularly important given the ethnic and
geographical diversity of Colombia. This implies that it is not clear that the curriculum used
to improve FAMI, as currently designed, would be suitable for other regions of Colombia,
specifically, for diverse communities such as those with afro-Colombians and indigenous
populations—although it should (and could) be easily adapted.
      On the other hand, it is possible that some developmental outcomes might have been
collected with significant measurement error (particularly those that are reported by parents
such as Ages and Stages for socio-emotional development), and that these specific measures
lack enough sensitivity to measure the impacts of an intervention. Similarly, some
intermediate outcomes are difficult to measure. For instance, maternal knowledge was
collected using 10 items—some coming from a much longer instrument to measure
knowledge of child development (McPhee, 1981)—and some developed by us and might have
failed to capture the construct of interest. These second set of difficulties points to the
importance to develop and implement richer measures of child development as well as of the
drivers of development.
      To conclude, our paper has shown that high quality ECD interventions are both a
feasible and effective policy tool for developing countries and can form a key element of the
policy toolkit for fighting poverty.

Appendix 1. Detailed Description of the Interventions

        The curriculum aims at assisting mothers to provide developmentally appropriate
activities for their children (in particular, activities that promote language, cognitive, and
motor development), as well as reinforcing maternal knowledge and practices about feeding
and nutrition. In doing so, it aims at improving mothers’ knowledge, practices, enjoyment in
child up-bringing, and self-esteem. Given that the program is delivered mostly through group
meetings and home visits, this intervention includes two complementary curricula. In both
cases, the components, actions and activities used to promote better maternal child rearing
practices are similar. These include making the mother the agent of change and empower her
to improve her child’s development, demonstrating the use of age-appropriate play materials
and activities and providing opportunities to practice with them, and provide supportive
feedback. The program also aims at training mothers in sensitive and responsive parenting
and appropriate behavior management, and encouraging positive mother-child interactions
and preventing child maltreatment.
        Most of the program content was delivered through the group meetings as they were
held on a weekly basis. In addition to being spaces where to demonstrate and practice the use
of age-appropriate play materials and language activities, the groups provided opportunities
for discussing and practicing effective child rearing skills and positive interactions with
children with other caregivers, sharing experiences, group problem-solving, as well as
opportunities for social support. Group meetings also provided the opportunity for mothers to
discuss how play activities promoted children’s development, and show them how to make
simple toys so that each family could set up a toy library for home use. Group meetings were
1 hour long. An average of 5 mothers attend each session (min=1, max=15, SD=2.6).
        The home visits were delivered monthly and provided the opportunity to introduce
activities that were more difficult in the context of the group (such as puzzles and matching
activities), additional language activities and specific ideas on how to use routine home
activities to promote child development and identify materials in the home that could be used
to promote child development. Home visits were, on average, one hour long.
        Mothers were asked to attend one group meeting according to the age of their children.
Separate group meetings were offered for pregnant and lactating women with children up to
6 months, mothers with children 6 to 11 months, and mothers with children aged 1-2 years.
We expected mothers of children 6 to 24 months of age to attend four meetings per month and
pregnant and lactating with children up to 6 months to attend two meetings per month.
However, in practice, this did not always occur, and, in anticipation, the curriculum had been


                                             36
designed so that it could be delivered to groups with children over the entire age range. Each
group session is structured in six different moments: arrival and free play; feedback from the
previous group session (10 minutes); song (5 minutes); demonstration and practice of age-
appropriate play activity and language activity for the week with material that will be taken
home (30 minutes); discussion around a parenting theme or activity (15 minutes); review of
the session to ensure that mothers understand the activities and commitment to practice with
children at home (10 minutes), and finally, they share a snack. If mothers cannot attend their
group according to their children’s age, then play and language activities are divided into age
bands (birth-5 months, 6-11 months and 1-2 years). The themes for discussion during the
group meetings include issues such as the importance of spending time playing with the child,
praising the child, talking to the child, things to do at bath time or mealtimes, learning to trust,
understanding the child’s feelings, teaching the baby about her environment, and child
behavior.
        Similarly, each home visit consisted of i) greeting and discussion of any issues, ii)
feedback from the previous home visiting session, iii) song, iv) introduction of new play and
language activities (including how to integrate into everyday routines, v) nutrition message,
and vi) a review of activities to be conducted over the next month.
        The curriculum involves simple play materials to be used during home visits and in
the group meeting, including books, pictures to talk about, home-made toys, puzzles and
building blocks. The curriculum includes discussion topics or key parenting messages, age-
appropriate activities to promote child development using the play materials, as well as
everyday activities to encourage adult-child interactions. The curriculum also includes a set
of nutrition cards relevant to the children’s ages that are discussed with the mother during
each home visit. The complete kit of materials has a cost of USD 2725 per child per year.
        In addition to the set of activities and materials, the qualification of the FAMI program
also included a training and coaching component (pre- and in-service training) to support and
maintain the quality of home visits and group meetings. Shifting away from a supervision
model, the new approach consists of a team of tutors with degrees in psychology and social
work, who provided the initial pre-service training and then continued to provide in-service
training and support during the implementation period. Tutors trained and supervised by the
research team, were in charge of training FAMI mothers. Training was provided sequentially
by town. All FAMI mothers were trained simultaneously in a given town for an average of
3.5 weeks and 85 hours.26 Towns with a larger number of FAMI units spent up to 170 hours
of training in cases with more than 10 FAMI units per town. More specifically, towns with

     This was done in two stages: an initial stage of 2 weeks and a second stage of 1.5 on average two months later.

less than 5 FAMI units received 75 hours of training in 3 weeks, towns with 6 to 9 FAMI units
were trained for 100-125 hours in 5-6 weeks and towns with more than 10 FAMI units
received training during 150-175 hours offered during 6-7 weeks. The training involved
demonstration, practice and feedback in running the group sessions and conducting the play
and language activities with mothers and children, and training in how to make the toys. The
one-time cost of pre-service training per FAMI provider was of about USD 113 or USD 11
per child. 27
        After training was finalized, tutors coached FAMI mothers continuously throughout
the duration of the intervention. Tutors observed one group session and one home visit, and
provided feedback to the FAMI, in each supervision round which took place approximately
every 6 weeks. Each tutor was in charge of 5 towns and 19 FAMI mothers, on average.
Whenever possible, they also facilitated a group meeting of FAMI mothers in each town to
discuss and share positive experiences and challenges and engage in problem-solving. The
tutors were supervised by an intervention supervisor (a member of the research team) who
conducted visits with each tutor every 2 months. The cost of coaching was around USD 82
per month per FAMI provider or USD 8 per child per month.
        In addition to the introduction of the early stimulation curriculum, the intervention also
includes a nutritional component. It is comprised of the delivery of a monthly nutritional
supplement to FAMI participants, and psychoeducation around feeding and nutrition during
group meetings and home visits. The nutritional supplement corresponds to 35% of daily
calorie intake requirements for pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers and children younger
than 2 years of age (for 30 days). The cost of the package is USD 26 per month including
shipping costs. It contains tuna, sardines, canola oil, and whole milk with iron supplement,
beans and lentils. In terms of educational contents, we developed a cooking book that takes
into account the socioeconomic characteristics of households in our sample, brochures used
to handle and classify foods and 19 nutrition cards that are discussed with the mother during
each home visit. Mothers receive a nutrition card relevant to their child’s age at these monthly
home visits. The topics covered include things like breastfeeding, bottle-feeding, breastmilk
extraction and storage, weaning, hygiene, finger foods, menu ideas, mealtimes, and chatting
while feeding.

  Once in the field for data collection, we realized some towns did not have any FAMI units as they had
made the transition to other public parenting programs (MF)
b
  Towns in the list of 39 towns excluded initially form the sample, were randomly ranked and used as
replacements. However we did not have enough replacement towns in all randomization strata.

Appendix 4. Data and Measurements
The primary outcomes included in this study are the following.
       Nutrition. In line with similar international studies (Walker et al., 2004; Fernald,
Gertler, and Neufeld, 2008), we collected information on height and weight and computed
externally standardized Z-scores following World Health Organization (WHO) standards
(WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006, 2007) for all children in our
sample, both at baseline and follow-up.
      Cognitive, language, and motor development. We used the Bayley Scales of Infant
and Toddler Development, third edition (Bayley-III) (Bayley, 2006) at follow-up only. We
administered the cognitive, receptive language, expressive language, fine motor, and gross
motor scales, following standard procedures, in local community centers, and in the presence
of the children’s mother.
      The Bayley-III scales were translated into Spanish, back translated to English to ensure
accuracy, and piloted by testers.28 Testers held degrees in psychology and had six weeks’
training, including practice sessions with children of the target age groups. Inter-rater
reliability (intra-cluster correlation) was above 0.9 on each scale of the test.
      In the analysis, we use internally age-standardized scores, where raw scores have been
standardized using the sample mean and SD calculated from weighted local
smoothing regressions. Using internally standardized raw scores also allows us to examine
each scale separately. We also constructed a Bayley-III factor score by factor analyzing the
internally age-standardized scores of the five scales.
       Socio-emotional development. To measure the socio-emotional domain, we used the
Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ:SE) (Squires, Bricker, and Twombly, 2009a) for all
children at follow-up only. The ASQ:SE is a parent-completed assessment system for children
ages 6 to 60 months completed through culturally sensitive questionnaires focusing on socio-
emotional development and the identification of children at risk of social-emotional
difficulties. It includes self-regulation, compliance, communication, adaptive functioning,
autonomy, affect, and interactions with others. The ASQ:SE shows high levels of consistency,
reliability, validity, and specificity (Squires et al., 2002; Squires, Bricker, and Twombly,
2009b), and has been used for early development assessments in low and middle low-income

28
  The Institute for Fiscal Studies had already translated the Bayley-III record forms and administration manual
to Colombian Spanish in the context of a prior research study entitled “Early Childhood Development:
Identifying Successful Interventions and the Mechanisms behind Them”. Translation activities were carried out
under the research translation license agreement between Pearson and the IFS, dated August 2009.

countries (Handal et al., 2007; Heo, Squires and Yovanoff, 2007). Given the relatively low
education levels of the mothers, we administered it as an interview to the mother (caregiver).
We report internally age-standardized total scores. It is important to note that the ASQ:SE is
an instrument that screens for developmental risk and is traditionally not the best measure for
assessing changes in children’s behavior.
     We did not collect any measures of child cognitive, language, motor or socio-emotional
development at baseline.
        In addition to primary outcomes, we consider intermediate outcomes that could have
mediated the effect of the intervention on children’s developmental outcomes. In particular,
we focus on variables that measure the home environment, maternal self-efficacy, maternal
knowledge about child development, and food insecurity. All these measures were collected
by maternal report in the home (19%), in the FAMI (43%) or in a different community center,
such as, the town’s school, town hall or library (38%), both at baseline and at follow-up. We
assessed the quality of the home environment using four age-standardized variables
constructed from items in UNICEF’s Family Care Indicators (Kariger et al, 2012): the number
of magazines, books or newspapers in the home; the number of toy sources; the number of
varieties of play materials in the home; and the number of varieties of play activities the child
engaged in with an adult over the three days before the interview. These four indicators were
then summarized in an individual factor using standard factor analysis.
        We assessed maternal self-efficacy using the Self-efficacy in the Caregiver Role Test
– Modified (Pedersen et al., 1989; Porter and Hsu, 2003), which evaluates feelings mothers
could have while taking care of their children.
        To measure maternal knowledge about child development, we used 10-items, some
selected from the Knowledge of Infant Development Inventory (KIDI) (MacPhee, 1981), a
much longer tool, and some developed by us. In the statistical analysis, we used raw total
scores for both variables.
        Finally, we measured food insecurity by using the ELCSA scale –Latin American
Scale for the Measurement of Food Insecurity - which was validated in Colombia (ELCSA
Scientific Committee, 2012) at baseline and follow-up. Total scores allow classification of
households in four different levels of food insecurity: secure, mild insecurity, moderate
insecurity and severe insecurity (Álvarez et. al, 2008). In the statistical analysis, we use an
indicator for food insecurity which equals 1 if the household is food insecure (mild, moderate
or severe) and 0 otherwise.
        We collected household demographic and socio-economic status data both at baseline
and follow-up. These included data on dwelling characteristics such as type of property, type
of floors, roofs, and walls, number and type of bathrooms, access to public utilities,

                                              41
availability of durable goods, characteristics of members of the household such as educational
attainment, employment status and wages, ethnicity, participation in social programs, and
household income by source. The socio-economic status score was computed as the principal
component of a set of dichotomous variables that describe characteristics of the household,
ownership of durable goods, and access to public utilities. A lower socio-economic status
score is denoted by a negative factor and a higher status by a positive factor (Vyas and
Kumaranayake, 2006).
      Background information on FAMI mothers was collected directly from them in both
rounds. Apart from basic sociodemographic characteristics, we also collected verbal ability
by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and knowledge on ECD based on the same 10-item
inventory used for mothers.

Standard errors clustered by town. P values are computed using Romano-Wolf (2005, 2016) step-down
procedure. We consider 3 hypotheses for children outcomes. Exclusion restrictions: interviewer fixed
effects at baseline and assigned interviewer fixed effects at follow-up. First stage F-stat=11.24. Bayley-
III factor is the principal factor of the age-standardized Bayley III scales. ASQ:SE Total Score is the
age-standardized ASQ:SE score.
