                 Education, Welfare, and the "New Federalism:
                State Budgeting in a Federalist Public Economy




                                    ABSTRACT

     President Reagan's proposal for a "New Federalism" raises a fundamental

challenge to our current structure of Federal—state—local fiscal relations.

This research examInes the lIkely consequences of the New FederalIsm for

fiscal allocations by state governments, and attempts to model the impact on

both the size of state budgets and on the sectors on which that budget is

spent.    A political economy model of state budgeting is specified and

estimated for a sample of forty—four states for the years 1966—1980.          The

analysis focuses on the two most visible sectors of state government

expenditure, welfare and education, while accounting for the remaining end

uses of state funds, other expenditure and taxes.        Two general conclusions

emerge from the analysis.        First, current fiscal allocations by states are

significantly influenced by the structure of Federal aid; without Federal

matching —ules and spending requirements stateswould choose to spend less on

education and welfare services and more on tax relief and the numerous other

state activities.    Second, the New Federalism, as it relaxes the spending

rules and reduces the level of Federal aid, both reduces state education and

welfare spending and decreases the aggregate level of state expenditure.

We conclude the New Federalism will succeed in reaching its objectives; the

government sector will be more decentralized, with the additional consequence

of reduced government budgets.

1.   Introduction


     The United States public economy is a federalist economy.               Public

services are financed and purchased by Federal, state, and local governments

each with autonomous decision—making authority, but each intimately connected

to the others through an elaborate network of grants—in—aid and regulations.

Historically, it has been an evolving structure marked by significant shifts
                                       1
in responsibilities and control.           Most recently the trend in financial

responsibility has been upward, towards the Federal level, while the

state—local sector has become the primary provider of (non—defense) public

services.2 The decade 1965—1975, called the period of "creative federalism",

marked a significant acceleration in those trends.          During this period the

number of Federal grants to the state—local sector went from 160 separate aid

programs in 1965 to 412 by 1976. Federal to state—local aid grew from about

$66 per capita in 1960 to $192 per capita in 1980, both measured in 1972
           3
dollars.       Almost all of these transfers imposed significant Federal

regulation and spending requirements upon the recipient state and local

governments; the one exception is General Revenue Sharing which composed only

eight percent of all aid transferred in 1980.
                                      —2—



        In January, 1982, President Reagan proposed a significant reform in our

current fiscal structure.     Under the label of the "new federalism', Reagan

offered a three part reform package whose objectives are to decentralize

fiscal choice through a consolidation of grants and a relaxation of Federal

requirements, and to shrink the size of Federal government spending through a

gradual reduction In overall dollar support.            First, sixty—one Federal

programs in education, community development, transportation, and social

services will be returned to the states for state financing and
administration.      To help defray the   costs   of these programs a $28 billion

Federal trust fund supported by existing federal excise taxes will be

established. The trust fund will he fully funded until 1988, at which time it

will be reduced in four equal steps until, by 1992, no additional federal

support will be offered. However, the supporting Federal excise taxes will be

discontinued as Federal taxes, and the states may, if they wish, institute

these taxes as their own after 1992. Second, the Federal government will turn

over to the states for state financing and administration the present Aid for

Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program.        To help the states assume

this financial obligation, the Federal government will, third, assume full

financial and administrative responsibility for the current state—run and

state—supported Medicaid program.         As initially calculated, the dollars

flowing to the states from the trust fund and the Federal assumption of

Medicaid would just equal the added program costs to the states of AFDC and

the sixty—one released Federal programs. The initial effects of the exchange

would    leave   the fiscal structure basically unchanged; one redistribution
                                        —3—



program (Medicaid; health care for the poor) would be traded for another

(AFDC) and block grants (the trust fund) would replace categorical aid (the

sixty—one existing programs).         In the long run, however, the Reagan
administration hopes to "cap" and reform the current health insurance system

(including Medicaid), to phase out the trust fund aid, and to foster

interstate competition to discourage the growth of the state—local sector. If

successful, the end result will be a more decentralized public sector and

perhaps a smaller one as well.

        Will the new federalism succeed? There is the first question, of course,

of whether the new federalism will even emerge from Congress sufficiently

intact to have its intended effects. We shall not make political predictions
        4
here,       In this paper, we are interested in the economic ——   i.e.,   allocative
—— consequences
                of Reagan's reforms assuming they do become law.           Our work

here extends our previous analysis of the new federalism (Craig and Inman

(1982)) in two important directions.       First, the previous work studied the

effect of the fiscal reforms on one important state—local service, education.

Here we include a second major program area ——     welfare   —— which is In many

ways the linchpin of the new federalism.       Secondly, in order to model two

public services it is crucial that we specify how grants will influence both

services and allow for the possibility of cross—effects between program areas.

To do so we must specify more carefully than past research (our own included)

just how multi—service fiscal allocations are decided. As in our prior work,

however, we will continue to assume Federal fiscal policy is exogenously set

and concentrate instead on the effects of that policy on fiscal choices in the
                                       —4.-




state—local sector.     It is from this analysis that we hope to understand the

likely consequences of President Reagan's proposed reform of our current

federalist fiscal structure.



II. A Model of State—Local Fiscal Choice in a Federalist Economy


     From the early simple linear determinant models of state—local fiscal

choice to the more recent median voter specifications, the emphasis in the

empirical analysis of state—local budgetary allocations has been on voter

preferences and the fiscal constraint which defines the set of feasible public

budgets. Figure 1 illustrates the now familiar story.

     One resident will be chosen as the representative or "typical" resident

whose preferences for state and/or local services are decisive in the

budgetary process.     This resident's preferences are represented by a utility

function over after—tax private income (y) and public goods (g), denoted

U(g, y), and are shown as a set of indifference curves in Figure 1.            Public

services (g) are generally assumed to flow from a per capita sharing of a

public facility (x) with a population of size n:            g = x/n.    The public

facility ——   e.g.,   a park or school ——   is   produced by a constant—returns—to—

scale technology; x costs c dollars per unit. Total expenditures to provide a

facility of size x is cx. Residents may not be required to pay all of cx for

these local services. In a federalist public economy, the Federal government

often assists states and localities by either paying a fracAon (in)       of   those

total expenditures directly or by offering the locality a lump—sum payment (z)

which can be used to cover local service costs, Residents therefore need pay
Figure I: Resident Preferences and Budget Constraint

taxes which total only (1 — m)cx —                z,      the government's net expenditure after

deducting Federal "matching aid" (m is the matching rate) and Federal

"lump—sum aid". The total tax payment —— T = (1 — nt)cx — z ——                           will   be shared

by all residents within the community. If local taxes are proportional taxes,

then each resident's share (denoted )                     will   equal the resident's share of his

or her tax base (h) in the total tax base of the locality:                              •   = b/(B   •
                                                                                                         n),
where B is the aggregate tax base per resident in the locality. A typical

local resident therefore pays a tax (t) equal to:


             t =   T   =   (b/B) {(i    —   m)(cx/n)      —   (z/n)   }   ,   or

since g =    (x/n):

             t =   (b/B) {(1   —   m)cg —     (z/n)   }




To define after—tax income for the typical resident, we simply subtract t from

pre—tax income (I), with one further adjustment.                               Since most residents can

deduct their state or local taxes from their Federal income tax payments, a

dollar of local taxes will not cost the resident a full dollar.                                 For each

dollar of local taxes paid the resident saves a fraction, q, of that dollar in

Federal tax payments, where q is the resident's marginal Federal tax rate.

The portion of local taxes actually lost from pre—tax income will be w =

(1 —   q).   Net local tax payments are therefore rt, and after tax income, y, is

equal to I —        nt.      This definition of y allows us to define the typical

resident's budget constraint when purchasing private goods (y) and public

services (g). From y =             I—   iTt, and the definition of t, we have:
                                                  —6—




            y =   I   —   {Ir(b/B)(1   —   tn)c}g + i(b/B)(z/n)

or upon rearranging terms:


            y+p g=I
where p is called the "tax price" of local public services and equals
{ir(b/B)(1 —   m)c } and       where I is called "full fiscal income" and equals
I +   i(b/B)(z/n).        The budget constraint is drawn in Figure 1 as the line lCD.

The kink in the budget line at point C reflects the fact that                         exogenous,

lump—sum aid is generally restricted to be spent only on g and cannot be given

directly to households; points along the dashed extension of the budget line

to I areThot legally available to the typical resident.                       From the point—of--

view of the resident, lump—sum aid is equivalent to a free gift of g units of

the public good.5          From point C, the resident is then free to buy additional

units of g at a "tax price' of p {=              ii(b/B)(1   —   m)c} dollars per unit of g.
      The preferred allocation of the representative resident will be that

combination of g and y which maximizes U(g, y) subject to the constraint.

This is point (g*, y*) in Figure 1.                     As is true in most economic models of

this form, an increase in full fiscal income (I) or a fall in the price of g

(p) will stimulate the resident's demand for the public good.                     I rises either

because before—tax income increases (I) or lump—sum aid per capita increases

(z/n).    The price, p, falls either because costs (c) fall, or the matching

rate (m) rises, or more local taxes become deductible (ir falls), or there is

an exogenous increase in the average level of the locality's tax base (B
                                             —7—



rises). The effects of change in each of these variables is captured in the

representative resident's demand curve for public services:



(1)          g =   f(p,   IlTastes)


where the comparative statics of price and income changes (normally) predicts

ag/ap      0 and ag/al       0. The taste variables (Tastes) are assumed to be those

of the "typical" resident who is decisive in budgetary allocations.

        This specification of state—local fiscal choice has been used extensively

to analyze allocation in a federalist economy; see Inntan (1979) for a review.

However, there has been one matter left unresolved in almost every application

of this approach. Who exactly is the typical resident whose demand curve is

estinated?     Vague, but generally unsubstantiated, references to some average

income voter is seen to suffice.            Only recently have there been efforts to

give a precise answer to this important question. That literature draws its

inspiration from the classic paper of Howard Bowen (1943) on the role of the
                                        6
median voter in fiscal politics.

        In the special case where only one public service level is being decided

and decisions are made by a simple majority rule process ——           school spending by
local districts is the usual example ——         the   political process will select that

level of services preferred by the voter with the median (50th percentile)

demand for the public good.           If a service level greater than that demanded by

the median voter             offered, the median voter and all voters with lower

demands will vote against it.           If a service level less than that demanded by

the median voter is offered, the median voter and all voters with higher
                                     —8—




demands will vote against it.    That level of services demanded by the median

voter will defeat all other service levels in majority rule comparisons. The

median demand voter is decisive and becomes the natural candidate for the

"typical" resident in the economic model of fiscal choice.

      Tests of the median voter model against recent experiences of U.S. and

European local governments support at least two of the model's central

predictions: the demand for local services declines as the median voter's tax

price increases (g/p < 0), and the demand for local services increases as
                                                          7
the median voter's full fiscal income rises (ag/SI > 0).        Yet one central

prediction of the model is rejected. The two components of full fiscal income
——   private income (I) and lump—sum aid per capita (z/n) —— should          have

identical effects on local service demands if ir(b/B)         1, alternatively if

1T(b/B) < 1 the effect of income should be greater than the effects of

exogenous aid.     In fact, the empirical evidence is uniformly against this

proposition:     (z/n) has almost always had a larger impact, sometimes a 20

times larger impact, on local service demands than I. The large effect of aid

on local service demand compared to the small effect of income has been called

the "flypaper effect".     Since private income belongs initially in private

hands and public aid is given initially into public hands, it appears that

dollars "stick" where they first land. Yet the demand model predicts dollars

are fully transferable between public and private uses.       Something more than

the demand model is needed if we are to rationalize these empirical results.

     That something more is politics.      The existence of a "flypaper effect"

implies the presence of a wedge between what fully informed, utility

maximizing residents would prefer arid     what they finally receive from the
                                      —9—



state—local fisc.     They would prefer to have lump—sum aid spent as private

income; what they get is lump—sum aid spent almost entirely on public
services. Who or what is that wedge which stands between public allocations

and resident preferences? Romer and Rosenthal (1979; 1982 with Filimon) have

argued that it is a budget—maximizing politician—bureaucrat —— a "typical"

state—local official —— who is insulated from resident control. A desire to

maximize the public budget means the bureaucrat—politician wants to spend all
       10
aid.        Insulation from voter control gives him the freedom to do so.    In

essence, what Roiner and Rosenthal have done is introduce a second player into

the game of fiscal choice —— a "typical" state—local official —— whose

preferences for how public dollars are allocated differs dramatically from the

preferences of our first player ——   the "typical" resident. We have a conflict
which must be resolved.     it is politics, the process of conflict resolution,

which will balance these competing interests, and it is the analysis of

politics which is so far missing from our formal models of fiscal choice.

       The Roiner—Rosenthal analysis sees the public allocation process as a

bargaining game between the politician—bureaucrat and the resident voter. The

voter retains the ultimate right to veto any budgetary proposal but the

politician retains the right to offer proposals. The game is played a finite

number of times and if no agreement Is reached, a "reversion level" or

fall—back budget is automatically adopted. Politicians and voters can talk to

each other —— there are budget hearings —— and they will seek to strike the

best compromise subject to the rules of bargaining. The model predicts two

outcomes which can distinguish it from the strict, resident—only demand model:
                                       —10—



(1) lump—sum aid and private income need no longer have identical effects, and

(2) the compromise will likely balance the competing interests of the typical
                                                 11
voter and the typical state—local official.             The empirical evidence is

supportive of both predictions. First, Filinion, Romer, and Rosenthal (1982)

find a significant flypaper effect ——         like    most other studies of local
budgeting —— which they attribute to the inability of voters to monitor what

public officials do with lump—sum aid (a "fiscal illusion").         Second, they

find the bargaining process between the voter and the bureaucrat leads to a

local budget which is approximately 15% larger than that desired by the median

voter were he or she decisive alone.

     While one need not embrace all the details of the Romer—Rosenthal

analysis, their basic point seems hard to ignore. Politics matter. They have

introduced the state—local official as a second player along with the utility

maximizing resident voter into the game of state and local fiscal choice.

Each player is given the "right—to—play" and they must negotiate an outcome.

Suddenly, not just preferences and a budget constraint determine local fiscal

allocations; the rules of the game matter too. Who are the players? What is

their standing and their rights within the budgetary game? How will conflicts

be resolved?    These are political questions and they require political
analysis for answers.    The simple analytics of budgetary choice so neatly

captured by equation (1) will be inadequate when policy choices involve many

players and many possible public programs.

     Yet the formal analysis of conflict resolution within a democratic

process faces a troubling contradiction of theory and fact.         In his famous
                                          —11—



(Im)possibility theorem, Kenneth Arrow (1963) proves that there is no

democratic process involving more than two players and more than two options

which would always yield a determinate outcome.                    Either matters are

indeterminate ——   essentially      cycling" from one policy option to another ——    or
there Is a dictator who decides the final allocation. Only in very special

and unlikely circumstances (Plott (1967) and Kramer (1973)) will it be

theoretically possible for a democratic choice process to give a determinate

outcome. No—equilibrium is the most likely result. Yet as a factual matter,

our democratic fiscal system does arrive at equilibrium allocations of

ser.rices and taxes. How can we resolve this apparent conflict of theory with

the facts? The answer must lie in a richer theory. Recent advances in the

theory of political institutions provides us with what we need.

     Figure 2 illustrates the central analytic problem for the simple case of

two fiscal options ——    e.g.,   spending on education (g1) and welfare (g2) —— and

three coalitions ——     e.g.,    poor (P), rich (R), and middle class (M) voters.

Each coalition is assumed to have well—defined preferences over g1 and g2.

These preferences differ, however, and a conflict arises which must be

resolved.   The poor want large welfare expenditures and relatively low

education outlays.       The rich want modest welfare expenditures and large

education outlays. The middle class are assumed to want modest expenditures
                                             12
on education and low welfare outlays.             The   conflict   resolution process is

assumed to be a democratic majority rule process in which each coalition has
                  13
one equal vote.        Coalition preferences are represented by a "bliss point" or

an ideal allocation ——     points    P, R, and M —— and a set of indifference curves

about the bliss points representing decreasing levels of well—being as we move

away from the ideal allocation.     The indifference curves are depicted as

circular for simplicity. The solid lines connecting the bliss points are the

"contract lines" marking the tangencies of the indifference curves between the

various pairs of coalitions. The area within the three contract lines defines

the set of Pareto points for this allocation problem.         A move from an

allocation within the Pareto set (e.g., point c) to a point outside the set

(e.g., point (5) will make members of at least one coalition worse off (e.g.,

coalition P). Conversely there is always a point within the Pareto set (e.g.,

point i) which will make all voters better off compared to its alternative

outside the Pareto set (e.g., point 5).     The important point, however, is

there is no stable majority rule winner in this game.    As any point outside

the Pareto set will be defeated unanimously by some point within the set, we

can focus our analysis on alternatives such as a, B, 1, and c.       In pairwise

comparisons by majority rule, B (favored by P and R) beats a (favored by N), a

(favored by M and P) beats y (favored by R), but now note that y (favored by N

and R) beats B (favored by P). Point c which is inside the Pareto set is also

caught in a voting cycle. Point c wins over point a as voters P and R prefer

c; point a defeats y as N and P prefer a; but y beats c as N and R prefer .

There is no equilibrium winner among the alternatives in Figure 2.

    To obtain an equilibrium outcome for this allocation game, further

political structure in addition to majority rule is needed. Shepsle (1979)

has described and analyzed various legislative institutions which are

sufficient to produce stable, majority rule allocations.             The final
                                         —13—



allocations in a Shepsie equilibrium ——         often   called a structure—induced

equilibrium ——are conditioned by the status quo and the constitutional rules

which determine legislative structures.         Shepsie adds three new structural

features to the majority—rule allocation game:           (1) a committee structure

which identifies who is allowed to offer proposals for consideration by the

full legislature; (2) a jurisdiction structure which defines which proposals

may be considered by the committee and the legislature; and (3) an amendment

structure which describes how the committee's proposals to the legislature may

be altered.        Together, these three additional rules can insure a stable

allocation.

     Figure 3 illustrates one possible case.              The committee structure

identifies    that group which is          permitted to     submit proposals     for

consideration; assume for the example it is group R, the rich. In Figure 3

the jurisdiction structure limits voters to consider only education proposals;

    '         is   the status quo point (denoted 8),
                                   14
                                                        only policies along the line
at g2 =       can be considered.        The amendment structure permits voters to

consider only the committee's proposal against the status quo; the amendment

process is "closed."        Group R, which we call the "agenda—setter" in this

example, will propose the g1 alternative along the line at          which maximizes

R's utility subject to the constraint that it will be approved by a majority

in a pairwise comparison with the status quo point.        R needs one more vote in

addition to its own.      That vote will come from the middle—class (M), and the

final allocation will be at point c (g,                 Point c* is just inside M's

indifference curve through the status quo —— the position needed to win M's

support —— and is the best that R can do as an agenda—setter subject to these

structural constraints. If group M were the agenda—setter from the committee

structure, the final equilibrium would be at point i   with   M and R voting for

approval and the poor (P) against.     If P were the agenda—setter, the final

allocation would remain at the status quo point, 8, for group P could not do

better and still win the support needed from groups N or R to defeat 8.

     Figure 4 extends the analysis to a case where the jurisidiction structure

allows the committee and the voters to consider both dimensions of fiscal

choice simultaneously. Again, allow R to be the agenda—setter and point 8 to

be the status quo. R seeks, as before, to maximize Its utility subject to the

structural constraints and the status quo.     R can attract group P into a

majority winning coalition with any proposal along the contract line between
                  16
points P and S.        Group P is just indifferent between the status quo and

proposal 5; allocations closer to point R along the contract line (which group

R prefers) will be rejected by P in favor of 8.    If R chooses to align with

group N, points along the R to N contract line between allocations y and c**

are available; allocations between points N and y are rejected by group R

while allocations between R and c** are rejected by group M. Therefore, the

possible winning allocations available to agenda—setter R are on the heavy

line segments 'r€k and P5 in Figure 4. R will select that allocation on one

of these line segments which maximizes the coalition's utility;           e.g.,

allocation c** in Figure 4. In this example, policy is set by the middle and

rich coalitions. A similar analysis will show that point P is the winning

allocation if group P is the agenda—setter and that point y is the winning

allocation if group M is the agenda—setter. All three allocations are stable

equilibria provided the political structure, including the status quo point,
                 17
remains fixed.

     The concept of a structure—induced equilibrium provides an important

element in the needed theoretical framework to begin the analysis of fiscal

allocations in a federalist economy. Since budget allocations are stable over

time, it is essential that we have a theory of political choice which gives a

well—defined equilibrium prediction.            Further, the theory must generate
equilibrium outcomes even when there Is conflict and the issues are

multidimensional. The theory of structure—induced equilibria does just that.

To apply the theory of structure—induced equilibria, however, we must close

two gaps in the analysis. First, we must specify the determinants of voter

preferences in the policy space from a general, underlying preference

structure over public and private goods Second, the political theory is a

partial equilibrium theory providing predictions of budget allocations given

the status quo point and the relevant political institutions. Applications of

the theory of structure induced equilibrium must specify which institutions

are relevant and exactly how those institutions will influence budgetary

choices.

     The starting point for the.specification of voter preferences over fiscal

policies is the individual utility maximization model of fiscal choice which
                                                   18
defined the individual voter demand curves in (1).    Generalized to the case

of multiple public goods Ct = 1, ...,     G),    the utility—maximizing demand model

would define a vector of preferred allocations, the typical element of which

is    =
           f(p1, •••    p   IlTastes). The optimal level of private goods (y) will

be what is left over after the resident pays for the preferred bundle of

public goods.         For each voter or coalition, the vector of preferred public
                                      —16—



allocations defines the voters' bliss points ——   e.g.,   points R, M, and P, In
                                                    19
Figures 3 and 4 for the case of two public goods.         The starting point for

specifying the influence of political institutions on budgetary choices is the

fact that in models of structure—induced equilibria final allocations will be

weighted averages of the (just specified) voter bliss points ——        e.g.,   points

r**, y, or P in Figure 4.        The institutional structure ——        status     quo,

committee, jurisdiction, and amntendment structures ——   will   define the weights.

If we allow S to represent political structure and 8 the status quo point,

then the final budgetary allocations of public goods can be specified as:



(2)       g* = aR(S   8)          IRiTastes) + M(5 8)                IMiTastes)




               + c(S, 8)            IITastes)
                                                          (t = 1, ..., G)




where p. is the vector of tax prices, I is the full fiscal income
respectively of each voter group I (= R, M, P) and where c() is the

political weight on the rich coalition, M(.) is the political weight on the

coalition of middle class voters, and al? (E 1 —          — B)    is the political

weight on poor voters.     Variables which might be included in the vector of

political structure include controlling Interests (chairmanship, majority) of

the key legislative committees which set the agenda, jurisdiction and

budgetary rules on how dollars can be allocated, size of voting blocs within

the legislature or community, political allegiance of those with veto power
                                     —17—



over final allocations (e.g., governor, mayor), and amendment rules which
                                                                 20
might allow proposals to be submitted from at—large interests.

     Once estimated, equation (2) gives us exactly what is needed to begin to

analyze the effects of changes in public dollars and political structures on

fiscal allocations in a federalist economy.        Section III outlines one

application of this methodology to state government spending for welfare,

education, and "other services".



III. State Spending for Education, Welfare, and "Other" Services


     President Reagan's new federalism offers a fundamental reorganization of

our current federalist fiscal economy, decentralizing many of the new

Federally mandated fiscal activities of the state and local sector. Central

elements in the reform are the current Federal aid programs in education and

public welfare. These programs now constitute 49.5 percent of all federal to

state—local assistance. It seems useful, therefore, to begin our analysis of

fiscal allocations in a federalist economy by focusing on a major, new reform

package and on the central components of that package. We do so by specifying

and estimating a four—equation budgetary model of state allocations for

education, welfare, "other services", and revenues. The model is based upon

the conceptual analysis of fiscal choice summarized by equation (2) above, and

is estimated for a sample of the 48 mainland states over the period 1966—1980.

    Three voter coalitions —— a rich/upper middle cL_ss (R; defined as the

percent of families with income > $25,000), a middle class (M; percent of

families with incomes between $5,000 and $25,000), and a poor class (P;
                                          —18—



percent of families with incomes less than $5,000) —— are assumed to determine

state budgetary allocations over three expenditure categories and non—debt,

current state revenues (SREV).          Expenditures include state aid to local

elementary—secondary education (SAE), state payments to low income families

from all state—run welfare programs (SWL), and "other" current account state

expenditures (OEXP). SAE includes all direct state to local educational aid

as well as all Federal education aid given to the states with the requirement

that it be "passed—through" to the local units.            SWL includes state AFDC

payments, state Medicaid payments, state general assistance payments, and the

many small state—run supplemental welfare programs. All Federal aid dollars

which are given directly to the states t help defray these welfare costs are

included in SWL.      OEXP includes all oth.r state expenditures supported from

non—debt state revenues (SREV), while SRE\ includes all state tax revenues as

well as revenues from state user fees and licenses. The model is specified as

where tax prices (,      i   = R, M, P), full fiscal income (I i —        R, M, P),
voter tastes (Tastes1, I = R, M, P), the political structure (S) and the

budgetary status quo () are defined as In our previou8 discussion of equation

(2) above, and where v captures the effects of all unmeasured determinants of

SAE,   SWL, OEXP, or SREV. Equation (4) is the state's budget Identity which

relates total expenditures to total current account revenue from the state's

own revenues and from the Federal—to—state grants—in—aid.              Our analysis

provides a careful disaggregation of the effects of Federal aid; these aid

programs are central to our understanding of fiscal allocations in a

federalist economy and to predicting the likely effects of the new federalism.

Disaggregated Federal assistance includes:        (1) Federal general revenue

sharing measured by the program's two component parts —— a lump—sum, general

revenue sharing grant (LSGRS) and a tax effort component which gives states

more money (at a rate, e) for each dollar raised from a state income tax
                                                                  21
(which constitutes the share •     of    total state revenues);        (2) lump—sum

education aid (LSEA, including Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Title I

for the educationally deprived, Title VI for the handicapped, and vocational

education aid); (3) closed—ended matching aid for education and welfare (CEM,

including school lunch, breakfast, and milk programs and all low—income

commodity assistance aid); (4) open—ended welfare matching aid at the federal

matching rate m for eligible expenditures (AFDC and Medicaid outlays are

eligible for matchin aid and constitute a share U of SWL); (5) lump—sum

welfare aid (LSWA, including aid for social services, child nutrition,

maternal and child health care); and (6) other federal aid for current
                                     —20—



expenditures (OFA, excluding highway construction aid but inclusive of other

Federal—to—state aid not already included in revenue—sharing, education, or

welfare aid). Since the budget identity defines an exact relationship between

each of the three expenditure categories —— SAE,     SWL, and OEXP —— and own

state revenues (SREV) given Federal—to—state aid, we need only estimate three

of the four behavioral equations in (3). We choose to estimate the SAE, SWL,

and SREV equations and infer OEXP front the budget identity.

     The estimation of the SAE, SWL, and SREV equations requires the

approximation of several of the independent variables in (3).    Specifically,

we do not have individualized tax prices or individualized full fiscal incomes

for the rich, middle class, and poor coalitions, nor do we have measures of

the determinants of coalition tastes. We do have measures of the components

of those tax prices and fiscal incomes, and plausible correlates with

coalition preferences. Coalition tax prices have two elements:     open—ended

Federal matching aid programs, and relative population usage. The open—ended

matching programs are revenue sharing (e) and welfare (m); while relative

population usage of education services is measured by the percent of school

age children who attend private schools (PRIV), and population usage of

welfare is measured by the percentage of families whose head is over 65 (OLD),

or is headed by a female (FHH).      Per capita state Income (INC), exogenous

Federal aid to state governments (LSGRS, LSEA, CEM, LSWA, OFA), exogenous

Federal aid to local governments (educational impact aid (IMPA) and low income

housing aid (LHA)), and Federal assistance given directly to households

(earned Income tax credit (ErTC) and food stamps (FS)), are used to specify,
                                          —21—



                                                              23
collectively, the coalitions' full fiscal incomes.                   Two    variables   are

included to specify coalitions' tastes for education —— percent high school

graduates (HS) and the average number of children per family (KIDS) —— and

three variables are used to measure coalitions' tastes for low—Income

assistance including the exposure to poverty or to the risks of poverty ——

percent of population in urban areas (METRO), the state unemployment rate
(UE), and percent of state population employed in manufacturing (MAN).

        Political structure is defined by the percent of the population in each

voter coalition —— R and P, with H omitted from the regressions to avoid

singularity —— and by the percent of population which is white (WHT) as a

proxy      for    possible   political    discrimination and/or relative voter
participation. We also include a vector of state dummy variables to control

for the many institutional differences in the budgetary process across

states.2         Finally, the state's budgetary status quo is represented by a

lagged vector of educational services provided —— lagged school personnel per

public school enrollee (PER_1), lagged wages per public school employee

(WAG1), and lagged non—personnel expenditures per public enrollee (NPEXP1)
—— and by lagged state welfare expenditures per capita (SWL_1). All fiscal

variables arid state income are measured in per capita units and are deflated
                                 25
by a state cost of living index.

     The error term specification of our model assumes that our state dummy

variables will capture all systematic effects across states which are

correlated with the included exogenous variables.                    Previous analysis

(Craig—Innian, 1982) suggests that a time trend may          also   be appropriate with
                                     —22—



this sample to control for the systematic upward drift in state spending.

With both state dummy variables and a time trend included as exogenous

variables we feel that the remaining unmeasured determinants of taxes and

spending captured by v(t = SAE, SWL, and SREV) are randomly distributed
across states and time.       This least squares dummy variable estimation

procedure has been shown to closely approximate two—way error components

estimation (see Baltagi (1981)).        We do, however, permit error term
interdependence across revenue and spending within states and years.      Such

cross—equation interdependence is to be expected in budgetary models;
                                                                26
estimation by generalized least squares (GLS) is appropriate.

     The model as estimated is clearly a reduced—form specification of the

structural model given in equations (3) and (4). Thus, we cannot identify the

relative importance of the various coalitions in state budgetary policy, nor

the exact role political structure plays in setting spending or taxes.     We

can, however, identify the effects of Federal aid on state budgetary outcomes,
                                        27
and that is our central concern here.        Section IV summarizes our results

based upon GLS estimation of the budget model.



IV. State Fiscal Policy


     Table 1 summarizes our estimates of a state budgetary model for state

assistance for education (SAE), state welfare spending (SWL), state revenue

(SREV), and, via the budget identity, other state expenditures financed from

current revenues (OEXP).   The results across all three estimated equations

tell a consistent, and upon reflection a not too surprising, story: education

assistance, welfare spending, and broad—based tax relief are not the favored

outlets for state dollars.            State politicians prefer to spend state public

dollars on OEXP, the treasure chest of many small, favored public projects

which keep constituents from all corners of the state content. If the Federal

government wishes to stimulate state spending on human services ——                  education
and low income assistance ——          it   must impose strong spending regulations and

matching requirements on Federal aid, and even these requirements will not

keep some dollars from leaking into OEXP.

     Nothing reveals this pattern more clearly than an analysis of the initial

impact effects of the major Federal—to—state aid programs, beginning with the

least restrictive grant —— general revenue sharing —— and moving to the most

regulated grant, —— open—ended categorical matching aid.

     (1)      General Revenue Sharing.          The marginal effects of a dollar of

lump—sum revenue—sharing aid (LSGRS) on each of the two estimated expenditure

items ——     SAE   and SWL —— are negative and, in the case of SWL, statistically

different from zero. Estimated at the mean value of LSGRS (=                 $2.84/capita),   a

dollar of GRS aid will reduce state education aid by $.08 and state welfare

spending by $.09. LSGRS is estimated to increase state revenues by $.09, but

the effect is not statistically significant.                   OEXP is clearly the net
recipient of GRS funds.            From the budget identity —— eq. (4) —— we can

estimate the average effect of a small change in LSGRS on OEXP as:                    OEXP =
         —   iSAE                     + (1 + e)MREV =           —            —

(1 + .O1)(.09)      =   $1.21.28
     The "tax effort" component of revenue—sharing (e) has only tiny effects

on the state budget; the estimated coefficients are insignificant, except for

SWL, and the implied elasticities of spending and revenue with respect to e

never exceed .01.    What small budget effects result from an increase in the

effort rate favor SAE and OEXP.

     (2)    Categorical, Lump—Sum Aid.   There are three categorical, lump—sum

grants considered here, one for each expenditure category —— LSEA (education),

LSWA (welfare), and OFA (OExP). These grants are nominally restricted to be

spent only on the specified programs.       However, states can comply with the

terms of the grant by spending the aid dollar as specified but then cutting

back on their own expenditures on closely related state—funded projects.

Some, or perhaps even all, of the categorical aid dollars can thereby be

"released' for allocations elsewhere in the budget.       This is in fact what

happens with LSWA and LSEA assistance. A dollar of Federal lump—sum welfare

aid (LSWA) increases state welfare spending by only $.076, of which the state

pays only the fraction (1 — me) or $.03 (= .4 x .076). LSWA also lowers state

education aid spending by $.20. This decline in SAE is not surprising since

many of targeted programs in LSWA assistance are for low—income, school—age

children.   The total "released" dollars for each dollar of Federal LSWA is

$1.17, $.97 from welfare and $.20 from education. However, only $.12 of these

released dollars are allocated to revenue relief; 3SREV/aLSWA = —.12.     OEXP

receives the remaining $1.05.

     LSEA is somewhat more productive when it comes to keeping Federal aid

dollars within the target category, perhaps because a major component of LSEA

is Title I school assistance for low—income children and this program has been

closely monitored by Federal auditors.       Approximately, $.43 of each LSEA
                                             —25—



dollar remains in SAE; aSAE/aLSEA =           4329   Welfare spending rises by $.23 as

well, perhaps because of a regulatory spillover onto child welfare programs.

Not all of the LSEA dollars remain in human services, however. Each dollar of

aid increases education plus the state share of welfare spending by $.52

(    .43 + .23(1 —      mO) =    .43 + (.23 x .4)) so $.48 is allocated to tax relief

and OEXP. The coefficient of LSEA on SREV suggests tax relief receives $.39

per dollar of aid, leaving $.09 for OEXP.

      Other Federal aid (OFA) helps only OEXP. A dollar of OFA leads to a $.16

reduction in SAE, a $.057 reduction in SWL with a state share of $.025

(=   .057(1       — in0) = .057 x .4) and a $.005 rise in SREV; overall OEXP rises by

$1.19 (=      1   + .16 + .025 + .005).

      (3)         Categorical, Closed—ended Matching Aid.         A prominent form of
categorical Federal assistance is to require the state to "match" a fixed

amount of Federal aid with some corresponding, number of state dollars at a

given mark—up ——        e.g.,   $2 of state money for each dollar of Federal aid. (The

fact that the amount of Federal aid is fixed, distinguishes these programs as

"closed—ended" matching grants.)            The Federal hope is that these levered

dollars will stay within the program area. However, in the case of education

and welfare aid (school breakfast and lunch assistance and low—income

commodity assistance) there is only partial retention; again OEXP captures the

spillover.          The average, required mark—up of Federal aid dollars can be

estimated from the SREV equation as the increase in state revenues induced by

a dollar increase in CEM aid:             3SREVRCEM = .61 + .00035 • INC.      Evaluated

at the mean income in our sample (INC =         $2950/capita)   the implicit state match
                                             —26—



f or the CEM program is 1.64. The rate of mark—up rises with state income as

is in fact required by the Federal law for the programs in CEM.                For the

average income state, therefore, a dollar of Federal aid must            be matched by
$1.64 of state money. Thus $2.64 flows into the categorical program areas in

education and welfare.            Only $1.03 remains, however, $.98 in education

spending and $.05 in welfare assistance. OEXP captures the residual flow of

$1.64 (= 2.64 — .98 — .05(1 — mO) = 1.66 —          (.05   x .4)). It is clear that the

Federal match requirement brings more dollars into the target programs, but it

also provides state legislators with a reason to increase taxes and to

reallocate all of that increase to their favored programs in OEXP.

       (4)    Open—ended Matching Aid.        The most regulated of the Federal aid

programs is an open—ended matching grant which operates as a tax—price

subsidy. Aid       is   only received when dollars are spent on the targeted program,

and further, additional state spending is rewarded with additional Federal

aid.    The net effect of such assistance is to lower the per unit costs to

taxpayers of providing the aided service.             If m is the open—ended Federal

matching rate and 0 is the share of state spending covered by aid, then

(1 — mO)     is   the share of expenditures which must be paid by taxpayers. The

major open—ended matching grants now used by the Federal government are for

the state provision of welfare spending on AFtC and Medicaid. For all states

participating in the program, the rate in           varies from a low of .5 for the
richer states (INC )       national   average income) to a high of .78 for the poorest

states. The share of total welfare spending in AFDC and Medicaid (0)           is   .8

for states in our sample. We have estimated the effects of (1 — mO)           on state
                                           —27—



spending and revenues.30        Calculated at the means, the implied tax price

elasticities for (1 — mO) are + .22 for SAE (a positive cross—price effect),

—.17 for SWL (a negative own price effect), —.08 for OEXP (a negative

cross—price effect), and +.07 for SREV (implying a negative cross—price

elasticity of —.001 for private income). Welfare and education are (loosely

speaking) substitutes in the state budget, while welfare, private income, and

other expenditures are complements.          If states transfer more income to the

poor, they apparently transfer more income to other income classes also. The

transfers are facilitated by a reduction in the education budget and increased

Federal aid. In fact, the dollar flows to the middle and upper income groups

may exceed those to the poor. Again we do our calculations for the average

state. A rise In the average state's effective matching rate (in0) from .60 to

.615 will bring in $1/capita more in welfare matching aid. This additional

dollar will initially be spent on the targeted activity increasing state

welfare expenditures by $.34.           The additional $.34 of SWL brings in an

additional $.21 (= .615   •
                              .34)   of aid. As in   increases,   (1 — mO) falls and SAE

f ails too —— by approximately $.54.         SREV also falls by an estimated $.63.

OEXP rises, however, by $.78 ( $1 — 1SAE — SWL(1 — .615) ÷ SREV = $1 + .54
— .34(.385) — .63).    Again, other expenditures and tax relief are the favored

outlets for Federal assistance, even when that assistance Is targeted to the

poor.

        This pattern of state spending which allocates new, marginal dollars

towards OEXP is also observed in how states react to Federal assistance which

by—passes the state and is paid to local governments and to households
                                        —28—



directly. Such Federal aid will still be available to state legislators if

they are willing to tax back some or all of the aid through an increase in

state revenues. For the earned income tax credit (EITC) and food stamps (FS)

paid directly to low—income households, and for Federal impact school aid

(IMPA) paid to school districts, this seems to be what happens.        We do not

observe a statistically significant tax—back effect with low income housing

aid (LHA) paid to local governments. For a state with the average EITC grant

(     $2.91/capita),   a dollar of EITC assistance triggers a $.50 increase in

state revenues which Is allocated entirely to school aid ($.47) and state

welfare ($.25, of which the state pays .25(1 — me) = .25 x 4 = $.1O); here

OEXP seems to lose on average (—$.07).         There is a similar tendency to tax

back food stamp assistance.       A dollar of food stamp aid to the household

sector is offset in part by a $.69 increase in SREV which is spent on SAE

($34), on welfare ($.12, which requires $.05 from the state = .12(1 — mO) =

.12    x .4) and on OEXP ($.30).        School impact aid (IMPA) has the most

pronounced effect on SREV ——    $322   for each dollar of federal—to—local school

aid(!) —— and OEXP is a main beneficiary receiving $1.68 after the SAE ($1.16)

and SWL ($.95, with a state share = .95        x 4 = .38) allocations. We have
difficulty rationalizing the size of this effect of IMPA on SREV, however,

particularly since our earlier work (Craig—Ininan, 1982) for a shorter, but

largely overlapping, sample period (1965—1977) found a large, negative effect

of this aid on state taxes. We can only suggest a cautious use of the IMPA

results. Finally, a dollar of Federal—to—local housing aid (LHA) has a modest

positive, but not statistically significant, effect on SREV ($.12) and
                                       —29—



depressing, but not significant, effects on SAE (—$.76) and SWL (—$.32); if we

accept these coefficients as measuring average effects, OEXP spending rises by

$1.01 for each dollar of LHA. Over all four by—pass aid programs considered

here, a dollar of increased Federal aid to each program will stimulate a full

tax—back of $4.53, allocated $1.21 to SAE, $1.00 to SWL (of which the state

pays $.40 due to mO aid), and $2.92 to OEXP.

      Increases in average state income (INC) stimulate a larger state budget,

with low income assistance and "other expenditures" as the favored outlets. A

dollar of INC increases SREv by $.025, which induces a $.003 rise in SAE, a

$.008 rise in SWL (though the state share is only .0032), and a .019 rise in

OEXP. The private income elasticity of demand for state education assistance

is .13, for state welfare assistance is .45, for "other expenditures" is .26,

and for state revenues .32.        Our results also confirm the presence of a

flypaper effect on state budgets. Most all of private income stays in the

private sector; most all public aid dollars stay in the public sector.

     The non—aid variables included in the analysis to reflect across—state—

and—time changes in voter coalition bliss points and political structure

reveal no major surprises. The three tax price variables —— OLD, PRIV, and
FUll ——   are either insignificant or as in the case of FHH in the SWL equation,

significant and of the correct sign. The coefficients for the five "taste"
variables —— HS, KIDS, METRO, UE, MAN ——      reveal   a revenue—spending pattern
which favors OEXP and tax relief over human services (SAE, SWL) in those

states with a large number of existing manufacturing jobs, which are heavily

urbanized, with relatively high rates of unemployment (though SWL does
                                         —30—



increase in response to UE), fewer children per family, and more high school

graduates.3' These states tend to be the older, urbanized states of the east,

south and midwest.       One plausible explanation for this observed spending

pattern is that these are also the states under intense fiscal pressure as

they struggle to retain mobile capital and jobs. What business wants is tax

relief and "other expenditures', not school aid and welfare, and the states

seem to be responsive.

       The political structure variables —— R, P, WHT, and the individual state

constant terms —— show state fiscal policy is not responsive to the income

class divisions as measured here, once we have accounted for the effects of

average income.    While income class seems unimportant, racial divisions are

not.     As the percent of the state's population becomes more white, fewer

dollars are allocated to SAE and to SWL, the human service portion of the

state budget.     Quantitatively, the effects of major swings in the racial

composition of the state are important; states one standard deviation below

the mean percent white spend approximately $24/capita more on human services

and $13/capita less on OEXP than states one standard deviation above the mean
               32
percent white.     The individual state constant terms meant to capture the

idiosyncratic nature of state political structures are reported in Appendix B.

       As we emphasized in Section II, state budgetary politics is a dynamic

process.    Our results illustrate the importance of these dynamics.          First,

from the coefficient on TIME we observe a continual upward drift in real state

spending and revenue over time, favoring SAE ($6.64/capita per year) and OEXP

($3.20/capita per year =     ASREV   —   SAE —   ASWL(1   — mO)   =   10.21 — 6.64 —
                                        —31—



.92(.4)).    Secondly, our theory of budgetary politics predicts an important

role for the level of last year's services in this year's budgeting (the

status quo), and our empirical analysis confirms this prediction.         We have

modeled the dynamics of the political process by including lagged service

levels for education (PER_1, WAG_1, and NPEXP_1) and welfare (SWL_1) in each

of the three estimated budget equations; the lagged service variables are
                                               33
always statistically significant as a set.           Further, the implied dynamic

adjustment process has important implications for the final disbursement of

fiscal resources.    While the feedback effects of lagged school services on

state spending and taxes are modest with most effects of a fiscal change felt

in the first year, lagged welfare spending has a quantitatively important

impact ——   particularly   on SWL, SREV, and OEXP —— which takes from four to six
                           34
years to be fully felt.         There is an inertia in state welfare budgeting as

legislators seem reluctant to expand or cut welfare spending too quickly,

perhaps concerned about the reaction of neighboring states (see Grainlich,

1982). Table 2 summarizes our estimates of the equilibrium effects of changes

in each of the exogenous fiscal variables in our model allowing for the

dynamic adjustments to the budget through lagged education and welfare
services.35 The table reports the equilibrium effects of an additional $1 of

Federal assistance paid either directly to the states or as "by—pass"

assistance to households and local governments. The calculation for Federal

by—pass aid allocates $.25 to each of the four by—pass programs in our study

(EITC, FS, LHA and IMPA).        We also show the equilibrium allocation of an

additional dollar of state private income.          Qualitatively, the equilibrium

effects of aid and income parallel the impact effects described above:         (1)
                                         —32—



OEXP is generally favored, but (2) the more regulated is Federal aid, the more

likely it         is   to remain within the          target   expenditure category.

Quantitatively, the equilibrium effects of aid on the human resource portion

of the state budget exceed the impact effects of aid, primarily because of

lagged adjustments to welfare spending.         Positive "shocks" to the human

resource budget (via in, CEM, LSEA, LSWA, and INC) increase SAE and SWL over

time while negative shocks (via LSCRS and OFA) decrease SAE and SWL over time.

OEXP is largely unaffected; it is SREV which adjusts to the changes in SAE and

SWL.

       Overall,   both the impact and the dynamic equilibrium analyses of Federal

assistance to the state—local sector reveal the same essential pattern to

desired state spending:        Federal dollars which flow into the state via

grants—in—aid are allocated disproportionally towards OEXP and away from the

human services components ——      SAE   and SWL ——    of   the state budget.   It is

important to know why.          This analysis cannot answer that question ——

structural,   not reduced form, models are needed —— but we will offer one

hypothesis which, on Its face, we find persuasive. Like their counterparts in

Washington, state legislators are rewarded with re—election when they deliver

publicly funded programs to their constituents and when those additional

public dollars can be explicitly linked to the efforts of the elected

off icial.3       Public expenditures which are most conducive to district—by—

district, constituent—by—constituent allocations are those outlays which can

be allocated by legislative or bureaucratic choice, not formula. Both welfare

assistance and school aid are disbursed according to pre—established
                                        —33—



formulas.37 The real battles for state dollars are fought in the non—formula

expenditures ——   that   is, in OEXP. Thus the more money to OEXP the better, for

it makes all legislators better off.38 The major state services provided by

OEXP dollars include state highway maintenance (potholes and jobs), state

hospitals and medical centers          (health care and jobs),       universities

(educational opportunity and jobs), parks (recreation and jobs), and state

bureaucracies (services and jobs). Each of these programs permits discretion

in dollar allocations. From these OEXP programs, alternative omnibus spending

bills can be fashioned to insure majority approval of the state budget. OEXP

is the grease or "pork" which keeps the wheels of state politics in motion.

In such a world, it is not surprising that Federal aid dollars are
re—channeled whenever possible into "other expenditures".

     Nor is It surprising that those interested in reducing the size of

government should wish to reduce and/or restructure the Federal aid system.

President Reagan's "new federalism" reforms can be viewed as one attempt to

curtail the flow of Federal aid dollars into state treasuries.         The likely

impact of the Reagan reforms on state budgets is described in Section V. The

President will not be disappointed with the results.



V.   The Budgetary Effects of the New Federalism


     President Reagan's new federalism is a three step reform package whose

primary intention —— Washington rhetoric aside ——      is   to reduce Federal and

state—local government spending.      Step (1) of the reform Is to turn the AFDC

and food stamp programs over to the states for financing and administration.
                                      —34—



In step (2) the Federal government will assume full responsibility for

Medicaid.     Step (3) gives the state financial responsibility for sixty—one

domestic aid programs in exchange for a lump—sum transfer per capita from a

newly established trust fund, with trust fund payments reduced gradually

until, by 1992, no further Federal lump—sum aid will be paid to the states.

Table 3 summarizes the predicted equilibrium effects of these reforms on the

allocation of state budgets to SAE, SWL, OEXP, and SREV.

     The baseline for our simulation is the "average" in each budget category

for our sample states in 1980; see Table 3.        This average pre—reforin budget

for 1980 is then adjusted by the equilibrium budgetary responses to changes in

Federal grants—in—aid for each of two major components of the new federalism

reform:     the welfare exchange of AFDC and food stamps for Medicaid and the

exchange of trust fund aid for 61 categorical programs.               First, the
simulations assume each component of the reform is done separately —— the

columns labelled "welfare exchange" and "tust fund exchange" in Table 3 ——

and then simulations are performed for the entire new federalism package with

full trust fund aid (the column labelled "new federalism, 1988") and then

without trust fund aid (labelled "new federalism, 1992+").              For each
simulation, we assume that (1) the effects of requiring state responsibility

is equivalent to setting Federal aid equal to zero for the affected programs,

(2) trust fund aid is equivalent to a lump—sum grant—in—aid, and (3) the

Federal assumption of Medicaid payments will induce state budget responses

equivalent to those now observed for a similar existing Federal—to—poor—

household aid program, food stamps.     We also assume the earned income tax
                                              39
credit (EITC) will be unaffected by reform.

      the state budget.
                                         —35—



     The transfer of food stamp aid and AFDC to the states and of Medicaid to

the Federal level is functionally equivalent to setting the welfare matching

rate (in)   to zero, food stamp aid (FS) to zero, and establishing Medicaid
assistance as a Federal—to—household by—pass aid program.            The combined

effects of these reforms are dominated by the change in the welfare matching

rate from in   = .6   to m = 0.   Equilibrium welfare spending falls by 65%. State

own revenues rise somewhat to offset the fall in Federal—to—state aid; these

dollars along with the state dollars released from the welfare budget are

allocated to education aid and other state expenditures.          The exchange of

trust—fund aid for categorical aid has a somewhat different pattern of

effects, and favors tax relief. State assumption of Federal categorical aid

implies all Federal—to—state aid (LSEA, CEM, LSWA, OFA) and all Federal—to—

local aid (IMPA, LEA) in our model now receive zero funding. In their place,

states receive a lump—sum grant from the Federal trust fund approximately
                                               40
equal to the value of the lost categorical aid.        Under this component of the

new federalism package, state education and welfare spending fall, other

expenditures remain the same, and state revenues and Federal aid decline.

Again, we observe that once the categorical "strings" of Federal human

resource aid are untied, dollars leave this portion of the state budget; in

this case they go to state tax relief.           Reagan's new federalism package

combines the welfare exchange and the trust fund exchange.          The policies'

joint effects are not additive, however, because of the interaction of aid and

spending levels in the equilibrium model. When full trust—fund aid is paid to

the states (the new federalism to 1988), SAE and OEXP are the clear net
                                     —36—



gainers, while state taxes rise and state welfare falls to almost nothing.

The welfare exchange plus the strong negative effect of LSGRS on state welfare

spending (see Tables 1 and 2) are responsible for this large fall in SWL.

When Federal trust fund aid is removed in 1992, we observe an increase in

state own revenues, SAE and SWL, and a sizeable fall in OEXP.

     While the exact dollar predictions in Table 3 must be interpreted with

care, we feel the overall impression left by these simulations is valid. In

the end, the new federalism reforms will reduce welfare spending, increase

education spending, reduce state expenditures on "other" goods and services,

and increase state revenues.      The combined size of Federal—state—local

government will also decline.   Though state (and possibly local) government

revenues increase (by about $30/capita in Table 3), Federal spending is

reduced by the amount of saved Federal aid ($107.30/capita) less any increases

in Federal Medicaid spending ( $17/capita, if 1980 average state Medicaid

spending is maintained).

     On balance, it appears the new federalism of President Reagan will

achieve its objectives. Government, and particularly pork—barrel government,

is smaller.   The possible price we pay is less public assistance for low
                     41
income households.



VI. A Concluding Comment


     The U.S. federalist public economy has evolved to the point where today

the Federal government is the primary provider of public dollars and the

state—local sector is the primary provider of public services. There are good
                                    —37—



reasons to doubt the efficiency of such a fiscal structure, particularly if

the wedge between the revenue and spending responsibility is large. Grants—

in—aid is the source of that wedge. Efforts to reform our current system of

grants—in—aid requires a careful understanding of the effects of aid on state

and local fiscal choice: first, to answer the question of whether Federal aid

is a cause of inefficiency, and if so, to then fashion a reform policy to

improve resource allocations.      The formal analysis of state—local fiscal

choice must recognize the fact that state and local governments are political

Institutions, however, and that the grants—in—aid system is an integral part

of that institutional structure. This first analysis confirms the importance

of grants as a structural determinant of state budgetary choice.        The task

before us now is to reveal more fully just how this structure works and to

exploit that knowledge to improve public sector resource allocations.

 1. For a desription of the historical evolution of our federalist public

     economy, see Scheiber (1966).

 2. The Federal share of all non—defense, government spending has grown from

     28.5% in 1902 to 48.8% by 1983. The source of this growth has been the

     increase in federally funded transfer programs to families and to

    governments. The state—local sector has always been the main producer of

    public services.        The state—local sector's share of non—transfer,

    non—defense government spending has grown from 71% in 1902 to 84.6% by

     1983.      Financial control has become more centralized; production has

    become less centralized. Bridging the widening gap between the financing

    and provision of public services are grants—in—aids; see Inman (1985).
3. See Inman (1985).

4. See Inman (1985) for some thoughts on this issue based upon the political

     history of our existing fiscal system.

5. The level of free g (             ) made        available by lump—sum aid is

     (z/n)/c(1 — m).   As z dollars of aid buys z/c(1 — m) units of x and x

     provides x/n units of g,    =   (x/n)   =   (z/n)/c(1   —   m).   The assumption in

     this calculation is that expenditures from z aid can be "leveraged"

     further by matching aid.

6. See the work of Bergstrom and Goodman (1973) and Ininan (1978).

7. See Inman (1979) for a review of the U.S. experience and Jackinan and

     Papadachi (1981) and Pomxnerehne (1978) for examples of applications of

     the median voter model to fiscal choice in European communities.

..   The theory predicts that the effects of I and (z/n) work only through

     full fiscal income, I.     While a dollar more of I increases I by one

     dollar, a dollar more of (z/n) Increases I by it(b/B), which generally is

     not equal to 1.    If 1T(b/B) < 1, a dollar of private income (I) should

     have a greater stimulative effect on the demand for g than a dollar of

     lump—sum aid per capita (z/n).     If x(bIB)     E 1,       then I and (z/n) should

     have equal effects on g.

9. Two   alternative   explanations have been offered for the flypaper effect.

     Moffitt (1984) argues that the flypaper effect may be due to a

     misspecification of the resident's budget constraint by failing to allow

     for nonlinearities of the constraint, e.g., the kink in the constraint at

     point C in Figure 1.   Moffitt explicitly allows for such kinks and bends
 in the resident's budget constraint when estimating a budgetary model for

 state welfare programs and finds that after such a correction the effects

of the lump—sum component of such aid cannot be statistically
distinguished from the effects of residential income, I.e., there is no

flypaper effect. While such nonhinearities are important in welfare aid,

and Moffitt is clearly correct to allow for these, most other Federal and

state aid programs for which the flypaper effect has been found do not

involve nonlinear budget constraints over the relevant range of local
fiscal choice.   For most programs, full fiscal income, I, or its
components I and (z/n), are the correct independent variables.

     Hamilton (1983) has also argued that the flypaper effect Is due to

an error in specification, now of the technology of local service

provision. Resident income plays two roles, not one. Income defines the

resident's available resources, hut income also is a determinant (or a

very good proxy for the true determinants) of local service production.

It is generally less expensive to provide a given level of services, g,

in rich towns than in poor towns.   Local service costs (c) depend on I;

as I increases, c declines.    Resident income therefore plays two roles:

(1) as a part of full fiscal income (I) and (2) as a part of the

production function and local service costs (c). If income increases and

c falls, then the local tax price falls, and we demand more g (Hamilton's

output effect). But the fall in c means it is cheaper to produce any g

and thus we need spend less on public inputs (Hamilton's substitution

effect).   If the substitution effect dominates the output effect, then
          the total effect of I through the production relationship on public input

          use will be negative.   Thus while resident income and lump—sum aid may

          have nearly identical effects on local spending because of their effects

          on full fiscal income (I), resident income may have an additional,

          possibly negative effect because of its role in the production of local

          services. The effect of I on local spending will be less than the effect

          of (z/n) on local spending.       Hamilton tests his model for plausible

          parameter values and finds that it accounts for about half of the

          observed flypaper effects. But "the parameter values required to explain

          the entire flypaper effect appear to be implausible" (Hamilton, 1983, p.

          355).   Hamilton's hypothesis, while interesting, cannot really save the

          resident utility maximization explanation of state—local fiscal choice.

          Something more is needed.

          politician—bureaucrat behavior.

    12.   This particular positioning of each coalition's preferred allocations is

          only illustrative; the analysis which follows holds equally well for

          alternative combinations of preferences.    Implicit in this particular

          configuration is the view that education and a concern for the less

          fortunate are both normal goods with respect to income, and that all

          income classes also have a social insurance motive for supporting low

          income assistance programs.   Even Boeing engineers have need for food
     stamps every once in awhile. The social insurance motive dominates the

     altruism motive for the poor leading to a high welfare demand for this

     coalition, while the altruim motive is relatively strong for the upper

     income groups inducing a relatively high demand for welfare by this

     coalition. The blue collar middle class, motivated by neither altruism

     nor a need for public income insurance, has a low demand for welfare.

13. The relative voting strength of the three coalitions need not be equal

     for the analysis which follows. All that really is required is that no

     one coalition hold an absolute majority by itself, for then the analysis

     reduces to a study of a dictator and the fiscal model behind equation (1)

    will be sufficient.

14. An example of such a jurisdictional structure are special districts which

     can decide allocations on only one policy dimension, taking the

    allocation of other special districts as given. In our example, a school

    district decides on g1 and a welfare district sets            We will not
                                                            g2.

    consider the interaction between special districts which sets the joint

    allocation of g1 and g2, but see Shepsle (1979) or Inman (1984).

15. A fully open amendment process where any proposal can be considered would

    undo the committee and jurisdictional structures and return the decision

    process to the majority rule only case and its prediction of no stable

    equilibrium.

16. Points off the contract line will always be rejected in favor of points

    on the contract line by the R—P coalition, so we need consider only

    points on the line.
17. If the    status   quo point is not fixed then a new equilibrium point will

      emerge. Specifically, if the budgeting process is a dynamic one in which

      the last period's budget is the next period's status quo, then it is

      possible to show that the group which controls the agenda can move the

      budget allocation arbitrarily close to its ideal point over time. For

      example, if we repeat the analysis above using c* as the status quo, the

      new, next period allocation will be on the R—P contract line closer to

      the ideal point, R, than **•

18.   See also Denzau and Parks (1979) who provide a general treatment of the

      problem of specifying voter preferences for policy outcomes from a basic

      preference structure over primary goods and services.

19. The analysis here assumes the coalitions in conflict are three consumer

      groups who have demands for the public services.          While this is
      reasonable, the model can be extended to allow industry groups or even

      public employees to have a direct say in the final allocations.       To

      formally include such groups in the analysis we must define their

      preferences for outcomes.    Niskanen (1975), Innian (1981), and Courant,

      Gramlich, and Rubinfeld (1979) offer such models for public employees,

      while Stigler (1971) and Peltznian (1976) have specified profit
      maximization models of firm or industry preferences for public service

      allocations.

20. The Romer—Rosenthal analysis can be seen as a special case of this more

      general structure.      Specifically, Romer—Rosenthal consider the one

      jurisdiction case in which the high—spending coalition is the
     agenda—setter.   In terms of our analysis, this corresponds to Figure 3

     with the rich coalition as the agenda—setter.      The allocation of c*

     results which exceeds the allocation which would have emerged from a

    median voter model (point ii).    Point , our status quo, corresponds to
     Romer—Rosenthal' s so—called •reveLsion level".

21. See Reischauer (1975) for estimates of e.

22. Our original definition of the tax price in Section II above assumed all

     taxpayers used the public service. A simple re—calculation of p will

     show that if n people pay taxes (so B • n is still the aggregate tax

     base) but only u people use the public service (so g =    x/u),   then the

    definition of p becomes v(b/B)(u/n)(1 — m)c, where the new term (u/n) is

     the percent of population who use the public service.     As PRIV rises,

     (u/n) falls and the tax price for education falls, while if OLD or FHH

     rises, (u/n) rises and the tax price for welfare rises.

23. Aid programs explicitly for the elderly, such as Social Security and

    Medicare, have been excluded. Only means tested programs are included in

    order to confine the analysis to political choice over a common set of

    goals.   Similarly, unemployment and training programs such as CETA have

    been excluded because they are motivated by a different set of coalition

    determinants.

24. Since our continuous aid, income, and demographic variables are likely to

    capture most systematic differences across states in coalitions'
    preferences —— the bliss points —— we are reasonably confident that our

    state dummy variables will capture the systematic effects of state
     political and institutional differences on fiscal allocations. Exploring

     exactly what these differences might be is the task for later research.

25. The cost—of—living index used in this study is an update of an index we

     created In our previous study of Federal—state—local finance of

     education. See Craig—Inman (1982, p. 545).

26. See Zellner (1962) and Hausinan (1978).

27. For specialists in state—local finance, our reduced—form equations will

     appear (as they are) to be "old wine in a new bottle". The variables are

     familiar ones used in most previous budgetary models. We have given them

    a potentially new interpretation, however, an interpretation which we

    find more compelling for reasons outlined in Section II above.

         One note of caution must be sounded before presenting our results.

    Like all reduced form budget studies, we must assume that a change in a

    policy variable ——    e.g.,   Federal aid —— does not alter the basic

    political structure which defines spending or revenues. For example,

    less Federal aid for the poor does not lead to more or less political

    Influence for the poor in state budgeting. If so, the reduced form model

    will be misspecified. The assumption of no structural change is probably

    valid for small adjustments in Federal assistance, or for the first few

    years following large changes in assistance.        Our results must be

    interpreted with this caveat in mind.

28. All marginal effects are calculated at the means. The decision to use a

    logarithmic specification for LSGRS reflects the fact such aid has

    generally been found to have nonlinear effects on spending and revenues;
    see Inman (1979).

29. LSEA is comparable to "pass—through education aid" of our previous paper

    (Craig—Inman, 1982). Comparing the results here to those of our earlier

    paper shows this aid has a smaller effect on SAE than previously

    estimated. Additional years and a more complete specification in this

    study lead us to favor these results.

30. The estimation of the effects of matching aid is problematic.         The

    voters' budget constraints need not be straight lines, but can have

    complicated "kinks" depending on whether the state enrolls under one aid

    formula or another.     The AFDC formula is a subtle combination of

    open—ended and close—ended grants and requires a rather involved

    nonlinear estimation procedure; see Moffitt (1984).         The Medicaid

    formula, however, does not involve such "kinks" and by 1974 most states

    were using this simpler aid formula.     We have chosen to restrict our

    analysis to the sample of states which use the Medicaid formula, and to

    then address the problem of selection bias such a restricted sample may

    impose upon our results. We have adopted the procedure of Olsen (1980)

    for the correction of selection bias. In the SAE and SWL equations the

    variable to correct for selection bias was not significant, implying no

    bias.   The variable was significant in the SREV equation, though the

    degree of bias in coefficients was small.       We could not apply the

    procedure to all years in our original sample, however, because of data

    limitations.   We have chosen, therefore, to present the uncorrected

    results in Table 1, under the (largely substantiated) assumption that the
    bias will be small.

31. OEXP will rise if the decline in SAE and SWL dominate any decline in

    SREV.

32. The mean percent white for our sample is 90.07 (s.e. =   8.83).   The change

    in percent white from a low state to a high state is 17.66 percent

    inducing a change in SAE of —$16.42, a change in SWL of —$7.24, and a

    change in SREV of —$6.53.     The resulting change in OEXP from the state

    budget identity is $12.79 (= t.SREV — ASAE — (1 — mO)SWL).

33. The fact that education services are provided by local school districts

    leads us to use local school personnel per enrollee (PER), local school

    payroll per employee (WAG), and non—personnel expenditures per enrollee

     (NPER) as our measures of education services. State welfare services as

    social insurance or as a redistributive public good are assumed to be

    available to all residents equally, so lagged SWL is used to measure

    welfare service levels.

            An F test as to the joint significance of lagged PER, WAG, NPEXP,

    and SWL in the SAE, SWL and SREV equations leads us to reject the null

    hypothesis of no significance in each case. The value of the respective

    F statistics are 6.33 (for SAE), 160 (for SWL) and 17.54 (for SREV).

34. We have calculated the dynamic structure for changes in state education

     aid using a local fiscal model previously estimated in Craig—Inman (1982)

    which specifies the effects of SAE on PER, WAG, and NPEXP. A change in

     SAE_1 changes PER1, WAG1, and NPEXP which in turn influence SAE, SWL,

     and SREV today.    Tracing through the dynamic influences of last year's
     SAE on this year's SAE, SWL, and SREV, we can estimate the influence of

     one dollar of SAE_1 as .059 on SAE, as .007 on SWL, and .134 on SREV.

     Thus the dynamic effects of last year's state education aid on this

     year's state budget are small. These results should be contrasted to the

     effect of a dollar of SWL_1       SAE (.17), SWL (.75) and SREV (.47).

    These large marginal effects will take several years before adjustment is

     complete.

35. The equilbrum affects of exogenous aid changes on SAE, SWL, and SREV

    were estimated by solving this three equation dynamic model:


          SAE = X + .17   SWL_1 + .059 SAE_1

          SWL = 8X + e75 SWL1 + .007 SAE1 , and

          SREV = OX + .47 SWL1 + .134 SAE1


    where the impact coefficients 4, 8, 0 for the exogenous aid variable CX)

    and the coefficients on SWL_1 are as reported in Table 1, and the

    coefficients on SAE_1 are as reported in footnote 34 above. The dynamic

    equilibrium of aid changes on OEXP were calculated from the state budget

    identity. The interpretation of these dynamic results is subject to the

    caveats of footnote 27 above.

36. See for example Fiorina (1977).

37. How these formulas are chosen is itself an important question which we

    hope to address in future research.

38. The presumption here is that there is no effective tax relief coalition

    within the state which can divert dollars from OEXP to tax relief on a
      regular basis.     The sporadic success of the state tax limitation

      movements seems to be evidence on this point.

39. Before discussing the simulation results we must emphasize that the

      numbers in Table 3, which look precise, are not.         In calculating

      equilibrium effects we used all estimated aid coefficients in our model,

      many of which are statistically insignificant (see Table 1).    Further,

      the policy changes we are simulating can hardly be considered "small"

      changes which fall within the range of current sample variation. Whether

      the observed fiscal behavior holds outside the sample is an unanswered

      question. At best Table 3 provides only a first impression of what may

      happen under the new federalism.

40. The new federalism reform agreed to pay approximately 90% of the lost

      categorical aid, which was about $73/capita. Thus lump—sum aid from the

      trust fund will be $65.94.

41.   It is also possible the form of the remaining assistance will change.

      See Craig and Kohlhase (1985).

42. The Reagan Administration's reform is only one alternative. See Gratalich

      (1985) for another proposal of merit.

*   Indicates   significance at the 5% level.

a These estimates are from the model presented in Table 1.  Seven states are
  excluded: Alabania is the base state, Arizona and Texas have no
  observations, Missouri and South Carolina have only one observation, and
  Alaska and Hawaii have unique fiscal situations which suggest excluding them
  from our general analysis.
