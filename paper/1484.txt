          This paper presents closed—form solutions for the investment and

valuation of a competitive firm with a Cobb-Douglas production function

and   a constant elasticity adjustment cost function in the presence of
stochastic prices    for output and inputs. The value of the firm is a

linear function of the capital stock. The optimal rate of investment

is an increasing function of the slope of the value function with respect

to the capital stock (marginal q).

          A mean preserving spread of the distribution of future price increases

investment. An increase in the      scale   of the random component of a price

can   increase, decrease or not affect the rate of     investment depending on

the   sign of the covariance of this price with a weighted average of all
prices.

1. Introduction


        In   this paper we   develop a stochastic model         of the production and invest-
ment behavior of a competitive fiat and use this model to examine the                   effects

of uncertainty on the optimal             rate of investment.       ihe framework for this
analysis is a stochastic version of the q theory of                     investment. Following a

line    of        presented by !iynes (19361, Tobin (1969] defined (average) q
             argument

as the ratio of the market value of a fiat to the replacement cost of its cap-
ital    and then argued that investment is an increasing function of q.                 A more
rigorous foundation for the           q   theory of investment is based on the adjustment
cost    literature developed by Eisner         and Strots (1963]. Lucas (19671. Gould
(1968] •      and Treadway    (19691. It has been shown by flussa (19771 • Abel (1979.
19821 and Yoshikawa [19801 that in the presence of convex adjustment costs.
investment is an increasing funotion of the shadow price of installed capital
(marginal q). ibre recently, ffayashi (1982] has shown that under certain
linear homogeneity and price-taking assumptions, the shadow price of installed
capital is equal to the market value of               the fiat divided by the replacement

cost of       its capital; that is, marginal q equals average q.              In situations in

which   marginal q and   average q are        not equal, it is           marginal q which is
relevant for investment.


       The literature cited above has developed the q theory in a deterministic

frariavork     with adjustment costs.               tttothastic models of inveatnent in the
preserce of adjustieut   costs   have     beer    develoue1   by Lucas   and 'rescott f1971]   ,
artman     [1972), finriyck   [l92]   ,   and    Abel I93} . !Jsin       a discrete—tine sto-

chastic model, Fartmar showed that for a conretitive firm                     with constant
returns to scale, increased uncertainty about future output prices or factor

prices leads to increased     current     investment. Thre recently, Pindyck            [i92]
and Abel [1983] have analyzed investment behavior in continuous time models in
which the price of output evolves according to an Ito process, and Abel demon-

strated that artman's results carry over to continuous time. This paper

extends Abel [19831 by incorporating several variable factors of production,

with stochastic prices, and analyzes the effects of increased uncertainty. Py

extending the model to include several stochastic prices, we                are   led to exam-

ine different types of increases in uncertainty. A payoff to this extension

is that we find that different types of (mean—preserving) increases in uncer-

tainty can have qualitatively different effects on the rate of investment.


       In analyzing the effects of increased uncertainty about prices, we exam-

ine two types of increase in uncertainty: (1) a mean—preserving spread, and

(2) an increase in scale. Althoug. an increase h! scale is a mean—preserving

spread for a scalar random variable, we               show that   for a raultivariate random

variable, an increase in scale is not, in general, a mean—preserving spread.

More  importantly, we show that these two types of increase in uncertainty
about prices have different effects on investment. As shown by rartman
[1972], a mean-preserving spread tends to increase investtnent; however, an
increase in the scale of the random component of a single price will raise,
lower,   or not affect the rate of investment depending on whether the covari—
ance of this price with a weighted average of all prices is positive, nega-
tive, or zero.

         Section   2 develops the model of the competitive firm       and.   discusses the

 stochastic processes for the output price and the factor prices. The                strategy
 of the paper is to restrict the specification of technology enough (constant

 elasticity) so that we can obtain explicit solutions for            investment,     i'arginal

q     and the market value of the firm. We present       these solutions and provide an

economic      interpretation for them in Section 3. In Section 4             we   define and
analyze the effects of two alternative types of increase in uncertainty.                  The
effects of increased uncertainty on the required rate of return are discussed
in Section 5. Concluding remarks are presented in Section 6.


2. The Model of the Firm

        Consider a competitive firm with a neoclassical production function
F(Xi,...            E) where X., i = ?,...,n, is the amount of the ith variable
factor    used at time t and      is the amount    of capital used at time      t.   Let Pt
denote the price         of output at time t and let      w, i =     i,...,n,     denote the

price of the ith variable factor at time t.          The firm can accumulate capital

by undertaking gross investment It at a cost w
                                                         n+1,t C(T t ), where w n+1,t    is a

multiplicative shock to the adjustment cost function. Polloving the adjust-

ment cost literature, we assume that C(I) is an increasing convex function

(C' > 0, C" > 0) and that C(Q) =        0.   The accumulation of capital     is given by


(1)                                dV =        — 5T)dt
where S is the constant proportional rate of depreciation.


        The price of output, the prices of the variable factors, and the multi-

plicative adjustment cost shock are generated by          Ito   processes. To econor'ize
on    notation, we let   w0   denote   the price of output Pt and specify the evolu—

Fquation         (6) has a simple economic interpretation. The                       term in         square brack-

ets on the right hand side of (6) is the net cash flow                                   over      a small interval

dt of time and the term dV is the change in the value of the firm.                                         Equation

(6)     simply         states   that the expected. rate of           return on the firm (net cash flow

plus capital gain divided by the value                     of the      firm)       must be equal to the
discount      rate r.

       To calculate dV              we use Ito's Lemma to          obtain

The    noni inear partial differential equation in (9) is the Deliman equation.
Tn general, the ellran equation cannot be solved explicitly. The strategy in
this paper is to restrict the specification of technology enough to obtain a
closed form solution to the neilman equation.

        In order to make the Deilman equation easily solvable we assine that' the

production function is Cobb—Douglas and that the adjustment cost function

C(I) has a constant elasticity. Specifically

         The   optimal rate of investment is found by                                      differentiating (9) with

respect        to I and setting the derivative equal to zero. Using the fact that

               f3Ir
                the optimal rate of investment satisfies                                                     =    from

present value of the marginal revenue products of capital. Since the firm is

itdependent of               and the slope of the value function is independent of

4. The F.ffects of jjn tincertainty

        In this section we examine the effects of increased uncertainty on the

optimal rate of investment and on the market value of the firm.                                   In a
discrete—time                            [1972] has shown that if
                    model, flartman
                                                                             wj,    i=0,..., n+1,

undergoes     a mean preserving spread, then there is an increase in the rate of

investment. In a continuous time model with a single variable factor of pro-

duction, Abel [1983] has shown that Hartman's result continues to hold.


        In. this section we extend the results of Abel               [1983] to a model with
several (n+2) random variables.                   The extension is non—trivial as explained

below.    ¶ie consider       two    types   of increases in uncertainty:                (1)   a   mean

preserving spread (MPS); and (2)            an   increase in the     scale   of one of    the   random
                                           — 13   —




variables (IS). In the case of a single random variable, an increase in scale
is a mean preserving spread.              ITowever, with several random variables, an
increase in the scale of one variable is a mean preserving spread if and only
if that variable is uncorrelated with all other random variables; if the vari-
able whose scale is increased has a nonzero covariance with aw other random
variable, then an increase in scale is S a mean preserving spread.

      The effects of an lIPS increase in uncertainty differ fran the effects of
an IS increase in uncertainty. We will show that, consistent with Fartman's
findings, an PPS increase in uncertainty will increase investment.                  However,
the effects on investment of an IS increase in the uncertainty associated with
                                                        n     a1

on whether this covariance is positive, negative, or zero, an IS increase in
uncertainty will increase, decrease or leave unchanged the rate of investment.

      We will examine the effects on investment of increasing uncertainty hold-
ing constant the current values of wi,. Since investment is an increasing
function of            we can focus on the effects of uncertainty on              For given
values of wi, i a 0,...,            n, the effects on       and    investment can be deter-
mined simply by determining the effects on pa1: the effects on                   and invest—
nent are in the same direction as the effects on         pa1.


      We will first compare optimal investment under certainty and under uncer-
tainty.    In all cases we will examine changes in uncertainty which leave

           a .    t,   uncharged. Observe from (4) that !tt(wi5) is independent of

all       and   all         Therefore, the certainty case relevant for comparison to

ax uncertainty case is obtained simply by setting all ai equal              to   zero. Fran
(lEe) it follows that             (and hence      and       is greater wader     uncertainty

Proof.     See Appendix C.



       If we let x. =          and m = n,        then (19) follows immediately fran Lemma 2
(provided       that there is not perfect correlation among all dZ.). Hence, as

shown by Hartman [1972] and Abel [19831 the optimal rate of investment is

higher under uncertainty than under certainty.



4.1 r1ean Preserving Spread


       We follow Vartman's extension to several random variables of the

Pothschild—Stiglitz [19701 definition of a mean preserving spread. Specifi-

cally, if x is a random vector and if u is a random vector (with the same

dimension as x) such that H(ux) =                0,    then the distribution of the random vec-

tor y =   x+u is a mean preserving spread of the distribution of x.                         Observe

that the covariance matrix of y exceeds the covariance matrix of x by a nonne-

gative definite matrix (we all ow some elements of u to be nonstochastic)
                                                                           —

4.2 Increase in Scale

        Consider a scalar random variable Z                                with mean Z. We            will say that the
scalar        random variable y represents an increase in                                      scale for the random vari-
able Z,       if   y—Z = (1+b)(Z—Z)                for      some constant h >             0.      Thus     from (2) an IS

         At
        first glance it may appear inconsistent that the effect on investment
of an ?'PS increase in uncertainty is unambiguously positive, whereas the
effect on investment of an IS increase in uncertainty can be positive, nega-
 tive, or zero.               These two findings are reconciled by the fact that, in gen-
eral, an IS increase in uncertainty is not an T'PS increase in uncertainty.
Only if        is uncorrelated with all O, j     I, is it the case that an IS

      In this section we              have examined two different concepts of increasing
uncertainty in a multivariate context: an PS increase in uncertainty and an

IS   increase in uncertainty. Ue have shown that an PS increase in                                r.neertainty

 uncertainty will raise, lower or leave unchanged the rate of investment
 depending   on whether a certain covariance is positive, negative, or zero.


        As a final comment on the effects of uncertainty, it should be emphasized

 that it is uncertainty of relative prices which has an effect on investment.

 If all w are perfectly (positively) correlated and have the sane propor-

 tional variance, then all relative prices                are non—stochastic. In this

 case, the rate of investment under uncertainty is the same as under certainty.

under     the assumption of ri sk—neutral ity.    In particul ar, we have assumed that
the required rate of return on the firm's equity, r, remains unchanged when
the uncertainty of output price and factor prices is changed. It should be
noted that risk—neutrality         se is not required for the invariance of r with
respect   to changes   in uncertainty. r!ore generally, in the traditional capital

asset pricing model, the required rate of return on a        firm   is independent    of
the   variance of its own prices (output prices and factor prices) if the rate

of return on the firm is uncorrel ated with the return on       the   market portfol io.

In the context of more recent asset pricing models of Lucas (197) and Breeden

(1979), the required rate of return on a firm will be independent of the vari-

ances of prices if the rate of return on           the   firm is uncorrelated with the

marginal utility of consunpti.on.        Thus, risk—neutral itv            se is     not

required for the results in this parer to hold.


      If we drop the assumption that the return on the finn is uncorrelated

with the market portfolio (or with the narginal utility of consiniption), then
                                        —20—


the   required rate of return on the firm is an increasing function of the
covariance of the firm's return with the return on the market portfol io. If
the increase in price uncertainty causes this covariance to inc-:ase, then the
requi red rite of return, also increases which tends to decrease both                and
investment.     Alternatively, if the increase in price uncertainty leads to a

decrease in the relevant covariance, then the required rate of return

decreases so that       and investment each tend to increase.


       It is clear that to reach any conclusions about the effect of uncertainty

on the required rate of return we would       have   to impose some structure on the

covariance of the rate of return on the firm               return on the
                                                  and the rate     of

market portfolio (or the marginal utility of consinption). The results in
earlier sections can be used to      calculate the random component of the rate of

return on the firm.         Powever, without developing   a   complete   general equili—

briwn dynamic stochastic model, we have tremendous latitude in specifying a

stochastic process for the rate of return on the market             portfolio and thus
could "derive"    results which show the   required rate of return increasing or
decreasing    in response to an increase in uncertainty.


      The analysis of this paper is    explicitly partial equilibrium in nature.
We have      argued above that to reach any conclusions about the effect of

increased   uncertainty on   the required rate of return        (without,    in effect,
being free to assume the conclusion by strategically specifying the stochastic
process for the rate of return on the market portfol io) would require          a   gelt—

eral equilibrium model.         Of course, in a general equilibrium framework, the

analysis   of uncertainty    should focus not on the effects of     price   uncertainty
but rather on the        effects of uncertainty about preferences and technology.

Such analysis is beyond the scope of this raper.

6. roncludjnr remarks


     Ye   have analyzed the   optimal   rroduct ion and invest'ient behav ior of a corn—
netitive firm facing random prices for outtut and factors of vroduction. Py
restricting the production function to be Cobb—)ouglas and the adjustment
technology to have constant elasticity, we were able to obtain closed—form
solutions for investment, marginal q and the market Value of the firm.               In
particular,    the market value of the firm is a linear function of the firm's

capital stock; investment is an increasing function of the slope of this value

function.


     Using the closed—form solution for the optimal rate of investment, we

examined the effects on investment of two           alternative   types of increase in

uncertainty about the random vector of prices.              The effect of a mean—
preserving spread is to increase investment,               Uowever,   the effect of an

increase in the scale of the random component of a single price is to

increase, decrease, or leave unchanged the rate of investment depending on

whether the covariance of this price with a (geometric) weighted, average of

all prices is positive, negative, or zero.
