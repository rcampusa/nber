                                             ABSTRACT

Scholarly work seeking to understand academics’ commercial activities often draws on abstract notions
of the academic reward system and of the representative scientist. Few scholars have examined whether
and how scientists’ motives to engage in commercial activities differ across fields. Similarly, efforts
to understand academics’ choices have focused on three self-interested motives – recognition, challenge,
and money – ignoring the potential role of the desire to have an impact on others. Using panel data
for a national sample of over 2,000 academics employed at U.S. institutions, we examine how the
four motives are related to commercial activity, measured by patenting. We find that all four motives
are correlated with patenting, but these relationships differ systematically between the life sciences,
physical sciences, and engineering. These field differences are consistent with differences across fields
in the rewards from commercial activities, as well as in the degree of overlap between traditional and
commercializable research, which affects the opportunity costs of time spent away from “traditional”
work. We discuss potential implications for policy makers, administrators, and managers as well as
for future research on the scientific enterprise.

1    Introduction

         A large literature has examined academics’ engagement in commercially oriented
research and related activities. An important driver of this work are concerns that deepening ties
with commerce may lead scientists to neglect academia’s core mission of “pure” research or
compromise access to research findings (e.g., Dasgupta and David, 1994). Even though most of
the evidence does not support these concerns (Agrawal and Henderson, 2002; Azoulay et al.,
2009; Breschi et al., 2008; Buenstorf, 2009; Fabrizio and Minin, 2008; Goldfarb et al., 2009;
Perkmann et al., 2013; Thursby and Thursby, 2011), they remain salient in both the scholarly
literature and the public discourse. On the other side of the ledger, there has been a hope,
particularly among policy makers, that deepening commercial ties may increase the regional and
national economic impact of academic knowledge. These hopes are reflected in a range of
policies designed to encourage such interactions, most notably the Bayh-Dole Amendment
(Mowery et al., 2001).
         Whether the goal is to stimulate commercial engagement or to discourage it, it is useful to
understand why academics engage in commercially applicable research. Guided by a conceptual
framework, this paper examines the empirical relationships between academics’ motives (i.e.,
desires for payoffs such as career advancement and money) and their commercial activities.1 By
highlighting individual differences in academics’ motives as well as field differences in reward
structures, our work also extends the seminal argument of Merton (1973). Postulating a universal
set of values and norms, Merton’s perspective has framed much of the prior literature on the
scientific enterprise generally, and academics’ commercial engagement in particular.
         Although there is a growing body of research on the motives and incentives of academics
who engage in commercial activities (Bercovitz and Feldman, 2008; Fini and Lacetera, 2010;
Lam, 2011; Owen-Smith and Powell, 2001; Thursby et al., 2001), two important gaps remain.
First, efforts to understand academics’ commercial activities often rely on notions of a
representative academic or have examined particular fields in isolation. Yet, the benefits and
costs of commercial activities, and thus academics’ motives tied to such activities, are likely to
differ systematically across fields. Studying such differences is important given that there are


1
 In line with prior work (Sauermann and Cohen, 2010; Stern, 2004), we distinguish individual-level motives (e.g., the desire for
money) from rewards and incentives that may be provided by the employer or other actors (e.g., money paid to the owner of a
patent). The Appendix provides additional detail on the interplay between motives and incentives.

                                                                                                                                   2
significant field differences in the levels of academics’ commercial engagement (Cohen et al.,
2002; D’Este and Perkmann, 2011; Lim, 2004) and given field differences in the nature of
research (Fleming and Sorenson, 2004; Layton, 1976; Nelson, 2016; Sauermann and Stephan,
2013).
         Second, much of the work on academics’ motives around commercial engagement
assumes that departures from goals of peer recognition and career advancement (Merton, 1973)
are tied to other self-interested motives – not only money, but also intrinsic rewards (Dasgupta
and David, 1994; Lam, 2011; Stephan and Levin, 1992). Notably absent is the motive of social
impact. This is surprising given not only the salience of this motive in historical and qualitative
accounts (Shapin, 2008; Stokes, 1997), but also because social benefits have been invoked to
justify the public funding of academic research as well as policy efforts that promote academic
entrepreneurship (Bush, 1945; Lane and Bertuzzi, 2011; Salter and Martin, 2001). Moreover,
employees’ social motives have been shown to have important impacts in other organizational
settings (Bode and Singh, 2018; Fehr and Fischbacher, 2002; Grant, 2007).
         To address these gaps, we first briefly outline our conceptual framework, which is
formalized in the Appendix. We then use that framework to examine and interpret cross-field
differences in the motives tied to commercial activity observed in a sample of over 2,000 life
scientists, physical scientists and engineers working in over 100 U.S. academic institutions.

2   Conceptual Framework

         We assume that those who have selected into research-oriented academic careers wish to
advance those careers, and that the standard path for career advancement is achieving some
degree of eminence via traditional academic research (Merton, 1973; Roach and Sauermann,
2010; Stern, 2004). We also assume that academics who allocate effort to commercial activity
incur opportunity costs due to the loss of time dedicated to traditional academic research and the
associated career benefits. This loss can, however, be offset by the rewards from commercially
applicable research and related activity. Expanding upon much of the prior literature, a first
important feature of our framework is that these rewards may include not only the prospect of
greater income, but also the prospect for social impact.
         A second important feature of this framework is that the loss of time dedicated to
traditional academic research, as well as the rewards tied to commercial activity, may differ


                                                                                                      3
across fields. In particular, to the extent that traditional research in a field is closer to market
applications, commercially applicable work will detract less from work that supports an
academic career. For example, in the basic physical sciences, where traditional research
advances understanding of natural phenomena, research results are typically far removed from
commercial interest. Thus, effort spent on commercial research will tend to detract from
academic research and its rewards (Toole and Czarnitzki, 2010). By way of contrast, in
engineering and the applied sciences (henceforth referred to as engineering), a good deal of
traditional academic research focuses on solving concrete problems and creating useful artifacts
(Allen, 1977; Dym et al., 2005; Layton, 1976; Vincenti, 1990). Thus, generating
commercializable outcomes requires less departure from traditional work in these fields (Crespi
et al., 2011; Goldfarb et al., 2009). Moreover, we argue that in fields with a high degree of
overlap between traditional work and commercial activity, commercial activity may yield not
only rewards such as money or social impact, but may also contribute to academic advancement,
further lowering the opportunity costs of doing commercial work. Supporting this idea, there is
evidence that patenting can increase academics’ reputation among peers (Audretsch et al., 2010;
Haeussler and Colyvas, 2011) and, in some instances, prospects for academic promotion
(Azoulay et al., 2007; Butkus, 2007; Lipka, 2006).2
    Assuming that academics differ in their preferences for the different types of rewards, this
logic offers implications regarding the motives we expect to characterize those academics who
do commercially relevant work in a given field, and how such motives may differ across fields.
In fields where opportunity costs of pursuing commercially relevant work are greater, the
academics who choose to do such work are likely those who place a lower value than others on
academic advancement and a higher value on rewards such as money or social impact. In fields
where traditional research is closer to market applications, however, the motives of academics
who pursue more commercially relevant research may not differ much from the motives of their
colleagues who focus on traditional academic work.
    In the following section, we explore the empirical relationships between academics’ motives
and their commercial activities. In light of data limitations, our analysis does not identify the

2
 Commercial activity may also benefit traditional research, e.g., because it provides additional financial resources or suggests
novel ideas for research (Azoulay et al., 2009; Perkmann et al., 2013). In our model, such effects could be captured as
commercial activity supporting career advancement (indirectly, through research productivity). Notwithstanding this possibility,
we assume that individual academics face a fundamental trade-off between allocating a limited time budget to research versus
commercialization, and that a unit of the former tends to yield greater career advancement than a unit of the latter.

                                                                                                                                   4
causal impact of motives. Rather, our contribution is to document correlations between
academics’ commercial activities and a range of individual motives – including the desire for
social impact – that may speak to the interplay of individual motives with field differences in the
rewards and opportunity costs of commercial engagement.

3       Data and Measures

3.1       Data sources

            Our empirical analysis is based on two waves of the Survey of Doctorate Recipients
(SDR), obtained from the National Science Foundation under a restricted-use license. The SDR
is a longitudinal survey and its sampling population includes individuals who have obtained a
doctoral degree in a science, engineering or health field from a U.S. institution and lived in the
U.S. at the time of the surveys. In 2001 and 2003, the SDR achieved response rates of
approximately 80%.3 In this paper, we focus on those PhDs who are full-time employees in
academia (defined as educational institutions by NSF) and for whom research is either the most
important or second most important work activity. We exclude postdoctoral researchers since
they may pursue both academic and nonacademic career paths and tend to have limited control
over the allocation of research effort. Our final sample includes 2,094 scientists and engineers at
160 institutions. As discussed below, we distinguish between academics in the life sciences, the
physical sciences, and engineering.
            We augment the SDR data with data on: 1.) universities’ policies regarding the share of
licensing income going to the inventor from Lach and Schankerman (2008) as well as from
university websites and inquiries with administrators; 2.) the year in which academic institutions
started a formal technology transfer office from Association of University Technology Managers
(AUTM) surveys as well as from websites and through inquiries to administrators; and 3.) PhD
program quality from the National Research Council (Goldberger et al., 1995) as proxies for the
quality of the departments in which respondents were educated and employed.

                                                                                                      5
3.2     Measures

          This section describes key dependent and independent variables; Table 1 shows summary
statistics for all variables by field.
          Commercial activity: We proxy for academics’ commercial activities using patent
application counts (PATS). Each respondent reported in 2003 the number of U.S. patent
applications in which he or she was named as an inventor over the 5 years prior to the survey.4
We also code a dummy variable, ANYPAT, which takes on the value of 1 for academics with at
least one patent application. These measures capture all patent applications on which respondents
are listed as inventors, not only those going through university Technology Transfer Offices
(TTO’s).
          We observe significant differences in patenting across fields: Engineers have the highest
average count of patent applications, followed by life scientists and physical scientists (see also
Figure A1 for histograms). These field differences in levels of commercial activity are consistent
with differences in the costs of engaging in commercial activity noted above, though they may
also reflect differences in the associated rewards.
          Motives: In 2001, respondents were asked “When thinking about a job, how important is
each of the following factors to you . . .” Respondents rated the importance of each factor on a 4-
point scale anchored by 1 (very important) and 4 (not important at all); for ease of interpretation,
we reverse coded these items such that higher scores indicate higher importance. We feature four
factors and associated motives: Opportunities for advancement, salary, intellectual challenge,
and contribution to society. These measures capture respondents’ general preferences for
different kinds of work related payoffs (see also Agarwal and Ohyama, 2013; Sauermann and
Cohen, 2010). In this analysis, we use the desire for salary to represent the desire for financial
income more generally.5 Although the average importance ratings for all four job attributes are
generally high, the correlations between them, ranging from -0.06 (salary and challenge in
engineering) to 0.36 (advancement and salary in the physical sciences), are not, suggesting that
the measures capture distinct constructs (Table A1).

  The SDR data are anonymized and cannot be matched to other data sources such as patent records.
5
  In our conceptual model, financial payoffs may result from traditional research (e.g., rewards for publications, or salary raises
indirectly resulting from career advancement) as well as from commercial activities (e.g., royalty income from patents).
Unfortunately, desire for “salary” may not exactly reflect the importance individuals assign to other sources of financial income.
We assume that these preferences are, however, positively correlated, i.e., that individuals who state a high importance of salary
also care strongly about money more generally.

                                                                                                                                      6
       The means of motives are similar across fields. Indeed, we find no significant differences
in the importance of salary, intellectual challenge, or advancement reported by life scientists,
physical scientists, and engineers. Motives related to social impact, however, are slightly higher
among life scientists and engineers than among physical scientists. Although levels of motives
must be interpreted with caution given potential response biases (see Appendix), the observed
differences in social impact motives across fields are consistent with sorting of individuals into
fields as well as with ex post socialization effects (see Azoulay et al., 2017; Sauermann, 2018).
       Academic field: As noted, we distinguish between respondents who received their PhD in
the life sciences (N=1037), physical sciences (N=585), and engineering and the applied sciences
(N=472). In the regression analyses, we also control for fields at a more detailed level
(biochemistry, cell and molecular biology, microbiology, food sciences, environmental and
health sciences, other biological sciences; physics, chemistry, earth sciences, mathematics;
computer science, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil
and industrial engineering and other engineering, including materials engineering).
       Table A2 in the Appendix describes control variables such as type of academic
institution, age of the university’s TTO, the share of patent royalty income going to the inventor,
quality of PhD training and current department, publication productivity, as well as a range of
demographic characteristics.

4   Empirical Specification

       Our featured dependent variable is the number of patent applications in the prior five
years. To address the count nature of this variable, we estimate QML Poisson regression models
(Silva and Tenreyro, 2006). The following is our benchmark specification:

PATSi = f (εi; β0 + β1MOTIVESi + β2CONTROLS),

where PATSi is respondent i’s patent application count over the 1998-2003 time period (as
reported in 2003) and MOTIVESi is a vector of motives measured in 2001, reflecting
preferences for career advancement, income, intellectual challenge, and social impact.
CONTROLS is a vector of control variables taken from the 2001 survey and from other data
sources, and εi is a random error term. While regressions of PATS provide insights into the
intensive margin of patenting (i.e., the number of patent applications), we also estimate similar

                                                                                                      7
regressions using ANYPAT (indicating whether a respondent had any patent applications at all)
to gain insights into the extensive margin. These regressions are estimated using linear
probability models. Standard errors for all regressions are clustered at the level of the university.
          Since our framework suggests different effects of motives on academics’ commercial
effort across fields, we estimate our regressions separately for researchers in the life sciences,
physical sciences, and engineering, and compare the resulting coefficients. This approach also
implies that the coefficients we estimate reflect heterogeneity across individuals within fields
(e.g., some scientists in a particular field care more about a particular motive and those
individuals also patent more) rather than differences in motives across fields (e.g., all scientists
in a particular field care more about a particular motive and also patent more).

5     Results

          Table 2 shows significant relationships between academics’ motives and their patenting
activities. More importantly, these relationships differ across fields. We begin by briefly
reporting the basic results and then interpret the results, focusing on cross-field differences.
          In the life sciences (model 1), we find a significant positive relationship between patent
application counts and the desire for social impact. Researchers with a one standard deviation
higher motive to contribute to society have a 59.8% higher expected patent count. Income,
challenge, and career advancement motives have no significant relationship with patenting. In
the physical sciences (model 2), the advancement motive has a significant negative relationship
with patenting; a one-SD higher score is associated with a 33.0% lower patent count. Income,
challenge, and social impact motives have no significant relationship with patenting. Among
engineers (model 3), we find a strong positive coefficient on the challenge motive as well as the
career advancement motive. One-SD higher scores on the two motives are associated with 68.3%
and 35.6% higher expected patent counts, respectively. Motives related to income or social
impact have no significant coefficients. Formal tests confirm that the differences in the
coefficients of motives across fields are statistically significant.6
          Models 4-6 in Table 2 show the results for the ANYPAT regressions, estimated using
linear probability models. In the life sciences and engineering, the qualitative patterns for the


6
 We can reject the equality of coefficients of motives in the life sciences and physical sciences (Chi2(4)=21.88, p<0.01), the life
sciences and engineering (Chi2(4)=13.77, p<0.01), and the physical sciences and engineering (Chi2(4)=26.70, p<0.01).

                                                                                                                                      8
motive variables are largely the same as for the PATS regressions. In the physical sciences, the
negative coefficient on advancement motive loses its significance, while the positive coefficient
on social impact motives becomes significant.
          Our framework suggests that these different relationships between motives and
commercial activity across fields may reflect differences in the opportunity costs of commercial
engagement as well as in the associated rewards. We now discuss these possibilities in more
detail for each of the four motives.
          One notable result in Table 2 is the significant, negative relationship between
advancement motives and patent counts in the physical sciences (model 2), suggesting that
physical scientists who care strongly about their academic careers allocate less effort to
commercial activity. This contrasts sharply with engineering, where advancement motives have a
significant positive coefficient in the count and in the linear probability models. Interpreted in
light of our framework, these contrasting results are consistent with the existence of higher
opportunity costs of commercial work in the physical sciences than in engineering; physical
scientists who engage in commercial activities may give up more “traditional” research as well
as the associated career rewards than do engineers. In addition, the observed differences may
also reflect that fields differ in the career incentives associated with commercial activities, i.e.,
that commercial outputs such as patents are looked upon more favorably by academic peers in
engineering than in the physical sciences (Azoulay et al., 2007; Haeussler and Colyvas, 2011).7
We can only speculate why, in the physical sciences, the negative coefficient of advancement
motives is not significant in the ANYPAT regression. One conjecture is that physical scientists
may still be able to reconcile a small amount of commercial work with maintaining traditional
lines of research, limiting detrimental effects on career advancement. Generating higher volumes
of commercial output, however, may require a more fundamental shift away from traditional
areas of research, especially in a field where the distance between commercial work and
traditional research is large.
          Perhaps the most notable result is the significant relationship between commercial
activity and the social impact motive in the life sciences. A possible explanation is that life
scientists who engage in such activity expect significant social benefit, consistent with the notion

7
  In one of our interviews (see Appendix), an accomplished physicist likened patenting to “writing a textbook” in the sense that
both may result in extra income but do little to further one’s career. He noted, however, that “this is different in engineering…
those guys like patents”.

                                                                                                                                    9
that the social benefits from commercial activity are particularly salient in the life sciences. Our
particular measure, patenting, may also reinforce this interpretation: Life scientists are likely
aware of the fact that, for society to realize the health benefits from new discoveries, securing
patents is essential in order to provide companies the incentive to make the downstream
investments typically required to bring new drugs or therapies to market (Cohen et al., 2000;
Sampat et al., 2003).8 Note that we find the strong positive relationship between the importance
of social impact and patenting within the sample of life scientists; this relationship is thus
unlikely to reflect that life scientists typically have a stronger desire to contribute to society and
also happen to patent more. Indeed, our interpretation is consistent with the observation that the
social impact motive has a significant coefficient in the ANYPAT regression also among
physical scientists (even though physical scientists rate social impact overall less important than
life scientists or engineers; Table 1). Although this coefficient is relatively small, it suggests that
perceived social impact may be one of the factors that compensates physical scientists for the
opportunity costs of allocating effort to commercial activity.
          We had no priors as to whether intrinsic rewards such as intellectual challenge are more
strongly tied to traditional academic work or to commercial activity. The results suggest that the
answer depends on the field: We find no significant association with challenge motives in the
sciences but a significant positive coefficient in engineering. It appears that engineers – in
contrast to their colleagues in the sciences – perceive considerable intrinsic benefits from doing
commercially relevant work (see Layton, 1976). This result may be of broader relevance for our
understanding of scientists’ motivations: Much of the seminal work on intrinsic motivation
thinks of this construct in abstract terms and identifies factors that promote (or reduce) intrinsic
motivation generally (Amabile, 1996; Frey and Jegen, 2001; Hackman and Oldham, 1976).
However, intrinsic rewards are subjectively generated, and tasks that some people find
interesting and challenging may not be perceived as such by others. Future research on how
scientists perceive intrinsic rewards, and what role is played by the broader organizational
context or field, seems particularly interesting (to us).9

  In the words of the late Susan Lindquist, who was a pioneer in the study of protein folding: “Patenting activity is necessary for
my life’s work to make a difference… In the early 1980’s, scientists did not realize that. Now they do.” Quoted by Marie
Thursby, 2010 DRUID debate on academic entrepreneurship. http://www.druid.dk/index.php?id=20

  Such work could build on a large body of research in areas such as education, which has studied how people become
“interested“ in some subjects rather than others (Sauermann and Franzoni, 2013; Silvia, 2006), as well as research studying what
level of difficulty and challenge people chose when setting goals (Locke and Latham, 2006).

                                                                                                                                      10
       Finally, Table 2 shows no systematic relationship between income motives and patenting
in either of the three fields. Incidentally, our control for the share of royalty income going to
academic inventors also has no significant relationship with patenting. As such, the data show
less of an association between commercial activities and financial motives or incentives than
might be expected given the prominence of financial payoffs from patenting in the public
discussion. One explanation might be that, notwithstanding the very large financial payoffs
resulting from a few outlier patents, the expected financial returns from patenting are very low
(Lach and Schankerman, 2008; Stephan, 2012). It may also be that our measure of the
importance of salary only partly captures income motives in a more general sense. Additional
analyses to probe these results regarding financial motives and incentives leave the main
conclusions unchanged (see Appendix).
       The Appendix reports a number of supplementary analyses, including regressions that
control for scientific productivity, examine potential changes in motives over time, interact
motives with financial incentives (royalty shares), and use university fixed effects to control for
other factors that may shape academics’ decisions to engage in commercial activity. The
observed relationships between motives and commercial activity are consistent with our main
analysis.

6   Discussion

       Using two waves of survey data on over 2,000 academics at U.S. institutions, we
document correlations between individuals’ motives and their commercial activity. We find that
these relationships differ across broadly defined academic fields. In the life sciences, those
academics who most actively engage in commercial activities are characterized by strong
preferences for social impact. In the physical sciences, the most active patenters are those who
have little concern for career advancement, although social impact motives predict which
scientists patent at all. In engineering, patenting relates to motives of challenge and
advancement. These results highlight the importance of considering heterogeneity in individuals’
motives within fields, as well as differences in the rewards and opportunity costs tied to
commercial work across fields.
       Our results are subject to a number of limitations. First, while we consider a broader set
of motives than typically discussed in the economics and sociology of science, there may be

                                                                                                      11
additional motives for commercial engagement that are not captured by our measures, including,
for example, patenting as a way to ensure freedom to work on certain problems, or commercial
activities as a means to acquire resources for research (Murray, 2010; Owen-Smith and Powell,
2001; Perkmann et al., 2013). Second, we focus on patenting as one of several possible facets of
commercial activity. While patenting is likely complementary to – and correlated with – other
commercial activities such as consulting or new venture creation (Haeussler and Colyvas, 2011;
Jensen and Thursby, 2001), future work is needed to study how individual motives relate to other
commercial activities, and how such relationships differ across fields. Third, the opportunity
costs and rewards from commercial activities may change as “traditional research” in fields
evolves, as commercial activities become more accepted among academics, and as universities
and policy makers consider commercial activities as part of “broader impact” efforts (Bercovitz
and Feldman, 2008; Butkus, 2007; Stokes, 1997). As such, it would be useful to study how
academics’ institutional environment is changing and how such changes affect the relationships
explored in this paper. Fourth, variables employed in the analysis may be subject to measurement
error. For example, our measures of motives are quite coarse and may be affected by response
biases (see Appendix for a more detailed discussion). Similarly, patent applications may not fully
capture academics’ intent to patent since Technology Transfer Offices also play an important
role in decisions over whether to file for a patent. Finally, we do not estimate the causal impact
of motives on commercial activity, but document associations between measures of motives and
patent applications that are likely conditioned by sorting across fields and may be subject to
other sources of endogeneity. Nonetheless, the observed correlations are consistent with a view
that differences in the rewards and opportunity costs of commercial activity across fields are
linked to the motives of academics that pursue such activity within those fields.
       The observed correlations between motives and commercial activities, as well as the
differences across fields suggest potential implications for public and managerial policies. First,
a major objective of the Bayh-Dole legislation was to generate social benefits by increasing the
use and exploitation of knowledge developed in academia (Sampat et al., 2003). To the extent
that academics care not only about private benefits but also about making a difference in society,
their objectives may be more aligned with policy objectives than previously thought. Second, the
opportunity costs and rewards from commercial activities differ across fields. Thus, policies and
management practices that take into account field differences may be more effective than those

                                                                                                      12
that apply the same tools in very different contexts. For example, there may be less reason for
concern about distractions from traditional work in fields where academic and commercial work
are closely aligned (Azoulay et al., 2007; Fabrizio and Minin, 2008).
       Our findings may also be useful in light of discussions about potential detrimental effects
of commercial activities – patenting in particular – on the sharing and diffusion of academic
knowledge (Murray and Stern, 2007; Perkmann et al., 2013). Intellectual property rights can be
used in different ways, and their effects on knowledge flows are likely to depend on the motives
of the inventors and patent holders. A scientist who patents in order to improve social welfare,
for example, may be willing to share knowledge more freely than a scientist who patents in order
to appropriate financial returns.
       Our study also has implications for the broader literature on science and innovation. First,
although the Mertonian paradigm has allowed us to understand the distinctive features of
science, future research may benefit from considering more explicitly how the norms and
incentives of scientists differ across fields or organizational contexts (Crespi et al., 2011;
Sauermann and Stephan, 2013). Second, although much of the prior literature has focused on the
representative scientist characterized by self-interested motives, our results reveal important
heterogeneity across scientists, as well as the relevance of social motives that have received little
attention in prior work. Recognizing these aspects may provide a richer foundation for future
work on scientists’ decisions such as which career path to take, which employer to work for, or
what research problems to tackle (see Besley and Ghatak, 2005; D’Este et al., 2018; Francois,
2007; Salter et al., 2017). More generally, a broader view of scientists’ motives and the
consideration of differences in the scientific enterprise across fields has the potential to enrich
the study of science and allow us to provide more robust advice to managers, university
administrators, and policy makers.

Model

        The purpose of our model is to examine the relationship between academic researchers’
motives (i.e., preferences for different payoffs or incentives) and their allocation of effort toward
commercial activity. Accordingly, we model academics’ decisions to dedicate effort to
commercial activity as a function of their motives, while incorporating potential field differences
in the payoffs (i.e., incentives) tied to commercial activity as well as in the overlap of academic
and commercial activity that drives academics’ opportunity costs of commercial work. In
addition to offering empirical implications, the model serves to structure the subsequent
empirical analysis and inform the interpretation of results.
        For simplicity, we assume that an academic researcher’s effort can yield two different
payoffs: peer recognition and the associated career advancement in academia, A, and some
“other,” – nonacademic – payoff, O. While our theoretical model is agnostic as to the concrete
nature of this “other” payoff, our empirical analysis considers financial income, intellectual
challenge, and social impact as three important possibilities.
        The researcher can obtain A and O by expending effort on traditional academic research,
er, and on commercial activity, ec. The latter may broadly encompass activities such as R&D
with commercial applicability as well as working with a university’s technology transfer office
(TTO), licensing partners, or a startup. Our model allows for the possibility that each type of
effort can yield both academic advancement and the “other” nonacademic payoff, though at
different rates (αr, αc, γr, and γc). Accordingly,

        A = αrer + αcec and                                           (1)

        O = γrer + γcec.                                              (2)

These rates, αr, αc, γr, and γc, may reflect incentives embedded in the broader professional
community, the market environment, or incentive systems designed by particular employers
(e.g., university tenure guidelines or university policies around inventors’ share of royalty
income). To structure the analysis, we assume that αr > αc, implying that the academic career
payoff from academic research is greater than the academic payoff from commercial work.




                                                                                                        19
Similarly, we assume γc > γr, implying that the nonacademic payoff from commercial work is
greater than the nonacademic payoff from academic research.
         An important feature of our model is that effort dedicated to academic and commercial
activity can overlap; as such, effort allocated to commercialization does not necessarily imply a
reduction of effort towards academic research by the same amount. The intuition is that –
depending on the field – the very same effort that advances commercial objectives may also
advance a scientist’s academic career. For example, research identifying a cellular target
implicated in colon cancer may have considerable commercial value but may also contribute to
fundamental understanding and be recognized as an important scholarly contribution.10 To make
this overlap more explicit, we define a fixed nominal effort budget, B, and assume that

         er = B - φec,                                                                   (3)

where φ indicates how different the effort expended on commercial activity is from effort
dedicated to academic research (with 0 < φ ≤ 1; 0 ≤ er, ec ≤ B; er, ec are integer-valued). Thus, φ
can be thought of as the distance between the outputs of academic research and those required
for commercialization, with a smaller distance (i.e., lower φ) implying a larger overlap between
research and commercialization. If φ=1, the two activities are completely distinct, and effort on
one activity does not advance the other. As φ approaches zero, academic and commercial activity
increasingly overlap such that the effort spent towards commercial activity also counts as effort
advancing academic research objectives. In other words, φ indicates the degree to which
commercial activity detracts from traditional academic research, with a higher φ implying a
higher opportunity cost of engaging in commercial activity. In our model, having greater overlap
between academic and commercial research (i.e., φ approaching zero) allows the total effective
effort spent on both activities to exceed the nominal budget (B ≤ er + ec ≤ 2B).
         We suggest that φ differs systematically across fields, leading to differences in the
opportunity costs that academic researchers face when engaging in commercial activity.
Consider, for example, the basic physical sciences, where “traditional” research advances
understanding of natural phenomena, but the results are typically far removed from
commercially applicable outcomes. As such, effort spent on commercial research will tend to
detract from academic research and its associated rewards, implying a strong trade-off between

10
  In contrast to some prior work, we do not model the researcher’s choice between “basic” and “applied” research, but that
between “traditional” academic research in a particular field and commercial activity.

                                                                                                                             20
effort devoted to one versus the other (Toole and Czarnitzki, 2010). In engineering and the
applied sciences, in contrast, a good deal of traditional academic research focuses on the solution
of concrete problems and the creation of useful artifacts (Allen, 1977; Dym et al., 2005; Layton,
1976; Vincenti, 1990) such that effort dedicated to academic research is more likely to also yield
commercializable outcomes (Crespi et al., 2011; Goldfarb et al., 2009). Consistent with this
notion, Cohen et al.’s (2002) survey results show that firms report academic research in
engineering and applied science fields to be useful across a much broader range of industries
than is the case for research in the physical and biological sciences.11 Similarly, the share of
academically trained PhDs taking jobs in industry is considerably larger in engineering than in
the physical sciences, possibly reflecting – among other factors – easier applicability of the
knowledge acquired during academic training to the private sector (National Science Foundation,
2006).
          We assume that, in addition to yielding different types of payoffs, effort also imposes a
cost in the form of disutility, and that the disutility of commercial activity increases at a greater
rate than that tied to traditional research. The rationale for this assumption is that academics have
self-selected into academia rather than industry due to their strong “taste for science” (Agarwal
and Ohyama, 2013; Roach and Sauermann, 2010; Stern, 2004). Reflecting both types of payoffs
as well as the costs of effort, the researcher’s utility function can be written as:

          U=β1A + β2O – ec2 – er,                                                                    (4)

where β1 is the researcher’s individual preference for academic advancement, A, and β2 the
researcher’s preference for the other, nonacademic payoff, O. Following prior work (e.g., Stern,
2004), we conceptualize preferences as parameters in the utility function such that a stronger
preference for a particular payoff increases the utility derived from a unit of that payoff.
          Given equations (1), (2), and (4), and substituting for er, the utility function can be
rewritten as:

          U = β1[αr(B - φec) + αcec] + β2[γr(B - φec) + γcec] - ec2 - B + φec.                       (5)




11
  In Cohen et al. (2002), the percentage of R&D managers reporting academic research to be at least “moderately useful”
exceeds 60% in four industries for computer science, seven industries for materials science, and seven industries for electrical
engineering. The corresponding figures are one industry (semiconductors) for physics, two industries for chemistry, and one
industry (drugs) for biology.

                                                                                                                                   21
For simplicity of exposition, we omit subscripts indicating levels of analysis. Effort levels (ec,
er), motives (β1, β2), as well as utility (U) and realized payoffs (A, O) are at the level of the
individual researcher. Incentives (αr, αc, γr, γr) reflect policies and norms at the level of
universities but also the broader professional community or market environment specific to
fields. Regarding the distance between traditional research and commercial activity (φ), we focus
on systematic differences across fields and abstract from potential heterogeneity within fields.
        The marginal utility from effort dedicated to commercial activity is:

        ∂U/∂ec = β1(αc - φαr) + β2(γc - φγr) - 2ec + φ.                         (6)

        Utility is maximized for

        ec*= [β1 (αc - φαr) + β2(γc - φγr) + φ]/2.                              (7)

        Equation (7) shows how optimal commercial effort depends on individuals’ preferences
for academic (β1) and nonacademic payoffs (β2), the structure of incentives (αr, αc, γr, and γc),
and the distance between commercial and academic effort, φ. In the following, we highlight three
relationships that are central to our empirical analysis, which focuses on the association between
academics’ commercial activities and their preferences for different types of payoffs (i.e.,
“motives”). First,

        ∂ec*/ ∂β1 = (αc - φαr)/2.                                               (8)

        Thus, the impact of preferences for career advancement (β1) on commercial effort
depends on the relative size of academic advancement payoffs from academic and commercial
activities (αr vs. αc), as well as the degree to which commercial effort detracts from traditional
research (φ). Given that αr > αc and 0 < φ ≤ 1, the sign of the derivative is ambiguous. If the
academic payoff from commercial research (αc) is sufficiently low and the distance between
academic and commercial activity (φ) is sufficiently high, equation (8) implies that those
researchers with stronger preferences for academic advancement will allocate less effort to
commercial activity than those with weaker advancement motives. In contrast, researchers with
stronger advancement motives will allocate more effort to commercial activity if career benefits
from commercial activity (αc) are sufficiently high (e.g., patents receive significant weight in
promotion decisions) and if the distance between traditional research and commercialization is
small, implying low opportunity costs of commercial effort. The important role of opportunity


                                                                                                     22
costs is reflected in the negative cross partial derivative, ∂2ec*/ ∂β1∂φ = -αr/2, which suggests that
the effect of advancement motives on commercial activity becomes less positive (or more
negative) as the distance between the two activities, φ, increases.
       The impact of preferences for the other, nonacademic payoff on commercial effort is

       ∂ec*/ ∂β2 = (γc - φγr)/2,                                               (9)

which is unambiguously positive given that γc > γr and φ ≤ 1. Thus, unsurprisingly, preferences
for the other payoff will have a positive relationship with commercial effort. However, the
negative cross partial with respect to φ, ∂2ec*/ ∂β2∂φ= -γr/2, indicates that this positive
relationship is attenuated as the distance between academic and commercial work, φ, increases,
increasing the opportunity costs to engaging in commercial activity. Conversely, the positive
effect of preferences for the other payoff intensifies as the opportunity costs of commercial
activity decrease.
       Finally,

       ∂ec*/ ∂γc = β2/2,                                                       (10)

which indicates that commercial effort increases with the degree to which it yields a greater
nonacademic payoff. Moreover, this relationship should be stronger for researchers with strong
preferences for the other, nonacademic payoff (∂2ec*/ ∂γc∂β2 = ½ > 0).
       To summarize our discussion of the different payoffs and motives bearing on the
commercial work of academics, academics who allocate effort to commercial activity are likely
to incur opportunity costs due to the loss of time dedicated to traditional academic research and
the loss of associated career benefits. This loss can be offset by other payoffs from commercial
activity, including income, social impact and even the intellectual challenge tied to commercially
applicable work. As such, we expect academics to allocate effort towards commercial activities
based on their preferences for career advancement and these other types of payoffs. Moreover,
the opportunity costs and operative payoffs from commercial activities are likely to differ across
fields, partly reflecting the distance between commercial work and traditional academic research.
Thus, we expect important field differences in the levels of academics’ commercial activity and
in the individual motives associated with commercial engagement.




                                                                                                         23
Measures

        Key dependent and independent variables are discussed in the main text. Additional
variables are explained in Table A2. In the following, we briefly discuss potential measurement
concerns.
        A concern with survey data is the possibility of social desirability bias. In particular,
individuals might inflate ratings of motives that they think are socially desirable (e.g.,
contribution to society) and give artificially low scores to motives that may seem less socially
desirable (Moorman and Podsakoff, 1992). Any descriptive data on motives should be
interpreted in light of the possibility of such a bias. More importantly, we do not expect that any
such social desirability bias will affect the correlations between the measures of motives and of
commercial activities. In contrast to other surveys that directly ask individuals why they engage
in commercial activities (Giuri et al., 2007; Lam, 2011), the survey questions regarding motives
were asked in a more general context and separately from the questions on patents; it is thus
unlikely that respondents altered their responses to the question of motives to justify or
rationalize responses to the question on patenting. A further concern is that certain groups of
individuals may be socialized into thinking they should care about others and thus report stronger
motives to contribute to society. As shown in Table 1, the average rating of contribution to
society is somewhat higher for life scientists and engineers than for physical scientists, which
may reflect such bias but also true differences due to sorting or socialization. More importantly,
we run our regressions within field and any social desirability bias that is common to all
individuals in a particular field will not affect our results.
        A second important concern is that relationships between variables may be inflated
because variables are measured using a common method. Common methods bias may result
from the use of similar scales for dependent and independent variables, implicit theories
respondents hold regarding the relationships between variables, or from priming effects of
collocated questions (Podsakoff et al., 2003). While common methods bias may increase the
correlations among our measures of motives, it should be less of an issue with respect to
relationships between motives and other variables since variables were measured using a number
of different types of scales. Moreover, our key dependent and independent variables were
measured on different pages of the survey and in different years; such proximal and temporal
separation should further reduce common methods bias (Podsakoff et al., 2003). The royalty

                                                                                                      24
share measures as well as some control variables originate from different data sources, further
reducing concerns regarding common methods bias.
         As discussed in the main text, a limitation of our measure of patent applications is that it
only captures one kind of commercial activity; future work should explore other aspects such as
consulting or new venture creation. Another limitation is that patent applications reflect not only
individual academics’ decisions but often also those of other actors, such as the TTO, which
decides whether the university will apply for a patent on an invention disclosed by an academic.
Taken together, our patent measure is likely conservative in that an observed patent application
indicates commercial activity, but not all commercial activity will be reflected in a patent
application.

Supplementary analyses

         To examine whether the relationships between motives and patenting may reflect
underlying differences in researchers’ productivity (e.g., due to ability or different levels of total
effort), we include individuals’ (ln) number of publications in the regressions (Tables A3-A5,
models 1 and 2). The number of publications has a strong positive relationship with PATS in all
three fields, consistent with prior work (Azoulay et al., 2009; Stephan et al., 2007).12 There is
also a significant relationship with ANYPAT in the life sciences, though not in the physical
sciences and engineering. Most importantly, including these measures does not substantively
change the coefficients of motives, although the negative coefficient of advancement motives in
the physical sciences becomes even stronger, while the coefficient of advancement and income
motives are slightly reduced in engineering.
         Economists typically assume that individuals’ motives and preferences are stable, and
many social psychologists also consider preferences for work attributes to be “trait-like”, i.e.,
relatively stable over time and across contexts (cf. Amabile et al., 1994; Cable and Edwards,
2004). It is conceivable, however, that individuals’ reported preferences change over time,
possibly in response to past decisions or outcomes. Our main strategy to address this issue is to
use motives as reported in 2001 as predictors of patenting reported in 2003. In addition, we
explicitly examined changes in motives by comparing individuals’ responses to the 2001 and the

12
  The positive relationship between patents and publications may reflect a number factors such as unobserved heterogeneity in
researcher quality, complementarities between applied and basic research, as well as complementarities between patenting and
publishing (Azoulay et al., 2009; Fabrizio and Minin, 2008; Gans et al., 2017).

                                                                                                                                25
2003 survey. We regressed the observed changes in motives on PATS as well as ANYPAT as
measured in 2001 (detailed results available upon request). Out of 24 coefficients, only two are
significant – ANYPAT is associated with a small but significant decrease (not increase) in the
importance of contribution to society and challenge in the life sciences (p<0.05). We also re-
estimated regressions using only those cases who reported no change in any of the motives,
focusing on ANYPAT due to the smaller sample size (Tables A3-A5, models 3); the results are
in line with our main models (Table 2, models 4-6).
          The relationship between individual motives and commercial activities may be moderated
by incentives. For example, academics’ income motives may be more strongly related to
patenting in an organization that offers high financial rewards for patenting. Although we have
measures of four different kinds of motives, we only have one measure of incentives – the share
of royalty income going to inventors. In models 4 and 5 of Tables A3-A5, we include the
interaction between the royalty share and income motives (and, for robustness, also the
interactions between the royalty share and other motives). The main coefficients of motives as
well as the royalty share are unaffected, while the interaction effects are largely insignificant.
          To probe why variation in institutionally provided licensing incentives does not seem to
influence academics’ patenting,13 we conducted structured interviews by phone with a small
random sample of 25 scientists and engineers at universities included in our main sample. When
asked about royalty shares at their universities, all respondents were aware of the existence of
income sharing policies, but only 5 out of 25 respondents knew the royalty share at their
institution. Five respondents guessed but all of them underestimated the true royalty share.
Fifteen respondents simply did not know what share of licensing income inventors received at
their institution. The latter group included some individuals who indicated that their research had
no commercial potential but also several who did see commercial potential. While small in
number, these interviews suggest that variation in the royalty share across institutions may not
show a relationship with scientists’ patenting because the exact shares are not salient to most

13
   This result is not inconsistent with research by Lach and Schankerman (2008), who show that a positive relationship between
royalty shares and university licensing income is driven primarily by the quality of licenses rather than the number of licenses.
Unfortunately, the data do not allow us to examine the quality of licenses, or the licensing income per patent. More generally,
research on the relationship between licensing incentives and commercial activities provides mixed results (Perkmann et al.,
2013). Markman et al. (2004) observed that royalty shares set by universities were negatively related to the number of equity
licenses. Markman et al. (2008) compared across universities the share of academic patents that “bypassed” TTOs and found no
effect of the share of licensing income going to inventors. These ambiguous findings may reflect that studies examined different
outcomes that may relate in distinct ways to licensing incentives. In addition, prior work tends to examine aggregate outcomes at
the level of academic institutions while our analysis focuses on the level of individual researchers.

                                                                                                                                    26
academics. This interpretation is consistent with recent survey evidence showing that many
faculty members are not familiar with their institution’s TTO (Huyghe et al., 2016). It may well
be, however, that these shares become more salient once a license is taken out or royalty income
is generated, possibly leading researchers to invest more time by working with licensees to
increase the value of a license (Jensen and Thursby, 2001; Lach and Schankerman, 2008).14
         In a final analysis, we include university fixed effects to account for other university
characteristics that may influence the rewards (and opportunity costs) to commercial activities,
such as tenure policies, norms regarding engagement in commercialization, or differences in the
cost of living tied to location. Due to small sample size, we estimate these models using
ANYPAT (Tables A3-A5, models 6). The only noticeable difference compared to the baseline
models (Table 2, models 4-6) is that the positive coefficient of career advancement motives now
becomes insignificant in the engineering sample. This may reflect that university fixed effects
absorb some of the variation in career incentives tied to commercial activities, i.e., that some
institutions indeed consider engineers’ commercial activities favorably in tenure and promotion
decisions (Azoulay et al., 2007; Haeussler and Colyvas, 2011).




14
  When we inquired more generally about reasons not to patent potentially valuable results, opportunity costs emerged as a
common theme. Some respondents simply felt too busy with their primary job of running a lab. Others saw the process as very
cumbersome and costly in terms of time, partly due to insufficient support from the TTO.

                           quality (Goldberger et al., 1995). The particular quality measure we use is
                           a survey rating of “program effectiveness in educating research scholars
                           and scientists”, ranging from 0 (“not effective”) to 5 (“extremely
                           effective”). This measure formally captures the quality of an individuals’
                           graduate education, but should also reflect innate ability to the extent that
                           high-ability individuals self-select or are selected into high-quality PhD
                           programs.
Quality of employer        As a proxy for the quality of the employer, we use the 1993 NRC ratings
department                 of faculty quality in the respondents’ field at the respondents’ current
(Department NRC score)     employer (e.g., the ratings for the quality of the physics faculty for an
                           individual with a PhD in physics).
Not tenure track           Dummy variable indicating whether a respondent was on the tenure
                           track/tenured (0) or not on the tenure track (1).
Age                        Age of the respondent at the time of the second survey. To allow for
                           flexible estimation, we use dummies for 5-year intervals in regressions.
Race                       Dummies for Asian (not Hispanic), white, and other
Citizenship status         Dummy = 1 for U.S. citizens
Exposure                   Time since obtaining the PhD, top coded at 5 years. Serves to control for
                           the fact that output is measured over 5 years but some respondents have
                           worked for less than 5 years (Long and Freese, 2005).
Publications               Each respondent reported the number of (co)authored articles that have
                           been accepted for publication in a refereed professional journal over the
                           last 5 years. We interpret this measure as a proxy for research
                           productivity and the amount of knowledge that is potentially patentable
                           (cf. Azoulay et al., 2007). Given the skewed nature of this measure, we
                           use the natural logarithm in our regression analyses.
