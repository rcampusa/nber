                                           ABSTRACT

This paper uses data from the National Education Longitudinal Study to estimate the association
between illicit drug use during high school and the number of years of schooling completed. The
analysis accounts for the possibility that drug use is endogenous using two methods: (1) by
controlling for individual-level characteristics measured before high school entrance; and (2) by
using an instrumental variables method, with state drug policies and 8th grade school characteristics
as identifying variables. Findings suggest that marijuana and cocaine use in both 10th and 12th grade
are associated with reductions in the number of years of schooling completed.

       Illicit drug use among youth is a pressing public health problem at the national,

community, and school level (Johnston et al. 2002; U.S. Department of Justice 2001). Rates of

use have increased considerably since 1991, when about 12 percent of 10th grade students and 16

percent of 12th grade students reported any illicit drug use in the past month. As of 2002, 21

percent of 10th grade students and 25 percent of 12th grade students reported past month illicit

drug use (Johnston et al. 2002). The recent increase in illicit drug use among youth has led to

concern about both the short-term and the long-term consequences of this risky behavior

(ONDCP 2003).

       Part of the concern about adolescent substance use stems from the idea that drug use

interferes with the rapid accumulation of social, emotional and academic skills that normally

takes place during adolescence. Drug use has the potential to detract from motivation, cognition,

and memory as well as the potential to exacerbate existing mental disorders, all of which can

affect academic performance (Hawkins et al. 1992, Brook et al. 1999). It is widely believed that

drug use leads to academic failure, and, at first glance, the empirical evidence supports this

viewpoint. Adolescent marijuana users, for example, are about twice as likely as non-users to

drop out of high school, perform worse than non-users on some standardized achievement tests,

and are much more likely than non-users to report poor academic performance. (Brook et al.

1999; Bray et al. 2000; Yamada et al. 1998, Diego et al. 2003, Pacula et al. 2003a).

       The relationship between substance use and academic outcomes, however, clearly has the

potential to be bidirectional. While substance use during adolescence is associated with later

academic problems, early school failure and low attachment to school have been identified as




                                                                                                   2
leading risk factors for substance use, as well as good predictors of low educational attainment in

the future, independent of drug use (Hawkins et al. 1992, Jessor & Jessor 1978). Substance use

appears to be both a cause and a result of academic problems, and disentangling these pathways

is an empirical challenge.

          The objective of this study is to use data from the Fourth Follow-up to the National

Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS 2000) to explore the causal relationship between

illicit drug use during high school and the number of years of schooling completed by 2000,

when most respondents are about 26 years old. The analysis focuses on using two methods to

account for the possibility that illicit drug use is correlated with unobserved factors that also

influence educational attainment. The first method uses student characteristics measured before

high school to control for preexisting factors that may confound an observed association between

high school drug use and educational attainment. The second method is an instrumental

variables approach, with state and school-level drug policies as identifying instrumental

variables. Both of these empirical approaches take advantage of the unusually rich personal and

school-level information that is available for NELS respondents before, during and after high

school.

          This study is the first to estimate using national data the effect of illicit drug use on

educational attainment, while directly addressing the possibility that drug use is endogenous.

The findings suggest that past month marijuana use in 10th or 12th grade is associated with a

reduction in educational attainment at age 26 of about 0.2 to 0.3 years, while lifetime cocaine use

by 10 or 12th grade is associated with a reduction in attainment of about 0.2 to 0.4 years.

However, there is evidence of some selection into drug use along observed variables, which may

imply selection into drug use along unobserved factors that also affect educational attainment.




                                                                                                      3
The IV results, which account for this problem, provide suggestive, but not conclusive, evidence

that some of the associations between drug use and educational attainment represent causal

relationships.

1      Is the association between substance use and educational attainment
       causal?
       Psychologists have long debated whether or not drug use, low educational attainment,

and other problem behaviors are caused by a common, psychological factor, such as an

unobserved propensity towards deviant behavior (Jessor & Jessor 1977, Newcomb & Bentler

1988). Empirically, it is clear that drug use and academic failure share some common,

measurable antecedents at the individual level, such as misbehavior and lack of interest in

school, mental disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression,

deviant peer group, and early antisocial behavior (Bryant et al. 2003, Molina & Pelham 2003,

Slater 2003, DeWitt 2002, Griffin et al. 2002; Field et al. 2001, Jessor & Jessor 1978, Flewelling

& Bauman 1990, Bachman et al. 1991, Jeynes 2001, Brandon 2000, Bryant et al. 2003; Sale et

al. 2003). The existence of many measurable, common risk factors may suggest that unobserved

risk factors confound the negative association between drug use and educational attainment. In

this case, a strong correlation between drug use and low educational attainment may not reflect a

causal relationship.

       Some previous researchers in health economics have investigated the causal link between

substance use in high school and educational attainment. These researchers have focused on

alcohol use. Cook and Moore (1993), for example, use data on high school seniors from the

National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and an instrumental variables methodology to

study the impact of frequent drinking (drinking on at least two days in the past week) on the

number of years of education completed. Using state-level alcohol policies as instruments, they


                                                                                                  4
find that seniors who are frequent drinkers complete 2.3 fewer years of college compared to

seniors who are not frequent drinkers (Cook and Moore 1993).

       More recently, Koch & Ribar (2001), also using a sample from the NLSY, estimate the

effect of the age of initiation of alcohol use on the number of years of schooling completed by

age 25. They demonstrate that state-level alcohol policies are not good predictors of alcohol use

initiation, which casts doubt on their value as identifying variables in this case. As an alternative

approach, they take advantage of data on siblings and estimate: (1) family fixed effects models;

and (2) instrumental variables models using sibling age of alcohol use initiation as an instrument.

The findings suggest that at most, the age of alcohol use initiation increases the years of

schooling completed by 0.47 years for men and by 0.36 years for women. This upper bound

result comes from the sibling IV model, which relies on the assumption that each respondent’s

sibling’s age of drinking initiation is exogenous to the model. As the authors acknowledge, this

assumption is difficult to defend, as many unobserved family and environmental characteristics,

such as a family history of alcoholism, are likely to affect both siblings’ drinking behaviors and

educational outcomes.

       Dee & Evans (2003) use another approach to circumvent the problem of weak identifying

variables. They use pooled data from the 1977-92 Monitoring the Future surveys to estimate the

impact of minimum drinking ages on drinking, and data from the Census Bureau’s 1990 Public

Use Sample to estimate reduced form equations modeling the effect of drinking ages on

schooling. Using a two-sample IV strategy, they draw on both sets of results to generate

estimates of the impact of drinking on educational attainment (see Dee & Evans 2003 for details

of the methodological approach). Dee and Evans (2003) report that none of the alcohol use




                                                                                                     5
measures have a statistically significant impact on high school completion, college entrance or

college persistence.

        Two previous studies in the health economics literature focus on estimating the effect of

marijuana use on high school completion. Bray et al. (2000), using data on 1,392 students from

a southeastern US public school system, report that marijuana initiation during high school more

than doubles the odds of high school dropout. Similarly, Yamada et al. (1996), based on data on

high school seniors from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), find that recent

marijuana use is associated with a lower probability of graduation. These results are consistent

with findings from the psychology and sociology literature, which suggest that marijuana and

other illicit drug use detract from the likelihood of high school completion (Kandel & Davies

1996; Newcomb & Bentler, 1985, 1986).

       However, none of these studies on illicit drug use adequately address the issue of whether

drug use is a cause or just a correlate of high school dropout. If students who use drugs

disproportionately have behavior problems, academic deficiencies or disadvantaged

backgrounds, they may not have graduated from high school even if they hadn’t used drugs.

Yamada et al. (1996) do not present results from models where the endogeneity of drug use is

directly addressed. It is notable that Bray et al. test for endogeneity of drug use in their models,

and they find no evidence of this problem. Unfortunately, this study does not report information

about the identifying variables used to generate these results. This issue is important since their

data come from a single school system, and it is not clear from where they obtain exogenous

variation in drug availability.

       This paper contributes to the existing literature on illicit drug use and educational

attainment in several ways. First, this study uses empirical methods that address the possibility




                                                                                                       6
that high school students select into illicit drug use based on unobserved characteristics that also

affect their educational outcomes. This significant empirical problem has been recognized in

numerous, related studies that have focused on alcohol and schooling (see Cook & Moore 1993;

Dee & Evans 2003; Koch & Ribar 2001), and illicit drug use and labor market outcomes (see

DeSimone 2003; Kaestner 1991, 1994). However, to date, no study on illicit drug use and

educational attainment using national data has adequately accounted for the possibility that illicit

drug use is endogenous.

       This study also builds on previous work by considering the effects of both marijuana and

cocaine use, while the two previous health economics papers only consider marijuana. Although

cocaine use is still uncommon among high school students, the past month prevalence of cocaine

use among 10th graders more than doubled between 1991 and 2002 (Johnston et al. 2002). Given

this dramatic increase in use, it is important to understand how cocaine use affects educational

attainment.

       Finally, this study considers as an outcome the number of years of schooling completed.

This educational outcome measure is more informative than a dummy variable indicating high

school dropout since substance use might affect post-secondary educational attainment as well as

high school completion. Moreover, because educational attainment is measured around age 26,

when most young people have completed their education, this study sheds some light on the

long-term consequences of illicit drug use during high school.

2      Methods: Addressing the Endogeneity Problem

       Previous health economics research on alcohol use (Dee & Evans 2003), along with

extensive theory and empirical evidence from the psychology literature (see Hawkins et al. 1992

for a review), suggest that students who use substances during high school enter high school with



                                                                                                   7
individual and family characteristics that predispose them to low educational attainment.

Empirically, this issue becomes a problem because researchers using secondary data sets

typically cannot control for all of the important preexisting variables that are linked to substance

use and educational outcomes. If an unobserved factor exists that is correlated with drug use and

also directly related to educational attainment, standard estimation methods may yield biased and

inconsistent estimates of the effect of drug use on educational attainment. The goal of the

empirical approach used in this paper is to test for and address this problem, first by using

student characteristics measured before high school, and next by using an instrumental variables

method.

       More formally, consider a linear specification of the structural human capital production

function (H) and a linear specification of the demand function for drugs (D):

(1)    H = α1D + α2X + α3µ + ε

(2)    D = β1X + β2Y + β3µ + η .

Equation (1) represents a production function for educational attainment (H). Educational

attainment is a function of substance use (D), observed characteristics such as gender and race

(X), and unobserved variables such as motivation (µ). Equation (2) represents the demand for

illicit drugs. The vector X represents observed characteristics that affect substance use, which

are the same as the observed determinants of educational attainment, while the vector Y consists

of prices and policies that affect the availability of substances to youth. The vector µ represents

the unobserved determinants of educational attainment that also may influence illicit drug use.

The terms ε and η represent random disturbance terms, and intercepts are suppressed for

convenience.




                                                                                                      8
        The parameter of interest is α1, the structural effect of substance use on educational

attainment. However, estimating equation 1 by standard methods can lead to biased and

inconsistent coefficients if substance use is determined by the same unmeasured

characteristics that determine one’s educational attainment (α3≠ 0 and β2≠0). In this case,

estimating the coefficients by a standard OLS model would violate a central assumption

underlying the classical linear regression model framework, which is that the right-hand

side variables should be exogenous with respect to the error term (Greene 2003).

        The first approach used in this paper to deal with this problem is to use data on observed

characteristics to: (1) assess the importance of selection on observed characteristics; and (2) to

proxy µ to the fullest extent possible, mainly by controlling for a number of important

differences between students that preceded high school entrance.2 First, Equation (1) is

estimated using an OLS regression model without any control variables (Model 1). Next, the

model is estimated with a standard set of family background and demographic characteristics

that have been linked to educational attainment in previous studies (Model 2). If students select

into drug use along family background characteristics that also affect educational attainment, the

magnitude of the estimated drug use coefficient should change appreciably when these variables

are included in the model. Comparing the estimated coefficient on drug use in Models 1 and 2,

therefore, provides information about the degree of selection along observed family background

characteristics.

        Following the same reasoning, Model 2 is then estimated with the addition of a set of

student and school characteristics measured during high school (Model 3). Drug use is known to

be correlated with other concurrent problem behaviors and school/community deficiencies,




                                                                                                     9
which themselves may have independent impact on educational attainment (Jessor & Jessor

1977; Hawkins et al. 1992). If the observed association between drug use and educational

attainment is confounded by other, current problematic behaviors or high school characteristics,

the estimated coefficient on drug use would be expected to decline in magnitude once these

variables are included.

           The NELS data set is unique in that it provides detailed information about respondents in

8th grade, before they entered high school. Adolescents who use drugs during high school are

more likely than non-users to enter high school with preexisting problem behaviors, such as early

academic failure, smoking, and behavior problems (Hawkins et al. 1992). These factors may

detract from educational attainment regardless of drug use status in high school. To determine

the degree of selection on preexisting factors, the educational attainment equation is estimated

with the addition of a set of 8th grade personal characteristics (Model 4).             If the relationship

between high school substance use and educational attainment is causal, controlling for 8th grade

risk factors for drug use should not substantially reduce the magnitude of the estimated drug use

coefficient. Previous studies of illicit drug use and educational attainment have not been able to

control for these preexisting characteristics of students because of insufficient data.

           The approach outlined thus far is based on the assumption that adolescents select into

drug use based on measurable characteristics that also may affect their educational attainment.

However, despite the rich, longitudinal data available in NELS, it is still possible that important

unmeasured factors exist that affect both drug use and educational attainment. In particular,

NELS does not have clinical information on mental disorders, such as depression and attention

deficit hyperactivity disorder. These mental disorders are known to be correlated with both


2   This approach draws on the work of Painter & Levine (2000), who use NELS to study the effect of family


                                                                                                              10
substance use and academic problems (Molina & Pelham 2003, Diego et al. 2003). Although

existing data on smoking and behavior problems is used to proxy mental disorders, it is still

possible that this factor, or another important confounder, remains in the error term.

        For this reason, the educational attainment model is estimated using an instrumental

variables (IV) method, which purges the potentially endogenous drug use variable of its

correlation with the error term. The IV models are estimated with a set of basic family and

demographic covariates that are exogenous from the youth’s perspective, and with a full set of

covariates that includes potentially endogenous variables such as smoking and behavior

problems. The endogeneity of drug use with respect to educational attainment is tested

using the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test, and all models are estimated using robust standard

errors that account for clustering of observations at the state level. Additionally, the

validity of the over-identifying restrictions is tested, and the predictive power of the

identifying instrumental variables is assessed. The drug use equation has a binary

dependent variable, but it is estimated as a linear probability model for computational

convenience.

        The practical challenge of implementing the IV method is that it requires valid exclusion

restrictions – variables that affect substance use, but that are also exogenous and not directly

related to educational attainment. Measures of state-level illicit drug use prices (marijuana

decriminalization policy3, statutory jail terms for marijuana possession, fines for marijuana


structure on youths’ outcomes.
3 The following states had decriminalized marijuana during the time period when NELS respondents were in high
school: Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Ohio
and Oregon. Pacula et al. (2003) demonstrate that marijuana decriminalization policy captures something other than
more lenient consequences for marijuana possession. Instead, these researchers suggest that decriminalization may
proxy greater public awareness about marijuana policy or social acceptance of marijuana use. Because the
interpretation of this policy is potentially problematic, the models in this paper are estimated with and without
marijuana decriminalization included as an identifying instrument.


                                                                                                               11
possession, and cocaine prices) are used as identifying variables. State-level drug policies are

expected to be good predictors of adolescent substance use, but they are not expected to directly

affect educational attainment or to be correlated with the disturbance term. However, in the

instrumental variables (IV) context, these policy variables sometimes are poor predictors of

substance use. Bound et al. (1995), Bollen et al. (1995), Nelson & Startz (1990) and others show

that a low first stage F-statistic for the identifying instrumental variables may suggest that IV

estimates are no better than biased OLS estimates.

       In addition to these concerns about predictive power, Dee (1999) suggests that state

substance use policies may be associated with unobserved state sentiments that are correlated

with both substance use and the consequences of substance use. For example, a state whose

residents have higher than average concern and involvement in youth development and education

may enact particularly stringent alcohol and illicit drug policies. In this case, state substance use

policies are no longer exogenous and therefore cannot serve as identifying instrumental

variables. As an alternative, Dee (1999) suggests estimating models that include state fixed

effects and relying on within-state variation in policies for identification. In addition to these

problems with alcohol policies which have been highlighted in the alcohol use literature, illicit

drug prices may be measured with error and they are inherently more difficult to quantify than

alcohol prices and policies.

       For these reasons, the IV models are also estimated using a set of identifying variables

that capture the availability of drugs in each student’s 8th grade school. The availability of drugs

is captured by the 8th grade school principal’s perception of whether or not drugs are a moderate

to serious problem at the school, and whether or not the school has a policy of expelling students

if they are caught with illegal drugs on school property. If the 8th grade school principal believes



                                                                                                     12
that drug use is a problem, or if the 8th grade school policy for drug possession is not stringent,

these features of the school environment may indicate relative availability of drugs at school.4

These school-level variables are expected to be good predictors of drug use in high school since

students who have drugs available to them in 8th grade may be more likely than others to use

drugs and to continue use during high school (Kandel 1975, Morral et al. 2002).

         The availability of drugs in 8th grade is not expected to directly affect educational

attainment at age 26, conditional on the availability of drugs in 10th (or 12th) grade and the

student reaching 10th (or 12th) grade. The educational attainment equation includes the same

two 8th grade drug availability variables – drug use is a problem at school and punishment for

drugs is expulsion -- measured in high school. In other words, the use of these 8th grade

variables as identifying instruments assumes that the school drug environment in 8th grade may

affect drug use in 10th (or 12th) grade and academic performance until 10th (or 12th) grade.

However, once the student has made it as far as high school, the high school drug environment is

assumed to supersede the junior high school environment.

         This exclusion restriction presumes that the 8th grade drug environment does not affect

final educational attainment at age 26, conditional on the high school drug environment (and all

the other factors measured in high school) and conditional on the student reaching 10th (or 12th)

grade. Although the analysis includes tests to determine the empirical validity of these school-

level identifying variables, this assumption is still less theoretically appealing than the

assumptions used to justify state-level policies as identifying instruments. School-level factors,

on the other hand, may be better predictors of high school drug use than drug prices measured at


4 It is possible that school drug policy is endogenous in that school policymakers design policies based on the degree
to which drug use is a problem at the school. The estimated correlation coefficient between having a policy of




                                                                                                                  13
the state level since the school environment is one the most important contexts for adolescents,

along with family and peers (Hawkins et al. 1992).

        Both the state-level variables and the school-level variables are potentially problematic as

identifying instruments. The use of cross-sectional variation in state-level policies for

identification has been controversial in the alcohol use and educational attainment literature.

State-level drug policies in particular (but also school policies) may be correlated with

unobserved state-level factors that affect educational attainment. State policies also may be poor

predictors of drug use. School-level drug availability measures are likely to be better predictors

of drug use, but it is possible that they have direct impact on educational attainment.

        This paper deals with this issue in two ways. First, to control for state-level factors that

may be correlated with state-level and school-level drug policies, the models are estimated with

and without a set of state-level variables included that are thought to proxy state sentiment.

These variables are dummy indicators for the religious composition of state, the state

unemployment rate, and the state’s average real income. If the estimates are sensitive to the

inclusion of these state-level variables, this finding suggests that state-level sentiment may affect

both drug policies and educational attainment. This strategy is the best solution in the absence of

longitudinal data that would allow state-level fixed effects.

        Second, the analysis tests both sets of instruments (separately and together) for predictive

power and to see if they can be validly left out of the educational attainment equation. The IV

results are useful only if the identifying instruments as a group are reasonably strong predictors

of drug use, and if they can be validly excluded from the educational attainment equation. The



expulsion and having a drug problem at the school is negative and modest in magnitude (-0.07). However, the
possibility that school policies are endogenous cannot be ruled out.


                                                                                                              14
IV models also are estimated with both the school-level and state-level variables as instruments,

and then separately with just the school–level and just the state-level variables as instruments.

This approach allows one to gauge whether or not the instruments are appropriate, and whether

or not the results are sensitive to which instruments are used to identify the model. The IV

models also are estimated with a small and a larger set of covariates to determine whether the

estimates are sensitive to model specification.

3      The National Education Longitudinal Study

       Data come from the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS), an education survey

designed to study the high school students of the 1990’s. The study is unique in that it surveys

students prior to high school entry, in 8th grade, and then follows them until the year 2000, when

most respondents are 26 years old. The survey was initiated in the spring semester of 1988,

when about 25,000 8th grade students completed surveys along with their parents, teachers and

school administrators. The students are a clustered, stratified probability sample of over 1,000

public and private schools. In this base-year survey, extensive information was collected about

the students’ school experiences, family background, activities, attitudes and smoking behavior.

The students also took curriculum-sensitive cognitive tests in reading, mathematics, science and

social studies. Parents, teachers and school principals completed questionnaires about the student

and his/her activities, the family, teaching practices and the school (NCES 2002).

       After the baseline survey in 1988, the students completed surveys four more times, in

1990, 1992, 1994, and finally, in 2000, when most respondents were about 26 years old and had

been out of high school for eight years (NCES 2002). In 1990 and 1992, the samples were

freshened with some new respondents to ensure that the data could be used to represent the

national population of sophomores as of 1990 and the national population of seniors as of 1992.



                                                                                                    15
The survey continued to track and interview students who dropped out of high school. The

weighted response rate for eighth-grade respondents by the 2000 survey was 83.8 percent (NCES

2002).

         This study uses data from the 2000 follow-up of the NELS, which included 12,144

respondents from the three previous surveys. Two samples are used in the analysis: (1) a 10th

grade sample, comprised of 6,231 students who were interviewed in 8th grade, who were still in

school by 1990, and who had completed student, parent and school interviews; and (2) a 12th

grade sample, comprised of 4,008 students from the 10th grade sample who were still in school

by 1992, and who had student and school interviews available. The 10th grade sample is used to

examine the effect of 10th grade drug use on educational attainment among students who were

still in school (but not necessarily at grade level) 2 years after the baseline interview. The 10th

grade sample includes students who dropped out of school after being interviewed in 10th grade,

but it excludes students who dropped out prior to being interviewed in 10th grade.5 The sample

also excludes students with any missing substance use information (N = 1,273), missing

information on school drug policies in 8th or 10th grade (N = 1,229), missing education

information in 2000 (N = 69), and missing information on state drug policies (N=136). There

were only modest numbers of missing values for other data elements, and these missing values

were imputed using sample means.

         Because there were a large percentage of observations with missing data for school drug

policies and for substance use, it was necessary to see whether retaining, rather than dropping,

these observations affected the estimates presented in this paper. The models were estimated


5 The NELS survey made great efforts to track and interview school dropouts, including early dropouts. Drug use
information is available for students who dropped out of school between 8th and 10th grade. However, it is not clear
if the drug use preceded or postdated the school dropout event. Logically, then, these early dropout respondents
cannot be included in this analysis.


                                                                                                                 16
after imputing school and state drug policies, alcohol use, and cigarette use using sample means.

The OLS estimates from this analysis were very similar to the OLS estimates presented in this

paper. In some cases, the IV estimates varied from those presented here, but these estimates

were qualitatively very similar to those presented in this paper.

         The 12th grade sample is a sub-sample comprised of 4,008 respondents from the 10th

grade sample who were still in school two years later. This sample is used to explore the effect

of drug use in 12th grade among students who were still in school (but not necessarily at expected

grade level) four years after the baseline interview. By design, the sample excludes students in

the 10th grade sample who dropped out between 10th and 12th grade. Because only 14 students in

the sample dropped out after being interviewed in 12th grade, the effects estimated using the 12th

grade sample are mainly the effects of 12th grade drug use on post-secondary educational

attainment. The sample excludes 490 students with missing information on 12th grade marijuana

or cocaine use, and 339 observations with missing data on school drug policies.6

         This paper uses educational outcome data from the fourth follow-up survey which was

conducted in 2000. Most respondents were 26 years old, and were likely by this age to have

completed their education. Some respondents dropped out of high school or college, and then

returned to complete their studies by 2000. The dependent variable is the number of years of

schooling completed by the 2000 interview, which ranges from 11 to 20 years in both samples.

Both previous studies on illicit drug use and educational attainment have focused on a dummy

indicator of high school graduation as an outcome. In this study, because data are available on

educational attainment 12 years after 8th grade, one can explore the effects of drug use on post-


6  In order to use weights to generalize to a meaningful population, the group of 12,144 students must be sub-set
into a grade cohort (e.g. 10th grade cohort). Instead, in order to include students who were not at grade level, the 10th
and 12th grade samples in this analysis include students who repeated grades. Therefore, cohort weights are not used
to generalize to a particular population.



                                                                                                                     17
secondary attainment, as well as effects of drug use that might not be captured by a dummy

variable indicating graduation.

     NELS respondents answered extensive questions about their alcohol, marijuana and cocaine

use during the first and second follow-up interviews, when most students were in 10th and 12th

grade. Specifically, respondents answered questions about how many times they had consumed

any alcoholic beverages in their lifetime, in the past 12 months and in the past 30 days.

The illicit drug use questions included questions about marijuana and cocaine use (any form,

including crack). Respondents reported the number of occasions they had used marijuana and

the number of occasions they had used cocaine in their lifetime, in the past 12 months and in the

past 30 days.

     Marijuana and cocaine use are measured in both 10th and 12th grade by dummy variables

indicating: (1) whether or not the respondent used marijuana at least once in the past 30 days;

and (2) whether or not the respondent used cocaine at least once in his/her lifetime.7 The cocaine

use measure corresponds to any lifetime use rather than any use in the past 30 days because the

number of respondents reporting any past month cocaine use was very small. Because of

multicollinearity between the substance use measures, the main models presented in the paper

include each substance use measure separately. To gauge the sensitivity of the estimates to the

inclusion of other substance use measures, some models were estimated that include illicit drug

use measures with alcohol use measures.

     In addition to the substance use measures, the basic models include: (1) gender; (2)

race/ethnicity indicator variables; (3) region of residence; (4) religion indicator variables; (5)



7 The models were estimated using “number of occasions of marijuana use in past 30 days” and “number of
occasions of cocaine use in lifetime” instead of these dummy indicators of drug use. The results were qualitatively
similar to those presented here.


                                                                                                                 18
mother’s and father’s education levels (high school graduate as the baseline, high school

dropout, some college, college graduate); (6) family structure in 8th grade (two parents as the

baseline, step-family, single parent); (7) family income quartiles; (8) number of siblings; and (9)

whether or not the school is located in a suburban (baseline), rural or urban area. This

information was collected in 1988 as part of the baseline student and school surveys.

    In order to control for concurrent factors that may confound an observed empirical

relationship between substance use and educational attainment, some models include a set of

personal and school characteristics measured in the current grade (10th or 12th grade). These

variables are: (1) whether or not the standardized percentile score on math achievement test is in

the lowest quartile8; (2) a dummy variable indicating daily smoking; (3) a dummy variable

indicating that the principal thinks drugs are a moderate to serious problem at this school; and (4)

a dummy variable indicating that the school policy is to expel students for a first occurrence of

illegal drug possession at school. The math test is part of the NELS survey, and students self-

reported the information about smoking. The school principal, or a similar administrator,

reported information about the drug environment at school and the school’s policy regarding

drug possession at school. No information is available on enforcement of school policy.

    To control for drug use in the student’s peer group in high school, the models also include

whether or not the student reports that s/he has been offered to buy drugs at school. This is not

an ideal measure of drug use among the student’s peers, since drug offers will also be influenced

by state and school-level policies, and community-level factors. However, if a student associates

with drug-using peers, one would expect that s/he would be more likely to be offered drugs at

school compared to a student who does not associate with drug-using peers.




                                                                                                    19
      A set of 8th grade personal characteristics are added to the model to control for preexisting

differences between youth that may affect both high school substance use and educational

attainment. These measures are: (1) whether or not the respondent was a daily smoker in 8th

grade; (2) math test score in 8th grade was in lowest quartile; (3) whether or not the student had

repeated a grade by 8th grade; and (4) the number of times since the 8th grade school year began

that the student’s parent was contacted by the school about the student’s behavior in school. To

control for drug use in the 8th grade peer group, the models also include a self-report of whether

or not the student was offered to buy drugs in 8th grade. The math test was administered to the

respondents as part of the survey, and students self-reported repeating a grade, drug offers, and

smoking behavior. The parent reported the number of times he or she was contacted by the

school as part of the parent survey

         Four state-level substance use policies and prices are included in the models as

identifying variables. These variables are meant to proxy the full price that adolescents

face when using marijuana and cocaine. The variables are: (1) the midpoint of the minimum

and maximum jail terms for marijuana possession in the state; (2) the midpoint of the minimum

and maximum fine for marijuana possession in the state; (3) whether or not the state has

decriminalized marijuana; and (3) the real money price of cocaine. The jail terms and fines for

marijuana possession pertain to a first offence of possessing the lowest quantity of marijuana

mentioned in the statute (see Pacula et al. 2003b). The methodology for creating the cocaine

price series is described in detail in Grossman and Chaloupka (1998). The following state-

level variables are used in some specifications to proxy state sentiment: (1) unemployment

rate; (2) average real income; and (3) percentage of state that is Southern Baptist, Catholic,


8Psychologists have found that while there is not necessarily a negative correlation between intelligence and drug
use (in fact, the opposite may be true), school failure predicts drug use. The use of lowest quartile math score is

Mormon and Protestant as of 1990. Data on religion comes from Bradley et al. (1992).

        Finally, school-level variables measured in 8th grade are used for identification in

some IV models. These variables, intended to capture the availability of drugs in 8th grade,

are the following: (1) dummy variable indicating that the principal thinks drugs are a moderate

to serious problem at this school; and (2) dummy variable indicating that the school policy is to

expel students for a first occurrence of illegal drug possession at school. These variables are

used for identification while controlling for the same two variables measured in high school.

The school information was obtained from the school administrator survey.

4       Results

4.1     Do students select into high school substance use based on problem behaviors in 8th
        grade?

        Table 1 presents sample means. The average number of years of education completed by

2000 was about 14 years in both samples. Among 10th grade students, about 6 percent had used

marijuana in the past month, and about 3 percent reported any lifetime cocaine use. In the 12th

grade sample, 9 percent of students reported past month marijuana use and 4 percent reported

lifetime cocaine use. The rates for the 12th grade sample in 1992 are somewhat lower than illicit

drug use rates among 1992 seniors from Monitoring the Future (MTF), a yearly national survey

of high school students’ substance use. In the MTF, 12 percent of respondents used marijuana in

the past month, and 6 percent of respondents reported lifetime cocaine use.

        As other studies have documented, high school students in both samples select into drug

use based on certain family and personal characteristics that are likely to influence educational

attainment (Table 2). In the 10th grade sample, family and personal risk factors for illicit drug

use include smoking, alcohol use, having a parent who is a high school dropout, living in a single


intended to capture students who may be experiencing school failure.


                                                                                                    21
parent family, having a low math score in high school, and having been offered drugs at school

(which is included to proxy drug-using peer group). Protective factors include having a parent

who is a college graduate, African-American or Asian race/ethnicity, attending a rural school,

and living in the South. Most studies of illicit drug use and educational attainment have included

controls for these factors in their regression models.

       It is striking to see the differences in 8th grade problem behaviors between high school

drug users and non-users. For example, 19 percent of 10th grade marijuana users report smoking

in 8th grade, compared to just 3 percent of non-users. As the data in Table 2 demonstrate, high

school marijuana users are much more likely than non-users to enter high school with

educational risk factors, such as low math scores, behavior problems and associating with a

deviant peer group. This selection into drug use along preexisting, educational risk factors is

more evident for cocaine use than for marijuana use. Previous studies have not included these

important correlates of high school drug use because they lacked data on student characteristics

measured before high school entrance.

4.2    OLS Estimates: Using observed data to assess selection along family characteristics,
       student characteristics measured in high school, and student characteristics
       measured before high school entrance

       Table 3 shows results from OLS models that estimate the association between illicit drug

use and educational attainment. The first two rows summarize models that include 10th and 12th

grade marijuana use measures, while the second two rows summarize models that include 10th

and 12th grade cocaine use measures. Column (1) in each table shows the estimated coefficient

on illicit drug use from a model without any controls. The following columns (2-5) show

increasingly richer specifications in order to gauge the degree of selection on observed

characteristics. Column 2 shows results from a model that includes a basic set of demographic




                                                                                                  22
and family characteristics. Column 3 displays results from a model that also includes school and

personal variables measured in high school. Finally, Column 4 shows results from a model that

also captures 8th grade problem behaviors, and Column 5 displays results from a model that

includes alcohol and illicit drug measures simultaneously.

       As a group, these models show evidence of a robust, negative association between illicit

drug use and educational attainment. In almost every model, high school marijuana and cocaine

use is associated with a statistically significant reduction of 0.1 to 1.3 in the number of years of

schooling completed by age 26. However, a significant portion of this association can be

explained by selection into drug use along family and personal characteristics. For example, in a

model without any controls, marijuana use in 10th grade is associated with almost a full year

reduction in educational attainment (Table 2, Column 1). After including a basic set of

demographic and family controls, this effect diminishes in magnitude to -0.74, a 22 percent

reduction. When a set of high school student and school characteristics is added to the model,

the estimated coefficient on marijuana use declines in magnitude to -0.228, which is a reduction

of almost 70 percent. As seen in the other rows of Table 3, this trend is apparent in models that

include measures of 12th grade marijuana use, 10th grade cocaine use, and 12th grade cocaine use.

       Column 4 in Table 2 shows results from a model which includes all of the covariates

included in previous models but also accounts for risk factors for substance use that were

measured before high school entrance. Including 8th grade measures does reduce the estimated

association between illicit drug use and educational attainment in every case. The size of this

reduction is 16 to 28 percent for the 10th grade measures, indicating considerable levels of

selection into 10th grade drug use along 8th grade problem behaviors. On the other hand, the

findings suggest that selection into 12th grade substance use along 8th grade risk factors is not as




                                                                                                   23
important. The magnitudes of the coefficients on 12th grade substance use decline by about 6

percent when the 8th grade characteristics are added to the model.

       To summarize, the negative, statistically significant association between substance use

and educational attainment persists even when 8th grade risk factors are included in the model. If

the most important determinants of drug use and educational attainment are measurable in

NELS, this finding supports the idea that this relationship is causal. The OLS findings also

suggest that selection into drug use and educational attainment along preexisting factors is more

important for 10th grade substance use than for 12th grade substance use.

4.3    IV Estimates: Addressing the Potentially Endogenous Drug Use Measures

       The results displayed in Table 3 do not directly address the possibility that some of the

important determinants of drug use and educational attainment may be left out of the model.

Table 4 and Table 5 show results from IV models. The IV models purge the potentially

endogenous drug use measure of its correlation with the error term. If the IV estimates support

the OLS findings, one can make a stronger case for a causal relationship between illicit drug use

and educational attainment.

       Table 4 focuses on the effects of 10th grade substance use on educational attainment.

Columns (1-2) show results from IV models that include only the basic set of covariates, which

are thought to be exogenous from the respondent’s perspective. Columns (3-6) show results

from IV models that include the full set of covariates, which includes the basic set along with the

high school student and school characteristics and the 8th grade risk factors. Because some of

these variables are likely to be endogenous, these results should be interpreted with caution.

       Table 4 displays for each model the results from an over-identification test, a Hausman

specification test, and an F-test on the identifying instruments. These test results allow one to




                                                                                                    24
gauge the validity of the identifying instruments, as well as the effects of endogeneity on the

consistency of the estimates, in every model. Also, Table 4 shows results from models with and

without state sentiment variables included, and with all of the state-level and school-level

identifying instruments included together as well as separately by group. This approach allows

an examination of whether or not the results are sensitive to the instruments used to identify the

model.

         Panel A in Table 4 shows all IV results for 10th grade marijuana use. Two findings are

notable. First, in the fully specified IV model (Table 4, Panel A, Column 3) the estimated

coefficient on marijuana use is -0.161, which is reasonably close to the corresponding OLS

estimate of -0.192 (Table 3, Column 4). The IV estimate, however, is not statistically

significant. Second, there is no evidence in any of the models that endogeneity affects the

consistency of the estimates, and the instruments appear to be validly excluded from the

educational attainment equation in every case. The addition of variables to proxy state sentiment

generally does not change the signs of the estimates, but the magnitudes of the estimates do

change in some cases when these variables are included. This finding is consistent with the idea

that state sentiments are correlated with drug policies and educational attainment. The predictive

power of the full set of identifying instruments ranges from modest (in the models with

exogenous covariates only) to reasonable (in the fully specified models).

         Panel B in Table 4 shows all IV results for 10th grade cocaine use. These results are not

consistent with the OLS results for 10th grade cocaine use. The estimated coefficient on cocaine

use is large and positive in 5 of the 6 models estimated. The predictive power of the instruments

is reasonable in most of these models, and there is no evidence that the identifying instruments

should be included in the educational attainment equation.




                                                                                                   25
       Table 5 shows results from IV models that focus on 12th grade substance use. These

effects capture the impact of drug use on post-secondary educational attainment. Panel C

displays results from marijuana use models, while Panel D shows results from cocaine use

models. As seen in Panel C, the IV results do not support the idea that marijuana use in 12th

grade reduces educational attainment in the future. All of the estimates are positive in sign,

regardless of model specification, whether or not state sentiment variables are included, and

which set of instruments is used. These estimates suggest that marijuana use in 12th grade does

not affect post-secondary educational attainment.

       The 12th grade cocaine use models, however, are consistent with the OLS results (Table

5, Panel C). When only the exogenous covariates are included in the model, cocaine use has a

negative, statistically insignificant association with educational attainment. The size of the

coefficient is -0.997 in the fully specified model (Table 5, Panel D, Column 3), which is

considerably larger in magnitude to the estimate of -0.381 from the corresponding OLS model

(Table 3, Column 4). When the more extensive set of covariates is included, the signs of the

estimated coefficients remain negative in most cases, but the instruments perform poorly in terms

of predictive power. In the fully specified model with state sentiment included (Table 5, Panel

D, Column 4), the sign on the cocaine use coefficient becomes positive. The Durbin-Wu-

Hausman test is used to test every model to see whether or not the endogeneity of the drug use

measure with respect to education affects the consistency of the estimated coefficient. There is

no evidence of this problem in these models.

       The Appendix Table displays the estimated coefficients on marijuana fine, marijuana jail

term, marijuana decriminalization, and cocaine price from the first stage drug use equations.

These results offer interesting information about the effects of illicit drug policies and prices on




                                                                                                   26
adolescent drug use. In every case, higher marijuana fines are associated with statistically

significant declines in the probability of past month marijuana use. Pacula et al. find a negative

but statistically insignificant association between marijuana fines and marijuana use using NELS

data. Higher marijuana fines are also associated with higher probability of cocaine use among

10th grade students, which implies substitution between cocaine and marijuana. Marijuana

decriminalization is associated with increases in marijuana use among 12th grade students, and

decreases in cocaine use among 10th grade students.

         Overall, then, the results presented in Table 4 and Table 5 support the OLS results in the

cases of 10th grade marijuana use and 12th grade cocaine use, but with some important caveats.

First, none of the IV results are statistically significant, which often occurs in IV estimation with

relatively weak instruments. Second, the IV estimates are sensitive to both model specification

and to the set of identifying instruments used. For example, the negative association between

10th grade marijuana use and educational attainment disappears when only a basic set of

covariates is included in the model (Table 4, Panel A, Columns 1-2), or when only state-level

policies are used to identify the educational attainment equation (Table 4, Panel A, Column 5).9

However, given the fact that the Hausman test does not suggest that endogeneity of the drug use

measure affects the consistency of the estimates in any of the models, the OLS estimates may be

the preferred estimates in this analysis.

5        Conclusions
         Previous research has highlighted the strong association between teenage substance use

and reduced educational attainment, but it is not clear whether or not the relationship is causal.

These findings suggest that it is likely that past month marijuana use in 10th grade and lifetime


9 In certain cases, the IV results are also sensitive to whether or not the marijuana decriminalization indicator is used
as an identifying variable. These results are not presented here.


                                                                                                                     27
cocaine use by 12th grade may detract from educational attainment. The magnitudes of these

effects may be considerable. For example, in the most fully specified OLS model (see Table 3,

column (4)), marijuana use in 10th grade has a similar impact on educational attainment (-0.192)

as living in a single parent family (-0.194), or living in a family with an income in the lowest

quartile (-0.278).10 If these effects are causal, targeting illicit drug use with an effective

treatment or prevention program may be an efficient way to improve educational attainment. If

these effects are not causal, targeting illicit drug users still may be an effective way to improve

educational attainment, but it is less clear that a drug treatment or prevention program alone will

improve their educational outcomes.

         The results regarding the effect of marijuana use on high school outcomes are consistent

in sign with the two previous studies on this topic in the health economics literature. Yamada et

al. and Bray et al., find that marijuana users are more likely to drop out of high school than non-

users. Bray et al. use data from a single school system rather than national data, and Yamada et

al. do not test for endogeneity problems or show results that take into account the problem of

endogeneity. Neither study considers post-secondary outcomes. These issues make it difficult to

compare their results to the findings presented here. However, the OLS estimates in this paper

appear to be smaller than these estimates since it is unlikely that a decrease of about a fifth of a

year of schooling would affect high school graduation. The results in this paper also are

consistent with recent work by Pacula et al. (2003a), who use NELS and show that marijuana use

is associated with a 15% reduction in math achievement test scores.

         This research supports the idea that public policies that are effective in reducing

substance use during high school should have some impact on educational attainment. It is


10Living in a single parent family is compared to the baseline of living with both biological parents. Living in a
family in the lowest income quartile is compared a to a family with income in the second highest quartile.


                                                                                                                     28
important to note that the effects of these policies on educational attainment may take years to be

realized. Substance use during high school may not immediately affect educational outcomes –

preventing use in 12th grade, therefore, may not affect high school graduation. However, this

paper suggests that using marijuana and cocaine can alter students’ long-term educational

trajectories. Future research should focus on understanding what processes lead substance using

adolescents to low educational attainment, and what policies can do to alter these pathways.
