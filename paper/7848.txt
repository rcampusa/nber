               Factor Supplies and Specialization in the World Economy


          Since Ricardo, trade economists have had a persuasive explanation for
international output specialization: countries specialize in goods in which they
have a comparative advantage. The central problem with this elegant theory is that
it links the observables to be explained, outputs, to inherently unknowable, if not
metaphysical, autarky prices. The theory of comparative advantage is empirically
empty unless autarky prices can be linked to observables, as they are in the
Ricardian, Heckscher-Ohlin, and other versions of the theory. If trade theory is to
be useful in understanding the world, it is imperative to confront these models
with the data.
          Our paper is a contribution to this project. We collect and analyze the most
extensive data set currently available on production and factor supplies, with a
focus on the question: how does the world distribution of productive resources
influence the pattern of output specialization?
          We look at the pattern of specialization rather than the pattern of trade,
because most of the intellectual capital of trade theory is invested in explaining
production. Almost all flavors of comparative advantage theory combine a
sophisticated model of production with a rudimentary, if not naÃ¯ve, model of
consumption. The best-known example of this is the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem,
the proof of which consists of the remarkable Rybczynski theorem combined with
the assumption of identical and homothetic preferences1. Despite the fact that the
bulk of the intellectual content of comparative advantage theory is about
production, almost all empirical work on comparative advantage, from Leontief


1
    Plus, of course, the assumption that countries share the same technology.
(1954) to Trefler (1995), has used trade data and has not directly measured
production.
      Reasoning that economists won't be able to understand trade until they
understand specialization, Leamer (1987), Harrigan (1995, 1997), Bernstein and
Weinstein (1998), and Schott (1999) have looked directly at production data. Each
of these papers focused on endowment differences as a source of specialization.
With the exception of Harrigan (1997), who showed the importance of industry-
specific technological differences, these papers used quite restrictive models:
Harrigan (1995) and Bernstein and Weinstein (1998) used the even general
equilibrium model with factor price equalization, while Leamer (1987) and Schott
relied on the 2- or 3-factor identical technology model. Related work on the factor
content of trade by Trefler (1993, 1995) also used restrictive models that relied
heavily on modified forms of factor price equalization.
      In contrast, Harrigan (1997) used a more flexible model that did not rely on
factor price equalization assumptions and allowed for non-neutral technology
differences. Using a within-country estimator, Harrigan (1997) found that
technological differences were an important determinant of specialization in a
panel of OECD countries. Harrigan's statistical model with country fixed effects
offered consistent estimates but has the conceptual disadvantage that the model
did not use cross-country variation to help identify the effects of factor supplies on
specialization.
      Our paper builds on Harrigan (1997) and the related literature in several
ways. We ask the question: how well can relative factor endowments alone
explain specialization? To answer this question, we begin with an extended data
description that documents the pattern of industrial specialization and factor
endowment differences in a broad sample of countries over a long time period


                                          2
(1970-92). This data description reveals the importance of country-specific
influences on specialization but also suggests an important role for factor supply
differences.
      Next, we develop an econometric model that allows us to estimate the
effects of factor endowments alone in a world where technology differences may
also be important influences on specialization. Unlike Harrigan (1995), Trefler
(1993, 1995), and Bernstein and Weinstein (1998), we make no use of any form of
factor price equalization result. Unlike Harrigan (1997), we bypass the difficult
problems of measuring technology levels, and we also dispense with the strong
assumption that cross-country technology differences are exclusively Hicks-
neutral at the industry level. We use panel data techniques to estimate this flexible
model of specialization as a function of factor endowments.
      A further contribution of our paper is that we consider an explicit alternative
hypothesis. This competing explanation is the ladder-of-development or product-
cycle hypothesis: a country's output mix depends on its stage of development, with
countries moving from agriculture to labor-intensive manufactures to high-tech
manufacturing and services as their aggregate labor productivity increases. This
development story is consistent with both technology and factor supplies being
important, but it is simpler and more parsimonious than models that stress the
interactions between factor supplies, factor intensities, and non-neutral
technological differences.
      Our results show that factor endowments are a major influence on
specialization: for most large industrial sectors, relative factor supplies are a
statistically and economically significant determinant of the location of
production. However, the simple ladder-of-development model also has good
explanatory power and dominates the factor proportions model on purely


                                           3
statistical grounds. We interpret these results as confirming the empirical
relevance of factor proportions theory, and as suggesting that a full account of the
workings of the global economy must assign an important role to relative factor
supply differences.
1 Theory
       The theory used to frame the data analysis is resolutely neoclassical:
technology is assumed to be constant returns to scale, and markets are assumed to
be perfectly competitive. We dispense with most of the other assumptions that are
usually used in trade theory models, such as the assumptions that production is
non-joint with some specific relationship between the number of goods and
factors. We also make no use of any form of factor price equalization result, either
relative or absolute. The use of a neoclassical model is not intended to rule out the
importance of increasing returns or economic geography for specialization, but
these considerations are very difficult to nest in a model that has relative factor
endowments as a central driving force for specialization2.
1.1 Technology differences and the revenue function
       A convenient way to summarize the production side of the neoclassical
model is with the revenue function, which gives the maximal level of national
income Y for given endowments v and final goods prices p3:
       Y = r ( p, v )                p â \N , v â \M




2
 For some progress on marrying economic geography and factor proportions models, see Davis
and Weinstein (1999).
3
  For a careful development of the revenue function and its properties, see Dixit and Norman
(1980) and Woodland (1982).



                                               4
The revenue function r(p,v) is homogeneous of degree one in p and in v. The net
output vector y of the economy is given by the gradient of r(p,v) with respect to
prices4:
        y = rp ( p, v )               y â \N                                       (1)

If technology is the same across countries, then (1) says that outputs differ only to
the extent that p and v differ. In the more likely case that technology differs across
countries, outputs will differ even for the same p and v. If we allow technology to
differ arbitrarily across countries then (1) is useless as a framework for cross-
country analysis. By restricting the way that technology differs across countries,
however, modified versions of (1) can be used to study variation in outputs over
time and across countries.
       A simple specification is to suppose that technology differs in a Hicks-
neutral fashion across industries and countries. Let Î¸ict be a scalar productivity
parameter for industry i, country c, in year t, relative to a numeraire value of Î¸i11 =
1 in country 1 in year 1. By definition, Hicks-neutral technology differences mean
that, given the same inputs, industry i in country c in year t produces Î¸ict times as
much output as the numeraire country/year. An appealing aspect of this
specification is that Hicks-neutral technology differences are in principle
measurable by applying the theory of total factor productivity measurement to data
on industry inputs and outputs (see, for example, Caves, Christensen and Diewert
(1982)). It is straightforward to show (e.g., Dixit and Norman (1980)) that Hicks-



4
  These derivatives need not exist and will not if there are more produced goods than factors and
there is no joint production. For our purposes in this paper, potential output indeterminacy is an
empirical issue, and we assume differentiability of r(p,v) for the rest of this section for
expositional convenience.



                                                 5
neutral technology differences have general equilibrium effects on outputs that can
be summarized by
       y = rp ( Îp, v )                                                    (2)

where Î = diag{Î¸} is a diagonal matrix of Hicks-neutral technology differences.
This is the model implemented by Harrigan (1997).
      Alternatively, technology may differ because of differences in factor quality
across countries. For example, a hectare of agricultural land may differ in
productivity across countries, or a primary school education may embody greater
human capital in one country than in another. In this case, observed cross-country
technology differences at the industry level arise because of the industry's use of
factors that differ in their quality across countries. If we denote the quality of
factor j in country c in year t, again relative to a base country/year, as Î»jct , then we
have the result (Dixit and Norman (1980)) that
       y = rp ( Îp, v)                                                     (3)

where Î = diag{Î»} is a diagonal matrix of factor quality parameters.
      If the Hicks-neutral technology parameters are constant across sectors,
given by a scalar Î¸, then the homogeneity of r(.,.) implies that aggregate nominal
income is given by Y = Î¸ â r ( p, v ) and
       y = Î¸ â rp ( p, v )                                                 (4)

Similarly, if cross-country factor quality differences are the same across factors,
given by a scalar Î», then we have Y = Î» â r ( p, v ) and
       y = Î» â rp ( p, v )                                                 (5)




                                            6
Clearly, in either case the cross-country differences in technology are pure scale
effects and have no impact on the composition of output5. Multiplying both sides
of equations (1), (4), or (5) by a matrix P = diag{p} with prices along the diagonal
and dividing by nominal GDP, we can write this result as
             1
        s=     P â y ( p, v )                         s â S N â1                     (6)
             Y
where s is the vector of outputs as shares of GDP, and SN-1 is the unit simplex. It is
straightforward to show that (6) is homogeneous of degree zero in p and in v,
meaning that only relative prices and relative endowments matter for the
determination of output shares. If all countries face the same final goods prices
and technology differs across countries in a neutral way, then (6) boils down to a
very simple prediction: output share differences across countries and over time
depend on relative factor supply differences.
1.2 An empirical model
       Our next step is to devise an empirical model based on the above theory that
can be used to draw inferences about the effects of factor supplies on
specialization. To begin, we make the assumption that r(p,v) can be approximated
by a translog functional form6. Abusing notation slightly, let lower case non-bold
face p and v denote the logs of price and factor supply vectors respectively. A
translog approximation for the revenue function is then given by:
                                      1       1
        ln r ( p, v ) = aâ²p + bâ²v +     pâ²Ap + v â²Bv + pâ²Rv                          (7)
                                      2       2

5
 This is the model that is empirically preferred by Trefler (1995). Because technology
differences, which are neutral across industries or factors, do not affect the composition of
output, technology differences do not influence comparative advantage in Trefler's model.
6
 Kohli (1991) presents a comprehensive account of this methodology for time series analysis,
which Harrigan (1997) adapted for panel data models.



                                                 7
The matrices A and B are symmetric, and homogeneity requires that aâ²Î¹Î¹ = Î¹ , bâ²Î¹Î¹ =
Î¹ , AÎ¹Î¹ = 0, BÎ¹Î¹ = 0, RÎ¹Î¹ = 0, and Râ²Î¹Î¹ = 0, where Î¹ is a conformable vector of ones.
In what follows, let i and k index industries, c index countries, j index factors, and
t index time. Assume that (7) holds for all countries and time periods. Taking the
derivative of (7) with respect to pi gives the share of industry i in country c's GDP,
denoted by sict, as :
                    N             M
       sict = ai + â aik pkct + â rij v jct                               (8)
                   k =1           j =1


If there are Hicks-neutral technology differences, then (2) implies that (8) becomes
                    N             N              M
       sict = ai + â aik pkct + â aikÎ¸ kct + â rij v jct                  (8a)
                   k =1           k =1           j =1


Similarly, if there are factor-augmenting technology differences, (3) implies that
(8) becomes
                    N             M             M
       sict = ai + â aik pkct + â rij v jct + â rij Î» jct                 (8b)
                   k =1           j =1          j =1

                                                                 N       M
Notice that homogeneity of the revenue function implies that â aik = â rij = 0 .
                                                                 k =1    j =1


Consequently, if the Hicks-neutral parameters do not differ across sectors, or if the
factor quality terms do not differ across factors, then (8a) and (8b) collapse to (8),
as would be expected from the discussion in the previous section. On the other
hand, if the technology differences of either type are constant over time, but
otherwise unrestricted, then the influence of technology differences collapses to a
country-specific constant, and (8a)-(8b) become:
                          N              M
       sict = ai + bic + â aik pkct + â rij v jct                         (9)
                          k =1           j =1




                                                        8
Unfortunately, internationally comparable data on prices are not available. Instead,
we assume that trade equalizes prices across countries at a point in time up to a
mean-zero error term Îµict and (possibly) a country-specific mean. Then the first
summation in the previous four equations becomes

               ik   pkct = d ic + d it + Îµ ict                                       (10)

Substituting (10) into (9), we arrive at the following error-components
specification for output shares:
                                        M
        sict = ai + d it + Î´ ic + â rij v jct + Îµ ict                                (11)
                                        j =1


This is the equation that we estimate. Given data on output shares and factor
supplies over time and across countries, the parameters of (11) can be estimated by
a regression of output shares on log factor supplies, treating the country effects as
either fixed or random. The coefficients on log factor supplies, the rij, are related
to Rybczynski derivatives: a positive estimate for rij means that accumulation of
factor j raises the share of industry i in national income7. A zero factor supply
coefficient will arise if there are no factor intensity differences across sectors, so
that accumulation leads all outputs to expand proportionately.
       Several features of the model in equation (11) are worth emphasizing. First,
the country effects Î´ic = bic + dic reflect the combined influence of non-neutral
technology differences, plus any differences in internal relative prices, such as

7
  When every factor is used in at least two sectors, and every sector uses at least two factors, and
there is non-joint production, accumulation of a factor necessarily reduces the output of at least
one sector (see, for instance, Jones and Scheinkman (1977)). Because we are not imposing any
such assumptions, no such result holds, and it is possible that factor accumulation raises the
output of all sectors (think of labor growth in the simplest specific factors model). Nevertheless,
some sectors will generally expand faster than others when factor supplies change, leading to
corresponding increases and decreases in the shares of output in GDP.



                                                        9
differences in internal or external taxes and subsidies. Second, the model
potentially applies to all sectors in the economy, not just the manufacturing sectors
that we focus on in our empirical work below. Third, the assumption that the
translog functional form is an adequate approximation over the entire sample may
be restrictive, particularly if the effects of endowments on outputs differ
depending on where a country is in the space of relative endowments â this is the
possibility emphasized by Schott (1999). We return to this issue at the end of
Section 4. Fourth, the natural definition of specialization that comes out of this
model is differences in output shares of GDP. This contrasts with ad-hoc
definitions of specialization that have been used by other authors, such as output
shares of tradeable goods or indexes of ârevealed comparative advantageâ as
pioneered by Balassa (1965).
1.3 An alternative hypothesis
      A limitation of most of the empirical work on comparative advantage
models is that there is usually no explicit alternative hypothesis. Here we consider
a simple alternative hypothesis: the level of development, rather than factor
abundance per se, explains a country's output mix. In this view of the world,
countries develop through capital accumulation and technological progress. With
development comes a change in the output mix and pattern of trade, as countries
progress from specialization in agriculture through labor-intensive manufactures,
capital-intensive manufactures, and finally high-tech goods and tradeable services.
This ladder-of-development model is roughly consistent with a two-factor (capital
and labor), many-good model and is also consistent with product-cycle models. A
simple expression of the ladder-of-development model is that output shares
depend only on the aggregate productivity level, or
       sict = ai + d it + Î´ ic + Î² iÎ¸ ct + Îµ ict                         (12)


                                                   10
where Î¸ct is an index of aggregate output per worker. We estimate this model
below along with the factor endowments model of equation (11).
2 Data
         Estimation of the model of equation (11) and (12) requires data on outputs,
factor supplies, and aggregate productivity for a panel of countries. The sample
used covers 28 OECD and non-OECD countries over the period 1970-1992. This
is the broadest sample of countries for which data on output and factor supplies
are both available and includes both developed and developing countries. See
Table 1 for a description and summary of the dataset.
         Our output data covers twelve tradeable sectors that cover all of
manufacturing output (aside from a small "miscellaneous" category). Data on
other traded goods, such as mining and agricultural output, are not available on a
consistent basis.
         We consider three types of factor supplies: land, labor, and capital. Data on
aggregate capital stocks come from version 5.6 of the Penn-World Tables,
available from the NBER website8. The Penn-World Table classifies capital stocks
into producer durables, non-residential and other construction, and residential
construction. We aggregate only the first two capital stock measures, because for
the purposes of this paper, residential construction is most appropriately regarded
as a component of consumption. Aggregate output per worker also comes from the
Penn-World Tables.
         Our data on land comes from the World Bank's World Tables and is defined
as arable land9. This is a very crude measure of natural resources available for

8
    www.nber.org
9
 Arable land refers to land under temporary crops, temporary meadows for mowing or pasture,
and land under market and kitchen gardens.



                                             11
productive use, but a more nuanced treatment of natural resource abundance is
beyond the scope of this paper.
      We classify labor endowments according to the educational levels of
workers. The data on educational attainment comes from Barro and Lee (1993),
whose data are also available from the NBER website. Barro and Lee construct
estimates of the level of educational attainment in the population, and we use their
data to classify workers into two categories:
      1. Higher Educated: workers who have at least some secondary education.
      2. Lower Educated: workers who have no secondary education (most of this
      category consists of workers with at least some primary education).
The Barro-Lee data ends in 1985, and we extend the data through the mid-1990s,
following Barro and Lee's methods and using updated versions of their data
sources.
      Before turning to statistical analysis, we look at the data through an
extended series of tables and charts. Table 2 shows each country's output share
relative to the cross-country average in 1980 (a middle year in our sample). There
are two primary messages to take away from Table 2. First, most of the numbers
are far from 100, which means that there is a lot of cross-country variation in
output shares. Second, there is also a lot of variation across a row for a given
country: countries have above average output in some sectors and below average
output in other sectors. These two elements of variability, across countries for a
given sector and across sectors for a given country, are what the models of this
paper are trying to explain.
      Table 3 shows factor endowments in 1980 relative to the cross-country
average. As with the output data, there is tremendous variation in relative
endowments, even among the developed countries. The US is only a little above


                                          12
average in capital per worker, below average in land per worker, but has almost
twice the percentage of highly educated workers as the sample average. Japan is
similar to the United States in capital abundance, but has a tiny land endowment.
Australia, New Zealand, and Canada are similar to each other: each is very land
abundant, has a well-educated labor force, and capital per worker similar to the US
level. Korea and Taiwan have very little land, primarily low-educated workforces,
and moderate levels of capital per worker.
       Turning to the time-series variation in the data, the panels of Figure 1
illustrate output share data for five of the twelve sectors10. A glance at these
figures shows that most of the variation in the data is cross-country, but that there
is substantial within-country variation as well. In the food sector, there is less of a
correlation with land abundance than might have been expected. However, the
food category includes processed agricultural products and excludes raw grains
and produce as well as subsistence agriculture. The dominance of the Asian Tigers
(Taiwan and Korea) in apparel-textiles has faded somewhat over time, but not
nearly fast enough to match the virtual disappearance of apparel-textile
manufacturing in places like Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands. The poorer
European countries of Portugal, Spain, Greece, and Turkey have held on to or
expanded their apparel-textile sectors.
       In the chemicals sector, there is great heterogeneity across countries that
doesn't seem to have any simple pattern. Turning to the machinery categories, we
see several striking patterns: Korea and Taiwan have seen the biggest expansions,
while Germany and Japan have large sectors that stayed roughly stable over time.
Many other rich countries saw their big machinery sectors gradually shrink,


10
   The other seven sectors are omitted from Figure 1 to save space. The five sectors shown are
illustrative of patterns seen in the other sectors.


                                               13
including Canada, the US, the UK, Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands. In
electrical and non-electrical machinery, Ireland looks more like an Asian Tiger
than its European neighbors.
       The informal look at the data in Figure 1 necessarily focuses on one
industry at a time, while the theory of comparative advantage involves double
bilateral comparisons: a comparison of relative output levels within and across
countries, and a comparison of relative factor abundance within and across
countries. In Figures 2 and 3, we use "star charts" to make these double bilateral
comparison for a selection of industries and countries in 1980 and 198511. In
Figure 2, each country's output mix is represented by five vectors. The direction of
each vector identifies the industry, while the length of the vector is proportional to
the size of the industry. Loosely speaking, if countries have similar shaped stars,
then they have similar output mixes. If on the other hand, they have very
asymmetrical stars, then they are quite different from the average country. The
volume of each star also gives a rough indicator of the size of the overall
manufacturing sector.
       Figure 2 shows that Turkey, Greece, and Norway have relatively little GDP
produced by these five sectors, while Taiwan, Korea, Germany, and Japan have
large manufacturing sectors. Figure 2 also illustrates that the United States has
large machinery sectors and comparatively small food and apparel-textile sectors,
a pattern also seen in Japan, the UK, Germany, France, Sweden, and other rich
countries. Some countries have very extreme patterns of specialization: Hong
Kong's output is concentrated in apparel-textile and electrical machinery, while
Chile specializes in food and apparel-textiles. In contrast to richer industrial

11
  Our comparison year in Figure 2 is 1985, rather than 1980 as in the rest of the data displays,
because we wanted to include Japan, which has missing output data for 1980, in the figure.



                                                14
countries, Taiwan and Korea are relatively more specialized in food and apparel-
textiles and less in non-electrical equipment. Figure 2 illustrates graphically what
was pointed out in Tables 2: countries differ dramatically in their output mixes.
       Figure 3 uses the same technique to illustrate relative factor abundance in
198012. The US is most abundant in highly-educated workers and also has a lot of
land. Taiwan, Japan, and Korea are all land-poor and differ in their educational
mixes and capital per worker. Turkey is scarce in everything except low-educated
labor, while Norway is the opposite, abundant only in capital and highly-educated
workers. Many European countries have fairly similar relative factor supplies, as
can be seen by the similar shapes of their endowment stars. Figure 3 vividly
illustrates the range of endowment differences in our sample, and these differences
are linked to the specialization differences seen in Figure 2 by the econometric
analysis that follows.
3 Econometric Specification and Estimation
       The data review above, along with the theory behind equations (11) and
(12), guide our choice of estimation technique. For each of the twelve industries,
the dependent variable is the share of a sector's value added in national income
(expressed as a percentage), and the data is an unbalanced panel of countries and
years. The regressors for equation (11) are the logs of relative factor supplies,
which include capital, two types of labor, and land13. For equation (12), the only
regressor is the log of aggregate productivity, measured as total real GDP per


12
  Australia is excluded from this Figure, because its huge land endowment obscures variation in
land among the other countries.
13
  With four factor supplies and the imposition of homogeneity, there are three relative factor
supplies. Since the normalization is irrelevant, we report four separate factor supply effects in
Table 5, but the coefficients sum to zero by construction, and the covariance matrix is singular.



                                                15
worker. The data review suggests at least three issues that need to be addressed:
trends, measurement error, and country effects.
      The models of equations (11) and (12) include time effects, and strong
trends are clearly evident in the data. Although inclusion of time fixed effects in
our estimators is feasible, we include linear time trends instead, for parsimony and
for ease of reporting. This choice has no noticeable impact on any of our
inferences on other parameters. We also allow the error term Îµict to follow a
stationary AR(1) process, with a common AR(1) parameter across countries for
each industry:
      Îµ ict = ÏiÎµ ic ,t â1 + Î½ ict
where vict is white noise.
      There is no question that all of our explanatory variables are measured with
substantial error. The largest amount of measurement error is surely in the cross-
country dimension: land quality differs across countries but is relatively stable
over time, differences in educational systems are large across countries but change
only slowly within countries, and so on. If these country-specific, time-invariant
measurement errors are multiplicative in levels (and therefore additive in logs),
they will be absorbed into the country effects in our estimating equations. The
remaining measurement error is surely important. A solution to this statistical
problem requires the use of an instrumental variables estimator, but unfortunately
no plausible instruments are available. This limitation should be kept in mind in
reviewing our econometric results below.
      The theory, the exploratory data analysis, and a consideration of
measurement error all argue for the inclusion of country effects in our regression
models. A consistent estimator under general conditions is the within or fixed
effects estimator, which uses only time-series variation within countries to identify


                                          16
the parameters of interest. However, a key feature of our sample is that most of the
variation is across countries, and in addition, a major objective of the theoretical
models is to explain specialization across countries at a point in time. We therefore
want an estimator that takes account of country effects but also uses at least some
of the cross-sectional variation in the data, and to this end, we develop a random
effects estimator. The identifying assumption that justifies the random effects
estimator is that the random country effects are orthogonal to the explanatory
variables. This orthogonality assumption is a strong one, but we believe that the
benefits of using the cross-country variation in the data justify the discomfort
caused by making this assumption. Below, we report both the fixed and random
effects estimators, so that the impact of the random effects assumption on
inference can be assessed by the reader. We also report estimates from a between
estimator, which uses only the cross-sectional variation in the data. Details of our
estimators are given in the appendix.
      One of our purposes in this paper is to compare the statistical performance
of the two competing models of specialization, the factor proportions and ladder-
of-development models. These models are not nested, so we compute two test
statistics that are designed to discriminate between non-nested models. The
Akaike criterion is given by
       AICk = ln Lk â pk
where lnLk is the maximized value of the log likelihood of model k, and pk is the
number of parameters. An alternative is the Schwartz criterion,
                             pk ln T
       Schwartzk = ln Lk â
                                2
where T is the sample size. The model choice rule for both statistics is to choose
the model with the larger criteria value. Both models reward goodness of fit and


                                          17
penalize "complexity" as measured by the number of parameters. The complexity
penalty given by the Schwartz criterion, which is derived from Bayesian
principles, is more severe for the sample sizes we consider.
4 Results
       Each of our 12 industry equations includes 23 to 28 countries, with 6 to 23
annual observations per country. The average number of years per country is
roughly 21, with overall sample sizes per industry of 472 to 590 country-year
observations.
       Table 4 shows results for the fixed effects (FE), random effects (RE), and
between estimators of the factor proportions model given by equation (11), with
statistically significant coefficients shown in bold and t-statistics in italics14. The
parameters on relative factor supplies have the interpretation of semi-elasticities:
for example, a one percent increase in the supply of low-educated labor increases
the share of food in GDP by 0.194 percentage points, according to the fixed effects
estimates. It may seem odd that the effect of land, which has essentially no time-
series variation, is identified in the fixed effects estimates. The identification is an
artifact of homogeneity, because the coefficient on land is constrained to equal
minus the sum of the other three factor supply effects, which do have substantial
time series variation. For the FE estimates, then, the land effect may be better
thought of as the combined effect of all time-invariant factor supplies, or
alternatively, as an indicator of non-homogeneity in labor and capital.
       In the food sector, which includes processed food and beverages but not raw
agricultural output, capital abundance reduces output, while labor abundance

14
  In discussing the results, we will adopt the convention that a parameter is statistically different
from zero if the absolute value of the t-statistic is at least 1.62, that is, the approximate 10%
critical value.



                                                  18
(especially skilled) raises it. Similar patterns are visible in the wood-paper and oil-
coal sectors, at least for the RE estimates. Land has a statistically significant effect
on food output in the between regressions, but a negative effect in the FE and RE
results.
       The apparel-textile sector exhibits some informative disagreement between
the FE and between estimates. The between estimates generally confirm our
intuition about this sector: countries that are land and capital scarce and abundant
in labor, specialize in apparel-textiles. In contrast, the within or FE estimates show
that increases in skilled labor over time reduce output. The RE estimator offers an
informative compromise: unskilled labor abundance and scarcity in physical and
human capital is what accounts for specialization in apparel-textiles. The large
positive effect of land in the RE estimates is due to the positive FE estimate of
land, which is itself a consequence of the large negative time series effects of both
physical and human capital.
       Five of our small sectors can loosely be thought of as natural resource based
(wood-paper, printing, oil-coal, glass-stone-clay, and primary metals). Perhaps not
surprisingly, given that our empirical model does not include measures of resource
supplies, the model does poorly in explaining output in these sectors - most
coefficients are not statistically significant. The chemicals sector is also very
poorly explained by the factor endowments model; according to the RE estimates,
abundance in labor and scarcity in land is reliably associated with higher output,
but no other inferences are possible.
       The remaining four sectors, which include fabricated metals and the three
machinery sectors, have much stronger results: capital abundance and land scarcity
lead to greater output in all of these sectors. The FE estimates tend to be more
precisely estimated than the between estimates, perhaps because of the importance


                                           19
of country-effects in these sectors. In the electrical and non-electrical machinery
sectors there, is a strong positive effect of higher educated workers, which is
mirrored by a negative or insignificant effect of unskilled labor. In transportation
equipment, the strongest inference is that capital abundance is key; the labor
effects, in contrast, are imprecisely estimated.
      Overall, the factor proportions model gives a noisy but fairly consistent
story about industrial specialization: human and physical capital abundance raise
output in the heavy industrial sectors, while physical capital lowers output in food
and apparel-textiles. The model has little success in explaining variation in output
in the smaller, more resource-based sectors, probably because we have no
measurements of resource abundance. It is worth comparing our results here to
those of Harrigan (1997), which had a smaller sample and did not use the cross-
country variation in the data, but did have direct measures of technology. In that
paper, Harrigan found that technology and endowments were both important in
explaining specialization among OECD countries. To the extent that technological
sophistication and endowments are not orthogonal (it would be a surprise if they
were), it is not surprising that we find it harder to estimate the effects of
endowments than did Harrigan (1997), because we do not measure technology and
include countries at widely different levels of development.
      Turning to the simple ladder-of-development model of equation (12), Table
5 also presents FE, RE, and between estimates. The results are roughly in line with
what we would have expected from the factor proportions results: higher
aggregate productivity is associated with lower output of food and higher output in
the heavy industrial sectors (fabricated metals and the three machinery categories).
In addition, the RE estimate for chemicals is positive and significant as is the
between estimate for printing. As with the factor proportions model, the within


                                           20
and between effects are opposite in sign in the apparel-textiles sector. Aggregate
productivity also has mixed success in explaining output in the more resource-
based sectors, with the notable exception of primary metals.
      Testing for statistical significance is important but begs the question: are the
estimates economically important? To address this issue, Table 6 reports
standardized coefficients. These are calculated by multiplying the regression
coefficient from Tables 4 and 5 by the ratio of sample standard deviations of the
right and left hand side variables, so that a standardized coefficient answers the
question "by how many standard deviations does an output share change with a
one standard deviation increase in an explanatory variable?". Standardized
coefficients corresponding to statistically significant estimates from Tables 4 and
5 are in bold.
      In the food and apparel-textiles sectors, the effects of high educated labor
and capital are quite large: for example, a one standard deviation increase in
capital lowers each sector by around half of a standard deviation according to the
RE estimates. For the fabricated metals and machinery sectors, the statistically
significant standardized effects are in the range of 0.1 to 0.4. This implies that the
effects of endowments are economically important, but relatively small compared
to the sample variation in output shares. For the other sectors (wood-paper,
printing, chemicals, oil-coal, and glass-stone-clay), the standardized coefficients
are so small as to be economically of second-order importance. In other words,
country effects and noise are more important than measured endowments for these
sectors. By contrast, the ladder-of-development model has much larger
standardized effects in the sectors where aggregate productivity is statistically
significant, in most cases exceeding one in absolute value.




                                          21
      The results of Tables 4 through 6 indicate that both the factor proportions
model and the simple development model have some success in explaining the
data. Table 7 reports specification test statistics, with the "winning" model
indicated in bold. For each industry, the test statistics within a given row are
comparable when the sample size is the same; that is, the estimates that use the
within variation are comparable to each other, while they cannot be directly
compared to the between estimates. Generally, the FE estimates of the
development model are preferred among the estimates that use the within
variation; in a few cases the Schwarz criteria chooses the RE over the FE
estimates, but in only one case, apparel-textiles, does either criteria choose the
factor endowment model over the more parsimonious development model. The
verdict is more mixed for the between estimates: in 4 of the 12 sectors (including
food, apparel-textiles, and electrical equipment), both criteria choose the factor
endowment model, while in the remainder of the sectors the "winner" is the
development model. Overall, then, the development model seems to be preferred
on these purely statistical grounds.
      A final specification issue concerns our working assumption that the
translog functional form is an adequate approximation to the true revenue
function. We investigated this issue informally, looking for break points in the
sample where factor endowment effects changed sign, to no avail. We also
estimated an augmented version of equation (12), including the square as well as
the level of log real GDP per worker as an explanatory variable. There was not a
single statistically significant effect in the between estimates, but we did find
statistically significant quadratic terms in five cases with the FE estimator. The
implied nonlinear relationship between output shares and GDP per worker for
these five sectors is plotted in Figure 4. The figure indicates that with the possible


                                          22
exception of the food sector, with a peak at around $10,000 per worker, the
nonlinearities are not economically very important, and the relationship between
output shares and log GDP per worker can be well-approximated by a linear
model. In brief, if there are diversification cone effects in the world economy, we
cannot find them in our data.
5 Conclusions
      This paper uses a general version of the factor proportions model to
organize a study of the relationship between specialization and relative factor
supplies. Using a panel of 28 countries over 23 years, we report estimates using
both the cross-section and time series variation in the data. We also estimate a
simple ladder-of-development model, which predicts specialization by aggregate
productivity alone.
      The results show that factor endowments do help predict specialization,
particularly in large industrial sectors that are not natural-resource based. These
effects are economically large as well as statistically significant. The ladder-of-
development model is also useful in helping to understand the data and is
preferred on statistical grounds. The statistical analysis is motivated by and
supplemented with an extensive graphical display of the data, which is also
suggestive of the importance of factor supplies in explaining specialization.
      The data analysis in this paper suggests a simple, if not very tidy,
conclusion. Relative factor endowments have a large influence on specialization,
in ways that are consistent with theory and stylized facts about the international
economy. However, factor endowments leave much that is unexplained: there is a
great degree of country-specific idiosyncracy in specialization patterns, and there
is also a great deal of noise. A fuller account of specialization will probably




                                          23
include roles for history, geography, technology, and economic policy, but such an
account will definitely include a role for relative factor supplies.

Capital      From version 5.6 of the Penn-World Table (PWT 5.6) Units: millions
             of 1985 international dollars. See Robert Heston and Alan Summers
             (1991) for details.

Labor       The economically active population (from PWT 5.6) is classified
            according to education level: 1) low, workers with at most primary
            education, 2) high, workers with at least some secondary education.
            Units: Thousands of workers. The educational classification for 1970,
            1975, 1980, and 1985 comes from Barro and Lee (1993); intervening
            years are interpolated. The original data set has been updated to
            include the years 1990 and 1995, using the same equations and data
            sources used by Barro and Lee (1993).

Land        Agricultural land. Units: thousands of hectares. The source is the
            World Bank's World tables on CD-ROM.

                                         Appendix

In this appendix, we discuss our estimation methods for equations (11) and
(12). For the purposes of this appendix, we will generically write an
unbalanced panel model for output shares for industry i as
        sict = Î± ic + Î² iâ² xct + Îµ ict        c = 1,...,C    t = 1,...,Tic   (A1)
where Î² i â\ K is a vector of parameters to be estimated, and xct â\ K is the
corresponding vector of explanatory variables. The time index notation
emphasizes that the panels are unbalanced.
A.1 Autocorrelation
       As noted in the text, we allow the error terms Îµict to follow a stationary
AR(1) process, with a common AR(1) parameter Ïi across countries for each
industry:
       Îµ ict = ÏiÎµ ic ,t â1 + Î½ ict                                          (A2)
where vict is white noise. Our estimator first transforms the model so that the
resulting equation errors are serially uncorrelated. We use the panel data
modification of the Prais-Winsten (PW) transformation proposed by Baltagi
and Li (1991). The PW-transformation, which amounts to quasi-
differencing of equation (A1) with separate treatment of the initial
observation for each country, is valid for both the fixed and random effects
specifications. The transformation is applied to each industry-specific
equation separately and consists of two steps1.
       First, we estimate each industry equation by least squares with
country fixed effects and collect the residuals ÎµËict . Our estimate of Ïi is then
simply the least squares estimate of Ïi from the following regression:
       ÎµËict = ÏiÎµËic ,t â1 + eict                                           (A3)


1
  As noted in the context of the time-series literature by Maeshiro (1979), the separate
treatment of thefirst observation in the PW transformation results in significant efficiency
gains, especially if the explanatory variables are trending (as they are in our dataset).


                                            A1
The second step of the Baltagi-Li procedure is to transform (A1) as follows:

for t = 1, we multiply each observation by    1 â Ï i2 , and for t = 2,...,Tic, we

multiply each observation by (1-ÏiL) where L is the lag operator. All of our
fixed and random effects estimators use the PW-transformed data, so that by
construction the statistical models have error processes free from first-order
serial correlation. The error term of the PW-transformed model is denoted
by uict and is defined as

       uict = Îµ ict 1 â Ïi2            t=1
                                                                   (A4)
       uict = Îµ ict â ÏiÎµ ic ,t â1     t = 2,...,Tic

A.2 Random effects estimation
      For notational convenience we will drop the industry subscripts i in
what follows, with the understanding that each industry is estimated
separately. We assume that the error term uct has a one-way error
components structure with heterogeneous residual variance:
       uct = Î¸ c + Î¶ ct
      Î¸ c  N (0, Î³ c2 )                                           (A5)
      Î¶ ct  N (0, Ï c2 )
Note that we allow the variance of both the random country effect Î¸c and the
remainder disturbance Î¶ct to vary across countries. As it happens, allowing
for heterogeneous variances leads to large efficiency gains in our
application. We also assume that the random effects and the disturbances are
uncorrelated.
      The C country-specific equations observed over Tc time periods can be
conveniently written in matrix form as
       s = XÎ² + u = XÎ² + ZÎ¸ + Î¶                                    (A6)



                                      A2
where s is the (n x 1) vector of observed PW-transformed output shares, X is
the (n x (K+1)) matrix of observed PW-transformed explanatory variables, Z
is the known (n x C) design matrix, Î¸ is the (C x 1) vector of unknown
random effects, Î¶ is the (n x 1) unobserved vector of remainder disturbances,
           C
and n = â Tc is the number of country/year observations in the panel. The n
          c =1

Ã n covariance matrix of u is
       â¦ = ZGZ' + R                                                          (A7)
where the C Ã C matrix G and the n Ã n matrix R are defined as
        G = diag[Î³ c2 ]
        R = diag[Ï c2 I Tc ]
Given some estimates for G and R, the feasible generalized least squares
estimates of Î¸ and Î² are given by
      Î²Ë = ( X â²â¦
                Ë â1X ) â1 X â²â¦
                              Ë â1s                                          (A8)
       Î¸Ë = GË Zâ²â¦
                 Ë â1 (s â XÎ²Ë )                                             (A9)
       Our normality assumptions are used in deriving an estimator for â¦.
We use the restricted/residual maximum likelihood (REML) method
proposed by Patterson and Thompson (1971). As discussed in detail by
Harville (1977), the REML approach to variance component estimation
offers several significant advantages over ANOVA-type (i.e., method-of-
moments) estimators. The first favorable theoretical property of the REML
approach is that it accommodates an unbalanced panel design. Second, non-
negativity constraints on the variance components or other constraints on the
parameter space cause no conceptual difficulties. Third, REML estimates of
variance components take into account the loss in degrees of freedom
resulting from the estimation of the parameter vector Î², thus yielding
unbiased estimates of G and R in finite samples.2

 The fact that likelihood-based estimators are derived under the assumption of a
particular parametric form, generally normality, for the distribution of the data vector is


                                             A3
   The REML approach reduces the maximization problem to one over only
the parameters in â¦. The REML log-likelihood function is given by
                        1       1             nâK
      l (â¦) = constant â ln â¦ â ln X â²â¦ â1X â        ln ( bâ²â¦ â1b ) (A10)
                        2       2                2
where b = s - X[X'â¦-1X] X'â¦-1s. We use a ridge-stabilized Newton-Raphson
algorithm to maximize the log-likelihood function in equation (A10). Using
the REML estimate of â¦, we use equations (A8) and (A9) to calculate the
FGLS estimators of Î¸ and Î² . The heteroscedasticity-consistent asymptotic
covariance matrix of Î²Ì is computed according to Diggle, Liang, and Zeger
(1995):

                                                               Ë â1X ) â1        (A11)

      Ë â1 and uË are the components of â¦
where â¦                                          Ë â1 and uÌ , respectively that
          c         c

correspond to country c.
A.2 Fixed effects estimation
The fixed effects estimator treats the country effect Î¸c as a parameter to be
estimated as opposed to an error component. Under this specification, G = 0
and â¦ = R = diag[Ï c2 I Tc ] . As before, we use REML to estimate â¦, and the
estimator of Î² is again given by equation (A8); heteroscedasticity-consistent
standard errors of Î²Ì are computed using (A11).
A.2 Between estimation
The between estimator of equation (A1) averages the country-specific data
for each industry. The time average of (A1) is given by


not as restrictive as it may seem at first glance. As discussed by Harville (1977), the close
relationship between the distribution-free estimators of variance components, such as the
class of locally best translation-invariant quadratic unbiased estimators (e.g., MIVQUE
and MINQUE), and REML estimators indicates that the likelihood-based estimators of G,
and R derived under normality assumptions are reasonable, even when the form of the
error-term distribution is left unspecified.

We estimate equation (A12) for each industry i with weighted least squares,
with weights given by Ï c = Tic . The heteroscedasticity-consistent
asymptotic covariance matrix of the weighted least squares estimator Î²Ë is
computed according to White (1980).
