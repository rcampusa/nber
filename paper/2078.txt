                  Contractionary Devaluation, and Dynamic Adjustment
                                 of Exports and Wages


                                       ABSTRACT


         Recent macroeconomic models of developing Countries have emphasized the

  possibility of contactionary devaluations, stressing that domestic aggregate

  demand is likely to be reduced by the devaluations while aggregate
                                                                              supply may
  respond only slowly to the change in relative
                                                    prices brought about by the
  devaluation. These results have been obtained in static models. In this

  paper we add wage and export-sector dynamics to the models of contractionary

  devaluation, and show that the effects which
                                                  produce contractionary
 devaluations in the short term can
                                      produce limit cycles in the long run. The
 economy never returns to long-run equilibrium
                                                   following a devaluation, but
 rather moves with fixed periodicity
                                       through successive phases of boom and
 bust.

 1. Introduction.

            Exchange rate changes have important and multiple effects on economic

 activity. When currency parities are fixed, as it happens in rmst developing

 countries, devaluation becomes a key policy option for the authority. The cru-

 cial task is then to assess the impact of a devaluation both on the external

 payments position of the country, which is likely to improve, and on the level

 of economic activity, a more controversial issue. International institutions
                                                                              ty-
pically recommend exchange rate increases as a way of coping with "fundamental"

 imbalances in the countries! external situation, while at the same time domestic

authorities are reluctant to devalue.

           Early economic approaches to this problem were centered around the

well—kno Marshall-Lerner condition, initially stated in a partial equilibrium

framework in which the trade account was in balance and substantial unemployment

existed. In the early fifties this condition was extended to a general equili-

brium, open—econonomy Keynesian multiplier scenario which did not sigiiifficantly

affect the previous result. Subsequent developments considered situations of

initial trade imbalance, as empirical evidence
                                                 overwhelmingly suggested. On the
other hand, the absorption approach stressed the trade balance as the result of

an aggregate income-expenditure relationship, an appropriate framework to study

the distribution effects coming from a devaluation.

           Krugman and Taylor (1978) develop a general equilibrium ndel inte-

grating income redistribution effects of a devaluation from an initial trade im-

balance situation. Their key conclusion is that a devaluation has contractionary
                                       2



effects on domestic income, while improving the trade balance.

          This paper adds a dynamic structure to their model by allowing slug-

gish adjustment of wages through a traditional Phillips curve. Under these con-

ditions a devaluation is again contractionary, but this time the system is

unstable due to the interaction of a demand determined home goods sector, a f 1-

xecI supply of exports and the Phillips curve. After the exchange rate increase

there are no forces in the model to stop the downward trend.

           Available empirical evidence suggests a more realistic scenario where

exports respond to price incentives in addition to wages. In this case the ex-

port response is not only expansionary, but also pushes the system towards sta-

bility. It is possible, however, that even with a large long run elasticity of

exports with respect to wages, the economy does not smoothly return to equili—

brium after a devaluation. If the export sector does not react fast enough to a

devaluation the economy is unstable around the steady state. Nonetheless, even

in this case it may be possible to show that a Poincare-Bendixson limit cycle

exists, thus stopping the downward trend of the economy. Under some circuntstan-

ces the existence of a Hopf bifurcation cycle may also occur. At least one of

these cycles is stable.

           The paper starts with a brief review of devaluation theory and evi-

dence, placing Krugman and Taylor in its appropriate relation to it. The next

section introduces wage dynamics and studies the stability properties of the mo-

del, while section 4 considers both wage and export adjustment. Finally, section

5 states the main conclusions.

 2. A brief review on devaluation
                                    theory and evidence.

            Early analyses of devaluation were centered around the well-knowii

 Marshall—Lerner condition1 stating that a devaluation will improve the trade

 balance as long as

                         +            1


 where r is the home
                       country's Price—elasticity of demand for   imports and r j
 the world's price-elasticity of demand for the country's exports.

           This condition was derived starting from a scenario in which the home

 Country specializes in the production of
                                               an exportable good whose Supply in
terms of domestic currency is
                                  infinitely elastic. As a corollary, the devalua-
tion brings about a one—to—one
                                 deterioration in the terms of trade if the
country is a price taker for imports. The trade
                                                account is assumed in equili—
brium at the moment of the devaluation.

           Further theoretical developments      come with the work of Robinson
(1947)2 and Hirschman (1949),
                                  who investigate the effects of a devaluation
starting from a trade imbalance. Under these
                                                 conditions it becomes necessary to
distinguish between the trade balance
                                           expressed in domestic currency and its
counterpart in foreign currency, since
                                          they will not necessarily move in the sa-
me threction. The practical relevance of
                                           this analysis is immense Since most -if
not all—countries devalue their
                                   currency in the face of a trade deficit. What

matters then to solve the payments problem is the foreign-currency balance,

which is more likely to improve. However, it is the trade balance expressed in

domestic currency which is relevant in terms of aggregate demand; this one is

more likely to deteriorate. Thus, a not uncommon outcome of a devaluation in

this scenario is a contractionary effect on domestic income coupled with an im-

provement in the foreign currency denominated trade balance.3

              Intuition for this result may   be strengthened by thinking of a deva-
luation as having two types of effects: (i) a valuation effect on the initial

quantities of imports and exports at the higher exchange rate, and (ii) a quan-

tity effect, given by the responsiveness (i.e. the elasticities) of imports and

exports to the price change, evaluated at the previous exchange rate. When trade

is initially balanced, the higher cost of imports exactly cancels out with the

additional export revenue (at the original quantities). The valuation effect is

nil in this case and only the quantity effect is left. But when the country

starts from a trade deficit the valuation effect operates towards a deteriora-

tion in the domestic currency denominated balance and thus contracts internal

demand for domestic goods (unless there is an offsetting effect coming from a

reduction in savings).

              The elasticities approach was originally stated as a partial equili-

briuxn   relationship involving only the markets of imports   and exports. Harberger

 (1950) and Laurseri and Metzler (1950) adequately restate it by considering the




         3mis point has been stressed, among others, by Cooper (1971a).

 general equilibriwn effects coming from the Keynesian open-economy
                                                                    multiplier.
 The modified relationship,
                             however, presents the same qualitative result as
 before: an improvement in the trade balance following a devaluation
                                                                     requires
 that the SUXT1 of the relevant
                                  price elasticities exceeds one.

              Sidney Alexander (1952) called attention to the fact that if a deva-

 luation was to improve the current account it had to reduce in
                                                                    some way expendi-
 ture relative to income. His
                                  insight, coming from the national income
                                                                             identity,
 is the well known Keynesian
                                  "absorption approach". Looked in this perspective,
 the potential terms of trade
                                  deterioration arising from a devaluation was expec-
 ted to reduce savings for a given level of income and thus to
                                                                  deteriorate the
 current account; this is better—known
                                       as the Laursen-Metzler effect. Recent con-
tributions by Obstfeld (1982), Sachs (1981, 1982a) and Svensson and Razin
                                                                          (1983)
have pointed out that the direction of the effect on the current
                                                                  account is am-
biguous, and depends on the terms of trade deterioration being
                                                               transitory or
permanent.

             Dornbusch (1976) studies the conditions under which the absorption

approach can be properly integrated with the
                                                  earlier elasticities approach. He
also concludes that, starting from trade balance, if the terms of trade
                                                                          remain
unchanged after the devaluation the
                                    commercial balance can not deteriorate.

             Distribution effects can also play a role on expenditure determina—

tion following exchange rate movements. In particular, Diaz-Alejandro
                                                                      (1963) has
argued that a devaluation is likely to
                                          redistribute income from workers to capi-
talists. If the former
                         group has a higher marginal propensity to consume than
                                         6


the   latter one, expenditure will go down and so will output in a demand determi-

ned model. The classical example is the Argentinian devaluation of 1958 which,

according to Diaz-Alejandro (1965), importantly accounts for the 1959 recession

in that country through its redistribution effect from workers to landowners.

             A   different line of argument has been stressed in   the   monetary ap-
proach to   the balance of payments,4 where a devaluation is analyzed through its

effects on the money market. More precisely, an exchange rate increase will pro-

voke a stock excess demand for money; with passive monetary policy, the only way

to go back to equilibrium is by running balance of payments surpluses whose ef-

fects on the money stock are assumed not to be sterilized by the authority. This

type of models, based in a line of thought dating as far back as David Nurne

(1752), have almost always been carried out under full employment and with money

as the only asset.5 When nontradeable goods are introduced in this framework

the devaluation has real effects, but only in the short run. The link is for-

mally made by Dornbush (1974) using the ad-hoc expenditure function, later

grounded in optimizing behavior by Dornbusch and Mussa (1975). The initial ex-

cess demand for money provoked by the devaluation is translated into an excess

of income over expenthture which pushes downward the relative price of nontra-

deable goods, thereby causing consumption and production switches and a surplus

in the balance of payments. The effect lasts only while there is unsatisfied ex-

     5An extension to more than one asset is found in Dornbusch (1975) in what
could be called a portfolio approach rather than a monetary approach.

  cess demand for money, and so it
                                      dissappears through time. The Only way in which
  a devaluation can have long run effects (other than reserve
                                                                 accumulation) is in
 the presence of wage/prje stickiness, where it serves to
                                                              simultaneously achieve
 internal and external balance.6

             Kruginan and Taylor (1978), hereafter referred to as K—T, pursue
                                                                                 a
 structuralist approach for an economy composed of three types of goods:
                                                                          exporta—
 bles, importables and nontradeables.
                                       A Keynesian stand is taken in the home good
 market, where output is demand deter-mined.
                                             Imports are neither produced nor con-
 suxned domestically but rather used as intermediate inputs in
                                                               the production of
 the home good and exports are in fixed supply. In this
                                                        sense, the Keynesian and
structuralist approaches towards exports can be considered as two
                                                                  extremes, with
neoclassic analysis (the one used in
                                     the monetary approach, if any) standing so—
mewhere in the middle.

           Two crucial features of K—T have been borrowed from the earlier
                                                                               con-.
tributions discussed in this section: the existence of two
                                                            groups of agents with
different marginal propensities to consume and the starting
                                                             point of the economy
from a trade deficit.

           An extension of K—? to
                                      account for substitutability both in produc-
tion and in consumption is
                              provided by Hanson (1983). His results challenge tho-
se of K—T regarding the effect
                                    of a devaluation on domestic income and the
balance of payments. Indeed,
                                 K—T's conclusions come as no surprise in view of




    6See Dorrthusch (1974).
                                      8


their assumptions which close any possible channel through which a devaluation

could be expansionary.

           Empirical work on the effects of devaluation does not abound. Cooper

(1971b), analyzing the short run effects (after one year) of 24 devaluations for

the period 1953—66, ...including most of the major devaluations by developing

countries in the early 1960..." finds that in nearly three-fourths of the

cases the trade balance improved. He also reports a negligible impact of the ex-

change rate change on the terms of trade and a response of domestic wages and

prices that falls short of the currency depreciation. Connolly and Taylor (1976)

study 18 devaluation episodes in 14 mostly developing countries for the period

1959-70. They conclude that exchange rate increases appear on average not to ha-

ve a significant effect on economic activity while at the same time generally

improving the balance of payments. Krueger (1978) analyzes 22 devaluations in 10

third world countries to conclude that only in three cases it was followed by a

signifficant recession.

           More recently, Gylfasson and Schmid (1983) have developed and tested

a one sector model in which output is determined by the interaction of supply

and demand. A devaluation influences the former through the cost of intermediate

inputs and the latter through substitution, income and real balance effects. The

results for a group of 10 countries (5 industrialized and 5 developing) show a

contractionary effect of an exchange rate increase only in 2 cases (India and

 the U.K.). Larrain (1985) presents evidence indicating that medium to large de-

 valuations tend to decrease the product wage, at least in the short run, except

 in economies undergoing strong and steady depreciation of their currencies, arid

 that employment in the tradeables sector is a decreasing function of the product

wage.

              One of the reasons for the lack of empirical work on devaluations no

doubt arises from the difficulty of separating it from other parallel influences

in the economy. In particular, exchange rate changes in developing countries are

usually accompanied by liberalization and/or stabilization attempts, as stressed

by Cooper (197th) and thoroughly studied in the NBER project headed by Krueger

and Bhagwati.




3. Contractionary devaluation and Wage Adjustment.

              The original K—T model, with its notation kept as much as possible

for comparative purposes, is stated below:


(1) h = (a1hw+apm)(1+z)


(2) P = (1_tx)px*e


      m =   (1+tm)pm*e


              (1)—(3) are the price formation equations, with tax—corrected purcha-

from profits in exports. With this latter sector in fixed supply output can only

vary through home goods which are demand determined, as specified below.

               Many empirical studies, as well as casual evidence, have shown the

 existence of some stickiness in the behavior of nominal wages for different

 countries and sample periods. But sticky wages are not the same as fixed wages,

 as K-T assume, and once we depart from the very short run it is necessary to

 provide a mechanism for wage adjustment.

               Doing so will imply adding a dynamic structure to an otherwise static

 model. In the new scenario wages will be sticky in the sense that they will not

 react instantaneously to clear the labor market; rather, they will adjust down-

 wards under conditions of excess supply in the labor market and upwards when ex-

 cess demand prevails. This defines a Phillips curve type equation which is
 specified below

      .

              Inflationary expectations are not included in (13) because the ex-

change rate and world prices are assumed to be fixed and thus there is no infla-

tion in the long run. We further assume no population growth and a totally

inelastic labor supply; with this L* becomes a constant.8

              The model consists now of equations (1)-(8).             It is clear that in
this modified scenario the immediate effect of a devaluation can not be diff e—

rent than in K—T since nominal wages are fixed on impact. Rather, we will be in-

terested in studying the dynamic properties of the system.                  In particular,

stability requires that dw/dw'(O, since the model has only one differential equa-

tion. We notice that


(9) dw/dw = (dw/dL)(dL/dw) = 4)'alh(dH/dW)

             Our equation for output determination in the home good market is ob-

tained by replacing (1)—(5) and (7) in (6). Using this, and after some computa-

tions, we can express (9) in terms of the underlying parameters of the model as



(10) dw =    $'alh(l+z)   {(—Y)KO'+a1h )wMPm*e_YrXPx*e)
     dw         DOPh

                           +alh( IwtmMpm*e+ Yrtxx e) }

where K0 I=alXaP*e


                                  z(11r) ] + aP*m                      J}   )0
      D0 =    {alh   w[(1-Iw) +                     e(1+tm) [,+i_yr)


             Expression (10) is clearly positive under the original K-T assump-

tions, rendering the model unambiguously unstable.

             The intuition for this instability result goes as follows. The deva—

luation, by decreasing real wages, depresses demand for home goods and hence

output and employment. But the increase in unemployment, through the Phillips

curve, drives downward the nominal wage and with it the real wage. This further

decreases demand and there are no forces in the model to stop this downward

trend. Formally, we can notice that the sign of dw/dw is exactly the opposite as
                                          13



 that of dH/de; thus, whenever a devaluation
                                                is contractioriary instability is
 also present.

            Graphically we can plot the equation of wage dynamics and the general

 equilibrium relationship between employment and wages from the home good market

 (NH) in (w,L) space, as presented in figure 1. The initial assumption about
                                                                                do-
 mestic goods being demand determined
                                        implies that the economy will always lie in
 some point of the HH schedule, with the long
                                                 run equilibrium also requiring wa-
 ges to be at rest (point E). The preceding discussion
                                                         tells us that if any shock
 (e.g. a devaluation) moves the economy
                                          away from steady state, forces in the mo-
del will further nve us away from equilibrium. This explains the divergent

arrows being drawn through HH. We notice that the divergence of the economy is

discontinuous in the right direction. After a while wages will turn so high that

they will account for practically 100% of the costs of producing H. At this

point real wages become constant and emloyment and
                                                       home good output stabilize
while nominal wages continue their upward trend.

           The Conclusion coming out from this analysis is twofold:

(a) The original K—T model is considerably weakened if we allow for some plausi-

ble response in wages, because by becoming unstable it can not be used for coin—

parative static purposes.

(b) The fundamental result of K-T remains true, in the sense that a devaluation

has perverse effects. But this time the
                                           contraction persists through time dri-
ving downwards both output and employment.

 4. Wage and export dynamics.


 4.1. The new setup.

             A most natural way to search for stabilizing forces would be to relax

 the X—T assumption of a fixed supply of exports determined by existing capacity,

 which has been carried on until now. Indeed, available international studies

 such as Sachs (1982b, 1983) and Larrain (1985) show a significant, negative res-

ponse of employment (and thus of output) to real wages in the tradeable sector

for both industrialized and developing countries. The fact that the employment

response is contemporaneous suggests that a devaluation, operating through a re-

duction in real wages, has an effect in the supply of tradeable goods even in

the short run.

            A straightforward extension of the X—T model to allow for export res-

ponse to prices in a static framework will simply introduce another source of

ambiguity in the devaluation effect on real income. Our attempt is, however, to

Study the dynamic adjustment of the economy after a shock. We will assume accor-

dingly that exports are neither in fixed supply, nor that they adjust

instantaneously; rather, they will respond through time to movements in the real

wage. An adjustment pattern such as this can be formally derived from an inter—

temporal profit-maximizing firm facing adjustment Costs in the hiring and firing
of labor.   This strategy has not been pursued to keep the model as simple as

possible, avoiding expectationa]. issues.

            Let the long run supply of exportable goods (X*) respond to unit pro-

fits in the standard form
                                          15



(11) X = 6(px*e_alxw)           0) 0     for (Px*e_alxw) > 0

       =0                                for        e-alxw) ( 0


            The above equation is ad-hoc in one important respect. In principle,

output should respond not only to the current level of profits but also to the

entire path of future profits. This limitation becomes serious in an economy

where nominal wages quickly respond to price changes,9 but looses importance

the slower wages catch up with inflation. Available empirical evidence tends to

support this latter view. In a study of 24 devaluations for the period 1953-66,

and including most major exchange rate changes in developing countries, Cooper

(1971b) found that "...twelve months after devaluation..., general wholesale

prices will have risen less than this, consumer prices will have risen by about

the same as wholesale prices and, except where devaluations are small, manufac-

turing wages will have risen by less than consumer prices...Thus nonwage income

of employed factors —mostly profits and rents- show an increase in real terms a

year later and it is this increase that provides the incentive for the necessary

reallocation of resources..."'° Larrain (1985) has also presented evidence for

12 developing countries indicating that devaluations, except when small, tend to

reduce the product wage in the manufacturing and mining sectors.

            In our   scenario   the level of X is fixed on impact; its response th-

rough time is given by

             The parameter of export response (Y') has been specified as an in-

creasing function of the difference between the current and desired level of ex-

ports in a similar way as the quantity response mechanisms used by Beckman and

Ryder (1969) and Mas—Colell (1985). Thus, the more a devaluation increases per—

unit profit, the faster will exports increase towards their long run equili-

brium. On the other hand, if profits are squeezed by wage increases so that

(x*_x) turns negative, exports will contract increasingly faster as this gap wi-

dens. When profits are down to zero or turn negative export production will tend

to stop altogether. This pattern of response is illustrated in figure 2.

             Replacing (11) in (12) we get

4.2. Local stability.


                We have thus two downward sloping schedules in (X,w) space (X=O and

w=O) whose relative slopes will presumably be related to the issue of stability.

where ' has been evaluated at steady state.


            Even though both (19) and (20) have ambiguous signs, there are three

parameters which play a key role in the above expressions: (a) The speed of ad—

justnent of exports toward their long run        level   (); the higher this value, the

more likely that the trace condition will be satisfied, although it has no ef-

fect on the sign of the determinant.

(b) The parameter of wage adjustment (4)         influences   only the trace; the higher

it is, the more likely the unstable outcome occurs.

            From (19) the exact relationship between these two coefficients and

the parameters of the model for a stable trace condition is:


 (21) 1 >   +'alh(l+z)   {(   IW   Y)aXa Pm+alhwmYrXPx) }
              D1Ph


 (c) The long run response of exports to price incentives (0), even if it plays

no role in the trace, the higher its value the more likely that the determinant

will be positive. The exact relationship for this condition to be satisfied is:
                                            19


 (22) 0 >    {(   r)alxxamhPm+alh(YwMPm_yrXpx)   }


                                             }




              Therefore,   stability requires both a fast adjustment of exports and a

 high long run response of them to price incentives. That the source of potential

 instability arises from the interaction of a demand determined home good sector

and the Phillips curve is also clear. Indeed, if the contractionary effects from

a devaluation coming from the different marginal propensities to consume and the

initial trade deficit were not present, conditions (21) and (22) get immediately

satisfied.

              We also notice that, as could be expected, the relative slopes of the

two loci and the stability issue are not
                                             independent. From equations (16), (18)
and (22) it is apparent that the value of 0 required to make the determinant po-

sitive is exactly the same one needed for the w=O locus to be steeper than X=O.

             In figure 3 the two possible cases are presented. From the transition

matrix 2 we can draw the corresponding arrows of motion and study the direction

of forces implied by the resulting vectors in each of the four regions.
                                                                                This
confirms our earlier discussion; when X=O is steeper than w=O (case of a low 8)

a clearly divergent path when away of equilibrium arises. On the other hand,

when X=O is flatter than the
                                wage schedule the system presents a counterclockwi-
se Rvement.

             What is the economics out of these stability conditions? We recall

that a devaluation, by cutting real wages, has both a contractionary effect in

 the demand for home goods and an expansionary influence on exports through time.

 In figure 3B the long run export response is not big enough and the contractio—

nary effect dominates; in this case unemployment will increase putting downward

pressure on the wage rate and leading to the unstable outcome. However, 0 being

sufficiently high to guarantee that the relative slopes are correct as in figure

4A is not enough for a stable outcome. From now on we will concentrate in the

case in which stability depends on the relative speeds of adjustment of wages

and exports (the trace condition), assuming the determinant to be positive and

thus ruling out case 3B.

           Since the trace is now the sole condition which determines
                                                                        stability,
we can distinguish two possible cases from equation (21) which will be illustra-

ted graphically and conceptually with the help of figure 4.

(1) If exports adjust slowly relative to wages condition (21) will not be satis-

fied and we can expect the unstable outcome. This situation may be visualized by

starting at a point like A in figure 4, where the wage is low enough to encoura-

ge the export sector and unemployment prevails. The economy begins moving south-

east through the dotted line with the wage declining due to unemployment and

exports nving slowly upwards. At B the wage stops moving (the natural level of

unemployment is reached), but there still remain incentives to expand exports;

this leads to overemployment and w starts rising. At C exports stop growing but

overemployment keeps increasing wages. Now, if exports would respond fast we

will soon move in the horizontal direction; but this is not the case and the ad-

justment is more upwards than to the left. Continuing the analysis it is easy to

 see that the system diverges. (ii) Conversely, if exports are fast to react re-

 lative to wages condition (21) will be satisfied and local stability is guaran-

 teed. Let us start again from point A; this time the low wage makes exports

 expand rapidly and the economy moves from A to B' through the solid line. Once

w crosses the X=O level (above C') exports take
                                                        a small period of time to con-
tract. We quickly converge to equilibrium through the solid path AB'C'E.

             Notice that in the adjustment process the home good sector is also

reacting. In region I while wages fall employment is
                                                              expanding because exports
increase; the net effect on labor income and thus on the home good sector is am-

biguous. Region II, with exports, wages and employment growing is a boom period

for the whole economy. On the contrary, area IV is a period of generalized de—

pression. The situation in the four regions is summarized in Table 1.

4.3. Towards global stability.

             So far, we have just analyzed local stability around the steady state

and concluded that only if exports adjust fast enough relative to wages the eco-

nomy will go back to equilibrium when a shock disrupts it. In this section we

will show that even if this condition is not satisfied the system has forces

that will drive it to a stable cycle at some distance of the equilibrium. Thus,
                                          22



the fact that the economy is not locally stable around steady state does not

mean that it will explode through time.

           It is clear that if the model were totally linear, local and global

stability conclusions will necessarily coincide. Indeed, local dynamic analysis

is done by linearizing around steady state which is obviously unnecessary when

the system is already linear. Our model, however, has two sources of nonlinea-

rity as defined: on the one hand it is defined only for positive values of w and

X, and on the other, the speed of adjustment of exports ('F') increases the fart-

her away is the current level with respect to the desired one. The idea behind

this formulation is that if we start from equilibrium, as wages fall (increase)

the export sector becomes increasingly profitable (unprofitable) for given ex-

change rate and world price, and thus exports would react faster.

           We are then interested in studying the case where local instability

occurs (tr(Z)>O, det(Z)>O), but in which export responsiveness grows with the

distance from equilibrium. Suppose for a moment that the value of 'F' relative to

the other parameters of the sdel is such that the trace at equilibrium is very

close to zero (i.e. the system is borderline stable or unstable). Then we can

appeal to Hopf bifurcation theory (see Mas—Colell (1985))12 and obtain the

existence of a Hopf bifurcation cycle as the economy goes from stable to unsta-

ble (or viceversa). Technically, it is necessary that the trace has some nonli-

nearity nbedded, which is guaranteed in our model by the shape of the export

adjustment function. It should be kept in mind, as Mas—Colell (1985) remarks,

that Hopf bifurcation is still a local analysis of dynamics in the neighborhood

of the steady state, since the trace condition looses its meaning when going

away of equilibrium. A plausible form of the Hopf cycle is shown in figure 5.

           The appropriate study of the stability properties of the Hopf cycle

involves examining third, fourth and even higher order derivatives of the func-

tions. This task may be perfectly justified for a mathematics study, but lacks

any significant economic meaning and will not be attempted. Getting the correct

stability conditions by ill—grounded assumptions about the 'I and $     functions
will not improve our understanding about how the economy works.

           Rather than going in that direction we will go in another, less res-

trictive way. An attempt will be made to show that the system has at least one

stable cycle by using the Foincare-Bendixson theorem, valid for global dynamic

analysis and with no restrictions in the size of the trace.13     Following Beck-

man. and Ryder (1969), Benassy (1984) and Mas—Colell (1985) the conditions for

the existence of this type of cycle are:

(i) The long run equilibrium is unstable.

(ii) There exists a bounded, invariant arid simply connected region.


Definitions:

(D.1) Invariant region is one which is absorbing in itself, that is, every point



     3The analysis of Poincare—Beridjxson is carried through for the case in
which the equilibrium is unique. If the global extension of condition (22) is
met, uniqueness unambiguously holds. However, (22) is sufficient but not neces-
sary for a unique equilibrium, and thus stronger than we need.

starting inside the region will remain inside it.

(D.2) Globally absorbing is a region where every point will enter in finite time

(either starting inside or outside it).

(D.3) Informally, the simply conriectedness condition means that the region has

no holes inside it.

Theorem: The dynamic system defined in equations (8) and (12), under the condi-

tions in (8), (11), and (12) contains at least one stable cycle.

Proof: To demonstrate the theorem we must show that the requirements (i) and

(ii) for a Poincare-Bendixson cycle are met. This is done below.

           Condition (i) is immediately met when the trace is negative around

the steady state, which is the case we are analyzing.

           To show condition (ii) we need to construct a region with the desired

characteristics, which will be done with the help of figure 6. We first notice

that the two axes are natural boundaries since the system is only defined for

positive w and x. Let us start in a point like A, to the right of the intersec-

tion between the X=O locus and the horizontal axis, where the level of X is hig-

her than its equilibrium. The dynamics of the model start moving the economy

north—west, with wages rising and exports contracting. As wages rise the export

sector moves farther away from equilibrium, speeding up its own reaction; becau-

se export contraction finally dominates over the upward trend in wages the eco-

nomy moves in a path like AB, collapsing in the vertical axis. By the conditions

in (8) and (12) the point of intersection of this trajectory and the wage axis

can be -at the most-at C. Exports are there at equilibrium but forces still

 exist in the economy to decrease wages. Once point C is crossed exports are

 again profitable and, with wages falling, the movement is south-east. it becomes

 then clear that OABCO is a bounded, invariant
                                                 and simply connected region inside
 of which there exists at least
                                  one stable limit cycle as figure 6 shows. This
 completes the proof of the theorem.

            The region OABCO is not globally absorbing since, for example, points

 starting above w1 will not collapse into it within a finite time. Rather, those

trajectories will touch the vertical axis above w1 and will remain at the level

of X=0 with nominal wages steadily
                                     increasing. Real wages, though, will converge
to a constant value as labor approaches 100% of the costs of producing the home

good. At that point all real variables in the model will have reached stationary

values.

           Combining the Hopf bifurcation (NB) and the Poincare-Bendjxson (PB)

analyses we have three possible cases:

(i) If the NB cycle exists and is stable, then there exists at least one stable

cycle in the system, since it may happen that PB and NB coincide.

(ii) If the NB cycle exists and is unstable, there exists at least one other

stable cycle, since PB is always stable. The minimwn number of cycles in this

situation is two: one stable and one unstable.

(iii) If the KB cycle does not exist, there is at least one stable cycle in the

system (PB).

           Notice that a large value of '        (fast   export adjustment) is not
enough to generate cycles. If in addition 'V"=O the system will be globally sta-
                                      26



ble, provided condition (2) is met, but no cycles will occur.

           The theoretical results analyzed are an adequate representation of

the situation lived by many third world nations. In particular, Latin—American

countries typically undergo cycles in which periods of slow overall growth,

booms and recessions alternate. This is in the spirit of the predictions of our

model, as illustrated in the four regions of figure 6. If we start at point D,

the economy is beginning a boom period (region II) with both exports and wages

expanding. The boom runs out of steam because real wages get too high, squeezing

exports (III) and a recession is ad—portas. The farther away from equilibrium

with wages rising, the faster exports contract; at some point wages can no lon-

ger keep rising and unemployment starts developing. A deep recession then deve-

lops with wages and exports falling (IV). After a while wages have fallen enough

and exports are again profitable (region I); wages will continue falling until

the export sector has expanded enough. When the economy reaches point D a full

cycle has been completed and the process is about to start again.

           It is important to notice that the existence of cycles with large am-

plitudes can only be accounted for by Poincare-BendiXSOfl type analysis. Hopf

theory is only a local phenomenon occurring in the vicinity of the steady state

which can not explain wide fluctuations.

           This analysis suggests that for a good number of developing countries

 neither neo—classical nor structuralist models may be applicable. If the supply—

 response forces in the economy are weak enough around the steady state the long

 run equilibrium will never be reached. This does not imply that the economy will
                                         27


 diverge towards zero output and employment, which would happen if wages keep fa—

 lung and supply does not react. The outcome is likely to be somewhere in the

 middle, with the economy undergoing a stable cycle at some distance from the

 equilibrium.


 5. Conclusion.

           This paper has been focused on the potential contractionary effects

of a devaluation and the subsequent dynamic
                                              adjustment of the economy after it.
The starting point is Kruginan and Taylor (1978) (K-T) who emphasize the redis-

tribution effects of a devaluation from an initial trade deficit, drawing on

earlier contributions by Diaz-Alejandro (1963, 1965), Robinson (1947), Hirschman

(1949) and Cooper (1971a). Their main conclusion is that a devaluation is unarn—

biguously contractionary, a hardly surprising result given that exports are in

fixed supply and there is neither substitution in production nor in consumption

in their model.

           Dynamics are introduced in the model by letting wages sluggishly ad-

just through time. In this scenario the devaluation continues being contractio—

nary, but in addition the equilibrium is shown to be unstable because the

initial reduction in real wages decreases demand for home goods which in turn

reduce employment, bringing the real wage further down; there are no forces in

the model to stop this downward trend.

           A nre realistic scenario is then set with exports adjusting through

time in addition to wages. This extension is suggested by empirical studies such
                                        28


as Sachs (1982b, 1983) and Larrain (1985) which show a contemporaneous response

of employment (and thus of output) to real wages in the tradeable sector for a

group of industrialized and developing countries. In this framework, local sta-

bility around steady state is achieved both with a high long run response of ex-

ports to price incentives and with a higher speed of adjustment in exports than

wages. Because the model has some nonlinearities embedded, the existence of lo-

cal instability does not imply global instability. Indeed, when exports adjust

slowly in relation to wages around the steady state, the economy is locally uns-

table, while at the same time it undergoes at least one stable cycle. In parti-

cular, conditions are thscussed under which a Hopf bifurcation cycle and a

Poincare-Bendixson limit cycle exist.

           The key element explaining the existence of a Poincare-Bendixson cy-

cle, the one more relevant to explain wide fluctuations, is the pattern of ex-

port response, whose velocity increases (relative to wages) when going away from

equilibrium. Thus, if we consider a devaluation which is contractionary on im-

pact, at some thstarice of steady state the expansionary forces coming from ex-

port reaction to increased profitability will be strong enough to offset the

negative influences arising from income redistribution and the initial trade de-

ficit. This stops the divergent path of the economy.

           This analysis seems an appropriate representation of the reality in a

number of developing countries where neither neoclassical nor structuralist mo-

dels seem fully appliccab].e. The supply-response forces may be weak enough

around steady state so that long run equilibrium will never be reached. This
                                      29


does not imply that the
                         economy will diverge through time towards lower levels
of output and employment, which would happen if
                                                  wages keep falling and Supply
does not react. Rather, third
                              world countries typically
                                                        undergo periods of slow
growth interrupted by booms and
                                depressions, the characteristics of the cycle
described in this paper.
