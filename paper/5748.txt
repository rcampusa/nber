                                              ABSTRACT



        We characterize the equilibrium exchange rate in a general equilibrium economy without
imposing    strong   restrictions    on the output   processes,     preferences,    or commodity      market
imperfections.   The nominal exchange rate is determined by differences in initial wealths–the
currencies of richer countries tend to be overvalued by PPP standards-and by differences of marginal
indirect utilities of total nominal spending.    Changes in the exchange rate mirror differences in
growth rates of real spending weighted by relative risk-aversion (which can be time-varying and can
differ across countries), and in the case of non-homothetic       utility functions, differences in inflation
rates computed from marginal spending weights.        Thus, standard regression or cointegration tests
of PPP suffer from missing-variables biases and ignore variations in risk aversions across countries
and over time, We also present cointegration tests of the version of the model with constant relative
risk aversion (CRRA) and homothetic preferences. When nominal spending is given an independent
role (next to prices) in the short-term dynamics, both PPP and the CRRA model become acceptable.

              The Equilibrium Approach to Exchange Rates:
                            Theory and Tests


Relative to the monetary models of the exchange rate, “equilibrium” models offer the advantage of

being based on mainstream          micro-economics       and general-equilibrium      analysis. 1 Still, these

equilibrium    models of the exchange rate often depend on very specific assumptions                about the

number of goods and countries, the utility functions and production            processes,    and the type of

friction in the international   goods markets. Our objective is to characterize the exchange rate in a

general equilibrium    setting without imposing strong restrictions on the model. In contrast to most

of the Purchasing     Power Parity (PPP) literature, where the relation between exchange rates and

prices is derived rather informally, we show under what alternative sets of assumptions the general

equilibrium   model reduces to PPP, and, especially, how exchange rates are determined when PPP

does not hold. We also formulate and implement a new test of PPP against a specific alternative.



        On the theoretical front, we characterize the equilibrium exchange rate in a multi-country

and multi-commodity         economy       where   there may be fixed and/or         proportional    costs     for

reallocating goods across countries, and where agents’ utility functions need not be homothetic,               or

of the HARA class, or identical across countries, Our main findings are the following:

(a) In general, the nominal exchange rate mirrors differences             in initial wealths and marginal

     indirect utilities of nominal spending. The effect of initial wealths is that, by PPP standards,

     the currencies of richer countries tend to be overvalued. Necessary conditions for differences

     in marginal    indirect utilities,   on the other hand, are (a) commodity        market imperfections

     antior   differences   in consumption        preferences,   and (b), perhaps    less predictably,      risk-

The Equilibrium   Approach   to Exchange Rates                                                           pa~e 2



     aversion.

(b) The popular        case of risk-neutrality     and homothetic    preferences    has rather exceptional

     implications.     First, under these assumptions     relative PPP holds irrespective     of commodity

     market imperfections       and differences in consumption preferences. Second, initial wealth does

     not affect the equilibrium        if (and only i~ the assumptions      of perfect goods markets        and

     identical preferences are added.

(c) In another special case—with            homothetic,   constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility

     functions—we       obtain a tractable and testable generalization    of the traditional PPP equation.

     Specifically,     according    to the CRRA model there are two missing variables                in the PPP

     equation (the two countries’ nominal spending);           moreover, the elasticities   of the exchange

     rate with respect to the price indices need not be identical across countries,            and their sign

     differs from what PPP predicts.

(d) In a (more realistic)        model with non-homothetic      preferences,    the nominal exchange       rate

     change depends not only on the standard (“average”) inflation differential across countries (as

     in the PPP model) but also on the inflation differential         computed on the basis of marginal

     consumption weights, growth in real spending, and the (generally time-v~ing)              degree of risk

     aversion in the two countries.

(e) From items (b) and (d), we infer that standard regression or cointegration            tests of PPP suffer

     from missing-variables         biases and ignore variations in risk aversions across countries and

     over time. In hyperinflation        samples, relative PPP may seem to hold fairly well because the

     missing variables then behave quite similarly and because the elasticities of the exchange rate

     with respect to all variables sum to unity,



         We complement         our theoretical   analysis of the exchange      rate with empirical     test of a

version of the model with constant relative risk aversion and homothetic              preferences,    using the

Johansen and Juselius (1990) cointegration framework. We find, first, that the outcome of the tests
crucially depends on whether (and how) nominal spending is allowed to enter into the short-term

dynamics      of the exchange     rate: If nominal     spending   is entirely   absent from the short-term

dynamics, or when only real spending is included in the vector autoregessions            (VARS), we reject

both PPP and the CRRA model. Second, when nominal spending is given an independent                     role

(next to prices) in the short-term dynamics, both PPP and the CRRA model become acceptable.

We provide a theoretical explanation         for the inability to distinguish between the PPP and CRRA

models in samples where nominal spending and price data have sirnil~ time paths.


           The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section I, we present a generalized version

of the Stockman (1980) equilibrium           model, In Section II, we analyze deviations from Absolute

PPP under homothetic        utility—first    for the general case, and then for the special cases of risk

neutrality and constant relative risk aversion. We also discuss the implications of the CRRA model

for cointegration    tests of exchange rate models. In Section III, we test this special version of the

model. As mentioned        before, the results are ambiguous,       In Section IV, we therefore return to

theory, We derive a general model for changes in the exchange rate and we use this model to re-

interpret regression    tests of relative PPP and cointegration      tests of the CRRA model, Section V

concludes, A glossa~       summarizing      the mathematical notation used in the paper is included at the

end of Section V.




I.          The Economy and the Equilibrium Exchange Rate


In this section, we first describe a model of a multi-country,        multi-good economy with imperfect

commodity       markets. We impose only a few (very standard) restrictions on preferences,        and none

on production       or endowment       processes     or on the degree     or type of commodity      market

imperfections.     In the second part of this section, we chmacterize the exchange rate in this general

setting.
        The economy that we consider consists of M 22 countries. We focus on two arbitrarily

selected countries that are referred to as the home country (subscript k = 1) and the foreign country

(k= 2). Each country has a representative        consumer with a standard, strictly quasi-concave          utility

function defined over N 21 goods. Across countries these representative individuals may differ in

terms of risk-aversion, consumption preferences, and initial wealths.


        The outputs of each of the N goods can be stochastic over time. The economies could be

exchange economies where output is given by exogenous endowment processes (as in Stockman

(1980) and Lucas (1982)) or production economies with endogenous                  investment decisions (as in

Dumas (1992) and Stulz (1987)). The specification            of the production or endowment processes is

quite general: some goods may be produced everywhere, while other goods maybe produced only

in some countries.     International   shipment of these goods may be costly for some or even all of

these goods ; these costs are assumed to be purely variable costs (as in Dumas ( 1992) and Sercu et

al. (1995)). Given these costs for transferring goods across countries, some goods may be traded

all the time, some may be tradable in the strict sense (that is, traded only if the price difference is

sufficient] y large to justify incurring the shipment costs), and some goods may be de facto non-

tradable.z For simplicity, money is introduced into the model via the Lucas (1982) cash-in-advance

constraint.3


        We assume       that financial    markets    are complete     and perfect.     Thus, the outcome         of

decentralized    consumption      and investment      decisions   is identical   to the solution    of a central




20ther frictions could be introduced, like shipment lags (goods sent from one country at time t arrive only
at time t+]) and transaction lags (a trade arranged at time t is implemented     at time t+ 1 only). It can be
shown that neither transaction lags nor shipment lags affect any of our conclusions.

3Essentia11y the same results would be obtained if real money balances were introduced as an argument in
the utility function, except that the price index will contain the interest cost of money balances—see, for
instance, Stulz (1987).
planner’s problem of the form

                                                          M
                                  T

                                                               ek Et[ ~ uk(~k(s)) ds] .                  (1.1)
                                                         k=2


This optimization      is constrained      by an opportunity     set that depends on the currently       available

outputs, the production       functions,    and the shipping technology.      We do not need to specify the

opportunity set explicitly. In (1.1), ~(t) is the vector of consumption quantities Ckj(t) of good j (=1,

. . .. N) consumed by the representative         individual in country k (= 1, . . .. M) and Uk is the utility

function of the representative          investor in country k. The relative weight assigned by the central

planner to each of the other countries, ek, generally is a function the initial distribution of wealth in

the equivalent       decentralized       problem.d    In turn, these initial wealths      depend   on the initial

endowments,       the characteristics    of the (stochastic) investment functions or endowment processes,

the frictions     in the international      markets   for consumption     and capital goods, and the utility

functions.s     For example, one sufficient (but not necessary) set of assumptions            to obtain gk = 1 is

when the utility functions, the initial endowments,            and the parameters of the output process of all

countries are identical.



        Given the above assumptions, we now derive the exchange rate. Define the net endowment

of each good in each country as the amount available for consumption.                In an exchange economy,

the net endowments         are, of course, identical to the gross endowments,             while in a production

economy we need to set aside the resources needed for the optimal investments identified from the




41n a decentralized  economy with a complete capital market, there exists a portfolio strategy that allows
investors to implement the central planner’s solution. For example, consider the case where t3~ = 1, utility
functions are equal, and shipmen[ costs are zero. The central planner’s solution then is to give each of the
M countries an equal amount of consumption, The portfolio strategy that implements this plan is that each
country holds 1~-th     of the shares of each productive asset, so that each country can obtain 1~-th      of
world output.

5When commodity preferences are not equal, t32 obviously depends also on the (arbitrarily      chosen)   size of
the reference bundle in which each country’s real wealth is expressed.

solution of ( 1.1). If ( 1.1) is maximized,           it must be impossible          to further increase the utility from

current consumption           in one country without reducing either consumption                        in another country or

investments.      Denote the aggregate utility of the central planner from immediate consumption                                    by

(boldface) U(.):
                                                                   M
                                      U(q(t)) = ul(Ql(t))       + ~.2ek uk(a(t)).                                          (1.2)


Thus, in the optimum identified from ( 1.1), U(q(t)) must be at its maximum subject to the feasible

set implied by the net endowments               and the transaction technology. From this Pareto-optimality                         of

consumption,       it follows that the relative price for any pair of goods can be read off as the marginal

rate of substitution (MRS), along U(~(t)), in the optimum.

         Let us chose, as the pair of goods, one unit of good j located in country 1 and one unit of

the same good j located in coun~                2. The local-currency prices of these goods are denoted by plj(t)

and pzj(t). Because the relative price has to be computed                        from nominal prices expressed                     in a

common         numeraire,     we need a reference           numeraire      and an exchange              rate. Without        loss of

generality, we select currency 1 as the numeraire, and use the symbol S(t) to denote the exchange

rate (units of country-1 currency per unit of currency 2). Below, we write the condition that equates

the relative price to the MRS:


                                            _                 dU(t)/~Czi(t)
                                                                                                                           (1.3)
                                                            = dU(t)/~Clj(t) “


In Proposition       1, below, we now link the nominal exchange rate to the marginal indirect utility

function.6 The indirect utility function, V(Mk(t), Pk(t)), is defined as



                  V(Mk(t), pk(t)) ~ ~~,           {Uk(gk(t)) - Ak(t) [j~lckj(t)          Pkj(t)   - Mk(t)]   }J            (1 .4)


where Mk(t) is the amount of nominal spending, expressed in units of currency k. The marginal




6Proposition    1 is a familiar    result in the Unbiased   Expectations   literature;    see, for instance,      Lewis (1995).
The Equilibrium   App roach to Exchange Rates                                                               page 7



indirect utility of nominal spending in country k is the multiplier, A(t), in the above optimization

problem:
                                                        ~v(Mk(t), ~(t))
                                            Ak(t) =
                                                             dMk(t)        ‘



Proposition       1: The nominal exchange          rate, S(t), is proportional      to the ratio of the marginal

indirect utility of total nominal spending in the two countries:

                                                            A2(t)
                                                ‘(t)   = ‘2 Al(t) I                                       (1.5)



Proof Substitute (1.2) into (1.3) to relate the central planner’s MRS to the marginal utilities of the

two countries:

                                     y                 = e2 ~Uz(t)/~Czi(t)
                                                          dUl(t)/dClj(t)   “

Then solve for the exchange rate:
                                               ~Uz(~z(t)) / ~C2i(t)
                                                     P2j(t)
                                     s(t) = ez ~u~(~~(t)) / aclj(t) c
                                                             plj(t)

To obtain (1.5), we substitute           dUk(t)/dckj(t)    = Ak(t) pjk(t), which is the first-order      condition

obtained from the optimization problem defined in (1.4). +


         We wish to study the implications                of Proposition       1 for the real exchange    rate and

deviations    from PPP. In Section II, the focus is on the level of the exchange rate. Most of this

discussion is confined to the special case of homothetic utility functions. h this section we obtain a

new sufficient condition for PPP, and a testable generalized equation that contains PPP as a special

case. We test this model in Section III. In the non-homothetic             preferences case, it is rarely possible

to obtain a tractable characterization           of the level of the exchange rate from ( 1.5); however, as

shown in Section IV, an interesting general characterization of changes in exchange rates is always

possible,
II. Characterizing           the tivel     of the Exchange Rate


In this section, we consider the special case of homothetic preferences. We first discuss the general

implications of homothetic preferences for the exchange rate equation (1.5). We then consider two

alternative   special cases that both imply PPP, artd we derive the CRRA exchange rate model of

which PPP is a special case. Lastly, we discuss the implications                                of our theoretical          results for

empirical tests of PPP.


11.A     Implications        of the Assumption       of Homothetic             Utility Functions


By definition,     a homothetic      utility function can be written as uk(~(t))                        = @[Uk(Qk(t))], where

Uk(Qk(t)) is linear homogeneous              in the consumption                quantities       and where @k is a positive

transformation.      The function        LIk(Lk(t)) can be thought                  of as summarizing                the consumption

preferences    (which are independent              of wealth or total spending),                  while the curvature              of the

transformation,        @(.), reflects     the degree of risk aversion,                     This separation           of consumption

preferences from risk aversion makes it possible to obtain simple statements about the level of the

exchange rate in terms of the level of nominal spending, the level price and relative risk aversion.v


        If the function        @[uk(~k(t))]        is at its maximum                    value given a consumption               budget

constraint,   then Uk(Qk(t)) must also be at its maximum value subject to the same Constraint. It iS

well known (see, for instance,            Samuelson      and Swamy (1974)) that the solution of the linear-

homogenous        problem,


                  Vk(Mk(t),Qk(t)) E Max {uk(~k(t)) – ~k(t) [~ckj(t)                       Pkj(t) – Mk(t)]      } ,            (2.1)
                                         Ckj(t)




7With non-homothetic     utility, similar results can be obtained          only in very special cases. One example              of a
tractable non-homothetic function is u(t) = [Hjfll       (Cj (t) –   mj   ) ~’
                                                                             J ] l-n,    where risk aversion     is a   constant (q)
and the optimal consumption      pattern depends    on total spending        and prices in a very straightforward           way,
iS Of the fO~ Vk(t) = Mk(t)~k(pk(t)).         The fUnCtiOn~k(~k(t)) is independent Of nOfind            spending,

Mk(t), and is linear homogeneous in the prices. Accordingly,              ~k(W(t))     is interpreted as the price

level, and vk(t) = Mk(t)/~k(~(t))        is interpreted as real spending. These properties of homothetic

fictions    lead to the following restit:


Proposition    2: If utility functions   are homothetic,        the nominal exchange rate, S(t), and the real

exchange rate, Wt), are given by

                                              d@2(t)/dv2(t) Hi(t)
                                    S(t) = ‘2 d@l(t)/dvl(t) H2(t) ‘                                      (2.2)


and
                                               l-I’2(t)        d@2(t)/dvz(t)
                               z(t) = s(t) —
                                           l-f](t)        = ‘2 d@l(t)/dvl(t)   “                         (2.3)



Proof Using the relations Vk[Mk(t), ~(t)] = ~(vk(t))               and vk(t) = Mk(t)/TIk(t), we can specify the

marginal indirect utility of nominal spending as follows:

                          dvk(Mk(t), ~(t))       = d@k(Vk(t)) ~Vk(t)
                                dMk(t)               dvk(t)   dMk(t)

                                                     =   d@k(v(t))     1
                                                                                                         (2.4)
                                                          dvk(t)   ~k(~(t))    “


Substituting (2.4) into (1.5) we obtain (2.2) and (2,3). +


Corollary     1: The real exchange          rate for countq       k relative to country    1 is the MRS of that

countq’s real spending, v~t), relative to vi(t).

Proof This result follows immediately           from (2.3) and U() = @l(vl(t)) + ~k,z @(vk(t)). +



Corolfury 2: If there are transaction costs or fconsumption              preferences    dl~er, then for given net

endowments the currencies of wealthier countries tend be overvalued by PPP standards.

Proof: From Corollary       1, we need to show that at the optimum, the MRS of vz(t) relative to v] (t)
tends to be higher when (3zis higher. The optimum is jointly determined by the indifference curves

and the opportunity        set. First consider        the effect of initial wealths       on the central planner’s

indifference curves. A higher initial wealth for country 2 generally implies a higher value for ez,s

which means that, in the (v2, VI) plane, the indifference curves are more to the right, reflecting the

bias in favor of country-2            consumption.        For instance,    in Figure      1 the curve     through   V’

corresponds    to a higher value of 82 than is the case for the cume through V. Thus, for given

endowments     a higher initial wealth for country 2 will produce a higher MRS provided that the

opportunity    set is convex. We now show that the opportunity                   set is convex if (a) there are

transaction costs or (b) consumption preferences differ across countries.

(a) The graph on the left in Figure 1 illustrates the case of one good and a proportional                  transaction

cost equal to ~, as in Dumas (1992). The bound on the consumption                      opportunity   set is piece-wise

linear: its slope is <1 +~) when country 2 is importing (that is, when the consumption                      point V =

(v2, VI) is to the right and below the net endowment point Q = (qz, ql)), and its slope is -1/(1+~)

when county 2 is exporting. Thus, the opportunity               set is convex, and equilibria more to the right

(like V’ relative to V) correspond to a higher MRS and, therefore, a higher real exchange rate.

(b) The graph on the right illustrates           the case of many commodities,           no frictions, and different

consumption    preferences,      Uk(gk(t)). The problem of deriving the opportunity             set for international

real spending,       (v1, v2), is isomorphic           to the problem      of deriving      a country’s   production

opportunity set in the Heckscher-Ohlin            model: the role of the Heckscher-Ohlin         linear homogeneous

production    functions     with different      factor intensities   is taken over by the linear homogeneous

preference    functions     uk(~) with different consumption            preferences;     and the role of the factor

endowments     is taken over by the aggregate endowments,                 ~ = qlj + q2j, for each of the goods.

Thus, with different consumption preferences the opportunity set is strictly convex. Therefore, the

solution for a higher value of ez, V’, again results in a higher MRS than the solution for lower (32,




‘The one exception    is discussed   in Proposition   3(c).
v. #



          The second corollary fits in with the stylized fact that currencies of richer countries tend to

have higher real values. Thus, the effect of relative wealth (via 92) complements                  the Balmsa

(1964)-Samuelson          (1964) productivity-based    explanation of the same empirical regularity.


11.B.      Purchasing       Power Parity


Much of the theory of exchange rates is based on PPP, In this section we discuss PPP as a special

case of (2,2)-(2.3). In the next section we then derive a more general theory of the exchange rate

that will provide an alternative hypothesis to PPP in our empirical tests,


         The general model of the exchange rate in the case of homothetic preferences, (2.2)-(2.3),

simplifies to relative PPP if the ratio of the marginal utilities of real spending is a constant. This

will be the case under the alternative assumptions           (a) and (b) listed in Proposition   3, below. Case

(a) in the proposition       corresponds   to the standard (commodity-market        based) set of assumptions

for PPP, Case (b), being purely utility-based,          is less familiar. Case (c)—the intersection of (a) and

(b)+esenes           special attention because this represents the sole case where relative wealths are not

a determinant of the exchange rate.


Proposition     3.

(a)     Ifcommodi~        markets are frictionless    and agents have identical, homothetic utility finctions,

        then Absolute PPP holds.

(b)     If agents have linear homogeneous utilipfinctions,          the real exchange rate equa[s a constant,

        62,—that is, Relative      PPP holds—irrespective        of market impeflections    and dl~erences       in

        consumption preferences.

(c)     02 is independent of the initial wealths if and only if agents huve identical linear homogeneous

        utili~fimctions     and markets are pe~ect. Then 02 = 1.

    Proof: To derive Proposition                     3(a) from (2.3), note that under the assumptions                   of friction less

    markets and identical               homothetic       utility functions,    the relative consumption             bundles       will be

    identical across countries. That is, at any time t there is but one composite good in the world (with

    time-varying         composition         proportional    to the aggregate consumption             amounts of the individual

    goods). It follows that at any moment the central planner’s opportunity                            set in the (VZ,VI) plane is

    bounded by a minus 45-degree                      line. Thus, if the optimum is an interior one, the MRS in that

    optimum always equals unity.

               The proof of proposition                3(b) immediately       follows upon specifying ~k(vk(t)) = vk(t) in

    (2.2):9
                                                                                    l-1](t)
                                            (risk-neutral model:)         s(t) = e2 ~2(t) .                                     (2.5)



               To reconcile the if-part of Proposition 3(c) with Proposition 3(b), we need to show that 62

    must be equal to unity when preferences are identical and frictions are absent. This can be shown

    by contradiction. 10Under the assumptions of Proposition 3(c), the central planner’s opportunity set

    is again bounded by a minus 45-degree line. However, with risk neutrality—that                                  is, U(t) = VI(t) +

    ez vz(t))—the central planner’s indifference curves degenerate to straight lines with slope –Oz. This

    geometry immediately means that, if Oz were different from unity, there would always be a comer

    solution: one country would never consume anything, which is incompatible with the existence of

    two countries. To see why the irrelevance of initial wealths for the detetination                              of exchange rates

    holds only under the highly stylized assumptions                      in part (c) of Proposition          3, just note that when
r
    there are transaction             costs or when preferences differ across countries, the opportunity                        set is no




    9This ignores possible           constants   (like @k(vk(t)) = ak Vk(t)); such constants    are assumed      to be part of ek,
    See also footnote 5.

    10An alternative line of proof is as follows. Assume that there is one (composite) good, no friction, and
    that @k(vk(t)) = vk(t)]’~  where q (#o) is relative risk aversion. It follows easily that the consumption
    ratio,    v2(t)/vl   (t), will    be constant     and equal   to (32 1/~ . As   a result,   the   ratio   of initial     wealths,
    W2(0)/Wl(0),         must be t321/’l, too. This then means that 62 equals            [W2(0)/Wl(0)]~,        which      converges
    towards unity as q approaches            zero,
The Equilibrium   Approach   to Exchange Rates                                                                 page 13



longer linear (see Figure 1), while the indifference              curves become non-linear when there is risk

aversion. Either is sufficient to produce an interior solution. Thus, any value of OZthen implies a

well-defined      sharing rule for consumption           and, therefore, corresponds      to a specific division of

initial wealth. *


        We finish this section with two comments on Proposition                  3. Our first comment relates to

the perhaps puzzling indeterminacy               of the central planner’s consumption     allocation problem in the

case discussed in Proposition          3(c). Mathematically,      this indeterminacy    stems from the result that,

under the assumptions           in Proposition     3(c), all indifference curves must be minus 45-degree lines

and, therefore,      parallel     to the budget line. To better understand             the economics      behind   this

indetetinacy,       consider the portfolio decisions in the underlying decentralized              economy. While,

with identical preferences and perfect markets, consumption decisions are similar across countries,

the portfolios      held by the (risk-neutral)         representative   agents will differ unpredictably        across

countries, This is because, in equilibrium,             all assets provide the same expected real return, which

then implies that all fully invested portfolios              are equally acceptable     to a risk-neutral    investor.

Because of the indeterminacy           of the portfolios chosen in the past, very little can be said about the

allocation   of consumption         across countries at any given point in time. All we know is that the

dividends    will finance a consumption              plan that clears the commodity       markets. To reflect this

indeterminacy,       the central planner’s indifference           curves U(V1 (t),v2(t)) must rank all market-

clearing consumption         patterns (V1(t), vz(t)) as equally desirable, regardless of the initial wealths.

This means that the slope of the indifference cume, 62, is equal to (minus) unity everywhere.


         Second, note that Proposition            3 allows us to clear up some confusion that exists about the

Unbiased     Expectations         Hypothesis       (UEH) and the Siegel Paradox.          Specifically,     the Siegel

Paradox seems to suggest that no equilibrium                can be obtained in a risk-neutral      world unless the
The Equilibrium   Approach   to Exchange Rates                                                              pa~e 14



exchange rate is non-random. 11 To resolve the issue, we note first that risk-neutrality               ought to be

defined in real terms, not in nominal            terms (as the UEH does). Stated differently,            the UEH

implicitly assumes that inflation is deterministic.          But Proposition     3(b) tells us that, if inflation is

known, the future spot rate automatically             becomes non-random.      Thus, under the assumptions        of

the UEH—risk-neutrality          and no inflation risk-the     Siegel Paradox does not arise, and there is no

problem with obtaining equilibrium.


         One implication        of Proposition   3 is that, within the logic of standard micro-economics,

variations   in the real exchange        rate are prima facie evidence of risk aversion when, at least,

consumption       preferences    are homothetic.      We shall address the implications       of non-homothetic

preferences in Section IV. Before that, we derive a testable equation for the level of the exchange

rate in the homothetic/CRR4          case, and present some empirical results.


II. C     Models with Constant Relutive Risk A version


Backus and Smith (1993), Dumas (1992), Stulz (1987), and Sercu et al. (1995) discuss models of

the real exchange rate with one or two goods (whereof at least one good is tradable only at a cost),

and constant relative risk aversion. These models are special cases of the general, homothetic-

utility model (2.2). To see this, we first consider the case where relative risk aversion is constant

and not equal to unity; that 1S, we specify (2.2) fOr @k(vk(t)) = Vk(t) I“qk, where ~k is the pratt-

Arrow measure of relative risk aversion, With this definition of ~(vk(t)),               we obtain:


                                                        1-   2 vz(t)-~z nl(t)
                   (CRRA model:)         S(t)=
                                                 ‘2     &      v~(t) -n] nz(t)




11Denote the forward rate, set at time t for delivery at time t+n, by F(t, t+n), and denote a conditional
expectation about the future spot rate by Et(S([+n)), The Siegel paradox is that, when exchange rates are
uncertain, the UEH from country 1‘s point of view is incompatible with the UEH from country 2’s point of
view: F(t, t+l) = E[(S(t+n)) precludes l~(t, t+l) = E1(l/S(t+n))  unless S(t+n) is non-random.

The last line follows after substituting          vk(t) = Mk(t)~k(t).       In the log-utility case (q= 1), equation

(1.5) immediately leads to

                                                                         Ml(t)

        Assuming two countries and identical relative risk aversions across countries, Sercu et al.

(1995) derive (2.6) and (2.7) for the special case of one (imperfectly tradable) good, while Backus

and Smith (1993) derive (2.6) for the case of CES consumption                        preferences      defined over one

perfectly tradable good and one non-tradable good. Stulz (1987) derives (2.7) from a two-country

production economy with log investors that have identical, Cobb-Douglas                         preferences defined over

a perfect] y tradable good and a non-traded good. Iz Thus, we see that these special versions are

easily generalized to cases where there are N goods (regardless of their degree of tradability)                            and

M countries, and where the degrees of relative risk aversion and the commodity preferences differ

across countries.


         From Proposition        3(a), equations (2.6)-(2.7) collapse to Absolute PPP in the special case

of identical consumption         preferences and perfect commodity markets. Thus, unlike standard PPP

theory, the CRRA model offers a specific equilibrium                value for the exchange rate when there are

frictions in the commodity         markets or when consumption           preferences differ. To characterize this

equilibrium       one needs just two additional        (observable)     variables,       the nominal spendings.         This

means that we now have a specific alternative when we test for PPP. An additional advantage of

the CRRA model is that it can be linearized               by taking logs. Given the well-documented                     non-

stationarity   of the right-hand-side      variables, this log-linearity       of equations (2.6)-(2,7) also allows

the utility function rather than through a cash-in-advance constraint.
us to use a cointegration      framework      rather than the less powerful    techniques   that rely on

differencing the data. In the next section we discuss how one can test the alternative exchange rate

models (PPP versus CRRA).


11.D     Testuble Distinctions    between the PPP and CRRA Models of the Exchange Rate


        In Sections 11.B and 11.C, both the CRRA and PPP models have been derived as exact

relations. In practice, no proponent of PPP would reject that theory just because it does not hold

perfectly at all times. Instead, the hypothesis is said to hold “in the long run”. Once one admits

deviations   in the short run, the term “long-run PPP” obviously          cannot mean that there are no

deviations over long horizons; instead, “long-run PPP” can only mean that the ex ante variance of

future deviations   increases less than proportionally       with the time horizon. Or, more precisely,

“long-run PPP” is commonly equated with stationarity of the real exchange rate.



        Tests of long-run PPP (in the above sense of the term) include time series analysis of real

exchange rates and cointegration tests. The empirical evidence is mixed. AutoCorrelation tests often

cannot reject the hypothesis     of a non-stationary   real exchange rate (see, for instance, Adler and

Lehman (1983)), However, the more powerful augmented Dickey-Fuller                test does reveal mean

reversion in real exchange rates (Abuaf and Jorion (1991)). Cointegration        tests, on the other hand,

tend to strongly reject PPP (see, for instance, Ness&n (1994) and the references therein).


        In light of our theoretical analysis, we offer the following comments on these tests of PPP.

First, the presence of mean-reversion        in the real exchange rate does not allow us to distinguish

between the PPP and Cm           models because the real exchange rate implied by (2,6)-(2,7) is likely

to be stationary, too. To see this, re-cast model (2.6) in real terms:


                                                   1- qz    vz(t)-~z
                                    z(t) =                                                       (2.8)
                                              ‘2   1 -Tll   Vi(t)-lll “


It is quite likely that the real spending ratio on the right-hand side of (2.8) has finite variance. For
The Equilibrium   Approach   to Exchange Rates                                                             page 17



instance, when all goods are tradable at a positive but finite cost and consumption              preferences are

identical   across countries,      then the relative   real spending      ratio in (2.8) is clearly bounded.

Differences in spending patterns may lead to deviations from Relative PPP if, within each country,

relative prices change over time. However, when productive resources can be redeployed                      across

sectors, one would not expect relative prices to wander off to infinity or zero, within a country.

Thus, relative price effects are not likely to imply martingale-behavior         in the exchange rate either.



         In light of the probable boundedness          of the consumption       ratio, stationarity   of the real

exchange rate is not a good criterion if the purpose is to distinguish between the PPP and CRRA

models. Rather, the appropriate question is whether deviations from PPP are correlated with real

spending    data, with the direction       of the correlation     being consistent   with our prior that ~k is

positive (and, almost always larger than unity). 1s Alternatively,            the question to be answered is

whether, after controlling        for nominal spending,      the nominal exchange      rate depreciates      when

domestic prices rise faster than foreign prices, rather than the inverse (as PPP predicts). This type

of question is better addressed         in a cointegration      analysis rather than a univariate     time series

investigation of real exchange rates.



         This then brings us to our second comment on empirical tests on PPP. True to their main

purpose, standard cointegration        tests have focused exclusively on the long-term relation between

exchange rates and prices, and have simply taken for granted that no other variables are relevant in

the VARs—the        first stage of a cointegration     analysisar      in the short-run dynamics in the final

equation,   Yet, PPP can also be obtained by setting q k = O in the CRRA model, (2.6); and this




 13Following Lucas (1982), many have tested the CRRA model in the special case of            equal q’s. From
equation (2.5), we see that there is no need to impose this restriction. For example, in a   plot of means or
standard deviations of log real rates against means or standard deviations of log ratios     of real spending
ratios, Backus and Smith (1993) find no linear pattern. Such a finding, being consisten[      with differences
in q’s across countries, is not evidence against the general CRRA model, and a fortiori        not against the
equilibrium approach to the exchange rate.
The Equilibrium   Approach   to Exchange Rates                                                                      pa~e 18



CRRA model predicts a long-run relationship between not just exchange rates and prices but also

nominal spendings:

                  1-111
                  ()
 logs(t) = log e2 l_~2  + TI1 logM] (t) – T2 10gM2(t))             + (1-~1)     log~l(t)   – (1–T2)     10g~2(t)      .

                                                                                                                   (2.9)

In estimating (2.9) in its general form (without a priori restricting the q’s to be zero), both nominal

spendings    and prices are allowed to play independent              roles in the short-term          dynamics.       Thus,

when testing for PPP as a special case of (2.9), the first-pass VARS and the short-tern                     fluctuations

are not the same as in the standard cointegration test of PPP (where spending is not allowed to play

any role). We provide evidence, in the next section, that such differences in the modeling do affect

the conclusions     regarding PPP. As a theory of exchange rates, PPP of course cannot answer the

question which variables should enter the short-term model, because PPP is utterly agnostic about

what variables       explain    movements        of the real rate within        the leeway provided          by market

imperfections     or differences in consumption preferences.

         Note that a similar VAR-modeling           decision has to be made when the Cm                  model is to be

analyzed. Again, theory has no suggestions               about what explains short-tern          deviations from the

equilibrium because theory derives (2.8)-(2.9) as an exact relation. The pragmatic solution again is

to assume that the short-term fluctuations             are driven only by the variables entering the long-term

cointegration     relation. But even within this assumption           two approaches        are possible. First, one

could work with (2,9), which lists five nominal variables; then the assumption is that the nominal

prices and spendings are allowed to independently affect the short-run fluctuations of the exchange

rate. Alternatively, one could re-cast (2.9) into real terms, as follows:


                                                                  Mz(t)                Ml(t)
                                           ()
                             rIl(t)
                             —      =   log 62 -l–~2     + n2 log —
                                                                  I-Iz(t) -nl      log ~l(t) “                 (2.10)
                     s2(t)   ~2(t)



In estimating     the cointegration      vector(s) between the real exchange rate and the real spending

variables in (2.10), one then assumes that also for the first-pass VARS and the short-run dynamics
The Equilibrium   Approach   LOExchange Rates                                                          page 19



the real consumption         data suffice; that is, unlike in tests of model (2.9) one now constrains      the

coefficients of logMJ(t) and lognj(t)       to be the same (up to the sign) in the long-run cointegration

relationship, and likewise in the short-run fluctuations. Again, it is not a priori obvious which way

of specifying the VARS and the short-run dynamics is the correct one.


        To summarize:        univariate tests of stationarity of the red exchange rate do not allow us to

distinguish between the PPP and CRRA models of the exchange rate. As to cointegration              tests, we

can test the following hypotheses:

●   Hypothesis     PPP( 1)—the standard cointegration      test of PPP: the data are compatible       with the

    hypothesis ?lk = O for all countries k, and the short-term dynamics involve only inflation rates.

●   Hypothesis PPP(2): the data are compatible with the hypothesis qk = O for all countries k, and

    the short-term dynamics involve both inflation rates and changes in nominal spending.

●   Hypothesis     PPP(3): in the long run, the real exchange rate is unrelated to real spending data,

    and the short-term dynamics involve only changes in real spending.

●   Hypothesis     CRRA( 1): the data are compatible with the hypothesis qk >0 for all countries k,

    and the short-term dynamics involve both inflation rates and changes in nominal spending.

“   Hypothesis     CRRA(2): the data are compatible with the hypothesis qk >0 for all countries k,

    and the short-term dynamics involve only changes in real spending.



        Note, lastly, that the power of such cointegration       tests may be low, Assume, for instance,

that the CRRA model is true, and that one tests Hypothesis            PPP( 1), which omits the nominal

spending variables. One could still observe a PPP-lilce relation between the exchange rate and the

domestic     and foreign price level if each of the omitted nominal-spending           variables   is highly

positively   correlated      with the price level of the corresponding     country.   For instance,     under

hyperinflation    circumstances,    the log of a country’s nominal spending closely tracks the log of that

country’s price level; thus, under those circumstances       the estimated coefficient for the price level
The Equilibrium   Approach   to Exchange Rates                                                         page 20



can be expected to be close to unity because this coefficient is likely to add (most o~ the effect of

nominal spending, ~k, to the ceteris paribus effect of the price level, which equals l–~k, This

argument    also implies that, when the CRRA model holds and the sample paths of prices and

nominal spendings are sufficiently similar, it can be quite hard to distinguish between Hypothesis

PPP(2) and Hypothesis         CRRA(l).




III       Empirical          Tests of the Model           with Homothetic         Utility and Constant
          Rehtive Risk Aversion


In this section,      we test the CRRA           model   (in its log form, equations    (2.9)-(2. 10)) using

cointegration analysis. 14 The original Engle and Granger (1987) cointegration            approach adopts a

bivariate framework, while the more recent and more powerful approach developed in Johansen

(1991) uses a multivariate         framework      that allows for the existence   of multiple   cointegrating

vectors and a richer specification of short-run dynamics. We have used the latter approach, and in

particular the type of tests described in Johansen and Juselius (1992), to implement the empirical

tests of the PPP and CRRA models.


III. A.    Data, Model Setup, and Estimation Procedure


One problem with (2.9)-(2. 10) is that, for many countries, real consumption           data are not available

in high-frequency      form. As the VAR procedure used in cointegration            analysis requires a large

number of observations,         we introduce      another restriction:   nominal spending is assumed to be

cointegrated      with the money supply. One case where this is trivially true is the cash-in-advance




14Cointegration analysis was pioneered by Granger(1981)      and developed by, among others, Engle and
Granger (1987), Phillips (1990), Stock and Watson (1988) and more recently by Johansen (1988,1991)
and Johansen and Juselius (1990,1992). A lucid and relatively non-technical exposition of the main ideas
can be found in Dickey and Rossana(1994).
The Equilibrium    Approach    to Exchange Rates                                                           page 21



world, where a country’s nominal spending simply equals the country’s money supply. Consumer

price indices being available on a monthly basis, the substitution              of money supplies for nominal

consumption       data allows us to use monthly data.


          Thus,    our main purpose         is to test (a) whether       there exists    a long-run   equilibrium

relationship      between nominal exchange rate, price levels and money supplies, and (b) whether

such a relationship, if any, is of the form specified in equation (2.9)-(2.10) with acceptable positive

values for the risk aversion parameters q 1 and T12.We will contrast this test of the CRRA model

against the classical PPP alternative, the special case of (2.9)-(2.10) with zero risk aversions.


          We have selected six countries. The US serves as the reference country. Germany (GE),

the United Kingdom (UK) and Japan (JP) are chosen so as to represent the most heavily traded

currencies.    Lastly, we added two smaller European countries,                Belgium     (BE) and Switzerland

(SW), on the basis that they (a) had an exchange rate that moved sufficiently independently                   from

the DEM, (b) did not no exchange                   controls   during the post-Bretton-Woods      era, and (c) had

complete data in the International          Financial Statistics tape published by the IMF: . The data set

consists of seventeen series of monthly data on nominal exchange rates of these five countries’

currencies against the US dollar, the consumer price indices (CPIS) of the six countries, and their

nominal       money    stocks     (Mo; M3 for the UK). The sample period is from January                  1973 to

December 1992.            -


          The data are arranged into a matrix that depends on which model is being tested. Denoting

logs of Sk, Mk, and ~k by Sk, mk, and pk, respectively,                and denoting the log real exchange rates

and money supplies bys: and m;, the data matrices are:

             For each data set we first test how many long-run relationships                  seem to be present. The

CRRA(l)-(2)          and PPP(l)-(2)       hypotheses     predict that there should be at least five of these

cointegrating        vectors;     but given the nature of the underlying             variables     and the degree          of

interdependence         (and possibly      policy coordination)        among the countries         in the sample,         the

existence of a larger number of cointegration              relations is quite likely. To estimate the number of

cointegrating relationships we use the maximum-eigenvalue                   (~m)     and the trace statistics. 15


             Having established      that there are at least five long-run relationships,           we then verify the

statistical acceptability        of the PPP( 1) hypothesis in the first 11-variable data set. This test is first

done one country at the time, and then for all countries simultaneously.                      The country-by-country

test is undertaken        as follows. In the first 11-series system (the test of Hypothesis                PPP( l)), for

instance, the hypothesis is that, for Belgium, the coefficients for SBE,nBE and zus are 1,– 1, and 1,

respectively.      To test the acceptability        of Hypothesis    PPP( 1) for Belgium, we verify whether the

1lx 1 matrix ~ppp = [1 0000              –1 0000       1]’ is compatible with the data, imposing no restrictions

on the remaining cointegrating             vectors. Such country-by-country          tests are done for each of the

other countries.       The second test is whether the hypothesis               is acceptable     for all five countries

simultaneously,        In this test, five cointegrating        vectors are specified          to conform   to the PPP-




15Lmax = –T log(l–~+1           ) and TR = –T ~=~+1 log(l–L1),      where   T is the sample    size, p the number    of
variables,    and Li is the i-th ordered eigenvalue. The Lmax statistic tests the hypothesis that there are r (<
p-1 ) cointegration  relations against the alternative that there are r+ 1 such relations, The trace statistic
tests the hypothesis that there are r (c p) cointegration    relations against the alternative that there are p
such relations. The tests often yield different conclusions. Osterwald-Lenum     (1992) provides critical values
for p = 11 variables, so that (p-r) can go from O (r= 11) to 11 (1=0). Because these tests are known to have
low power, Johansen and Juselius (1992) recommend using 90% critical values rather than the usual 95%.
hypothesis, while the remaining vectors are left unrestricted. The test statistic is a likelihood ratio.


         Tests of the PPP(2) and CRRA( 1) hypotheses               (in the 17-variable system) are analogous:

we test for the presence of a specific cointegrating relation as suggested by (2.9). In a test of a PPP

hypothesis      as reported above, the choice of coefficients for Sk, pk and pus—[ 1,–1, I]—is dictated

by theory.      Under the CRRA hypotheses,              however,     any positive        value of qus         and q k is

permissible. Consequently,       the number of theoretically acceptable cointegration vectors is infinitely

large. We report the tests for some illustrative             values for these parameters,              first imposing   the

restriction one coun~       at a time, and then for all five countries simultaneously.                For instance, to test

the hypothesis      for Deutsche        Mark we test whether the following              vector is acceptable       for the

preselected values for ~GE and qus:

                    [0, O, 1,0,0,0,0,      -(l-IIGE),   0,0, (l-llus),     0,0, –~GE, 0,0, qus] .



111.B.   Empirical Results and Tests of Hypotheses


We first verify the presence of unit roots in the log of the time series of S(t), H(t) and M(t). Table

1, below, presents the results of applying the augmented Dickey-Fuller                       (ADF) t-test with a data

generating process that allows for both constant and a trend, There is a unit root present in all the

data series, except for the Swiss ad          US money supply series which maybe stationary (apart from

the time trend). Tests for the presence of more than one unit root were also performed but failed to

reveal the presence       of another unit root in any of the variables                included        in the system. The

cointegration     procedure itself was implemented         with CATS in RATS. 16 The lag length in the first

set of auxiliary regressions was increased until the Box-Ljung statistic for serial correlation among

residuals was insignificant at 5% level for all the equations. The final value of k was 10.

        To test Hypothesis PPP( 1), we estimate the cointegration          relations in a system consisting

of five nominal exchange rates and six price levels. This is the usual set-up for tests of bilateral

PPP in a multivariate        cointegration   framework.   Table 2 presents the results for the number of

cointegrating     relationships   in the data. At the 107o level of significance,   both the ~ax    and trace

tests indicate the presence of nine cointegrating          relations among the eleven variables.      This is

consistent with PPP, which predicts that there should be at least five cointegration        relations in the

data set.


        Table 3 presents the results of the likelihood         ratio tests for the PPP( 1) hypothesis.   Our

results confirm the findings of Ness&n (1994) and others: in the exchange rate/prices system the

hypothesis of stationarity of real exchange rates is rejected for all currencies, whether we test for all

five countries individually or simultaneously.       The only exception is the country-by-country     test for

Belgium, where the hypothesis          of a stationary real rate vis-h-vis the US receives weak support

from the data.


        We next analyze the 17-variable system with five nominal exchange rates, six price levels

and six money stocks. Again, the first step is to estimate the number of cointegrating relationships.

The exchange rate model implies that there should be at least five of these relations among the six

countries. Table 4 presents the trace and maximal eigenvalue statistics that test for the number of

cointegrating     vectors, From the table it is clear that the data reveal sixteen cointegrating    relations

among the seventeen variables.


        In this 17-variable system we now test the hypothesis           CRRA( 1) and PPP(2); that is, we

test for the presence of a specific cointegrating         relation for each currency involving (only) the

following variables: that currency’s nominal exchange rate, the price level and money stock of the

country and price level and money stock of the reference country (the US). As argued before, the

number of theoretically acceptable values of qus, ~BE, qsw, IluK, qGE, and IIJP is infinite, so that

we can only show some representative             cases. Table 5 presents    the results for four different
The Equilibrium   Approach    to Exchange Rates                                                           pa~e 25



combinations      of q-values: (qus, ~non.us)        = (1.25, 1.50), (0.6, 0.4), (0.05, 0,05), and (O, O). The

(O, O) combination is the test of the PPP(2) hypothesis, which differs from the first PPP-test in that

we now allow money supplies to play a role in the short-tetm dynamics.


        From Table 5 we see that each of the proposed cointegration               vectors is still rejected when

imposed for all countries         simultaneously.      However, and unlike what we found in the tests of

Hypothesis PPP( 1), each of these hypotheses now becomes acceptable when tested one country at

the time-with       the single exception        for Switzerland   in the case (qus, q 2) = (1.25,      1.50). The

conclusion     is twofold. First, money supplies seem to play a role in the short term dynamics

process. Second, when allowing for this role of money supplies, it becomes difficult to reject any

low value for relative risk-aversion (including, disappointingly,          zero risk aversion). Apparently, the

money supply and price data are too similar, which causes problems if, as the model suggests, the

corresponding      coefficients, qk and l–ilk, sum to unity. 17


          As discussed       before, equation     (2.9) can also be interpreted    as an equilibrium     relation

between      the bilateral    real exchange       rate of currency i versus the reference currency       and the

corresponding      real money stocks, equation (2. 10). To test the validity of such a relation we now

estimate a multivariate system with five real exchange rates and six real money stocks, and we test

for the presence of cointegration vectors involving log(SIH1~us             ), log(Ml~l)   and log(Mus~us).

This test has the advantage of restricting, a priori, the coefficients of log(M1) and log(~i) to sum to

unity, and, thus, to steer clear of the multicolinearity          between the two series. The disadvantage      is

that, now, nominal money stocks and price levels are no longer allowed to play an independent

role in the short-term dynamics either; that is, the short-run fluctuations           in the real exchange rate

are assumed to be driven by real money supplies only.




17Mark (1985), who tests the relationship between interest rates and masginal rates of substitution,     also
obtains very imprecise estimates of q and cannot reject the hypothesis that q = O.
The Equilibn”um Approach   to   ExchnnReRates                                                       page 26



           Table 6 provides the results of tests for the number of cointegrating       vectors in this 11-

variable     system.   The CRRA(2)         model says that there should be at least five cointegrating

relationships    in the real data. In contrast, the PPP(3) hypothesis     implies that there should be at

most nine. This is because, in the PPP view (as distinct from CRRA) the real rate is not related, in

the long run, to real spending variables, which then implies that all cointegrating relationships must

be either among the real exchange rates themselves— up to four cointegration            relationships-or

among the real spending variables —up to five cointegration relationships.        The &ax test indicates

presence of seven cointegrating vectors while the trace test suggests eight. In the further tests of the

CRRA(2)       hypothesis   we have proceeded       on the assumption   that there are seven cointegrating

relations.


           As before, we have tested the acceptability       of a large number of specific cointegration

vectors corresponding       to selected values for the risk aversion parameters.     Some representative

results are shown in Table 7. Each of the proposed vectors in Table 7 is now rejected, with the

possible eXCeptlOn Of the VeCtOr (~us = 3, 11B E = 2) for the Belgian             Franc. To confirm        the

generality of this negative conclusion we add, in the last panel of Table 7, a test where we do not

specify any numerical values for the parameters ~1 and ?lUs; that is, we only wish to test whether

there is a cointegrating    relationship     that involves log(SIH1/TIus ), log(M1/Hi) and log(Mus~us        ),

and only these variables. This restriction is rejected in all cases except, very marginally,        for the

Belgian franc.


           We summarize our empirical findings as follows. First, nominal money stocks and prices

do seem to play separate roles in the short-term dynamics: the data reject all models where only

real money supplies are allowed to play a role in the short-run fluctuations            or where nominal

money is not allowed to play any role in them. Second, when money supplies and prices are

allowed to play a separate role in the short-term dynamics, equation (2.9) is acceptable when tested

one country at the time, as long as the proposed degree of risk aversion is low or even zero. This
The Equilibrium   Approach    to Exchange Rates                                                            page 27



finding is consistent        with the combined hypothesis that the CRW           model holds and that money

and price data follow similar time paths. Indeed, the Cm              model predicts that the coefficients for

the price and money supply variables sum to unity; so when these series behave rather similarly

over time, it is difficult to distinguish between the roles of the two variables.


         Still, the evidence in favor of the CRRA model is far from conclusive. One possible reason

for the less than satisfactory       results may be the model’s assumptions        of homothetic     preferences

and constant risk aversion. In the following section, we therefore return to the general model (1.5)

and see what can be said about (changes in) exchange rates when preferences are not assumed to

be homothetic and risk-aversion is not constant.




Iv.        Characterizing         Changes in the Exchunge Rate


From equation      (1.5), it follows that percentage       changes in the nominal exchange           rate reflect

percentage changes in the marginal utilities of spending:ls


                                            dS
                                            —-     dAz

                                             s-    A2–      A1’


As in, for instance, Barten (19@) or Breeden (1978), we now apply a Slutsky decomposition                        of

the changes in the marginal indirect utilities. That is, we decompose              dA/A into the effect of the

curvature of the indirect utility (the degree of relative risk aversion) and the effects of changes in

each of the arguments of the indirat         utility, As a result, the change in the nominal exchange rate is

given by the sum of two terms: one, the international differences in real consumption               growth rates

weighted    by each country’s relative risk aversion, and two, the international              difference   in the




18Equation (4,1) is a first-order approximation.   A (second-order) Ito expansion shows that, in a model with
continuous time and continuous but stochastic output processes, there will be a drift added to the right
hand side of (4,1) that depends on the risk aversions and the (co)variances      of the nominal spendings, the
marginal inflation rates, and the total inflation rates.

Substitution of (4.3) into (4.1) then immediately produces (4.2). +


         To detect the importance of non-homothetic-preferences             and time-v~ing    risk aversion for

the purpose of describing short-run changes of exchange rates, we can compare Equation (4.2) to

the log-change version of the homothecy/C~                Model in equation (2.6):


                                                                                                     (4.3)


Thus, locally, the non-constancy             of relative risk aversion has no first-order    effects, but non-

homothetic-preferences           do. Specifically, the marginal and total inflation rates no longer coincide,

and the term ( l–~k) dHk/~k             in (4.4) needs to be replaced by dzk/nk – q k dHk/Hk. A related

implication        of (4.3) is that risk-neutrality     is not sufficient   to obtain   PPP (Proposition     3),

Specifically,       when q=O, the exchange          rate change generally    equals the marginal     inflation

differential;   and only in the case of homothetic preferences will marginal inflation coincide with

average inflation.



        Equation       (4.2) also explains the poor results of regression tests of Relative PPP. To see

this, first consider the special case where preferences are homothetic and relative risk aversion is

equal and constant. Under these conditions, (4.2) simplifies to:
                                                                                                     (4.4)


The implications     of (4.4) for tests of relative PPP are similar to the inferences made in the single-

good model of Sercu et al. (1995). An increase in domestic inflation should lead to an appreciation

of the home currency (a decrease in S), as long as we control for nominal spending. In light of

this, the puzzle in standard regression tests of relative PPP is not why we do not observe exchange

rates that are equal, on average, to inflation differences. Rather, given that q is commonly accepted

to be larger than unity, the puzzle is why we often observe a positive association between the two

at all. The reason may be that, in the standard regression            tests of relative PPP, the nominal

spending     variables   are omitted.   Given that growth rates of nominal         spending    are positively

correlated   with inflation   rates, the true (negative)    effect, 1 - q, of inflation is to some extent

confounded with the positive effect, q, of the omitted spending variable. As a result, the empirical

estimates of the regression slope of AlnS on Aln(H l~z)           are biased towards unity. As Sercu et al.

(1995) argue, this is especially true in low-frequency        data and in samples drawn from periods of

hyperinflation    where the correlation between growth in nominal spending and inflation is likely to

be stronger than otherwise. This conclusion also holds if q differs across countries.


        Equation     (4.2) also provides   some insights about regression        tests of relative PPP that

cannot be obtained from (4.4). One, in the (realistic) case where preferences are non-homothetic,

there is an additional omitted variable, marginal inflation, which is imperfectly proxied for by the

CPI measure of inflation. Since d~k(t)~k(t)        is an imperfect proxy for dZk(t)/nk(t), the coefficient

for CPI inflation in a regression of AlnS on AlnH l~k          is expected to be closer to zero than in the

homothetic     case. Two, in the regression (4,4), the coefficients     for the true inflation rates and the

growths in nominal spending need not be identical across countries because the degree of risk

aversion need not be equal across countries.21         Imposing     a single coefficient    for Aln(M 1) and




21In their regression tests of relative PPP, Apte, Kane, and Sercu (1994) allow for different coefficients
across countries,    and they test for equality. The only instances where the equality hypothesis    is not
The Equilibrium    Approach   to Exchange Rates                                                                 page 31



–Aln(Mz)        will produce estimates       that are neither equal to q 1 nor to Tlz (and likewise             for the

inflation terms). Three, the risk aversion coefficients           need not be constant over time. Thus, the

standard constant-coefficient         regression test for PPP may be inappropriate.         In view of all this, the

poor results that are commonly           obtained in regression        tests of relative PPP may simply be the

result of rnisspecification        of the test equation     rather than some kind of excess volatility                 or

irrationality.n


           Equation (4.2) has similar implications for cointegration tests of exchange rate models: The

tests presented       in Section    111 suffer from a missing-variable          bias, and the fixed-coefficient

approach may be inappropriate.           In addition, like the homothecy/C~-model,                    equation (4.2) is

still consistent with PPP-like behavior in the long run, especially in high-inflation                 samples: If long-

run cumulative marginal inflation rates follow similar time paths as cumulative average inflation

rates and money supply data, it will again be difficult to distinguish between the roles of these three

variables if, as Proposition        4 predicts, the true coefficients      of the three variables sum to unity,

Thus, the fact that the country-by-country          tests of Section III appear to accept a rather wide range

of risk-aversion parameters can also be consistent with the generalized model in equation (4.2).




V. Conclusion


Much of the literature on exchange rate determination is based on PPP, with PPP being justified on

the basis of the consumption          opportunity   set (fnctionless    commodity       arbitrage), In contrast, the

standard micro-economics           paradigm views relative prices— and, hence, also exchange rates—as

jointly determined by consumption           opportunity sets and preferences. We accordingly characterize

the equilibrium       exchange     rate in a general equilibrium         economy    with imperfect         commodity




rejected   is when the power of the test is low.

z See the survey article by Frankel    and Rose (1994) for the evidence    on bubbles   in exchange    rates.

markets. We can avoid strong restrictions on the output processes or on preferences because, for

our purpose, there is no need to specify the link between the exchange rate and the underlying

exogenous variables. In such a model, the real exchange rate is determined by differences in initial

wealths—the       currencies    of richer countries tend to be overvalued,           by PPP standards-and            by

differences in marginal utilities of total consumption.             In the special case of homothetic       Constant

Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility functions, the model implies that there is a missing variable

in the PPP equation, the ratio of nominal spendings, and that the ceteris paribus effect of higher

domestic prices is a drop in the value of foreign cmencies              rather than a rise (as predicted by PPP).

In models with non-homothetic,            non-CRRA utility functions the exchange rate change depends not

only on the standard (“average”) inflation differential across countries (as in the PPP model) but

also on the inflation differential computed on the basis of marginal consumption                  weights, growth

in real spending, and the possibly time-varying degree of risk aversion in the two countries, Thus,

standard regression or cointegration          tests of PPP suffer from missing-variables         biases and ignore

variations in risk aversions across countries and over time.



        We also present cointegration              test of the equilibrium   exchange rate model with constant

relative risk aversion and homothetic preferences. The results of empirical testing appear to yield

few definitive conclusions;        in that sense they seem to accord with an observation             of Froot and

Rogoff( 1994): “cointegration approaches have sometimes created as much confusion as clarity on

the issue of PPP, ” One clear implication,              however, is that a long-run equilibrium      PPP relation

between nominal exchange rates and the relevant price levels does emerge if money stocks are

allowed to play a role in the short-run dynamics of the system, next to (and independently                    o~ the

price levels. Given that one lets money supplies play this role, the hypothesis                      of stationary

combinations      represented    by equation        (2.9) receives some support for values of risk aversion

parameters which are both theoretically and empirically acceptable when tested for one country at

the time. A related conclusion            is that the structure     of equilibrium   relations   revealed    by-or

extracted from—a given data set depend crucially upon the specification                   of the VAR model in
The Equilibrium    Approach   to Exchange Rates                                                      page 33



levels, in particular which variables are included in and excluded from the system being estimated.


        We see two challenges           for future research in this area. First, more powerful      tests me

needed to sort out the roles of nominal spending and prices in the long-run relationship,           Second,

one needs to find an explanation for the empirical result that nominal money stocks seem to play

an independent       role in the short-term       dynamics.   In a model such as ours, only real spending

matters. Possible approaches          could be fluctuations    in the velocity of money, or money-in-the-

utility-function     effects. Both routes suggest that interest rates should be incorporated        into the

model; and interest rate changes are likely to be related to short-term             fluctuations   in money

supplies.

Key to Fi~re 1, The figure on the left assumes a one-good, two-country economy with endowments            Q = (q 1,
q2). AS there is but one good. vk equals ck. There is a proportional shipment cost, ~. Thus, if the consumption
point V = (v1, v2) is above and to the left of Q—that is, when country 1 is importing—the            consumption
opportunity set has a slope -dvl/dv2    = l/(1+1). Likewise, if the consumption point V = (v1, v2) is below and
to the right of Q—that is, when country 1 is exporting-the      consumption opportunity set has a slope -dv l/dv2
= 1+1. If t32 < (>) 1, the central planner favors country 1 (2), and equilibria like V (V’) with a real exchange
rate equal to l/(1+~) < 1 (l+r > 1) become more likely. The figure on the right assumes two goods, no
friclions, and different consumption preference functions Uk(Ck 1, Ck2 ), The international   opportunist y set for
real spending (v2, VI) is strictly convex. To show this itsuffices to replace, in a Heckscher-Ohlin     model, the
(linear homogeneous) production functions and the factor endowments,       K and L, by the (linear homogeneous)
preference   functions   u~(~) and the total endowments,    qj = qlj + q2J respectively. Thus, the bound of the
opportunity set is linear (strictly convex) if the consumption preferences are equal (different). The larger 62,
the more to the right the optimal consumption       point, and the higher the MRS (the real exchange rate for
country 2).

Key to Table 7. The table shows the ~2-tests, degrees of freedom, and probability values for the CRRA(3)
hypothesis in the 1l-variable    data set (real exchange rates, real money stocks). We assume there are seven
cointegration relations in the data (Table 6). In the country-by-country   tests, the CRW-vector       is imposed one
country at the time; that is, in each such test the other six cointe~ation  vectors are left unrestricted.
