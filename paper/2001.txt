             The Political Economy of the Smoot—Hawley Tariff




                                ABSTRACT



     Economic histories of the interwar years view the Great Depression and
the Smoot Hawley Tariff as inextricably bound up with one another. They
assign a central role to the Depression in explaining the passage of the
1930 Tariff Act and at the same time emphasize the role of the tariff in the
propogation of the Depression. This paper argues that popular accounts have
conveyed what is at best an incomplete and at worst a misleading impression
of the relationship between the tariff and the Depression. Rather than
simply strengthening the hand of a Republican Executive predisposed toward
protection or increasing the burden borne by a depressed agricultural
sector1 the uneven impact of the Depression occasioned the birth of a new
protectionist coalition comprised of producers particularly hard hit by
import competition: border agriculture and small—scale industry engaged in
the production of speciality goods. Rather than leading to a dramatic
across—the—board decline in the volume of U.S. imports, the tariff had very
different effects across sectors. Rather than worsening the Great
Depression by reducing foreign demands for U.S. exports, the direct
macroeconomic effect of the tariff is likely to have been expansionary.
This remains true even when feedbacks to the United States and foreign
retaliation are analyzed. In any case, relative to the Depression, the
direct macroeconomic effects of the tariff were small. If Smoot—Hawley had
significant macroeconomic effects, these operated instead through its impact
on the stability of the international monetary system and the efficiency of
the international capital market.

       As a score of writers have pointed out, the world depression and
       the Hawley-Smoot Tariff are inextricably bound up one with the
       other, the latter being not only the first manifestation but a
       principal cause of the deepening and aggravating of the former.

                                                      Jones (1934, p.2)


       The intimate connection between the Great Depression and the Smoot-

Hawley Tariff of 1930 was recognized by contemporaries and continues to be

emphasized by historical scholars.1 But just as contemporaries, while

agreeing on its importance, nonetheless viewed the tariff in a variety of

different ways, historians of the era have achieved no concensus on the the

tariff's origins and effects. The definitive study of the Smoot-Jiawley's

origins, by Schattschneider (1935), portrays the tariff as a classic example

of pork-barrel politics, with each member of Congress after his particular

piece of pork. Revisionist treatments characterize it instead as a classic

instance of party politics; protectionism being the household remedy of the

Republican Party, the tariff's adoption is ascribed to the outcome of the

1928 election.2 Surprisingly, proponents of neither interpretation provide

an adequate analysis of the relationship of Smoot-Hawley to the Depression --

in   particular, they fail to establish whether the onset of the Depression

strengthened the movement for the tariff's adoption, and if so why.

       Following such contemporary critics of Smoot-Hawley as Bidwell (1932)

and Slichter (1932), one school of macroeconomic thought assigns a large

role to Smoot-Hawley in explaining why the 1929 recession did not follow the

course of previous contractions but culminated instead in the Great

Depression.3 The tariff, if not wholly responsible for the Depression, is

portrayed as a major contributor to its singular depth and long duration.
                                      —2-


Others who emphasize monetary aspects of the contraction, although deploring

the tariff's adoption, argue that world trade was collapsing anyway and

treat Smoot-Hawley as a sideshow.4 Finally, there is a school of thought

which suggests that the tariff may have actually had a favorable impact on

the U.S. economy, since it helped to offset the collapse of prices, thereby

enhancing profitability and stimulating domestic production.5

     Surprisingly in light of the attention devoted by contemporary

observers to the the relationship of the tariff to the decline and recovery of

different sectors, few recent studies have considered the impact of Smoot-

Hawley at a disaggregated level. Contemporaries debated the question of which

sectors were extended the most generous protection under the 1930 Tariff Act,

some concluding that, in line with Herbert Hoover's 1928 electoral pledge, the

benefits were largely limited to agriculture, others emphasizing upward

revisions of tariff rates on imports of manufactures.6 Still other

commentators suggested that a considerable share of the increase in protection

resulted not from acts of Congress but from the interaction of a falling price

level with import duties denominated in nominal terms. Observers failed to

agree even on the impact of the tariff on the traded goods sector, Free

Traders blaming it for the dramatic fall in U.S. imports in the early 1930s,

Protectionists noting that imports fell across the board and assigning

responsibility to the Depression rather than the tariff.

     To a remarkable extent, discussion of these matters proceeds as if the

effect of the tariff on the American economy can be considered in isolation

from its impact on the rest of the world. Insofar as Smoot-Hawley influenced

conditions abroad and elicited retaliation, repercussions were felt in the

United States, particularly by sectors producing exportable goods. Some
                                        -3-



 accounts attribute to the tariff a causal role not just in the disintegration

 of the international trading network but in the difficulties of

 primary-product exporting countries, the sovereign debt defaults of the 1930s,

 and the closure of the international capital market. Yet as Joseph S. Davis

 said of Smoot-Hawley more than a decade ago, "the extent of its influence has

 never been satisfactorily assessed."

      Perhaps the most striking feature of the literature on Smoot-Hawley is

 the extent to which it proceeds in the absence of systematic evidence.

This paper is an attempt to fill that void. It starts by reassessing the

political economy of the 1930 Tariff Act. In Section I the existing

explanations for the tariff's imposition are reassessed and found wanting.

Section II offers a new interpretation of Smoot-Hawley's adoption. Section

III then analyzes the contours of the tariff that emerged from the political

process.

     Sections IV and V turn to the macroeconomic impact of the 1930 Tariff

Act. Any such analysis requires a theoretical framework, so a model is used

to order discussion of the tariff's aggregate effects. That framework is

a macroeconomic model of two countries or regions linked together by

international flows of commodities and capital. Since the major countries were

all on some form of gold standard when Smoot-Hawley was adopted, gold-standard

rules occupy a prominent place in the specification. This framework helps to

identify the channels through which the tariff's influence was felt and to

isolate the parameters upon which the magnitude of its effects depended. The

model is then calibrated to generate quantitative estimates of the

macroeconomic effects.

     Section VI considers the relationship of Smoot-Hawley to the

disintegration of the international monetary system and to sovereign default

by primary producers. These relationships, I argue, provide the principal

channels through which the impact of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff on the Great

Depression was felt. Section VII turns to the question of retaliation.

     Section VIII describes an attempt to estimate the impact of import duty

revisions under the 1930 Tariff Act on the quantity of goods imported under

the 13 tariff schedules. The results pinpoint the proximate contribution of

the tariff to the decline in U.S. imports after 1929, and shed light on the

question of which sectors reaped benefits from Smoot-Hawley's imposition.



I.   Politics, Pressures and the Tariff


     The debate surrounding the passage of the Tariff Act of 1930 remains a

classic study in the political economy of protection. A number of theories

have been developed to explain Smoot-Hawley's adoption, starting with that

advanced in Schattschneider's (1935) classic monograph whose title this

section bears. However, by itself none provides a wholly adequate explanation

for the tariff's adoption.

     Schattschneider's influential study "set the tone for a whole generation

of political writing on pressure groups... ." and "cut the lens through which

Americans have since visualized the making of U.S. foreign trade policy..

Schattschneider focused on the influence of special interest groups over the

structure of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff bill. In his account, the actions of

lobbyists and special interests were largely responsible for the tariff's

adoption.
                                      —5-


     Schattschneider dubbed the principal around which the tariff coalition

organized reciprocal noninterference."10 The coalition was assembled by

offering limited protection to everyone involved. Since only moderate

protection was provided and no single import-competing sector reaped

extraordinary benefits at the expense of others, they could combine in

support of protectionist legislation. In addition, under provisions included

in the original House and Senate bills, credits (or "debentures't) were to be

made available to exporters, extending the coalition beyond the

import-competing to the export-producing sector.11 Not just the number of

commodities on which duties were raised but the very process by which the bill

was passed is invoked in support of the log-rolling interpretation.

Passage required 14 months from the point when Hoover called a special

session of Congress to when the final bill was signed. The record of public

hearings in which the bill was discussed ran to 20,000 pages, while the final

bill provided tariff schedules for more than 20,000 separate items. Since

insurgency was easier under Senate than House rules, log-rolling was more

conspicuous there: the Senate amended the House bill over 1200 times, most

of them on the Senate floor.12 Still other changes were engineered in

conference committee.

     If, in contrast to previous tariff legislation as the Fordney—McCumber

bill of 1922, the process and its result reflect the influence of special

interest lobbies, it is important to ask why such groups had suddenly grown so

powerful. Schattschneider provides no explicit answer, although he indicts

Hoover for failing to guide well—defined legislation through Congress.13 But

the systematic explanation implicit in his analysis is the rise of the "new

lobby." Although fraternal, religous, social, and economic groups had always
                                        -6-


been part of the American scene, they had never been so well organized or

visible in the Capitol as in the 1920s. According to one observer, "Within

recent years these groups have increased and multiplied. More important

still, they have become highly organized and are to-day conducted by shrewd

and capable leaders."14 In contrast to the old lobby, which was comprised of a

few corporate employees, "wire-pullers" and patronage brokers working behind

the scenes, members of the new lobby worked in the open, representing large if

often specialized interest groups.

     A number of influences combined to prompt the rise of the new lobby.

First, the activities of the "muckrakers" in the first decade of the 20th

century had intensified public scrutiny of political affairs. Second, whereas

businessmen had traditionally dealt with government in "a spasmodic and

haphazard fashion," the panic of 1907 spurred them to adopt more systematic

forms of representation.15 Third, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce took a more

prominent role in representing the interests of business, "a development of

great value to both parties concerned. . .   [lending]   clarity and force to the

opinion of business and simplicity and directness to its relations with

government."16 And fourth, much as the Chamber of Commerce represented

business's general interests, trade associations filled this role for more

specialized groups. A Department of Commerce (1925) publication listed some

1500 organizations classified as trade associations, nearly double the number

known to exist in 1914. Some were organized according to products produced,

others according to materials used, and still others according to markets in

which sales took place. Like the other three influences, the growth of trade

associations was a distinctively 20th century development, but in contrast to

other trends, which had been underway in the early years of the century, the
                                       —7—


 rise to prominence of trade associations was attributable to effects of World

War I. The war effort required closer ties between government and industry,

but upon attempting to establish them the authorities, finding it difficult to

deal with individual enterprises, requested that associations be formed. If

the war occasioned the formation and growth of many trade associations, the

armistice by no means signalled their demise. Once formed into an association

the process of marshalling a constituency was no longer so difficult.

Improvements in communication, notably the telephone, reinforced these

advantages, and associations quickly learned to use pamphlets and other media

to publicize their case. The adoption of new Congressional rules made it more

difficult for powerful individuals to dictate policy, opening the legislative

process to competing interests.17

     The same forces tending to promote effective representation of industrial

interests in Washington encouraged the formation of effective organizations

representing farmers and labor. The American farm movement had long been

distinguished by its inability to organize effectively and represent its

interests before Congress.18 The ad hoc methods of agricultural organizations,

such as sending a representative to Washington in response to alarming

developments, had proven largely ineffectual. For agriculture as for

industry, World War I and the impetus it provided for the formation of the War

Trade Board and the Food Administration caused farmers' organizations to

assume new importance. In 1918 the National Grange opened a permanent

legislative office in Washington, and the militant American Farm Bureau

Federation, founded in 1919, lobbied actively for farm legislation. In

1921 a bipartisan Farm Bloc of senators and congressmen from the South and

West was formed, and it acquired a critical position in the balance of power in
                                        —8—



the 66th and 67th Congresses. Although its success in passing farm

legislation was mixed at best and while it quickly fell into disarray, the

prominence of the Farm Bloc did much to alert agricultural interests to the

advantages of effective congressional representation.

     The war had a similar impact on the American Federation of Labor. While

maintaining its distance from party politics, by the 1920s the AFL was

commonly acknowledged as the most formidable group in the United States other

than the two political parties.19 Thus, in the 1920s the three principal

American interest groups -   business, agriculture and labor -- were for the
first time ably represented in Washington.

     The rise of the new lobby is entirely consistent with Schattschneider1s

characterization of Smoot-Hawley as an instance of pork-barrel politics. But

his theory of reciprocal noninterference --   that   the Smoot-Hawley bill by

offering something for everyone garnered widespread support --     fails   to confront

the question of why the vote on the final bill so closely followed party lines,

with only 5 Democratic Senators voting in favor and 11 Republicans against.

Moreover, it provides no answer to the question of why tariff-rate increases

differed so widely by schedule.

     An alternative explanation, recently advanced by Pastor (1980), is that

Smoot-Hawley is simply an instance of party politics. Protection was

regularly advocated by the Republican Party. With the White House occupied by

a Republican President and the Senate in Republican hands, there were few

obstacles to revising upward existing tariff schedules. It is curious that

this straightforward explanation has attracted so little attention. It may be

that partisan aspects of the debate were disguised by the absence of a change

in party in 1928 like that following the 1920 election and preceding the 1922
                                         -9-


Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act. Moreover, the issue of protection had not been

a prominant party issue in the 1928 campaign. Although the Democrats had

traditionally campaigned on the basis of staunch opposition to protectionist

measures, in 1928 they moderated their position and joined the Republicans in

endorsing protection, albeit in relatively vague and reserved terms. Where

the Republican Platform reaffirmed the Party's belief in "the protective

tariff as a fundamental and essential principle of the economic life of this

nation" and pledged to consider upward revisions of rates where needed to

protect American labor against low-wage foreign competition, the Democrats

acknowledged the desirability of tariff protection in principle but at the

same time pledged to reduce "monopolistic and extortionate tariff rates" and

to safeguard against "monopoly created by special tariff favors."20 But in

parts of the South, there was for the first time considerable emphasis by

Democratic orators on the policy of protection. Given the extent of

concensus, there was little debate in subsequent Congresses over principles of

free trade and protection. Hence even Free Traders among the Democrats were

ill positioned to mount effective opposition to tariff increases.

     The problem with this interpretation is that it provides no explanation

for Smoot-Hawley's timing or its form.    It is suggested that Congress was

simply accustomed to engaging in tariff revision every seven years (the

average life of a tariff law between the Acts of 1883 and 1930), and that by

1929 Congress and the public had recovered from the exhausting

Fordney-McCumber discussions of 1920—22. But this mechanical explanation

neither recognizes links between protectionist pressure and economic events

nor provides an explanation for the observed variation in import duty levels.

     The explanation coming closest to satisfying these requirements is the
                                      - 10—



view of Smoot-Hawley as a response to the problems of American agriculture.21

The explanation runs as follows. While the 1920s had been boom years for the

country as a whole, prosperity had been unevenly distributed. In particular,

agriculture, which had benefited from high prices from 1917 to 1920, failed to

recover from the recession of of 1920-21. For much of the decade, farm gate

prices declined relative to the prices of nonagricultural goods. (See Table 1.)

In 1926, a relatively favorable year for farmers when average wholesale prices

were 51 per cent above their 1913 levels, the prices of farm products were

only 42 per cent above those levels. The explanation for lagging prices was

that World War I had prompted a considerable expansion of agricultural

production outside Europe. While European sugar production, for example, fell

by 50 per cent during the war, the shortfall was offset by expanding output in

Cuba, Java and South America. Once European production recovered, often under

cover of import duties or production subsidies, world prices were permanently

depressed.22 Similarly, war had stimulated the expansion of wheat production

in Argentina, Australia, Canada and the United States. The consequent decline

in prices was magnified -in the second half of the 1920s by the imposition of

import duties on wheat by Germany, Italy and France.

     Agrarian distress in the United States took various forms, notably farm

foreclosures which, after averaging 3.2 per thousand farms between 1913 and

1920, rose to 10.7 per thousand in 1921-25 and 17.0 per thousand in 1926_29.23

The foreclosure problem reflected not just the declining relative price of

agricultural products but overall price level trends; since much agricultural

land had turned over between 1917 and 1920 when prices were high, the

subsequent deflation greatly augmented the burden of mortgage debt. The

foreclosures of the second half of the 1920s were most heavily concentrated in

Idaho, Montana, North and South Dakota, Colorado and Arizona, from where not

surprisingly the strongest pressures for agrarian relief emanated.

     In the 1928 presidential campaign Hoover laid considerable stress on

tariff protection for agriculture. Previously, agriculture had been the

recipient of only modest tariffs, in part because duties on farm imports would

have been ineffective given U.S. status as a net exporter of most agricultural

goods, sugar, wool and hides being the principal exceptions.24 In 1922,

however, the U.S. balance of trade of farm products turned negative, where it

remained except in 1925 for the duration of the decade. (See Table 2.) Hence

an expanding segment of American agriculture grew to appreciate the relevance

of tariff protection.

     By this interpretation, Smoot-Hawley was predominantly a form of

agricultural relief. "[T]he farmers of the country wanted as much protection

as had been given to the industrial East.    It was for this reason that the

agricultural schedules were boosted to higher levels than ever before."25

Since a significant share of the American population remained rural, farm

interests were able to press their case. Moreover, although the United States

had grown increasingly urbanized over the preceding decades, Congress had not

been reapportioned following the 1920 Census. In 1930 farm interests were

overrepresented in the House, just as, on the two senator per state rule, they

had long been overrepresented in the Senate.

     This characterization of Smoot-Hawley as an agricultural measure won by

the West over the opposition of the East is consistent not only with the

partisan interpretation, given the regional concentration of Democratic and

Republican voters, but it explains a number of defections from party ranks.

To the extent that agricultural distress intensified with the onset of the

Depression, it links the tariff to macroeconomic conditions. Where it fails

is in explaining why tariffs on manufactured imports were raised as part of an

agrarian relief measure, or why the tariff was supported not only by the

representatives of agricultural districts but by those of industrial regions

as well. Many accounts emphasize the extent of discord between agriculture

and industry. "The manufacturing East is represented as being anything but

pleased with the agricultural schedule, whereas the farming West is having a

lot to say about the industrial schedules."26 "Eastern industry thought the

agricultural schedules written into the bill by the Senate were beyond all

reason, but, by the same token, the Western agriculturalist thought the House

had gone stark mad when it wrote the industrial schedules into the bill."27

Vet the final bill passed by a coalition of agricultural and industrial

interests raised agricultural tariffs by an average of 11.57 points and

industrial rates by 5.48 points.28 How could this be?



II. A Model of the Tariff-Making Process


     The framework I use to analyze the adoption of Smoot-Hawley is a variant

of Gerschenkron's (1943) model of the political economy of protection in

19th century Germany. This is a member of the class of "interest-group

models" of tariff formation analyzed recently in Conybeare (1985) and McKeown

(1986).   I first review Gerschenkron's application of his model to Bismarckian

Germany before adapting it to the analysis of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff.

     In Gerschenkron's model, a tariff is adopted when specialized but

well-placed interest groups combine in its support. Gerschenkron divides

German society not merely along sectoral lines such as industry and
                                       —13—


 agriculture but into heavy industry (producers of basic products such coal,

 iron and steel), light industry (manufacturers of consumer goods, along with

 whom might be included artisans and shopkeepers), large agriculture (the

 Junkers, or large estate owners of Eastern Germany), and small agriculture

 (commercial producers located primarily west of the Elbe).    He explains the

Bismarckian tariff as a coalition of iron and rye, allying large agriculture

and heavy industry.

      In the 1870s as in the 1920s, the impetus for agrarian protection was the

rapid fall in world grain prices. The position of traditional German

agriculture, which specialized in grain, was seriously undermined. The

alternative to continued grain production behind tariff walls was to shift

into the production of high quality foodstuffs such as dairy products and meat

for rapidly expanding urban markets. Cheap imported grain could serve as an

input into such production. But, crucially, large and small agriculture

manifested different capacities to adjust. Differences in soil quality

provided greater scope for the production of dairy products and meat west of

the Elbe. In addition, dairy products, meats and vegetables were most

efficiently produced by relatively skilled labor working on small

owner—managed farms. Hence costs of adjustment were lowest where long-term

leaseholders and small owner—managed farms predominated —- west of the Elbe --

and highest where landless laborers worked large estates --   to   the east in

Prussia. The model predicts that small agriculture should have opposed

agricultural protection due to its impact on Costs, while large agriculture

should have favored it.

     Neither light nor heavy industry, with the possible exception of yarn

spinning, desperately required protection from import competition. Under
                                       -14--



competitive conditions, Germany probably would have imported grain and

exported both light manufactures and the products of the basic industries. It

is not clear that, given competition at home but the net export position of

German manufacturers, import duties on industrial goods would have succeeded

in raising the prices of domestically-produced goods.29 Nonetheless, heavy

industry supported the imposition of a tariff on manufactured goods. One

interpretation of this position is that, with high levels of fixed capital, it

was exceptionally susceptible to cyclical fluctuations.30 Tariffs ostensibly

reduced the risk of falling prices, thereby encouraging the fixed investments

which permitted scale economies to be exploited. A more compelling

interpretation is that barriers to cheap imports were a necessary condition

for firms producing basic goods to combine and successfully extract monopoly

profits from domestic users.31 Consistent with this interpretation, producers

of final goods like stoves, pots and pans, shovels, and rakes opposed tariffs

on the products of basic industries because of their impact on production

costs.

     What is relevant for our purposes is that no group favored the final

outcome: high tariffs on both agricultural and industrial goods. But because

of the dispersion of interests, action required compromise. The two likely

victors were a coalition of large industrialists and landowners obtaining

general protection, and a coalition of small manufacturers and farmers

successfully defending free trade. Gerschenkron ascribes the victory of the

protectionist coalition to institutional factors. The Junkers, as members of

the squirearchy, occupied a privileged position -in the German political

system. Not only did they staff the bureaucracy and judiciary but in addition

they, like the wealthy industrialists, benefitted from the structure of the
                                     —15-


German voting system. Heavy industry, helped by smaller numbers, organized

more effectively than small manufacturing. Managers of large industrial

enterprises formed new associations and worked to convert old ones to

protectionism.32 Their cause was not hurt by the fact that the Chancellor

found protection a useful tool for achieving his political goals, and played

an active role in forging the alliance of iron and rye.

     Gerschenkron's model can be applied to the case of the Smoot—Hawley

Tariff by again distinguishing industry by size and agriculture by region.

Naturally, the interests of the different groups and the resulting coalitions

are entirely different from those observed in Bismarckian Germany. So is the

role of the national leadership. Nonetheless, distinctions of region and

scale shed considerable light on the American case.

     In the case of Smoot—Hawley, it is useful to distinguish inland (or

sheltered) from border (or unsheltered) agriculture and, as in Germany, light

from heavy industry, where it is light industry and border agriculture that

combined in support of protection. As previously noted, critics of the

Smoot-Hawley Tariff argued that duties on agricultural products would not be

"effective" in raising prices because the U.S. was a net exporter of these

goods.33 In the words of Senator David Walsh of Massachusetts, "The reason why

most duties on agricultural products --   either   new duties or old duties

increased in amount -- can not help the farmer is because they will not be

effective."34 Or as Al Smith remarked during the 1928 Presidential campaign,

the existing 42—cent wheat tariff was no more than a gesture and for all the

benefit the farmer received "it might as well be put at $1.42." The problem

with this contention is that net trade may not be the appropriate indicator of

the effectiveness of a tariff. In the case of Smoot—Hawley, it may mislead
                                      -16—


either if there existed segmented regional markets or if products were

differentiated. For goods such as wheat with a high ratio of value to weight,

there existed not merely a national but an international market. But wheat

was not a homogenous product, and the United States both imported and exported

different grades of what was too often regarded in policy debate as a single

commodity. Since little if any exportable surplus of high grade milling wheat

was produced in the United States, for example, the tariff was effective in

raising the Minneapolis price relative to that prevailing in Winnipeg.36 Even

if the product was homogenous, for perishable products the United States was

sufficiently large geographically that transport costs might impede the

equalization of prices across regions. In Walsh's words, "for many products of

agriculture there is in this country no general market, but only a series of

local markets."37 Northern states like Minnesota and densely populated Eastern

Seaboard states like Massachusetts not far removed from Canada's maritime

provinces might find their markets flooded by cheap Canadian potatoes, milk,

cream, butter and eggs. Since these goods could not penetrate further into

the interior because of their high ratio of volume to value, inland producers

might be insulated from competing imports. In contrast, Southern farmers who

engaged in the production of cotton (other than the long staple variety, which

was imported and received a generous increase in tariff protection under the

1930 Act) were oriented toward the export market.38 Therefore, Northern farmers

close to the Canadian border should have favored protection to a much greater

extent than their counterparts in the Interior or the South.

     There existed equally sharp divisions within manufacturing. The pressure

for protection was greatest in light industry concentrating in the manufacture

of specialty products. Heavy industry and manufacturers of standardized
                                       —17—


 products had mechanized their operations and largely held their own against

 foreign competition. But the New England textile industry, which, in contrast

 to its Southern counterpart, specialized in the production of relatively high—

 quality products, experienced growing competition from English mills. In the

 bottle-making industry, producers of "fancy ware" such as perfume and toilet

water bottles suffered from an increasing volume of French imports.

Manufacturers of watches faced Swiss competition and and producers of jewelry

complained of German imports. Eastern glove manufactuers experienced

difficulty in matching the prices of foreign goods. The New England shoe

 industry experienced competition from Czechoslovak producers. Some producers

were sheltered by relatively generous Fordney-McCumber duties. But, for most,

foreign trends such as the desperate attempts of English mills to hold onto

market share exacerbated their woes.39 Still, only a minority of American

industries were seriously injured by foreign goods.40

      In opposition stood heavy industry, particularly segments which relied on

the assembly line and mass production. By the turn of the century, the U.S.

had gained a competitive advantage in many of the industries of the Second

Industrial Revolution, automobiles being a prime example.41 In 1929 motor cars

and parts comprised ten per cent of the value of total U.S. merchandise

exports, while imports were negligible due only partially to a modicum of

tariff protection.42 Given the importance of export sales and the anticipated

impact of a tariff on production costs, the automobile producers, led by Henry

Ford, made clear their opposition to the tariff bill.43 The same was true of

producers of farm machinery and of iron and steel bars, sheet, rails and metal

manufactures .44

     The banking community had traditionally lent support to the protectionist
                                      -18-


system. Bankers doing business in industrial regions where firms depended on

the tariff favored the maintenance of protection. But in the 1920s their

support was tempered by events. World War I had transformed the United States

from a debtor to a creditor nation and reoriented America's banking business

abroad. As early as 1923 spokesmen for the financial community acknowledged

that Europe's continued ability to service its dollar debt hinged upon foreign

industries' access to American markets.45

     A parallel shift was evident in the attitudes of organized labor.

Traditionally, labor had opposed high protection for its impact on the cost of

living. Those narrow groups of workers injured by import competition were

incapable of changing this policy. For half a century the AFL's position on

the tariff had been one of carefully cultivated neutrality. Although

individual unions might lobby for protection against imported goods or for

lower duties on raw materials, the Federation's policy was to take no position

on the issue.46 In 1930 it went only so far as to accede to individual unions'

requests for legislative assistance. However, at the November 1928 AFL

convention the first official caucus of pro-tariff unions was formed. This

"Wage Earners Protective Conference" represented 8 or 9 per cent of the

Federation's membership, the leading participants including the photo-engravers,

wall paper crafts, glass-bottle blowers and potters.47 Clearly, labor's

traditional opposition to protection was tempered by the success of pro-tariff

unions in organizing to lobby for a change in policy.

     In sum, the situation in 1930 appeared as follows. Farmers along the

Canadian border and the Eastern seaboard desired higher protection but,

comprising only a minority of American agriculture, found it difficult to

obtain alone. Light industries producing high-quality products also desired
                                      —19—


protection but similarly comprised only a portion of American manufacturing.

In principle, neither group favored protection for the other, but each was

willing to support the claims of its counterpart in return for participation

in the coalition. While agriculture received generous protection under the

final Smoot-Hawley bill, so did 1ight industry producing high—quality

products. "If one will cast aside his personal interests, he will admit that

the East and New England have fared relatively well. Some of the important

industries in the six northeast states have received about everything they

could have expected.. "48

     This framework has advantages over the view of Smoot-Hawley that divides

the American economy into monolithic agricultural and industrial blocs. It

explains why sections of the industrial Midwest and East, notably Detroit,

should have complained about the height of agricultural tariffs, and why

certain agrarian interests, notably in the South, should have complained of

industrial protection. It is consistent also with the observed alliance of

industrial and agricultural protectionists, and it explains why the

Smoot-Hawley Tariff, originally conceived as agricultural relief, evolved into

a bill extending protection to portions of both industry and agriculture. It

is consistent with Schattschneider's emphasis on log-rolling aspects of the

legislative process, but rather than characterizing the log—rolling as

entirely general suggests that "reciprocal noninterference" should have been

heavily dominated by border agriculture and light industry. It is consistent

with the notion that Hoover lost control of the legislative process by

permitting the debate to extend beyond the question of agricultural relief,

but not necessarily with the opinion of Senator Borah that a narrowly

agricultural tariff could have passed in 1929 had Hoover taken the bit in his
                                     -20-




teeth.49 National leadership, while important in both Gerschenkron's and this

paper's application of the model, plays the opposite role in the two

instances, since Bismarck favored widespread protection and played a prominent

role in obtaining it, while Hoover personally opposed blanket protection but

failed to effectively guide the legislative process. By invoking the rise of

the trade association, the model can be used to explain how diffuse

agricultural and industrial interests succeeded in influencing the legislative

process. Finally, its predictions of which sectors lobbied hardest for the

tariff is consistent with the findings of Section VII below of which sectors

reaped the greatest benefits.

     This simple model can be elaborated in various directions. One extension

would introduce the long history of protectionism in the United States and the

country's acquired habit of neglecting the impact of its economic policies on

the rest of the world.50 Another would build on the tendency of the Depression

to undermine confidence in the self-equilibrating nature of the market

mechanism. In many countries, the depth of the Depression provided a

rationale for the extension of economic planning. In Britain, for example,

Keynes went so far for a time as to argue for central planning along Soviet

lines.51 In the United States this desire for intervention and control was

most clearly manifest in the New Deal, but the same tendencies contributed to

the pressure for tariff protection -in 1930. As one American author asked in

the course of advocating the tariff, "How can the price-structure be

fortified? How can national income be distributively moralized and

rationalized? The mind of man can conceive of no answer except in terms of

enlarged social governmental control."52 The opponents of protection

acknowledged these tendencies but viewed them as dangerous trends; wrote one,
                                       —21—


     But now new defenders of the tariff have arisen. The tariff is to
     be made an instrument of national economic planning. We are told
     to look at Russia, the only country of importance with a greater
     trade in 1931 than in 1929. What we are suffering from, it is said,
     is not too much tariff but not enough tariff. The world-wide
     depression is used as a vivid illustration of the dangers of
     international economic interdependence, and we have held up before
     us the merits of a self-contained and isolated state.53

     At the same time the Depression worked to promote Smoot-Hawley by

undermining confidence in the stability of the market, it altered the costs

and benefits of protection as perceived by the principal interest groups. By

further lowering already depressed agricultural prices, it increased the

pressure agricultural interests brought to bear on elected officials. By

further undermining the already tenuous position of light industries engaged

in the production of specialty products, it reinforced their efforts to

acquire insulation from foreign competition.



III. Features of the 1930 Tariff Act


     There is dispute in the literature over the proper way to characterize

the height of the 1930 Tariff Act. A popular description of Smoot-Hawley is,

in the words of Haberler (1976), as a "skyscraper" tariff. But Dornbusch and

Fischer (1984) argue that the Fordney-McCumber Tariff of 1922 increased the

ratio of duties to either total imports or dutiable imports to the same extent

as Smoot-Hawley. If the 1930 tariff increase only matched the 1922 revision,

the absence of a recession in the wake of Fordney—McCumber casts doubt on the

notion that protectionist measures adopted in 1930 contributed significantly

to the contraction then underway. Dornbusch and Fischer also note that part

of the increase in the average rate of taxation under Smoot-Hawley reflects

the decline in the price level after 1929. Though any such effect is
                                      —22—


attributable to Smoot—Hawley insofar as the tariff was a central factor in

causing the Great Depression, not only is the tariff's causal role in

deflation debatable but, even granting it, the effects of price—level trends

should be factored out in order to isolate the magnitude of the initial

commercial initiative.

     Table 3 displays the percentage of imports entering duty free and the

average ad valorem equivalent rates of duty. Since the share of imports

entering duty free remains fairly steady over the post World War I period,

most of the variation in duties as a share of import values results from

movements in ad valorem equivalent rates. Between 1921 and 1922 the average

rate of import taxation rose by 9 percentage points, or by 29 per cent of 1921

levels. Between 1929 and 1931 (where 1931 is considered because the

Smoot-Hawley Act was only passed into law in June 1930), the average rate rose

by 13 percentage points, or nearly 33 per cent of 1929 levels. Given the

stability of the share of imports entering duty free, the same conclusion

emerges when import duties as a share of total imports are considered. Both

in percentage points and as a share of pre-existing levels, Smoot-Hawley

increases were in fact larger than those of Fordney-McCumber, but not

overwhelmingly so.

     A problem with unadjusted comparisons is that movements in the average ad

valorem rate reflect not only changes in statute but changes in import

composition and price. Price-level effects matter because many duties were

set as specific rates, and such effects could have been substantial given the

extent of price declines after 1929. To take an extreme example, as the price

of peanut oil fell from 12 to 4 cents a pound between 1928 and 1930, the

specific duty of 4 cents a pound rose from 33 to 100 per cent in ad valorem

equivalent terms. At the same time, changes in import composition could

have exerted a sizeable influence on the average rate, given the extent of

relative price movements over the period.

     Tariff Commission estimates of the average rate of taxation on dutiable

imports that would have prevailed in 1926 under the provisions of the 1930 Act

(shown in Table 4) provide an indication of average ad valorem rates in the

absence of both effects. The figures in the last four columns of Table 4,

holding constant import prices and import composition, show that Smoot-Hawley

would have raised import duties by 6 percentage points or 18 per cent of

pre-existing levels, roughly half the amount calculated when commodity-mix and

price-level effects are included.

     One can use time series data to estimate the impact of changes in the

price level on the average ad valorem rate of import taxation, regressing the

effective ad valorem rate on the import price level and a variable designed to

capture changes in statute.54 The sample period is those years when

Fordney-McCumber and Smoot-Hawley were in effect. Since the Tariff Act of

1930 was adopted midway through the year, the dummy variable for Smoot-Hawley

takes on a value of zero for years up to 1930, 0.5 for 1930, and 1.0

thereafter. Results appear in Table 5. The contrast between equations

indicates that Smoot-Hawley and price level trends are highly correlated. It

is difficult, therefore, given the length of the time series to obtain precise

estimates of the price-level effect. The point estimate on import prices in

the third equation suggests that for each point by which the price index

declined, the ad valorem equivalent rate of duty rose by 0.17 of a point.

Since that price index declined by 19 points between 1929 and 1931, this

indicates that deflation added three percentage points to the ad valorem

equivalent rate. While the precision of the estimates does not inspire

confidence, they suggest that the effects of deflation, although nonnegligible,

were considerably smaller than those of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff itself.55

     Table 4 displays average tariff rates under the House and Senate bills as

well as the compromise measure hammered out in conference committee. While

the House consistently adopted larger increases than the Senate, different

groups were extended different treatment by the two Houses of Congress. The

figures confirm that the increases bestowed on agriculture were exceptionally

large, but the Senate, where agricultural interests were disproporately

represented, offered the more generous increases, and in many cases the Senate

rates were those ultimately adopted. Of the 887 tariff increases, fully 250

were on agricultural goods. At the same time, the figures support the special

attention paid to border agriculture in Section II above. Tobacco, an

example of a Southern agricultural good, received increases less generous than

the average for dutiable imports. Similarly, there is support for the

distinction between the levels of protection offered modern mass-production

industries and those offered industries producing high—quality products on a

smaller scale. The producers of chemicals, an industry associated with the

Second Industrial Revolution, received relatively modest increases in duty

under the House and Senate bills, while pottery and related products, an

example of a sector characterized by small scale of enterprise and older

technology, received relatively generous increases.

     The figures on tariff rates by schedule are more difficult to reconcile

with previous interpretations. Pastor (1980, p.77), for example, argues that

"[tihough there was a general increase on tariffs on agricultural products,

the tariffs on industrial goods were raised so much higher that farmers of the

South, the Midwest and the Northwest, concerned over their rising costs of

production, not to say living, ended up opposing the bill." Table 4 indicates

to the contrary that increases on industrial imports did not approach those on

agricultural goods, implying that the bill was opposed mainly by farmers on

whose products import duties were ineffective. Moreover, the figures in Table

4 refer to dutiable imports alone. Most of the 75 items added to the free

list were transferred at the request of agriculture.56



IV. Analyzing Smoot-Hawley's Macroeconomic Effects


       The macroeconomic effects of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff have received

particular emphasis in the accounts of Meltzer (1976), Gordon and Wilcox

(1981) and Saint-Etienne (1984). Yet their analyses are neither equivalent

nor compatible. For example, MeItzer (1976, pp.459-50) writes:

     After a year of debate, the Hawley-Smoot tariff was approved in June
     1930. The tariff raised U.S. import duties substantially,
     particularly for agricultural products, and was quickly followed by
     higher duties in many countries.

        The tariffs restricted the operation of the price-specie-flow
     mechanism and the adjustment of the U.S. and the world economy. In
     the absence of the tariff, prices in the U.S. would have fallen
     relative to prices abroad the change in relative prices would have
     increased foreign demand and net exports. With the tariff in effect
     in 1930, the U.S. balance of payments shifted from deficit to
     surplus; the trade balance declined very little; the monetary gold
     stock increased and prices in the U.S. fell by less than prices in
     other industries countries....

        This argument assigns a largely role to the Hawley-Smoot tariff
     in explaining why the 1929 recession did not follow the path of
     previous monetary contractions but became the Great Depression.


Meltzer thus appears to emphasize Smoot-Hawley's deflationary impact on the

rest of the world and the damage to the U.S. economy of the international
                                       -26—


 repercussions. While some pasages appear to suggest that Smoot-Hawley

would have contributed to the contraction of the U.S. economy even in the

 absence of retaliation abroad, tariff retaliation nonetheless figures as a

central aspect of the indictment.

     Gordon and Wilcox (1981, p.82), while critical of other aspects of

Meltzer's argument, write approvingly of his discussion of the tariff:

     Meltzer is on firmer ground when he blames another international
     factor, the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act of June 1930, as responsible for
     converting a 'sizeable recession into a severe depression.'....The
     tariff was responsible for an increase of almost 50 per cent in the
     effective rate of duties paid on imports between 1929 and 1932.
     This aggravated the contraction through three main channels:

        1. Directly, without any retaliation, the resulting increase
     in the price of U.S. imports and close substitutes altered the
     division of the nominal income decline between output and prices in
     1930—32, so that output fell more than otherwise and prices fell
     less.

        2. Foreign retaliation reduced the demand for U.S. exports,
     which aggravated the contraction through the standard Keynesian
     multiplier mechanism.

        3. Foreign retaliation against U.S. exports of food products,
     which dropped 66 per cent between 1929 and 1932. . .aggravated the
     decline in farm prices, which was an important cause of rural bank
     failures and in turn the decline in the supply of money due to
     currency hoarding.


While Gordon and Wilcox elaborate certain of Meltzer's arguments, they

transcend his analysis by Citing the export multiplier as the mechanism by

which the effects of tariffs are transmitted internationally and by arguing

explicitly that Smoot-Hawley would have been contractionary even in the

absence of retaliation. In contrast to Meltzer's emphasis on the

price—specie-flow mechanism, they invoke the quantity equation as a channel

through which Smoot-Hawley had contractionary effects.

     In this section and the next, I argue to the contrary (1) that the direct
                                      —27—


effects of Smoot-Hawley were favorable for the U.S. economy and unfavorable

abroad, (ii) that the impact of the tariff on foreign demands for U.S. exports

did not offset these favorable effects, and (iii) that it is even unclear that

foreign retaliation swamped these effects. The central point is the same as

Schumpeter's (1939, p. 707), that "[i]t is not easy to see how, had a

reduction of import duties been passed instead of the Hawley—Smoot Act, this

could have improved short-run conditions in Europe without aggravating them in

the U.S."

     These conclusions derive from a simple two-country model of the open

economy, drawing on the work of Mundell (1961) and Fleming (1962) but extended

to encompass aggregate supply and gold-standard rules governing money. The

central elements of each country model are three: (i) an upward sloping

aggregate supply function along which output decreases with the real product

wage, coupled with an aggregate demand function whose arguments are relative

prices and interest rates; (ii) a gold-standard money supply rule according to

which money in circulation is endogenously determined by central bank gold

reserves, coupled with a money demand function whose arguments are income and

interest rates; and (iii) the assumption that labor markets adjust less quickly

than commodity markets, so that money wages lag behind product prices. Along

with trade, the two countries are tied together by the assumption that capital

is internationally mobile, linking their domestic interest rates, and that their

central bank gold reserves exhaust the world total, linking their money

supplies.

     Many of the conclusions follow intuitively without formal analysis of

the model. In this section I present an informal discussion of the

central conclusions before presenting in the next section the derivation of
                                      -28-


results.

     The simplest case ignores the impact of U.S. policy on world prices,

output and real balances, and neglects foreign retaliation. This amounts to

assuming that the U.S. was small relative to the world economy and that its

actions were of no consequence to foreign countries. These assumptions are

employed not for their realism but as a pedagogic device. After analyzing the

effects of a tariff in this simplified setting, I incorporate repercussions

and retaliation.

     The problem with Gordon and Wilcox's argument that the Smoot-Hawley

tariff aggravated the contraction "[d]irectly, without any retaliation" is

that, under fixed exchange rates, a tariff is expansionary for reasons related

to both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. On the demand side, the

imposition of a tariff switches expenditure from imports to domestic goods.

Only if any upward pressure on domestic producer prices due to import taxation

is exactly matched by an increase in domestic Unit costs should relative

prices and the pattern of spending remain unchanged after the tariff's

imposition. The average rate of import taxation in 1931 was 52 per cent, up

from 39 per cent in 1929; one can imagine that an increase of this magnitude

would, through its expenditure-switching effects, have provided considerable

stimulus to the demand for domestic goods, holding constant the level of

expenditure.

     This presumption that output and employment are increasing functions of

the ratio of product prices to variable costs derives from the neoclassical

theory of the firm. Gordon and Wilcox take a different approach to the

determination of aggregate supply, invoking instead the quantity equation.

Since the tariff raised prices relative to what they would have otherwise
                                      -29--



been, holding the money stock and velocity constant, it must have reduced the

volume of production. But as Meltzer would note, this ignores the endogenous

adjustment of money supply under any fixed exchange rate regime including a

gold-exchange standard. Since the stock of money was demand-determined, the

rise in prices due to Smoot-Hawley, by reducing real balances, would have

forced the balance of payments into surplus, permitting gold and foreign

exchange to be imported from abroad and converted by the Federal Reserve until

real balances had been restored to desired levels. This may be what Meltzer

has in mind when he suggests that the Smoot-Hawley tariff influenced the

operation of the price-specie-flow mechanism and observes that in 1930 the

U.S. balance of payments moved strongly into surplus while the monetary gold

stock increased.57

     Ironically, Gordon and Wilcox's conclusions are correct for a floating

exchange rate regime: under floating the domestic money supply can be taken as

exogenous, and the imposition of a tariff, by raising import prices, will

lower the volume of production (Eichengreen, 1981a, 1983). Gordon and Wilcox

imply that the flexible exchange rate analysis is appropriate since the

Federal Reserve sterilized gold inflows over much of the period. But the

presence of sterilization does not change the fact that the money supply was

demand-determined under the fixed exchange rate regime. The Fed could

influence only the composition of the money supply (domestic credit versus

gold and foreign exchange reserves) but not the quantity in circulation if the

exchange rate was fixed, interest parity held, and the volume of transactions

was determined exogenously.

     It might be objected that domestic output was depressed by the real

balance effect on spending. Real balances fell temporarily, the argument
                                        —30—


would run, because time was required to generate the trade balance surplus

needed for gold imports. By raising prices and reducing real balances, one

could hypothesize that Smoot-Hawley compressed U.S. spending sufficiently to

depress output and employment. To so argue would overlook that, insofar as

the tariff created an excess demand for real balances which were then

accumulated by running a balance-of-payments surplus, it placed a wedge

between domestic output and absorption, rendering the latter an inappropriate

indicator of the level of production.

     it is unrealistic, if convenient, to analyze Smoot-Hawley under the

assumption of constant international prices. When a country has market power,

as surely was true of the United States, the imposition of a tariff or an

increase -in modest duties improves its terms of trade. This presumption

appears to be consistent with Meltzer's position when he argues that U.S.

prices declined less than foreign prices in 1930 due to Smoot-Hawley. But it

is instructive to recall the source of the improvement in the terms of trade

of the tariff-imposing country: its terms of trade improve precisely because

the tariff creates an incipient excess demand for domestic goods. In other

words, introducing the standard terms—of—trade effects of a tariff and finding

support for them in the data provide another indication that the Smoot-Hawley

exercised an expansionary impact on the U.S. economy.

     It could be argued that rates of import taxation were already so high

that Smoot-Hawley exceeded optimal tariff levels, causing the terms of trade

to deteriorate. Since the impact of Smoot—Hawley on the U.S. terms of trade

has not been estimated, there exists no empirical support for this position.

But since Meltzer argues that Smoot-Hawley pushed up U.S. prices relative to

foreign prices, this is unlikely to be the basis of his argument.

     One might attempt to salvage the argument that Smoot-Hawley was

contractionary on grounds of expectations. Saint—Etienne (1984) suggests that

uncertainty surrounding the tariff's imposition prior to May 1930, and perhaps

also uncertainty about prospects for retaliation, increased the demand for

real balances in the U.S., with deflationary consequences.58 However, were the

demand for real balances to rise owing to uncertainty about commercial policy,

this need not cause a decline in output and employment; under fixed exchange

rates, the additional real balances are accumulated by reducing domestic

absorption relative to production and exporting the difference.

     One might attempt to salvage the expectational argument on the grounds

that people mistakenly thought the tariff would be contractionary. Even if

Smoot-Hawley would have been expansionary in a world of static expectations, a

belief that -it would be contract-ionary could have depressed firms' production

and investment decisions and households' expenditure plans. The impact of

anticipations could in principle have swamped the tariff's direct effects.

But such an argument hinges on the notion that agents fundamentally

misunderstood the operation of the tariff. They would have had to base their

actions on an incorrect model of the economy, not a particularly appealing

assumption.

     It might be argued that Smoot-Hawley was contractionary due to its

international repercussions. By "restrict[ing) the operation of the

price-specie-flow mechanism" (Meltzer, 1976, p. 460), the Smoot-Hawley tariff

attracted gold to the U.S., or at least prevented it from flowing out,

reinforcing contraction abroad and reducing foreign demands for U.S. exports.

This decline in foreign demand might have dwarfed any increased domestic

demand for American goods. This may be what Meltzer alludes to when he states
                                      —32—


that, by raising U.S. prices, the imposition of Smoot—Hawley made U.S. exports

less competitive and reduced foreign demand for U.S. products and net exports.

Yet only under extreme assumptions about economic structure will these

repercussions offset the direct effects of a tariff. Even were foreign

incomes to fall by the same proportion that domestic incomes rise, since the

marginal propensity to consume domestic goods is higher out of domestic than

foreign incomes, the demand for domestic goods generally will rise. Again,

the change in the terms of trade provides evidence on the direction of the net

effect: since the American terms of trade improve between 1929 and 1930, the

demand for U.S. goods appears to have been stimulated.

     The argument that Smoot-Hawley was contractionary must hinge, therefore,

on the effects of retaliation. For the reasons described, notably expenditure

switching, a foreign tariff has a contractionary impact on the domestic

economy in the same way that a domestic tariff is expansionary. If

retaliation against Smoot-Hawley was sufficiently severe, the

expenditure-switching effects of foreign tariffs could have swamped those of

the U.S. initiative. Clearly, in the presence of retaliation the output and

employment effects of a tariff are ambiguous. But the movement of relative

prices provides a guide to the combined impact of domestic and foreign

policies. If retaliation more than offsets the effects of domestic commercial

initiatives, expenditure will be switched on balance toward foreign goods,

whose relative prices rise to clear world markets. As Meltzer notes, U.S.

prices, not foreign prices, rose in relative terms between 1929 and 1930.

Unless other terms-of-trade effects swamped those of Smoot-Hawley and

retaliation, commercial policy appears to have been expansionary from the U.S.

point of view.
                                      —33—


       There is a special case in which a tariff that elicits retaliation can

have a contractionary impact on the initiating country even when it suffers no

deterioration in its terms of trade. This will occur if the tariffs' combined

price-level effects outweigh their combined relative price effects. By pushing

up consumer prices worldwide, tariffs-cum-retaliation may alter the division

between prices and production, given no change in the world money stock. This

is Gordon and Wilcox's quantity-equation argument on a global scale. Holding

the quantity of money fixed and ignoring changes in the velocity of

circulation, the worldwide rise in consumer prices due to import taxation must

be offset by a combination of lower net-of-tariff prices and lower outputs.

But the imposition of equal tariffs at home and abroad necessarily reduces

output only when velocity is fixed; the more interest elastic the demand for

money, the less likely this result is to obtain. Insofar as it is appropriate

to characterize the early 1930s as a period when money demand was relatively

elastic -- as a period when the economy was in a liquidity trap --   output   and

employment are likely to rise both at home and abroad.

     A final argument invoked by Meltzer and by Gordon and Wilcox concerns the

sectoral effects of the policies. Metzler suggests that by raising American

prices relative to those prevailing abroad, Smoot-Hawley depressed American

agricultural exports. This was a source of distress in farming regions, where

nonperforming mortgage loans contributed to the wave of bank failures which

was so heavily concentrated in agricultural areas —- bank failures in turn

responsible for the monetary contraction that was the proximate cause of the

Great Depression. In this view, the tariff so reduced foreign prices that it

left American producers worse off.

     This argument can only be correct under extremely restrictive
                                       —34--



assumptions. Since the most generous tariff increases under Srnoot-Hawley were

those on agricultural goods, for present purposes we can analyze it as a

tariff on agricultural imports. Such a tariff, by raising American prices

relative to those prevailing abroad and by reducing foreign incomes, would

have tended to depress foreign demands for American exports. But domestic

prices rather than domestic exports are the appropriate indicator of sectoral

welfare effects. The tariff wedge tends to put upward pressure on American

prices at the same time it tends to reduce prices abroad. This increase in

domestic prices leaves domestic producers better off despite the decline in

exports: it reflects the tariff's tendency to switch domestic demand toward

domestic produce. In other words, a tariff is protective precisely because it

increases domestic demand for importable goods by more than it reduces demand

abroad. The exception to this rule is the Metzler Paradox (Metzler, 1949),

the special case in which the domestic price of the protected good falls

because foreign export demands are sufficiently inelastic. But if the channel

through which the tariff exercised its contractionary effect was the Metzler

Paradox, the indictment of Smoot-Hawley loses its generality and its force.

     Gordon and Wilcox are on firmer ground theoretically when they suggest

that foreign retaliation against American agricultural exports was the source

of farm distress. They cite the dramatic decline in American agricultural

exports as evidence of retaliation's effects. Yet they provide no evidence

that retaliation was in fact skewed toward American exports of agricultural

goods. As described in Section VI, many European restrictions on agricultural

imports were imposed in the second half of the 1920s, not in the wake of

Sinoot-Hawley, while those tariffs which were most clearly retaliatory were

imposed against U.S. exports of relatively sophisticated manufactures such as
                                         —35—


automobiles, vehicle components and sewing machines.



V.     A Model of the Macroeconomic Effects


       A simple model can spell out the arguments advanced above. The framework

analyzed here is an adaptation of the two-country Mundell-Fleming model,

extended to incorporate both a supply side and links between monetary

aggregates and gold. I first consider the small-country case before

introducing the full two-country model.

       Money demand is specified in standard transactions-balance form:


(1)          m-=qy-i

where m is log nominal money balances, p is the log price deflator relevant

for measuring real balances, y is log GOP, and i is the nominal interest rate.

Interest rates are linked internationally by open interest parity.



(2)          I =   1* +




The domestic interest rate equals the foreign interest rate plus the

expected rate of depreciation of the exchange rate, denoted /e. Asterisks

signify foreign variables throughout. Assuming that the exchange rate is

credibly fixed, the expected rate of change of the exchange rate is zero, and

I =   1*.   Convertibility crises are not considered.

      Under a gold standard, the central bank is assumed to peg the domestic

currency price of gold at 11G.59 G denotes ounces of gold per unit of domestic
                                            -36-


currency. With the foreign central bank pegging the foreign-currency price of

gold at ]./G*, the exchange rate E, defined as units of foreign currency per

unit of domestic currency, equals G/G*. Letting lower case letters signify

logs of the corresponding upper case variables, e = g -       g*.   Since the

exchange rate is fixed, it can be normalized to unity and suppressed.

      The domestic currency value of a given volume of gold reserves R is

simply R/G. Denoting the gold backing of the currency (the ratio of money

supply to gold reserves) A, the money supply can be decomposed into:


(3)                    m=A+ r-g

where r is the log of R. When the gold backing ratio is fixed, the money

supplies of the two countries are rigidly linked. To highlight the two

countries' interdependence, A is held constant throughout the analysis.

      The consumer price index is used to deflate real money balances:


(4)        p =    cp + (1_e)p* +   (1-e)t          0 <   c   < 1




where p is the log domestic-currency price of domestic output, p is the

log foreign-currency price of foreign output, and t is the log tariff wedge

(one plus the ad valorem rate of import taxation).

      Aggregate supply is a decreasing function of the real product wage:


(5)        y =   -a(w-p)

where w is the log wage and a is the supply elasticity. In line with the

short-run focus of the analysis, the nominal wage is taken as fixed.

      Aggregate demand in each country is written as a decreasing function of
                                                   —37-.



competitiveness (p_p*) adjusted for import taxation and of the nominal

interest rate i, and as an increasing function of a shift parameter Z designed

to capture autonomous shifts in demand.


(6)        y = -6(p--p*—t) -          ai   + Z


      In the small-country case, p* and i* are parametric. Differentiating

totally and solving with Cramer's rule yields:


'7'
           dt        ö+a

'8'
           din   —   a(1-e)    +   ö(1+a4)
           dt                 â+a


(7) shows that an increase in t drives up the domestic product price, except

in the limiting case of a -÷               expanding output and employment. The rise in p
increases with the responsiveness of demand to relative prices and decreases

with the responsiveness of supply to the real product wage. (8) shows that

the endogenously-determined money supply depends similarly on the same

parameters (ö and a); in addition, the rise in nominal balances is an

increasing function of the income elasticity of money demand (since income

rises) and of the share of domestic spending on imported goods 1-e (since the

larger this share the greater the extent to which the tariff drives up

consumer prices) 60

      Thus, a tariff unambiguously raises output and employment. If

ambiguities arise, they must result therefore from repercussion effects or

retaliation. To analyze these effects, equations for the foreign country must

be introduced. It is convenient to specify the foreign country as identical to

the domestic, both in scale and structural coefficients. These assumptions
                                                        -38—


simplify (without dictating) the results.                            In addition, the two countries'

reserves now must sum to the world gold stock RW (RW = R +                            R*).   Note that

dr = d log R = dR/R.            Then changes in the reserves of the two central banks

are related by:


(9)         ydr +         (1-y)dr*   = 0




where y = R/RW in the initial equilibrium. In the symmetric case, y =                                    1/2.
       A general equation for foreign retaliation takes the form:


(10)        dt* =         8dt

where 0     0.


       To analyze repercussion effects without retaliation, consider the

imposition of a domestic tariff when 9 =                        0.    In this case:



 11
                      (a+5)[2o —      (aI)(1—c)J        +       (a/)(e+aq)[o   —   (a/$)(1—c)]   >
                                                                                                     0
            dt                                              A



            ci!: —    a(1+aq) [a+(a/)      (1+aq)) ]+(1-e) ((1-cl [a+(a/) (1+a) l+cz[a+(c/$) (c+aq) I)
 12)        dt                                                           A
                     >0

where A =   2(2o+a)[a+(o/)(aq+1)]              >   0.
       If c =    1   (so that the rise in import prices does not reduce real

balances), a tariff increase raises p and is unambiguously expansionary for

the same reasons as in the small country case. But as e declines toward zero,

real balances tend to be reduced by the tariff-induced price-level increase,

attracting more reserves to the domestic country. The consequent decline in

money supply in the foreign country reduces the level of output there,
                                            -39—


depressing the demand for home-country exports.

     (a/)(1-ö) > 5 is a necessary condition for repercussion effects to

reverse the tariff's own-country expansionary impact. If money demand is

interest inelastic,   -÷   0 and a >   (a/)(1-e)    becomes unlikely, in which case

activity falls. By increasing consumer prices, holding other variables

constant, the tariff's imposition reduces the supply of real balances,

creating an incipient excess demand for money and forcing producer prices to

decline to clear asset markets. Since output and employment depend on the

real product wage, activity also falls. The force of this real balance effect

rises with the share of imports in domestic consumption (1-c). As           -,a
marginal rise in the interest rate suffices to equilibrate the money market.

The smaller a/ (the smaller the interest-elasticity of commodity demand

relative to money demand), the more likely are the positive supply-side

effects (which operate through a lower real producer wage) to outweigh the

negative demand-side effects (which operate through higher interest rates).

     In the presence of retaliation (9 >      0),   a commercial initiative may be

either expansionary or contractionary, depending in part on the height of the

tariffs the domestic and foreign countries impose. Through its expenditure

switching effects, a foreign tariff reduces domestic output and employment for

the same reasons that a domestic tariff increases them. Guidance on the net

direction of these expenditure-switching effects can be found in the movement

of the terms of trade. If expenditure is switched on balance toward domestic

goods, the home country's international terms of trade will have to improve

(raising the relative price of domestic output to clear commodity markets).

     By placing a wedge between consumer and producer prices, even tariffs cum

retaliation with no terms of trade effects alter output and employment.

Consider the symmetric case of 0 =     1.   Then:
                                            —40—



'13'
            dt
                 —   (a/)(l) [a+(a/) (1+aq)]+[5-(a/) (1—c)]2[ai-(a/)(l—c)]
                 >0

Note that dp =       dp* under the assumption of symmetry, and dm = dm* = 0 since
both countries are affected identically. Again, the change in the level of

activity depends largely on the sign of ô -        (a/)(1-c).     For activity to

decline, the interest elasticity of commodity demand a must be large relative

to the price elasticity of commodity demand ,        the   interest elasticity of

money demand , and the share of domestic goods in the price index €.

         Even when these demand-side effects dominate, if the domestic tariff is

sufficiently high relative to the foreign tariff, a domestic commercial

initiative can still be expansionary. This result is at least possible when

the domestic country's terms of trade improve, as was the case for the U.S. in

1929—30.

       These analytic results provide little intuition for the magnitude of the

effects. How large an impact on GOP could be attributed to a tariff on the

order of Smoot-Hawley -in the limiting, small-country case? To what extent

does the introduction of repercussions attenuate the effect? By how much does

its magnitude diminish further in the presence of retaliation?

       To provide a sense of magnitudes, the model can be calibrated and used in

couriterfactual exercises. Equations (7), (8), (11), (12), and (13) depend on

six parameters: the elasticity of aggregate supply (a), the price and

interest elasticities of aggregate demand (ô and a, respectively), the share

of domestic consumption devoted to goods produced at home (e), and the income

and interest elasticities of money demand (4 and ).          I   impose standard values

for these parameters to see what they imply. Since the value of the
                                         -41—


parameters is known only approximately, the results are merely suggestive.

Still, they shed light on the questions at hand.

         Assuming a Cobb-Douglas production function with a labor share of 0.75,

the elasticity of supply of profit-maximizing firms -is 3.0. Adopting standard

values from a variety of money demand studies, p is set to unity and       to 0.5.

o   is   assumed to equal unity and, as in Sachs and Wyplosz (1984), a is set at

0.8. Finally, in line with interwar patterns, the share of spending on

domestic goods is set to 0.85.

         From equations (5) and (7), these parameters imply in the small country

case an elasticity of GDP with respect to the average ad valorem rate of

import taxation of 0.75. Treating Smoot-Hawley as a tariff increase of

seven percentage points (the Tariff Commission's estimate for commodities

subject to duty), this implies as an upper-bound estimate that Smoot Hawley

increased GOP by 5.25 per cent, ceteris paribus. The fall in output between

1929 and 1931 was on the order of 15 per cent. According to this upper—bound

estimate, Smoot Hawley exerted a useful expansionary impulse which reduced the

fall in output which would have otherwise occurred by roughly a quarter.

         Continuing to assume no retaliation but introducing repercussions as in

equation (11) reduces the tariff's impact dramatically. When the same

parameters are imposed for the home and foreign countries, 5,      and   are
sufficiently large relative to a for the tariff's impact to remain positive.

The top panel of Table 6, where the same calculations are reported for a range

of different parameter values, shows that this result is quite general.

But the elasticity of output with respect to the import tax rate falls to

0.37. Thus, admitting Smoot—Hawley's tendency to reduce foreign income and

foreign demand for U.S. exports, the tariff is found to raise GOP by 2.6

percent, ceteris paribus. In a period when output was falling by 15 per

cent, any initiative which would have expanded production was helpful, but

the macroeconomic impact of Smoot-Hawley appears to have been dwarfed by the

Great Depression. The small size of the output effect compared to the

small-country case supports the emphasis contemporaries placed on Smoot-

Hawley's external effects and on feedbacks to the United States.

     In contrast, adding retaliation, assuming domestic and foreign tariffs to

be of equal height, yields relatively little change in the output effect. The

elasticity of output with respect to the tariff falls from 0.37 to 0.23, and

the percentage increase in output from 2.6 to 1.6 percent. The bottom panel

of Table 6 shows that basically the same result holds for a range of parameter

values. Although the direction of the change is expected, its magnitude is

surprising compared to the introduction of repercussion effects. Retaliation

damages the home country by switching foreign demand away from domestic

exports, but that damage is ameliorated by the induced increase in foreign

income and spending. In the case considered here, the interest semi-elasticity

of money demand f3 is sufficiently high that the tendency of tariffs at home

and abroad to put upward pressure on output prices is not offset by the

deflationary influence of the consequent increase in money demand. Instead,

money demand is curtailed by its relatively high interest elasticity, while

spending is only slightly reduced by its relatively low interest elasticity.

     Thus, the parameters used here suggest that the case where Smoot-Hawley

plus retaliation increase output is not beyond the realm of possibility. In

any case, the tariff's direct macroeconomic effects were surely small. It is

far from clear that Smoot-Hawley cum retaliation operating through standard

macroeconomic channels was a major, or for that matter, even a contributing

factor to the Great Depression.

VI. External Effects and International Repercussions


     If its direct macroeconomic effects were not to blame, Smoot—Hawley still

could have contributed to the severity of the Depression by undermining the

stability of the international system. The most damning indictment of the

tariff is that it unleashed a tidal wave of retaliation which had undesirable

repercussions on the operation of international monetary and financial

institutions. In particular, the collapse of the interwar gold standard and

distintegration of the international financial system have been blamed on the

disruptive influence of the U.S. tariff. The argument advanced by Meltzer

(1976) is that tariff barriers impeded the operation of the price-specie-flow

mechanism. In this view, the ability of the monetary system to adjust to

disturbances was undermined by commercial restrictions. Yet it is not

adequately explained why the presence of tariffs should inhibit smooth

adjustment. The model analyzed above suggests that a tariff's imposition will

tend to raise the price level, which will increase the demand for money

balances, drawing gold toward the country where protection -is imposed. But

this is a one-time effect which would follow the tariff's imposition without

impeding subsequent reserve flows in response to other determinants of the

balance of payments.61

     It makes more sense to analyze Smoot-Hawley not as a measure which

undermined the capacity of the financial system to adjust to normal balance of

payments pressures but as one which redistributed gold from countries with

weak reserve positions to a country whose position was strong, thereby

undermining the system's resistance to exceptional destabilizing events.

Smoot-Hawley was imposed at a time when the U.S. balance of payments was in

surplus, when there was no threat to the dollar, and when the Federal Reserve
                                          -44—


held ample reserves of monetary gold. By further strengthening the payments

position, Smoot-Hawley conveyed additional gold to the U.S., which further

strengthened the dollar but undermined the stability of currencies abroad.

The value of U.S. gold reserves rose from $3746 billion in 1928 to $3900

billion in 1929 and $4225 billion in 1930, before slipping to $4051 billion in

1931. By 1931 the United States possessed 40 per cent of the world's monetary

gold stock.62 Hence other countries were forced to defend the convertibility

of their currencies on the basis of slender reserves. Some such as Britain

hesitated to obey the rules of the gold standard game, which dictated that

they reduce their money supplies in an amount proportional to gold losses.

When the market was disturbed —-   in   the British case by the Austrian and

German financial crises of the summer of 1931 which froze short-term assets of

the British banking system and dealt a general blow to confidence --     the   low

level of reserves left the Bank of England little room for manoeuvre. Once

Britain was forced off gold, some two dozen countries followed, and the

devaluation cycle of the 1930s was underway.63 Since devaluation as practiced

in the 1930s was an uncoordinated, beggar-thy-neighbor policy which created

uncertainty and undermined the public good or "international moneyness" of the

fixed exchange rate regime, here we have another possible channel through

which Smoot-Hawley's negative effects were felt.64

     Precisely how much greater British reserves would have been and how much

difference additional reserves would have made to the Bank of England's

defence of sterling is difficult to say. Palyi (1972, p. 182), for one,

doubts that the difference would have been great. International loans to the

British from the French and Americans delayed devaluation only temporarily.

But these funds may have been ineffective in restoring confidence precisely
                                        —45—


because they were loans rather than reserves -- because the public viewed them

not as British resources but as liabilities to be repaid. In this view,

Smoot—Hawley is likely to have made some contribution to the international

monetary system's collapse.

     The gold standard's disintegration coincided with the collapse of foreign

lending. Between 1923 and 1928, capital had flowed on a large scale from the

United States and United Kingdom to Europe (primarily to Germany, although to

Eastern Europe as well), to Canada, to Latin America, and to portions of the

British Empire. Starting in 1928, with the boom on Wall Street, capital

exports from the leading supplier of long-term capital, the United States,

declined precipitously. Lending recovered somewhat in 1930 before widespread

default in 1931 all but eliminated American capital exports. While debt

default was only one factor disrupting long-term capital flows, without doubt

it was a major one.

     There is considerable debate over the underlying soundness of loans made

in the second half of the 1920s. Tales of loan pushing, corruption and

wasteful use of borrowed funds imply that at least some defaults would have

ensued even in the best of circumstances. But a number of observers argued

that protectionist measures in the industrialized center exacerbated the

difficulties the borrowing countries faced in attempting to service their

external debts.65     Eichengreen and Portes (1986) identify the magnitude of the

terms—of-trade deterioration suffered by borrowing countries as an important

determinant of the incidence and extent of default. The U.S. accounted for

more than 40 per cent of the primary product consumption of the 15 leading

industrial economies.66 Insofar as the United States had leverage in markets

for primary commodities and through the Smoot-Hawley Tariff's imposition
                                     -46-


succeeded in improving its terms of trade, it contributed to these

terms of trade deteriorations and thereby to the incidence of default.

Between 1929 and 1932 the relative prices of wheat and sugar declined by over

20 and 30 per cent respectively. Although it is suggestive that these were

two of the products that received exceptionally generous protection under

Smoot—Hawley, further evidence is required to confirm that the tariff was

responsible for such trends. But as a provisional conclusion it seems fair to

say that Smoot-Hawley's undesirable effects operated in the main not through

its direct macroeconomic effects but indirectly, via its impact on the

stability of the international monetary regime and the resiliency of

international financial markets.



VII. The Extent of Retaliation


     The argument that Smoot-Hawley disrupted both the smooth operation of the

international monetary system and the smooth functioning of international

financial markets depends for its force on the presumption that Smoot—Hawley

elicited widespread retaliation. It is important to ask, therefore, whether

those foreign tariff increases which took place were in fact a result of the

1930 Tariff Act. The classic study of foreign responses to Smoot-Hawley by

Jones (1934) continues to dominate the literature.67 The problem with Jones's

account, however detailed his case studies, is that, while acknowledging the

difficulty of disentangling the impact of Smoot-Hawley from the influence of

the Depression, he proceeds on the assumption that foreign tariffs were

retaliatory, interpreting and selecting evidence accordingly rather than

testing the hypothesis.68
                                      —47—


     Contemporary judgments ranged from those of the tariff's critics, who

attributed every protectionist initiative to Smoot-Hawley, citing

demonstrations by 20,000 French lace workers in the streets of Calais and

protests by 15,000 Swiss clock and watchmakers in Bienne, to the partisan

statements of the tariff's proponents, including Senator Smoot himself, who

wrote,

     It is difficult to understand why any one should try to fasten
     responsibility for the general movement toward higher protective
     duties upon the United States. Many nations revised their tariffs
     before Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley bill in June 1930, and many
     have increased their duties since. Each country has been prompted
     by economic considerations of its own. Only the purblind egotist
     can suggest that the world turned to protection in retaliation
     against the American tariff.59


     The facts are more complex and variegated than either faction admit.

Protectionist pressure was mounting abroad well before Smoot-Hawley, and a

number of countries either had adopted tariff increases or were inclined to do

so before the 1930 Tariff Act was passed, much less signed. Between 1925 and

1929 there were 33 general revisions and substantial tariff changes in 26

European countries, and 17 revisions and changes in 20 Latin American

republics.70 The movement slowed toward the end of the decade in Europe at

least: the number of general tariff revisions decreased from 10 in 1927 to 5

in 1926 and to 2 in 1929. But stability was less apparent elsewhere; in 1927

and 1928 Australia, Canada and New Zealand instituted broad upward revisions

in tariff rates. Tariffs were used to relieve structural difficulties

experienced by staple industries expanded during wartime, to promote

industrialization through import-substitution to raise revenues in newly

established nations of Central and Eastern Europe possessing few other sources

of tax receipts and, particularly after 1927, to relieve agricultural
                                      —48-


producers suffering from the slumping commodity prices.

     A countercurrent eminated from international efforts at tariff

reduction conducted under League of Nations auspices. The League organized

a World Economic Conference in 1927 whose purpose was to work toward the

stabilization and reduction of tariffs and the elimination of nontariff

barriers to trade. Although the Conference was only a deliberative body,

the vigorous language of its pronouncements "strengthened the position of

statesmen and others the world over who were working for more liberal

commercial policies."71 Immediately following the 1927 Conference an

international group of government officials assembled to discuss the abolition

of import prohibitions and restrictions. They drew up a treaty to refrain

from use of embargoes, licensing systems and quotas, to become effective upon

ratification by all participants. Much effort was expended over the next

three years to ratify this treaty, until its rejection by the single remaining

signatory, Poland, deprived it of force. A similar fate befell the Tariff

Truce Conference convened in 1930 largely on British impetus. The treaty

which emerged from its deliberations was "weak and ambiguous and failed to

arose interest or support."72

     Against this less than auspicious backround were superimposed the effects

of the Great Depression. As Bidwell (1932, p. 396) noted, the business-cycle

downturn reversed any movement toward lower tariffs in Europe and added

momentum to the movement for tariff increases. The point is that this would

have been true even in the absence of the American initiative. The question

is to what extent.

     One way in which this question might be answered is to ask whether there

existed circumstances heightening the danger of retaliation. Bidwell (1930a,
                                       —49-


 p. 13) argues that Europe's violent reaction to Smoot-Hawley is explicable

 partly by the fact that it followed immediately upon the onset of the

Depression, hitting Europe when its economies and export industries were most

vulnerable, and partly by resentment of other American policies. The impact

of Prohibition on exports of whiskeys from the U.K. and of wines from the

Continent was a major annoyance. More important still was what Europe

perceived as American intransigence over war debts. How could Europe fairly

be expected to service these debts, statesmen asked, if the U.S. made it

impossible to accumulate foreign exchange by blockading the major export

market?

     Ultimately, the extent of retaliation can only be determined by

studying individual cases. In some instances, evidence of retaliation is

clear. It is no coincidence that Spain, the most striking example, provides

Jones with his first case study. In 1930 Spain withdrew most favored nation

status from the United States and imposed the Wais Tariff (named after the

Minister of Commerce). Adopted a month after Smoot-Hawley, the Wais Tariff

substantially raised duties on automobiles, tires, tubes and motion pictures,

most of which were imported from the United States. Since there was little if

any Spanish production of these items, taxation of imports was simple

discrimination against the U.S. exports. Spanish officials openly

acknowledged the retaliatory nature of the increases, taken after requests by

producers and export associations ranging from the Cork Manufacturers

Association to the National Union of Agricultural Exportation. Spain reacted

so violently because Smoot—Hawley was the latest in a series of American

impediments to Spanish exports. Not the least of these was Prohibition:

before 1923 wine had comprised Spain's leading export to the United States,
                                      -50--



and government officials blamed Prohibition for the trade deficits run

thereafter.73 Moreover, Spain's remaining exports to the U.S. were

agricultural products, to which the structure of Smoot-Hawley increases was

particularly damaging.

     In other instances, such as Italy, the evidence is more ambiguous.

Although the prohibitive increase in Italian tariffs on automobiles

immediately following the adoption of Smoot-Hawley, which provides Jones his

second case study, is ascribed to reprisal motives, the authorities in Rome

had determined previously to revise these duties upward.74 Fiat had suffered a

30 per cent fall in sales over the preceding three years, much of which was

blamed on American competition in the Italian market, and for several years

Italian producers had been lobbying for increased protection. The only

question is whether the Italian tariff might have been smaller had U.S.

duties not been raised.

     The timing of events provides little guidance on the extent of

retaliation. In the Canadian case, for example, it is clear that officials

were closely monitoring the progress of Congressional debate and contemplating

retaliatory measures as early as 1929. Given the importance to Canada of

agricultural exports destined for American markets, the argument is plausible.

But Canadian tariff policy depended most of all on domestic political

developments. Between 1921 and 1929, with one short interruption, Canadian

politics were controlled by the traditionally low-tariff Liberal Party. When

the Conservatives, the traditional party of protection, took power following

the General Election of July 1930, almost immediately the new Premier offered

a tariff measure to Parliament. Until it is shown that the 1930 election

turned on the progress of American tariff legislation (a contention asserted
                                      —51—


but not proven by Jones), the only question is whether the increase might have

been smaller had Smoot-Hawley not been passed.

     Similar controvery surrounds the question of whether changes in

Czechoslovak restrictions on vehicle imports had a retaliatory component. A

Franco-Czech agreement under negotiation in the summer of 1930 proposed to

establish a Czech automobile import quota of 750 cars from each most-favored

nation. This, it was alleged, was a reprisal against the United States, since

the quota equaled or exceeded annual imports from France and other European

countries but was less than one—third of American sales. But skeptics

questioned whether the Czechs had any reason to single out American trade

policy as the source of their troubles, noting that U.S. imports of dutiable

Czech goods fell by only seven per cent between the f-irst quarters of 1930 and

1931, at the same time purchases of non-dutiable items declined much more

rapidly. 76

     One European initiative, the British General Tariff of 1932, has been the

subject of considerable recent attention.77 This case is notable for several

reasons, not the least of which was Britain's symbolic value as the last

bulwark of free trade. While there is some disagreement over the precise

reasons for Britain's adoption of the General Tariff, there is no dispute that

retaliatory motives rank low on the scale of motivations. There is little

evidence in Parliamentary debate, ministerial correspondence or discussions

among economic advisors that retaliation played much role in British

discussion. The only argument that can be construed as retaliatory is Stanley

Baldwin's suggestion that Britain impose duties to act as a lever to bargain

down the tariffs imposed abroad. The central economic considerations were

domestic -- whether a tariff would ameliorate Britain's unemployment problem
                                      —52—


and help to defend the exchange rate -- as were the central political factors,

namely the dominance of the Conservative Party in the National Government

formed in 1931.

     Given the clarity of this evidence, it is interesting to note Jones's

(1934) treatment of the British case. The General Tariff is spoken of in the

same breath with others in which evidence of retaliation is more compelling,

despite the fact that the principal motives for the British tariff's

imposition were at best tangentially related to U.S. commercial policy.18

     What can be said by way of conclusion? Clearly, certain tariff increases

adopted by other countries had important retaliatory components. But others,

including some popularly blamed on Smoot-Hawley, appear to have been adopted

mainly for other reasons. In the absence of a definitive reassessment of the

motives of the major trading nations, it would seem appropriate to view

Smoot-Hawley as but one of a number of forces contributing to the collapse of

the international trading system.



VIII. Import Prices, Import Volumes and Import Taxation


      Strikingly, there are just two empirical analyses of the impact of

Smoot-Hawley on U.S. foreign trade, both completed within three years of the

tariff's imposition. The first, an informal study by Hirschfeld (1932),

examines the behavior of United States imports in 1930 and 1931. Hirschfeld

was aware of the problem of abnormal imports --   that   importers monitored the

debate over tariff revision and attempted to beat the imposition of higher

duties by accelerating shipments to the U.S. While aware that this would

cause simple before and after comparisons to exagerate the effects of the
                                      .-53—



tariff, Hirschfield made no adjustment for it. Instead he assumed that, since

Smoot-Hawley was imposed about halfway through 1930 (on June 17), the tendency

of anticipations to raise imports in the first six months was offset by the

tariff's tendency to lower them in the remaining six, rendering 1930

representative of the pre-tariff situation. On the basis of trade in 1930 and

1931, he concluded that the volume of America's high-duty imports declined by

more than imports as a whole.

     A more rigorous analysis was provided by Hall (1933). Hall acknowledged

that "the problem of isolating the effect of this particular tariff act was

hopelessly complicated by the world depression...." and the procedure he

developed catalogs considerations that must be taken into account in any

attempt to estimate the impact of Smoot Hawley on U.S. trade.79 Hall's

starting point was the observation that, if imports can be partitioned into

two "really large and well-diversified groups" according to whether or not

their rates of duty were affected by the 1930 Tariff Act, the decline in

imports of goods on which duties were unaffected ("Category A") could be

attributed solely to the Depression, and any additional fall in imports of

goods in the other group ("Category B") could be attributed to the tariff.

Between calendar year 1929 and the twelve months ending on September 30, 1931,

imports in Category A fell by 43.5 per cent and those in Category B by 60.0

per cent. On this basis Hall concluded that Smoot-Hawley reduced U.S. imports

by $191 million, or just under 17 per cent. When 1928 imports were used as

the base, his estimate was slightly higher, just under 20 percent.

     Hall was aware of the shortcomings of this simple procedure and made

various adjustments for them. He first attempted, unlike Hirschfeld, to

adjust for imports made in anticipation of higher rates of duty. On the basis
                                      —54--



of Department of Commerce estimates of articles in bonded warehouses at

month-ends, he estimated the value of anticipatory shipments at $125 million,

$25 million of which remained in stocks on September 1, 1930, the starting

date for the second half of his comparison. Accordingly, he reduced his

provisional $191 million figure to $166 million.

     Hall next considered the extent of overvaluation of imports on

consignment due to the fact that prices were falling over the period 1930-31

but U.S. customs statistics were based on value at foreign point of origin.

Since the two groups of imports were large and diversified, however, the

impact on each was assumed to be similar and the required adjustment was

negligible. Hall's third adjustment was for the tendency of deflation to

raise the ad valorem value of specific duties. Since there were more

duty-free imports, to which this consideration would not apply, in Category A,

the interaction of deflation and specific duties would lead the simple

comparison to overestimate the effects of Smoot—Hawley. Hall deducted another

$25 million from the effects of the tariff, reducing his -interrim estimate to

$141 million.

     Hall's final concern, namely differences in the commodity composition of

Categories A and B, was probably the most important. Despite his intent to

construct two large and well-diversified groups of products, Hall's Category A

was disproportionately comprised of raw materials that entered duty free and

whose relative prices declined significantly after 1929. Assuming demands to

be price inelastic, some of the fall in the value of imports of these

commodities should be attributed to the price decline. In contrast to the

other sources of bias, failure to make this adjustment leads the effects of

the tariff to be underestimated. Unfortunately, Hall's adjustments for
                                     —55—


composition effects were crude and ad hoc. He assumed an adjustment factor of

$25 million, raising the interim figure of $141 million to a final estimate of

$165 million. The implication is that Smoot Hawley's direct effect was to

lower U.S. imports by 3.8 per cent of their 1929 value. Hall concluded,

therefore, that only 8 percent of the decline in imports between 1929 and 1931

was attributable to Smoot—Hawley.

     A better approach to this problem would be to use data on trade volumes

and ad valorem tariff equivalents for individual commodities, and to adjust

for the fact that price elasticities of demand, percentage tariff increases,

and import price changes all differed by commodity type. Fortunately, there

exist, courtesy of the U.S. Tariff Commision and the Work Projects

Administration, detailed statistics on the value and volume of imports by

tariff schedule and class number, along with information on whether the duty

is specific or ad valorem and, f or the specific duties, ad valorem tariff

equivalents. For calendar year 1931 this information is provided for some

4,500 commodities in all.

     The intent of the W.P.A. project in the course of which these statistics

were assembled was to provide information on every article specified in the

1930 Tariff Act. The format of the Commerce Department's import statistics

was revised in 1934. The basis for coverage was changed from imports entered

whether for immediate consumption or for storage in bonded warehouses to

imports for consumption, i.e., entries for immediate consumption and

withdrawals from bonded warehouses for consumption. The W.P.A. project used

unpublished records for previous years kept in code by the Department of

Commerce to generate import statistics for 1929, 1931, 1932, 1933 and 1935

comparable with the published data for 1934. Ad valorem equivalents of

sensitivity implied by the differences between some of the lower- and

upper—bound estimates. Nonetheless, the compromise estimates suggest rather

different conclusions concerning the impact of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff on

imports of different groups of commodities and on different domestic producers

of import substitutes. Those differences are consistent with the

interpretation offered in Sections II and III above, insofar as those portions

of agriculture and traditional manufacturing which pressed hardest for the

tariff are the same ones which appear to benefitted the most, and the new 20th

century industries like metals and manufactures, machinery and vehicles, and

chemicals which opposed the tariff are also those which benefitted least from

the bill finally passed. Table 9 suggests that Smoot—I-Iawley was most

important in explaining the fall in imports of vegetable products. Whether or

not it was intended first and foremost as a protective measure for

agricultural producers, this was the group for whom changes in import

penetration were most heavily influenced by changes -in tariff rates as opposed

to other factors. It is interesting to note that the fate of domestic

producers of animal products was not so heavily conditioned by Smoot-Hawley.

For certain nonagriculturalists, including textile manufacturers and mineral

producers, Smoot-Hawley was important but it still only accounts for perhaps a

half of the observed decline in imports. Note that these are traditional

industries who, according to the interpretation advanced above, should have

reaped benefits from the tariff. For others, including such modern

manufacturing sectors as chemicals and vehicles, the effects of Smoot-Hawley

were negligible. Thus, the incidence of effects across sectors appears to

mirror the pressures those sectors brought to bear on the tariff-making

process.

IX. Conclusion


     As the quotation which opened this paper aptly put the point, economic

histories view the Great Depression and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff as

inextricably bound up with one another. They assign a central role to the

depression in explaining the passage of the 1930 Tariff Act and at the same

time emphasize the role of the tariff in the singular depth and long duration

of the slump. This paper has reexamined the historical evidence on both

points. It is not hard to identify relationships linking the tariff to the

depression and vice versa. But the evidence examined here suggests that

previous accounts have conveyed what is at best an incomplete and at worst a

misleading impression of the mechanisms at work.   It is clear that the

severity of the initial business cycle downturn lent additional impetus to the

campaign for protection. But it is equally clear that the impact of the

downturn on the movement for protection worked through different channels than

typically posited. Rather than simply strengthening the hand of a Republican

Executive predisposed toward protection, or increasing the burden borne by a

depressed agricultural sector which had long been agitating for tariff

protection, the uneven impact of the Depression occasioned the birth of a new

protectionist coalition comprised of producers particularly hard hit by import

competition: border agricultural and small-scale industry engaged in the

production of specialty goods. That coalition was able to obtain for its

members substantial increases in levels of tariff protection because of an

unusual conjuncture of distinct if related developments including reforms of

Congressional procedure, the rise of trade associations and the growth of

interventionist sentiment. The experience of Smoot-Haw'ley documents how
                                       -62-



macroeconomic distress accompanied by import penetration gives rise to

protectionist pressure, but succeeds in doing so only once the analysis

transcends the textbook model of monolithic agricultural and industrial

blocs.

     The importance of moving beyond a highly aggregated analysis is equally

evident when it comes to the economic effects of the 1930 Tariff Act. A

disaggregated analysis of the change in U.S. imports between 1929 and 1931

confirms that the direct effect of the tariff was only one factor contributing

to declining import volumes after 1929. No simple view -—   neither   that which

blames Smoot-Hawley exclusively for the decline in trade nor that which

dismisses it altogether --   adequately captures the relationship of the tariff
to American foreign trade. This analysis reveals also that the tariff's

contribution to the decline in imports differed dramatically across commodity

groups.

     If studying the political economy of the tariff leads one to conclude

that the Depression affected the movement for protection through different

channels than typically posited, so it is when one considers the impact of the

tariff on the Depression. Contrary to the presumption informing most analyses

of the subject, holding constant both the impact of Smoot-I-$awley on the rest

of the world and feedbacks to the United States, the direct effect of the

tariff on the U.S. economy is likely to have been expansionary. It remains

likely that the tariff was expansionary even when one admits the existence of

feedbacks. In fact, this remains possible and even plausible when the effects

of foreign retaliation are introduced. But whether or not one agrees with the
                                     -63-


particulars of the analysis, it is hard to dispute the point that the direct

macroeconomic effects of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, operating primarily through

the volume of trade, were small relative to the Great Depression. If

Smoot-Hawley had significant macroeconomic effects, these operated instead

through -its impact on the stability of the international monetary system and

the efficiency of the world capital market.

1.   It is strictly correct to refer to the tariff as "Hawley-Smoot," since
revenue bills originate in the House of Representaties. "Smoot-Hawley" is the
popular usage, which reflects Senator Smoot's prominance.

2.   See Pastor (1980) and the references cited therein.

3.   For example, Slichter (1932) refers to Smoot Hawley as "an act of almost
incredible economic folly" and as "a major influence in making the world
vulnerable to depression and intensifying the slump when it came." Bidwell
(1932) singles out tariffs as "among the active causes of our present
disaster." The views of modern macroeconomists are analyzed below.

of the scheme, the farmer would receive a debenture worth half the duty on the
commodity exported.

54. The price index is contructed from import unit values, from U.S. Department
of Commerce (1976), p. 893.

55. This conclusion is consistent with the relative unimportance of the
price-level effect in the cross-section analysis of Section VII.

56. See Watson (1930).

57. Metzler's statement that the U.S. balance of payments "shifted from
deficit" into surplus in 1930 is incorrect. The current account was in
larger surplus in 1929 than 1930, while the U.S. acquired rather than lost
gold over the course of 1929. What is true is that the accumulation of gold
was considerably larger in 1930.

58. There were statements at the time that uncertainty about tariff revision
was disruptive to business activity. See for example Business Week (1930a).

59. The gold standard money supply rules analyzed here are the same as in
Eichengreeri and Sachs (1985).

60. By differentiating with respect to Z rather than t, the reader can
demonstrate to his or her satisfaction that dt/dZ is negative. Thus, the
model is compatible with explanations for the Great Depression which find its
origins in shocks to spending. If lags in the adjustment of money demand and
a money supply shift parameter are introduced, it would be equally compatible
with the monetary explanation. This, however, is beyond the scope of the
present analysis.

78. The same debate over whether British measures were retaliatory raged in
the American press. See for example the discussion in Protectionist (1932).

79. Hall (1933), p. 405.

80. Because of the inclusion of relatively few items in Groups 00 and 7, and
even fewer which did not suffer from missing variables, the sampling factor
was adjusted to yield samples of 50 and 30 commodities, respectively.

81. Data for 1929 and 1931 are used because the W.P.A. statistics are
available by calendar year and because these are the two years immediately
before and after passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Bill. Hirschfeld and Hall
use 1930 and the 12 months ending September 1931, respectively, instead of
calendar year 1931 presumably in order to minimize the impact of other
factors, such as the deepening Depression, on the volume of imports. Since,
however, multiple regression is used here, the impact of such other factors is
picked up by additional regressors, including the constant term.

82. In 1932, they then rose by a factor of 6 before falling back to 1931
levels in 1933.

83. All regressions were also run excluding commodities on which import
duties were defined as specific rates. The results changed insignificantly,
indicating that the price—level effect (the interaction of falling prices with
duties fixed in nominal terms) had a statistically insignificant impact on the
import volumes in the samples examined here. This is entirely consistent with
the interpretation in Section III of the results of Table 5.
