We extend the model of Fullerton, Karney, and Baylis (2012 working paper) to explore cost-effectiveness
of unilateral climate policy in the presence of leakage. We ignore the welfare gain from reducing
greenhouse gas emissions and focus on the welfare cost of the emissions tax or permit scheme. Whereas
that prior paper solves for changes in emissions quantities and finds that leakage may be negative, we
show here that all cases with negative leakage in that model are cases where a unilateral carbon tax
results in a welfare loss. With positive leakage, however, a unilateral policy can improve welfare.

                    Leakage, Welfare, and Cost-Effectiveness of Carbon Policy
                       By Kathy Baylis, Don Fullerton, and Daniel H. Karney *

Policymakers fear that a unilateral carbon policy will reduce competitiveness, increase imports,
and lead to higher carbon emissions elsewhere (“leakage”). In Don Fullerton, Daniel H. Karney
and Kathy Baylis (2012), we show that it may actually reduce emissions in other sectors
(“negative leakage”). But reducing emissions in both sectors may merely reflect welfare costs of
carbon policy that reduce real income and thus reduce consumption of both outputs. These
possibilities capture the concern that unilateral carbon policy might have a high cost per global
unit of carbon abated (that is, low “cost-effectiveness”).
        Based on Harberger (1962), the two-input, two-output analytical general equilibrium
model of Fullerton et al (2012) could represent two countries or two sectors of a closed
economy. Each sector has some initial carbon tax or price, and the paper solves for the effect of
a small increase in one sector’s carbon tax on the quantity of emissions in each sector. But it
does not solve for welfare effects. Here, we use the same model but derive expressions for the
cost-effectiveness of a unilateral carbon tax – the welfare cost per ton of emission reduction. We
show that higher leakage does not always mean lower welfare. If one sector is already taxed at a
higher rate, then an increase in the other sector’s tax might reduce deadweight loss from pre-
existing misallocations. Thus, abatement can have negative cost. The welfare cost most directly
depends on the relative levels of tax in the two sectors. We show that negative leakage always
corresponds to a negative income effect, but negative income effects can also arise with positive
leakage. Conversely, positive leakage does not always mean positive welfare cost.
        Actual carbon policy is not likely to be applied uniformly across all countries and sectors.
The EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) only covers about 40 percent of emissions
(http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/index_en.htm).            In the U.S., the Waxman-Markey bill
proposed carbon policy primarily in the electricity sector. Metcalf and Weisbach (2009) estimate
that even a very broad carbon policy can only include 80 to 90 percent of emissions, so applied
carbon policy will likely leave some sectors uncovered. Raising one sector’s carbon tax may
have welfare costs if the other sector has no carbon tax, but on the other hand, that other sector

may face an indirect price of carbon through taxes on fossil fuels such as gasoline. Those fuels
may serve as substitutes for electricity, so a new carbon tax in the electricity sector may shift
consumption back somewhat from the low-taxed electricity sector into other fuels. In that case, a
new carbon tax just in the electricity sector may increase welfare despite positive leakage.
       This paper makes several contributions. First, we demonstrate the generality of the
Fullerton et al (2012) model by showing cases where leakage can exceed 100%. We solve for
conditions under which total emissions increase or decrease. We also solve for welfare effects,
and for “cost effectiveness” (the additional welfare cost per ton of net abatement). And we
explore the relationship between the sign of leakage and the sign of the effect on welfare.
       In addition, we decompose the change in deadweight loss into two components. First, the
unilateral increase in carbon tax worsens a production distortion, as that sector substitutes from
carbon to other inputs (such as labor or capital for abatement). Second, it affects a consumption
distortion, the existing misallocation between the two outputs. Depending on the other sector’s
pre-existing carbon tax rate and carbon intensity, this consumption distortion may rise or fall.
       Our prior paper shows that negative leakage occurs when the elasticity of substitution in
utility is small and the elasticity of substitution in production is large. Here, we show that these
are the same conditions that lead to higher deadweight loss from an increased carbon tax in one
sector: a low elasticity in utility means that any reduction in the consumption distortion is
relatively small, while any increase in the production distortion is relatively large. However,
positive leakage may be associated either with welfare gains or losses. The intuition is that
welfare cost most directly relates to the relative levels of tax in the two sectors, rather than to the
relative changes in emissions. That is, a high cost per ton of carbon abatement can be associated
with either negative or positive leakage. All proofs and derivations are in the Appendix.

                              I. The Change in Carbon Emissions

Using the model of Fullerton et al (2012), we demonstrate here the conditions under which an
increase in one sector’s carbon price may increase total emissions, and the conditions under
which it is certain to decrease total emissions. The two competitive sectors have constant returns
to scale production, X = X ( K X , C X ) and Y = Y ( K Y , CY ) , where a clean input Ki and carbon
emissions Ci have decreasing marginal products (i = X, Y). The clean input can be labor,
                                                              (               )
capital, or a composite of the two, with fixed total supply K = K X + K Y . That input is mobile
and earns the same factor price pK in both sectors. Sector i can use any positive amount of Ci,
given price τi (which can be a tax rate or permit price). Either sector might initially have the
                                                         -3-

higher carbon price. Reducing total carbon emissions C ≡ C X + CY can have separable benefits
in homothetic utility, U(X, Y; C), but we focus only on the cost of the policy. Permit or tax
revenue is R ≡ τ X C X + τ Y CY , rebated in a lump sum. Many identical consumers use income

p K K + R to maximize utility by their choice of X and Y (facing prices pX, pY, and pK).
        The simple version of this model assumes the supply of fossil fuel is perfectly elastic. It
does not model traded oil in limited supply, so it misses the positive leakage caused when a
carbon tax reduces one sector’s demand, thereby reducing the price of oil and increasing use
elsewhere. Instead, think of τ Y applying to coal-fired power plants where coal is not scarce.
The model does have positive leakage from the terms of trade effect (TTE) and negative leakage
from the abatement resource effect (ARE). The goal in Fullerton et al (2012) is not to measure
leakage but to demonstrate the ARE in a simple model that abstracts from other issues. That
paper lists citations to discussion of these other issues.
        The model is used to derive effects of a small increase in τY, with no change in τX, where
firms in sector Y can substitute away from carbon by additional use of abatement capital (KY)
such as natural gas plants, wind turbines, or solar power. The model ignores any transition but
instead compares initial allocations to those in a new long run equilibrium.
        Given this set-up, Fullerton et al (2012) differentiate all equations above to derive a set of

n linear equations with n unknowns, using a hat for each proportional change (e.g. Xˆ ≡ dX X ).

They differentiate production to get Yˆ = θYK Kˆ Y + θYC Cˆ Y , where θ ij is a factor share [e.g. θYK =

(pKKY)/(pYY)]. Define σY as the elasticity of substitution in Y, to get Cˆ Y − Kˆ Y = σ Y ( pˆ K − τˆY ).

The definition of σU implies Xˆ − Yˆ = σ U ( pˆ Y − pˆ X ) . Then, given a small exogenous increase in

one carbon tax ( τˆY > 0), the system of linear equations is solved for the general equilibrium
impact on each price and quantity as a function of parameters.
        For sector Y, the increase in tax always raises the equilibrium price ( pˆ Y = θYCτˆY > 0 )

and reduces the equilibrium quantity ( Yˆ = −[α X σ U + α Y σ Y ]θYCτˆY < 0 , where α i = K i K ). The

tax unequivocally reduces that sector’s carbon emissions ( ĈY < 0). To calculate the total effect
on carbon, we need to know the amount of leakage. As derived in our prior paper:
                                                                   

The first term in equation (1) is the terms-of-trade effect (TTE), where the higher price of Y
induces households to substitute into X (by an amount that depends on σU). This effect by itself
increases production of X and emissions CX. This positive leakage term is offset by a negative
second term, the abatement resource effect (ARE), where the higher price of carbon induces
firms to substitute into KY (by an amount that depends on σY). If sector Y increases its use of
capital, then sector X must reduce its use of capital, its output, and its emissions. (The price of
carbon in sector X does not change relative to the cost of other inputs, so those firms do not
change their ratio of inputs; less capital in X therefore means less emissions and less output.)
       Theorem 1 (Fullerton et al 2012): Net leakage is negative when σY > σU. Equation (1)
provides this result. When consumer substitution is low, they want to buy almost as much of the
taxed output Y after the tax increase (such as with inelastic electricity demand). Producer
substitution is high, so firms reduce carbon and use more capital, drawing capital from X.
       From here, we develop several new theorems to characterize the conditions for total
carbon emissions to fall. All proofs and derivations are in the Appendix.
       Theorem 2: Net negative leakage in this model implies that total carbon falls. An
increased carbon tax in sector Y clearly cuts the emissions of that sector. If the increase in τY
also reduces emissions of sector X, then total carbon emissions definitely fall.
       Theorem 3: If sector Y is carbon intensive (CY/KY > CX/KX), then total carbon falls.
Intuitively, increasing the carbon tax in the sector that uses carbon intensively creates a large
decrease in emissions that overcomes any possible positive leakage. Importantly, these two
theorems only provide sufficient conditions for a decrease in total carbon, as other parameter
combinations may also lead to reductions of total carbon emissions.
       Next, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions for an increase in total carbon
emissions. For total emissions to rise, carbon leakage must be positive and large enough to
exceed the reduction in CY. Thus, substitution in utility must be larger than substitution in sector
Y production (σU >σY), and sector X must be more carbon-intensive than sector Y (that is,
αY > βY , where α Y ≡ KY / K and βY ≡ CY / C ).

       Theorem 4: A necessary and sufficient condition for total carbon to increase ( Cˆ > 0 ) is
(σ U / σ Y ) > (α YθYC + βYθYK ) /[(α Y − βY )θYC ] > 1 . An increase in total carbon requires not only that

leakage is positive (σU >σY). It also requires the denominator in the middle term to be positive,
which means that Y must be relatively capital-intensive, while X is carbon intensive. Intuitively,
increasing the carbon tax in a capital-intensive sector has little direct effect on carbon, while it
                                                    -5-

does raise the relative price of Y.     If σU is sufficiently high, consumers switch consumption
from Y to X. Since the direct effect on CY is small, and substitution in consumption is large,
carbon leakage can more than offset the direct reduction in emissions of the taxed sector.

                                II. The Change in Deadweight Loss

In Fullerton et al (2012), both sectors have non-zero pre-existing carbon tax rates. Here, we
show that these taxes cause deadweight loss (DWL) via two channels. The first is a production
distortion, since firms use too little carbon. Second, differential carbon tax rates change relative
output prices and create a consumption distortion. We assume that environmental damages from
carbon are separable in utility, so that we can focus on the loss in utility from consumption (the
cost of abatement). We consider utility of our one worldwide consumer, not separate nations.
       To quantify the change in deadweight loss (ΔDWL), we totally differentiate utility and
follow the steps in our Appendix. Intuitively, the policy’s utility cost is the difference in the
bundle of X and Y that can be consumed before and after the tax change, where those changes in
outputs can be written as changes in inputs. Then we can re-write ΔDWL as:
(2)       − dU / λ = ∆DWL = −(τ X C X Cˆ X + τ Y CY CˆY ) ≷ 0
where λ is the marginal utility of income, so dU/λ is the monetary value of the change in utility.
Thus, the sign of the change in deadweight loss is a function not only of the pre-existing tax rates
but the sectors’ relative carbon use. Furthermore, we can decompose the welfare loss into the
consumption distortion and the production distortion:
(3)     ∆DWL = R{σ U [α X − δ X ]θYC + σ Y [α YθYC + δ YθYK ]}τˆY
where R is total tax revenue, δ X ≡ τ X C X R , and δ Y ≡ τ Y CY R . Inside the curly brackets, the
consumption distortion is the term that depends on σU, while the production distortion is the term
that depends on σY. An increase in τY always worsens the production distortion in that sector (as
firms switch from CY to KY). Also, the magnitude of this welfare effect increases with the
initial tax rate τY [through R in equation (3)]. Finally, ΔDWL is zero when σU = σY = 0, because
then τY is essentially a lump-sum tax (with a lump-sum revenue rebate).
       Theorem 5: If sector Y has a higher carbon-weighted tax rate than sector X, then an
increase in τY raises deadweight loss. That is, τ Y (CY KY ) > τ X (C X K X ) implies ΔDWL > 0.
When the carbon-weighted tax rate in sector Y exceeds that in sector X, the further increase in τY
has welfare cost. The ΔDWL is positive because an increase τ Y moves the weighted tax rates
                                                   -6-

farther apart and thus increases distortions. Equation (2) also implies that if both sectors reduce
use of carbon, the deadweight loss of the tax increase must be positive. In other words:
       Theorem 6: Negative leakage means a positive change in deadweight loss. That is,

Cˆ X < 0 implies ΔDWL>0. The increase in τY always shrinks Y. If it also shrinks X, then utility
of consumption must fall. The converse does not hold, however: ΔDWL>0 does not imply
negative leakage. The reason is that ΔDWL also depends on initial tax rates. We next explore
whether and when an increase in one sector’s carbon tax leads to a decrease in deadweight loss.
       For an increase in τY to provide a welfare gain (ΔDWL < 0), Theorem 6 says that leakage
must be positive (so we need σU > σY). Further, in equation (3), the loss from the production
distortion (the term in σY) must be offset by a gain from reduced consumption distortion (the
term in σU). That requires α X < δ X (the share of carbon in sector X is smaller than the share of
carbon revenue from X). From these two conditions and equation (3) above, we have:
       Theorem 7: The ΔDWL<0 if and only if [α YθYC + δ YθYK ]/[(δ X − α X )θYC ] > σ U / σ Y > 1 .

Note that this condition requires σ U > σ Y and α X < δ X . It looks similar to the condition for an
increase in carbon (Theorem 4), except that the big ratio here must exceed the ratio of
elasticities, and δi (shares of revenue) replace βi (shares of carbon). The intuition is similar to
that of Theorem 5: for DWL to fall, the carbon-weighted carbon tax in sector X must be larger
than the carbon-weighted tax Y, so that an increase in τY reduces the consumption distortion.
       In summary, an increase in one sector’s carbon tax can have negative marginal abatement
cost, if it reduces deadweight loss by raising the low carbon tax rate. Next, we use ΔDWL and
the quantity of carbon reduction to calculate of the cost-effectiveness of the policy.

                                      III. Cost-Effectiveness

We measure the cost-effectiveness of a policy change as the “marginal cost of abatement”
(MCA), the dollar value of the change utility divided by the change in carbon emissions:

                 dU / λ  α Y (σ U − σ Y )θYC − δ Y (σ UθYC + σ YθYK )  R 
(4)     MCA =          =                                               .
                  dC    α Y (σ U − σ Y )θYC − βY (σ UθYC + σ YθYK )  C 
The fraction R C is the average tax paid by firms per unit of carbon emissions at the initial tax
rates; this ratio is always positive. The scalar in square brackets contains just elasticity and share
parameters; it reflects the distortions in production and consumption. As demonstrated above,
the sign of the numerator is ambiguous (ΔDWL ≷ 0), as is the sign of the denominator (dC ≷ 0).
In fact, raising one tax rate may have welfare gain or loss even as dC approaches zero in the
                                                      -7-

denominator, so the MCA approaches positive or negative infinity. In the “normal” case, the
increase in carbon tax reduces carbon emissions, so the denominator is negative and we have:
       Theorem 8: If dC<0, then τY < τX implies the scalar in (4) is less than one (the MCA is
less than the average cost, R/C). In the normal case, a relatively low τY can be increased with
little welfare cost. Conversely, increasing a relatively high τY means MCA larger than the
average cost. To further explore this intuition, we consider two special cases.
                                         A. Special case where τX = τY
Assume both sectors have the same initial tax rate, τX = τY = τC > 0. Then the share of revenue
from sector Y matches its share of carbon emissions (δY = βY), and from equation (4) we have
MCA = R/C = τC. That is, all firms in both sectors abate until the MCA equals the tax rate,
common to all those firms, so the equi-marginal principle guarantees efficient allocation of
abatement. Moreover, a higher initial tax rate means higher marginal cost of abatement.
                                       B. Special case with no leakage

Assume σU = σY, so Ĉ X = 0 from equation (1). The MCA can be written as the change in utility

[–ΔDWL from equation (2)] over dC = C X Cˆ X + CY CˆY . Rearrangement yields MCA = τY. Since
leakage is zero, and input prices in sector X remains constant, all consumption changes are
reductions in Y. Thus, the dollar-equivalent utility cost is the carbon tax rate in Y.

                         IV. The Relationship between Leakage and Welfare

We now explore the relationship between leakage and welfare effects of unilateral climate
policy, using a numerical example and figure to help with intuition. When does the sign of the
welfare effect match the sign of leakage? Two key parameters for both outcomes are σY and σU,
so Figure 1 shows the elasticity of substitution in production (σY) on the horizontal axis and the
elasticity of substitution in utility (σU) on the vertical axis. We know that leakage is zero when
these two parameters equal each other, so the 45° line shows the boundary between cases where
leakage is positive (σU > σY) or negative (σU < σY).
       To get the boundary for the sign of the welfare effect, we set ΔDWL to zero in equation
(3) above, and solve for σU in terms of σY (see the Appendix):
                              δY          
(5)     σ U = σ Y 1 +                      .
                        (α Y − δ Y )θ YC 
Thus, the ΔDWL= 0 line always goes through the origin. Also, Theorem 6 says that negative
leakage implies positive ΔDWL. Therefore the ΔDWL=0 line must have a slope greater than one.
                                                -8-

We then plot ΔDWL=0 lines for two different values of τX/τY. When the initial τX is high relative
to τY, the policy to raise τY is more likely to improve efficiency.


  Figure: 1: The Sign of Leakage and the Sign of ΔDWL (CX/KX = 1.00 and CY/KY = 0.25)




       Since δ Y ≡ τ Y CY R , the slope of the ΔDWL=0 line is also determined partly by relative
carbon intensity. If sector Y were carbon intensive, then τX must always exceed τY for the
increase in τY to reduce deadweight loss. But if X is carbon intensive as in Figure 1, then raising
τY can improve welfare even when the initial τX< τY. The solid line indicates ΔDWL=0 when the
initial τX/τY is only 0.5, so the area above that line shows combinations of σU and σY where
raising τY has negative cost. When τX /τY is 2.0, the dotted line shows an even wider area where
raising τY has negative cost. A larger initial τX /τY means larger initial consumption distortion,
which can be improved by raising τY. The implication, as shown in the figure, is that the change
in deadweight loss can be either sign when leakage is positive.

                                         V. Conclusions

For unilateral climate policy, this paper uses a simple two-sector, two-input general equilibrium
model to explore how leakage is related to welfare changes from consumption and the cost per
ton of abatement (cost effectiveness). Even with this simple model, Fullerton et al (2012) find
that leakage can be negative. Here, we find that positive leakage can more than offset the direct
abatement achieved by the tax. We also explore the effect of the tax change on deadweight loss
(the cost of abatement). As it turns out, the conditions that give rise to negative leakage always
result in welfare costs. Yet positive leakage can be associated either with gains or losses.
                                                  -9-

       In addition, we show that a policy without leakage is not necessarily more cost efficient
than a policy with leakage. One sector’s tax increase can reduce a consumption distortion by
more than it increases the production distortion, if the initial carbon tax in the other sector is
relatively high. A higher elasticity of substitution in consumption increases this welfare gain, but
it also increases leakage. In other words, when the tax increase cuts the gap between the two tax
rates, the conditions that give rise to a welfare gain also give rise to leakage.
       These results have important policy implications for two reasons. First, carbon policy
proposals can cover only a fraction of emissions. Even if the same tax could apply to electricity
and other sectors, it could not apply to all emissions (e.g. homeowners can cut their own
firewood for heat, which is difficult to monitor). Second, most sectors already face an implicit
price on carbon. For example, the EU-ETS covers only “major industries” such as electricity,
cement, and some manufacturing (only 40 percent of emissions). Yet other sectors also face a
price of carbon (such as gasoline taxes in the transportation sector or BTU taxes on home heating
fuel). Even if an explicit carbon tax is imposed only in one sector, with positive leakage, it may
still raise welfare by reducing the consumption distortion from high fuel taxes in other sectors.

       Proof of Theorem 1: See Fullerton et al (2012).
       Proof of Theorem 2: Totally differentiate C = CX + CY to get dC = dC X + dCY , and then
multiply and divide through by appropriate terms, using the hat notation:
        Cˆ = β X Cˆ X + β Y Cˆ Y

where β Y = CY C          and 1 = β X + βY . Recall that τˆY > 0 implies Cˆ Y < 0 always, and thus

                     (         )
negative leakage Cˆ X < 0 clearly leads to a fall in total carbon emissions. ■

        Proof of Theorem 3: Using Cˆ = β X Cˆ X + β Y Cˆ Y , insert solutions of Fullerton et al (2012):

        Cˆ = β X [α Y (σ U − σ Y )θ YC ]τˆY + β Y [− (α X σ U + α Y σ Y )θ YC − θ YK σ Y ]τˆY
and simplify to yield:

        Cˆ = {σ U (α Y − β Y )θ YC − σ Y (α Y θ YC + β Y θ YK )}τˆY .

By inspection, α Y < β Y is a sufficient condition for Cˆ < 0 . However, the condition α Y < β Y

implies both (CY K Y ) > (C K ) and (C K ) > (C X K X ) . ■

        Proof of Theorem 4: We know Cˆ = {σ U (α Y − β Y )θ YC − σ Y (α Y θ YC + β Y θ YK )}τˆY . For total
carbon emissions to increase, it follows that:

        Cˆ = {σ U (α Y − β Y )θ YC − σ Y (α Y θ YC + β Y θ YK )}τˆY > 0
             σ U (α Y θ YC + β Y θ YK )
        ⇔       >                       .
             σY    (αY − β Y )θYC
From the proof of Theorem 3, we know that Cˆ > 0 requires α Y > βY , and so the denominator of
that last expression is positive. But the positive numerator necessarily exceeds the positive
                                σ U (α Y θ YC + β Y θ YK )
denominator, so we have            >                       > 1. ■

        Derivation of Equation 2: Totally differentiate the utility function to yield:
        dU = U X dX + U Y dY + U C dC
Next, substitute in the first-order conditions from the utility maximization problem:
        dU = λp X dX + λpY dY + U C dC

where λ is the multiplier on the budget constraint. Divide through by λ , so the left-hand side
is the dollar value of the change in utility:
        dU                            UC
              = p X dX + pY dY +            dC
         λ                             λ
Continue by substituting in the totally differentiated production functions for X and Y, and the
totally differentiated definition of total carbon:
        dU                                                                    UC
              = p X ( X K dK X + X C dC X ) + pY (YK dK Y + YC dCY ) +              (dC X   + dCY )
         λ                                                                      λ
where X K is the marginal product of X (KX,CX) with respect to KX. Other terms are similarly
defined. Next, use first-order conditions from profit maximization (e.g. pK=pXXK):
                                                              -11-

        dU                                                           UC
              = p K dK X + τ X dC X + p K dKY + τ Y dCY +                 (dC X   + dCY )
         λ                                                           λ
Recall that dK X = −dK Y , so:
        dU                                UC
              = τ X dC X + τ Y dCY +              (dC X   + dCY )
         λ                                    λ
Define µ C ≡ − U C λ as the marginal environmental damage from carbon, and rearrange terms:

        dU
              = (τ X − µC )dC X + (τ Y − µC )dCY
         λ
Multiply and divide though by C X and CY , respectively:
        dU
              = (τ X − µC )C X Cˆ X + (τ Y − µC )CY Cˆ Y
         λ
In the first term, any increase in CX reduces welfare if the existing τX is not high enough to
correct for carbon damages μC (and similarly for CY). However, our measure of the policy’s cost
ignores benefits from reduced carbon damages, and so we delete the μC parameter:
        dU
              = τ X C X Cˆ X + τ Y CY CˆY .
         λ
Finally, multiply by –1, which converts a negative gain to a positive change in deadweight loss.
                                                                          (                  )
        Derivation of Equation 3: From ΔDWL = − τ X C X Cˆ X + τ Y CY CˆY , insert solutions for

Ĉ X and ĈY :

        ∆DWL = −(τ X C X [α Y (σ U − σ Y )θ YC ]τˆY + τ Y CY [− (α X σ U + α Y σ Y )θ YC − θ YK σ Y ]τˆY )

Note that δ i ≡ τ i Ci R . We can replace τ i Ci = δ i R , where R is total tax revenue:

        ∆DWL = − R{δ X [α Y (σ U − σ Y )θ YC ] − δ Y [(α X σ U + α Y σ Y )θ YC + θ YK σ Y ]}τˆY

Rearranging to collect the terms σU and σY we obtain
        ∆DWL = R{σ U [α X − δ X ]θ YC + σ Y [α Y θ YC + δ Y θ YK ]}τˆY .

        Proof of Theorem 5:                   From ∆DWL = R{σ U [α X − δ X ]θYC + σ Y [αYθYC + δ YθYK ]}τˆY , by

inspection, α X > δ X is a sufficient condition for ΔDWL>0. However, the condition α X > δ X

necessarily means both (τ Y CY K Y ) > (R K ) and (R K ) > (τ X C X K X ) ). ■

                                                              (                      )
        Proof of Theorem 6: Use ∆DWL = − τ X C X Cˆ X + τ Y CY CˆY and Cˆ Y < 0 . Thus, negative

          (         )
leakage Cˆ X < 0 clearly leads to an increase in deadweight loss. ■
        Proof of Theorem 7: From equation (3), a reduction in deadweight loss requires:
                                                           -12-

        ∆DWL = R{σ U [α X − δ X ]θYC + σ Y [α YθYC + δ YθYK ]}τˆY < 0

        ⇔
            σU    [α θ + δYθYK ] , where the latter term equals [αYθYC + δYθYK ].
               < − Y YC

Also, Theorem 6 says that negative leakage always means a positive change in deadweight loss.
Thus, ΔDWL<0 requires that leakage be positive (σU >σY). Accordingly, σU/σY exceeds one, and:
                σ U [α Y θ YC + δ Y θ YK ]
        ⇔1<        <                       .■
                σY    [δ X − α X ]θ YC
       Derivation of Equation 4: We construct the MCA by dividing -ΔDWL by the totally
differentiated change in total carbon emissions to yield:

                  (dU λ ) = τ X C X Cˆ X + τ Y CY Cˆ Y .
       MCA =
                    dC            C X Cˆ X + CY Cˆ Y

Next, substitute to closed-form expressions for the baseline Ĉ X and ĈY :

        (dU λ ) = τ X C X [α Y (σ U − σ Y )θ YCτˆY ] − τ Y CY [(α X (σ U − σ Y )θ YC + σ Y )τˆY ]
          dC          C X [α Y (σ U − σ Y )θ YCτˆY ] − CY [(α X (σ U − σ Y )θ YC + σ Y )τˆY ]
and simplify:
        (dU λ ) = θ YC (σ U − σ Y )[α Y τ X C X − α X τ Y CY ] − σ Y τ Y CY   .
          dC           θ YC (σ U − σ Y )[α Y C X − α X CY ] − σ Y CY
noting that τˆY cancels from numerator and denominator. Continuing, define δ X ≡ τ X C X R

and δ Y ≡ τ Y CY R , where δ X + δ Y = 1 and R is the total tax revenue; that is, δ X is the share of
tax revenue collected from sector X.              Similarly, define the carbon share in sector      X   as
β X ≡ C X C and define β Y analogously. Rewrite the MCA in terms delta- and beta-shares:
        (dU λ ) = θ YC (σ U − σ Y )[α Y δ X − α X δ Y ]R − σ Y δ Y R .
          dC      θ YC (σ U − σ Y )[α Y β X − α X β Y ]C − σ Y β Y C
Finally, factor (R/C) and simplify the term in square brackets to yield equation (4) in the text.
       Proof of Theorem 8: To start, observe τ X > τ Y if and only if βY > δ Y and δ X > β X .
In that case, the theorem to be proven says that:
                  τ X C X Cˆ X + τ Y CY CˆY R
       MCA =                               < .

The denominator is negative by assumption, so we need to show:

                    (δ X − β X ) Y
Insert solutions for Ĉ X and ĈY , and we still need to show that Cˆ X > Cˆ Y :

        [σ U αY θYC − σ Y αY θYC ]τˆY > [− (α X σ U + αY σ Y )θYC − θYK σ Y ]τˆY
        ⇔ αY σ U θYC + α X σ U θYC > −θYK σ Y

        ⇔ θYCσ U > −θYK σ Y .

Thus, it is always true that Cˆ X > Cˆ Y . ■
