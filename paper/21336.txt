                                              ABSTRACT

We present a signalling theory of Quantitative Easing (QE) at the zero lower bound on the short term
nominal interest rate. QE is effective because it generates a credible signal of low future real interest
rates in a time consistent equilibrium. We show these results in two models. One has coordinated monetary
and fiscal policy. The other an independent central bank with balance sheet concerns. Numerical experiments
show that the signalling effect can be substantial in both models.

        “The problem with Quantitative Easing (QE) is it works in practice, but it doesn’t work in
theory,” Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jan 16, 2014 just before leaving o¢ ce.


1        Introduction
Since the onset of the economics crisis in 2008, the Federal Reserve has expanded its balance sheet
by large amounts, on the order of 3 trillion mostly under the rubric of Quantitative Easing (QE).
To date the accumulated amount of QE corresponds to about 20% percent of annual GDP. The
enormous scale of this policy has largely been explained by the fact that the Federal Reserve was
unable to cut the Federal Fund rate further, due the zero lower bound on the short term nominal
interest rate. Meanwhile, high unemployment, slow growth, and low in‡ation desperately called
for further stimulus measures.
        Many commentators argue that QE in the United States prevented a much stronger contraction,
and that QE is a key reason for why the US has recovered more rapidly from the Great Recession
than some its counterparts. As pointed out by Ben Bernanke, however, one problem is that even
if this might be true in practice, a coherent theoretical rationale has been hard to formulate. This
paper contributes to …lling this gap. We providing an explicit theoretical underpinning for QE:
It works because it allows the central bank to credibly commit to expansionary future policy in a
zero lower bound situation. We not only explicitly account for QE in theory, but also show some
numerical examples in which the e¤ect is non-trivial.
        What is QE? Under our interpretation, it is when the central bank buys long-term government
debt with money. We interpret this action though the lenses of two models. First, we treat the
central bank and the treasury as one agent, i.e. policy is coordinated and budget constraints of the
Treasury and the central bank are consolidated. Second, we treat the central bank as “independent”
in the sense that it faces its own budget constraint (and thus cares about it own balance sheet)
and its objective may be di¤erent from social welfare.
        Consider …rst QE under coordinated monetary and …scal policy, the main benchmark in the
paper.1 Since the nominal interest rate was zero when QE was implemented in the United States,
it makes no di¤erence if QE was done by printing money (or more precisely bank reserves) or by
issuing short-term government debt: both are government issued papers that yield a zero interest
rate. From the perspective of the government as a whole, QE at zero nominal interest rates can then
simply be thought of as shortening the maturity of outstanding government debt. The government
is simply exchanging long term bonds in the hands of the public with short term ones.
        Consider next QE from the perspective of the central bank in isolation. QE creates a “duration
mismatch” on the balance sheet of the central bank as it is issuing money/reserves (“short-term
debt”) in exchange for long term treasuries (“long term assets”). This opens up the possibility of
possible future balance sheet losses/gains by the central bank, because the price of its liabilities
    1
   Here we will be abstracting from variation in real government spending, a focus of Christiano, Eichenbaum and
Rebelo (2011), Eggertsson (2010), Woodford (2011) and Werning (2012).

may fall/rise relative to its assets. We can interpret QE as simply increasing the size of the balance
sheet of the central bank, keeping the extent of the duration mismatch on its balance sheet …xed.
Alternatively we can interpret it as only increasing the duration on its asset side, keeping the
liability side and size of the balance sheet unchanged. Either interpretation is valid, and we will
look at the data to sort out which interpretation …ts the facts better for a particular QE episode.
       Whether we consider QE from the perspective of a consolidated government budget constraint,
or an independent central bank, we arrive at the same conclusion. In both settings, QE operates
as a “signal” for lower future short term interest rates in a way we make precise.
       The main goal of QE in the United States was to reduce long-term interest rates, even when the
short-term nominal interest rate could not be reduced further, and thereby, stimulate the economy.
Indeed, several empirical studies …nd evidence of reduction in long-term interest rates following
these policy interventions by the Federal Reserve (see e.g. Gagnon et al (2011), Krishnamurthy
and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011), Hamilton and Wu (2012), Swanson and Williams (2013) and Bauer
and Rudebusch (2013)).2
       From a theoretical perspective however, the e¤ect of such policy is not obvious since open market
operations of this kind are neutral (or irrelevant) in standard macroeconomic models holding the
future interest rate reaction function constant. This may have motivated Ben Bernanke’s quote
cited above. This was pointed out …rst in a well-known contribution by Wallace (1981) and further
extended by Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) to a model with sticky prices and an explicit zero
lower bound on nominal interest rates. These papers showed how absent some restrictions in asset
trade that prevent arbitrage, a change in the relative supplies of various assets in the hands of the
private sector has no e¤ect on equilibrium quantities and asset prices.
       For this reason, some papers have recently incorporated frictions such as participation con-
straints due to “preferred habitat” motives in order to make assets of di¤erent maturities im-
perfect substitutes. This in turn negates the neutrality of open market operations as in such an
environment, QE can reduce long-term interest rates because it decreases the risk-premium, see
for example Chen, Curdia, and Ferrero (2012). Others, such as Gertler and Karadi (2012), provide
a framework in which these operations can have an e¤ect due to limits to arbitrage.3 Overall,
our reading of this literature is that the e¤ect of QE is modest in these models, with the possible
exception of QE1 when there were signi…cant disruptions in the …nancial markets.
       As pointed out by Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) (and further illustrated in Woodford (2012)
in the context of the crisis) QE need not be e¤ective only because it reduces risk premiums or due
to limits on arbitrage. QE can also reduce long-term interest rates if it signals to the private
   2
     For example, Gagnon et al (2011) estimate that the $1:75 trillion worth 2009 program reduced long-term interest
rates by 58 basis points while Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) estimate that the $600 billion worth 2010
program reduced long-term interest rates by 33 basis points. In addition, Hamilton and Wu (2012), Swanson and
Williams (2013), and Bauer and Rudebusch (2013) also …nd similar e¤ects on long-term interest rates. Note however
that empirical studies typically measure nominal interest rates, while theoretically, it is the ability to in‡uence real
interest rates that matter.
   3
     Del Negro et al (2012) is another example which focuses more on QE1 which has an e¤ect in their model due to
imperfect liquidity of private paper. That work, however, is less suitable to think about QE2 and QE3.



                                                           3
sector that the central bank will keep the short-term interest rates low once the zero lower bound
is no longer a constraint, i.e. signals a change in the policy rule taken as given in Eggertsson
and Woodford’s (2003) irrelevant result. In fact, arguably, much of the …ndings of the empirical
literature on reduction of long-term interest rates due to QE can be attributed to expectations
of low future short-term interest rates. Indeed, Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) and
Bauer and Rudebusch (2013) …nd evidence in support of this channel in their study of the various
QE programs.
   Our contribution in this paper is to provide a formal theoretical model of such a “signalling”role
of QE in a standard general equilibrium model. To do this we analyze a Markov Perfect Equilibrium
(MPE) in a game between the government and the private sector. In this equilibrium, agents will
use the “natural” state variables of the game to predict the behavior of future governments. QE
will have an e¤ect because it changes the endogenous state variables of the game. In this respect
our model of signaling is di¤erent from models in a related literature on signalling in which central
bank types are …xed (they can either be “doves” or “hawks”, see e.g. Barro (1986)). In these
models, central banks use nominal interest rates to signal how much they care about in‡ation.
Our signalling mechanism is di¤erent from this literature, because the central bank’s “type” or
preference for in‡ation is derived endogenously and depends upon the size and composition of the
asset holdings of the central bank (moreover, there is full information about the preferences of the
government). Thus our interpretation of “signalling” is somewhat di¤erent, namely, it has to do
with credibly changing the central banks’ future policy incentives, or “types” in the language of
this earlier literature.
   The paper connects more closely to the theoretical literature on how the maturity structure of
debt can be manipulated to eliminate the dynamic inconsistency problems in monetary models.
Well known examples include Lucas and Stokey (1983), Persson, Persson, and Svensson (1987 and
2006), Calvo and Guidotti (1990 and 1992) and Alvarez, Kehoe, and Neumeyer (2004). While the
focus of these papers is generally on policies that eliminates the government’s incentive to in‡ate,
our application is the opposite. In our setting, the maturity structure of debt is made shorter to
solve the de‡ation bias (Eggertsson (2006)) that arises when the zero bound is binding. In terms
of modelling strategy, a key di¤erence relative to this work is that because we assume sticky prices,
the government has an e¤ect not only on in‡ation, but also on the real interest rate which gives
rise to a new margin for policy that will prove to be important. Finally, the part of our paper with
an independent central bank that has balance sheet concerns is related to Jeanne and Svensson
(2007) and Berriel and Bhattarai (2009). The key di¤erence is that this work focuses on the e¤ects
of foreign exchange intervention and does not have long-term assets, while we analyze the size and
maturity composition of central bank balance sheet in order to connect to QE.
   Below we outline the organization of the paper and preview some of the key …ndings. We
start out by de…ning a Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE) in the standard New Keynesian model
(Section 2). The key di¤erence relative to standard treatments is that we allow for long-term
government debt. An important simpli…cation is that we assume that the long-term debt is of


                                                 4
some …xed duration and we will interpret QE as a one-time reduction in this duration. We defer
to Section 5 to de…ne the MPE with time varying and optimally chosen duration of government
debt.
       We …rst de…ne the equilibrium in the fully non-linear model, assuming that monetary and
…scal policy are coordinated. In this case a natural objective for the government is utility function
of the representative agent. We then (Section 3) show how the model can be approximated via
log-linearization of the constraints and quadratic approximation of social welfare. This is helpful
because it simpli…es the model considerably and allows for a more transparent discussion of the
main results. A key proposition (Proposition 1) shows that the MPE of this approximate economy is
equivalent to a …rst order approximation of the MPE of the non-linear model. This is an important
step, because linear-quadratic approximation are in general not valid for this class of problems.4
       An important element of Section 3 is that we de…ne the MPE not only in the context of
coordinated monetary and …scal policy but also if the central bank has its own objective and
budget constraint. One conclusion that emerges from Section 3 is that which model one adopts has
critical e¤ects on how one interprets the data. If we think of the government as a uni…ed entity then
what is important is the term structure of the government debt held in the hands of the private
sector. In contrast, for an independent central bank, what is important is the size and duration of
the central banks assets and liabilities on its balance sheet. We use the model to organize the data
under both approaches. The main …ndings of the data section will then serve as the basis of the
numerical experiments in Section 4.
       The baseline New Keynesian model is perhaps too simple for us to take numerical simulations
literally as point estimates of the e¤ect of QE. Nevertheless, we think it is useful to explicitly
parameterize the model to organize the key results and get some sense for the orders of magnitudes.
This is what we do in Section 4. To parameterize the model we ask it to replicate …ve targets,
which we formalize by choosing parameters to minimize the mean squared errors of the model
variables relative to the targets. We construct the targets as follows. First, we want the model
to generate a substantial recession. To do so, we ask the model to generate a recession at zero
interest rate due to drop in the e¢ cient rate of interest as in Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).
More speci…cally, we ask the model to generate a fall in in‡ation of 2 percent, an output gap of -10
percent, and an expected duration of liquidity trap of 3 years. We then use the numbers about the
size of QE we construct in Section 3 and ask the model to generate a response to this policy on
future in‡ation and long-term yields estimated by Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011).
The approach is then to ask the parameterized model the following question: Given that we match
these …ve targets as best as we can, what does the model predict would have happened to output
and in‡ation in the absence of QE? The answer to this question is that output would have been
30 basis point lower and in‡ation 14 basis points lower (annualized) in the model with coordinated
monetary and …scal policy for the episode we label QE2. For the central bank with balance sheet
   4
    Recent literature on log-linear approximations at the ZLB suggests that these approximations can be surprisingly
accurate, even under extreme circumstances such as those that are meant to replicate the Great Depression at the
ZLB (Eggertsson and Singh (2015)). We do no consider such extreme examples here, however.


                                                         5
concerns model, the analogous numbers are 45 basis points for output and 14 for in‡ation. What
we label as the Maturity Extension Program or QE3 in contrast had a bigger e¤ect, yielding 90
basis points for output and 40 basis point for in‡ation under coordinated policy but these e¤ects
are smaller for a central bank with balance sheet concerns. These experiments suggest that the
signalling e¤ect can in principle be substantial in modern monetary models.


2        Benchmark model
We start by outlining our benchmark model in which case monetary and …scal policy are coordi-
nated to maximize social welfare under discretion (i.e. the government cannot commit to future
policy). The model is a standard general equilibrium sticky-price closed economy set-up with an
output cost of taxation, along the lines of Eggertsson (2006). The main di¤erence in the model
from the literature is the introduction of long-term government debt. While it may seem like a
distraction to write out the fully non-linear model and de…ne the equilibrium in that context, as
we will later on analyze a linear quadratic version of this model, this is useful for two reasons.
First, we will formally show that the linearized …rst-order conditions of the government’s original
non-linear problem are the same as in our linear quadratic model (and this in general need not
be the case, see e.g. Eggertsson (2006)). Second, the non-linear version of the problem will be
important in section 5 once we allow for fully time-varying duration of government debt, where the
linear quadratic approximation is no longer valid. Laying out the model in this way, also, makes
transparent the relationship between social welfare and the ad-hoc objectives we will assign to the
central bank when it is independent in an alternative variation of the model which we propose in
Section 3. There, again, we will be working in a linear quadratic framework.

where nt is nominal wage, Zt (i) is nominal pro…t of …rm i, BtS is the household’s holding of one-
period risk-less nominal government bond at the beginning of period t + 1, Bt is a perpetuity bond,
St its price, and       its decay factor (further described below). At+1 is the value of the complete set
of state-contingent securities at the beginning of period t + 1 and Qt;t+1 is the stochastic discount
factor between periods t and t + 1 that is used to value random nominal income in period t + 1 in
monetary units at date t.6 Finally, it             1   is the nominal interest rate on government bonds at the
beginning of period t and Tt is government taxes.
      The way we introduce long term bonds into the model is to assume that government debt
not only takes the form of a one period risk-free debt, BtS ; but that the government also issues a
perpetuity in period t which pays             j   dollars j + 1 periods later, for each j                        0 and some decay
factor 0         <      1 .7   St is the price of the perpetuity nominal bond which depends on the decay
factor . The main convenience of introducing long term bond in this way is that we can consider
government debt of arbitrary duration. For example, a value of                                  = 0 implies that this bond is
simply a short-term bond while               = 1 corresponds to a classic console bond. More generally, in
an environment with stable prices, the duration of this bond is (1                                      )   1.   Thus, this simple
assumption allows us to explore a change in the duration of government debt in a transparent way.
The appendix contains details on why the budget constraint takes the form (2). In particular, the
modeling of long-term bond in this way admits a simple recursive formulation of the price of old
government bonds.
      For now, observe that we treat              as a constant. We will explore a one-time reduction in this
duration as a main “comparative static” of interest. In other words, a reduction in                                               answers the
question: What does a permanent reduction in the maturity of government debt                                      do?8            Toward the
end of the paper, however, we will extend the analysis so that                                 becomes a time varying choice
variable   t:   The main reason for our initial benchmark assumption is simplicity (and the fact that
we get a clean comparative static). But perhaps more importantly, we will see later that a one-time
reduction in         (in a liquidity trap) turns out to be a reasonably good approximation because                                           t   is
close to a random walk under optimal policy under discretion at a positive interest rate.
      The maximization problem of the household is now entirely standard, with the additional
feature of the portfolio choice between long and short term bonds.9 Let us now turn to the …rm

     The household is subject to a standard no-Ponzi game condition.

     We follow Woodford (2001).

     When we move towards an independent central bank, the thought experiment will be somewhat di¤erent, as we
soon explain.

     The problem of the household is thus to choose {Ct+s ; ht+s ; Bt+s ; Bt+s ; At+s } to maximize (1) subject
to a sequence of ‡ow budget constraints given by (2), while taking as exogenously given initial wealth and
{Pt+s; nt+s ; it+s ; St+s ( ); Qt;t+s ; t+s ; Zt+s (i); Tt+s }.

…rm produces a variety i according to the production function that is linear in labor yt (i) = ht (i).

    We can now write down the necessary conditions for equilibrium that arise from the maximiza-
tion problems of the private sector described above. We focus on a symmetric equilibrium where all
…rms charge the same price and produce the same amount of output. The households optimality
conditions are given by

where with some abuse of notion we have replaced vh with vy since in a symmetric equilibrium
ht (i) = yt (i) = Yt :
  10
     Our result are not sensitive to assuming instead the alternative Calvo model of price setting, provided we do not
assume there are large resource costs of price changes. This is explained in detail in Eggertsson and Singh (2015).
The reason we adapt the Rotemberg speci…cation is simplicity, i.e., it allows us to abstract from price dispersion as
a state variable.
  11
     The problem of the …rm is thus to choose {pt+s (i)} to maximize (4), while taking as exogenously given
fPt+s; Yt+s ; nt+s ; Qt;t+s ; t+s g
  12
     We may also add a standard transversality condition as a part of these conditions or a natural borrowing limit.




                                                                      8
2.2      Government
There is an output cost of taxation (for example, as in Barro (1979)) captured by the function
s(Tt      T ) where T is the steady-state level of taxes. Thus, in steady-state, there is no tax cost.
Total government spending is then given by

                                               Ft = Gt + s(Tt                 T)

where Gt is aggregate government consumption of the composite …nal good de…ned before.
       It remains to write down the (consolidated) ‡ow budget constraint of the government. Note
that the government issues both a one-period bond BtS and the perpetuity Bt . We can write the
‡ow budget constraint as

                       BtS + St Bt = (1 + it    1 ) Bt 1     + (1 + St ) Bt           1   + Pt (Ft   Tt ) :

Next, we assume that the one-period bond is in net-zero supply (i.e. BtS = 0; which makes clear
that we only introduce this bond explicitly as the one period risk free short term nominal rate is
the key policy instrument of monetary policy), and write the budget constraint in real terms as

                                                                          1
                                      St bt = (1 + St ) bt       1    t       + (Ft       Tt )                               (9)

              Bt
where bt =    Pt .   We now de…ne …scal policy as the choice of Tt ; Ft ; and bt . For simplicity, we will
from now on suppose that total government spending is constant so that Ft = F: Conventional
monetary policy is the choice of it : We simply impose the zero bound constraint on the setting of
monetary policy so that13
                                                        it       0:                                                         (10)

2.3      Private sector equilibrium
The goods market clearing condition gives the overall resource constraint as

                                              Yt = Ct + Ft + d (               t) :                                         (11)

We can then de…ne the private sector equilibrium, that is the set of possible equilibria that are
consistent with household and …rm maximization and the technological constraints of the model. A
private sector equilibrium is a collection of stochastic processes fYt+s; Ct+s ; bt+s ; St+s ;                        t+s ; it+s ;
Qt;t+s ; Tt+s ; Ft+s ; Gt+s g for s    0 that satisfy equations (5)-(10), for each s                    0; given bt   1   and an
exogenous stochastic process for f         t+s g:   To determine the set of possible equilibria in the model,
we now need to be explicit about how policy is determined.
  13
    This bound can be explicitly derived in a variety of environments, see e.g. Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) who
assume money in the utility function.




                                                             9
2.4      Markov-perfect equilibrium
We characterize a Markov-perfect (time-consistent) Equilibrium in which the government cannot
commit and acts with discretion every period.14 A key assumption in a Markov-perfect Equilibrium
is that government policy cannot commit to actions for the future government. Following Lucas
and Stokey (1983), however, we suppose that the government is able to commit to paying back the
nominal value of its debt.15 The only way the government can in‡uence future governments, then,
is via any endogenous state variables that may enter the private sector equilibrium conditions.
Before writing up the problem of the government, it is therefore necessary to write the system in
a way that makes clear what are the endogenous state variables of the game we study.
      De…ne the expectation variables ftE , gtE , and hE
                                                       t . The necessary and su¢ cient conditions for
a private sector equilibrium are now that the variables {Yt ; Ct ; bt ; St ;                        t ; it ;   Tt } satisfy: (a) the
following conditions

Note that the possible private sector equilibrium de…ned above depends only on the endogenous
state variable bt     1   and the shock      t:   Given that the government cannot commit to future policy
(apart from through the endogenous state variable), a Markov-perfect Equilibrium then requires
that the expectations ftE ; gtE , and hE
                                       t are only a function of these two state variables, i.e, we can
de…ne the expectation functions

                             ftE = f E (bt ; t ); gtE = g E (bt ; t ); and hE    E
                                                                            t = h (bt ; t ):                                   (20)

      We can now write the discretionary government’s optimization problem as a dynamic program-
 14
      See Maskin and Tirole (2001) for a formal de…nition of the Markov-perfect Equilibrium.
 15
      One could model this more explicitly by assuming that the cost of outright default is arbitrarily high.




                                                                  10

subject to the private sector equilibrium conditions (12)-(16) and the expectation functions (20).
Note that in equilibrium, the expectation functions satisfy the rational expectation restrictions (17)-
(19). Here, U (:) is the utility function of the household in (1) and V (:) is the value function.16
The detailed formulation of this maximization problem and the associated …rst-order necessary
conditions, as well as their linear approximation, are provided in the appendix.17


3        Linear-quadratic approach
For most of our analysis we take a linear-quadratic approach to the optimal policy problem, which
we will show explicitly is a correct approximation to the original non-linear optimal policy problem
of the government that is maximizing social welfare. This characterization will directly apply when
we consider the consolidated government. In this section, we also consider an independent central
bank. The problem of the independent central bank will be similar to that of the consolidated
government, apart from that it has its own budget constraint and an objective that may deviate
from social welfare due to political economy constraints. We consider …rst the coordinated policy,
and then move to an independent central bank.

3.1      Coordinated monetary and …scal policy
We start with the baseline model above of the coordinated government case where the budget
constraints are consolidated and government objective is to maximize welfare. We approximate
our non-linear model of the previous section around an e¢ cient non-stochastic steady-state with
zero in‡ation.18 Moreover, there are no tax collection costs in steady-state.19 Thus, there is a

We log-linearize the private sector equilibrium conditions around the steady state above to obtain

                                       Y^t = Et Y^t+1          (^{t   Et   t+1   rte )                            (22)

     Using compact notation, note that we can write the utility function as [u (Ct ) + g (F s(Tt T )) v (Yt )] t :
    17
     Note here that we assume that the government and the private-sector move simultaneously.
  18
     Variables without a t subscript denote a variable in steady state. Note that output is going to be at the e¢ cient
level in steady state because of the assumption of the production subsidy (appropriately chosen) we have made before.
  19
     We can think of this as being due to a limited set of lump sum taxation.
  20
     The steady-state is e¢ cient even with non-zero steady-state debt because of our assumption that taxes do not
entail output loss in steady-state.

       Here, (22) is the linearized household Euler equation, (23) is the linearized Phillips curve, (24)
is the linearized government budget constraint, and (25) is the linearized forward-looking asset-
pricing condition.23 (22) and (23) are standard relationships depicting how current output depends
on expected future output and the current real interest rate gap and how current in‡ation depends
on expected future in‡ation and the current output respectively.24
       (24) shows that since debt is nominal, its real value is decreased by in‡ation. Higher taxes also
reduce the debt burden. Moreover, an increase in the price of the perpetuity bond decreases the
real value of debt, with the e¤ect depending on the duration of debt: longer the duration, lower is
the e¤ect of the bond price on debt. Finally, (25) shows that the price of the perpetuity bond is
determined by (the negative of) expected present value of future short-term interest rates. Hence,
lower current or future short-term nominal interest rate will increase the price of the perpetuity
bond. Note that when    = 0; all debt is of one-period duration and (24) reduces to the standard
linearized government budget constraint while (25) reduces to S^t = ^{t :25

where        and   T   are a function of structural model parameters.26 Compared to the standard loss-
function in models with sticky prices that contains in‡ation and output, (26) features losses that
arise from output costs of taxation outside of steady-state.
       To analyze optimal policy under discretion in the linear-quadratic framework we once again
maximize utility, subject to the now linear private sector equilibrium conditions, taking into account
that the expectation are functions of the state variables of the game. In the linear system, the
exogenous state is now summarized with re while the endogenous state variable is once again ^bt 1 :

tively reducing/increasing – this interpretation would imply that total value of debt in steady-state – – remains
unchanged.

      Variables with hats denote log-deviations from steady state except for the nominal interest rate, which is given
as ^{t = i1+i
           t i
               : Since in the non-stochastic steady state with zero in‡ation, 1 + i = 1 ; this means that the zero lower
bound on nominal interest rates imposes the following bound on ^{t : ^{t        (1    ):
   24
      We write directly in terms of output rather than the output gap since we will not be considering shocks that
perturb the e¢ cient level of output in the model.
   25
      It is important to point out one technical detail in this case. The interpretation in this case of ^bt is that it is
the real value of the debt inclusive of the interest rate payment to be paid next period, that is, if all debt were one

Moreover, the expectation variables appearing in the system are now Et Y^t+1 ; Et S^t+1 ; and Et t+1 .
Accordingly, we will de…ne the game in terms of the state variables (rte ; ^bt 1 ) and the government
now takes as given the expectation functions Y E (^bt ; re ); S E (^bt ; re ); and E (^bt ; re ):

Observe that once again, in equilibrium, the expectation functions need to satisfy the rational
expectations restrictions that Et Y^t+1 = Y E (^bt ; rte ); Et St+1 = S E (^bt ; rte ); and Et t+1 = E (^bt ; rte ):
       We prove in the proposition below that this linear-quadratic approach gives identical linear
optimality conditions as the one obtained by linearizing the non-linear optimality conditions of the
original non-linear government maximization problem that we described in the previous section.
This provides the formal justi…cation for our simpli…ed approach.

Proposition 1 The linearized dynamic system of the non-linear Markov Perfect Equilibrium is
equivalent to the linear dynamic system of the linear-quadratic Markov Perfect Equilibrium.

3.1.1      Interpreting data from QE through the lens of the model

Let us now brie‡y review the data we will use when we do numerical experiments with this bench-
mark model. We are asking the data to give us some numbers for the following thought experiment:
What happens when you reduce the maturity of government debt? In the context of the model, we
are interested in getting some values for changes in                               as representing a particular unconventional
monetary policy intervention.
       According to the model, under coordinated policy and consolidated budget constraints we
should only be considering the debt held by the public (thus, we net out government debt held
by the Federal Reserve). Consistent with the model, also, we count reserves issued by the Federal
Reserve as short-term government debt. The duration of the consolidated government’s debt is
given below in Fig. 1.27 The vertical dashed lines are important events associated with the Federal
  27
    In generating this …gure, we …rst use estimates from Chadha, Turner, and Zampoli (2013) on the duration of
treasury debt held outside the Federal Reserve, which we then augment with data on reserves issued by the Federal
Reserve that is available from public sources (FRED).


                                                               13
Reserve buying long-term treasury bonds: November 2008 and March 2009 (Quantitative Easing
1); November 2010 (Quantitative Easing 2 (QE 2)); September 2011 (Maturity Extension Program
(MEP)); and September 2012 and December 2012 (Quantitative Easing 3 (QE3)). Around those
dates, the maturity of outstanding government debt declined. The baseline estimation of our model
will be based on the November 2010 or the Quantitative Easing 2 (QE2) program, a common focal
point in the literature. Given the parameter estimates from the QE2 program, we can also assess
the macroeconomic impact of the September 2011 or the Maturity Extension Program (MEP).
The reduction in maturity observed in Fig. 1 will be the input in our policy experiments under
coordinated policy and consolidated budget constraints.28

3.2      An independent central bank
We now present an alternate model where the central bank faces its own budget constraint and
minimizes an ad-hoc loss function that captures directly its balance sheet concerns. This model
has a political economy related justi…cation to why the central bank might care about transfers to
the treasury. This alternative formulation, as will become clear, will also require us to view the
data through di¤erent lenses than in the last subsection. As we shall see later on, however, the
central insights will remain the same, i.e. QE has an e¤ect via signalling.
       We are now interested in studying the problem from the perspective of an independent central
bank that need not act in concert with the rest of the government. The …rst step is to explicitly
write down its budget constraint, before we move on to its objectives. We consider the case where
the central bank holds long-term assets (long term government debt). It buys these assets by
issuing one-period liabilities (approximating interest-bearing reserves). We also introduce some
“seigniorage net of operations cost” of the central bank that is not time-varying (similar to …scal
spending that is not time-varying in our previous characterization when monetary and …scal policy
are coordinated). Denote central bank holdings of assets by BtCB and its liabilities by Lt (with
prices St and Qt respectively) and the “seigniorage net of operations cost” by K: The assets of
the central bank are in the form of a perpetuity bond of the same kind we analyzed before with
duration . Moreover, let Vt be the transfers to the treasury.
       The ‡ow budget constraint of the central bank is then given by

                         St BtCB + Pt Vt      Qt Lt    Pt K = (1 + St ) BtCB1                Lt    1


where the price of the liabilities, Qt ; is inverse of the (gross) short-term nominal interest rate.29
This can be written in real terms as

                                                                   1                1
                         St bCB
                             t      Qt lt = (1 + St ) bCB
                                                       t 1     t       lt   1   t       +K        Vt :
  28
     We will for the rest of the paper take September 2011, September 2012, December 2012 as one policy intervention
and with abuse of terminology, refer it as MEP.
  29
     For earlier work in this vein, see Jeanne and Svensson (2007) and Berriel and Bhattarai (2009). For recent work
exploring the implications of the central bank budget constraint, see Hall and Reis (2013) and Del Negro and Sims
(2015), who explore positive issues related to solvency and determinacy.


                                                        14
The debt of the treasury is now either held by the central bank or the general public. The market
clearing condition for treasury debt (BtT ) is thus given by BtT = BtCB + Bt where Bt is debt held
by the public. We assume that the treasury follows passive …scal policy that ensures stable debt
dynamics. Thus we completely abstract from …scal policy considerations. We also assume for
simplicity that all central bank reserves are held by the public.
       With some algebra outlined in the footnote, and some simplifying assumptions, we can write
the linearized budget constraint as
                           h              i                  h                   i

       Before we made the critical assumption that in steady state the market value of public debt was
given by some …xed number Sb =                          that we linearized around. Here, the most important parameter
is the scale of the balance sheet, measured by                              V:   This number re‡ects how large the asset side of
the balance sheet, S       bCB ;   is relative to the steady state transfers to the treasury, V: Also, note here
that the budget constraint is written in terms of the di¤erence between the central banks holding
of long term government debt ^bCB which has a …xed duration of and it own issuance of short
                                               t
term debt (interest bearing reserves) ^lt . It can thus be re-written in terms of the net asset position
of the bank, which we de…ne as ^bN;CB = ^bCB ^lt . We will use that formulation later below.

We will focus on a steady-state where S bCB = Ql: Since SQ = 1 1 ; we will have b l = (1                ) : This then
implies that K = V: We can now linearize the non-linear asset pricing and central bank budget constraint. First,
we have S^t = Q ^ t + Et S^ where in terms of our previous notation the following holds Q
                            t+1
                                                                                           ^ t = ^{t : Thus, we have
exactly like before the asset pricing condition for the long-term asset S^t = ^{t + Et S^t+1 : The linearized budget
constraint is now given by

constraint in the text.

no e¤ect on the net asset position of the bank. The reason for this is that in‡ation depreciates the
value of the assets (nominal long term bonds) and liabilities (short term nominal debt) to exactly
the same extent. This is a critical di¤erence relative to the consolidated budget constraint. Long
term debt does, however, have an important e¤ect on the net asset position of the central bank.
This is because while assets are long-term, the liabilities are short term. There is thus generally a
“duration mismatch” in the central bank’s balance sheet.
     To see fully the implications of this duration mismatch, consider …rst the case in which             = 0:
Then, both the assets and the liabilities have the same duration and variations in the short term
                                                                             ^ t and S^t cancel out.
nominal interest rate have no e¤ect on the net worth of the central bank, as Q
Consider now the case in which               > 0. Now the central bank is holding long dated assets and short
dated liabilities. In this case we see that an increase in the short-term nominal interest rate reduces
the net worth of the bank. The reason for this is that an increase in the short rate increases the
borrowing cost of the bank one-to-one. Meanwhile, on the assets side, the increase in the short
term nominal interest rate has a more limited e¤ect , since they are long-dated securities (so the
nominal interest rate is multiplied by 1                 in (27)). Thus, increasing the short-term nominal
interest rate sharply will lead to balance sheet losses for the central bank.
     What does quantitative easing mean in the context of this budget constraint? We can model
it in two ways. First, recall that for the consolidated budget constraint we interpreted it as a one
time decline in : Here, an analogous experiment is that it corresponds to a one time increase in
 , i.e. the degree of duration mismatch is enhanced by making longer the duration of the assets
held by the central bank. This interpretation is about the change in composition of the asset side
of the central bank’s balance sheet.
     While an increase in          is one way of interpreting quantitative easing, there is another comple-
mentary interpretation. An increase in              means that it is replacing shorter term bonds on its asset
side with bonds of longer duration. But the total value of bonds on the asset side is constant.
Thus, it is simply a change in the composition of the balance sheet. Now consider the following
experiment: Suppose all bonds on the asset side have some …xed                    (say, corresponding to …ve
years). Now imagine the central bank increases the purchases of these these bonds by printing
interest-bearing reserves. While this is not a¤ecting the average duration of bonds on the asset
side of the balance sheet (or average duration mismatch since              is …xed), it is increasing the scale
of the central bank balance sheet. The scale of the balance sheet in steady state was evaluated
                                   V
by the parameter         V   =   S bCB
                                       :   A permanent expansion in the balance sheet is therefore measured
as a drop in       V:   Observe that the increase in scale will simply expand the number of assets and
liabilities, but in steady state the remittances, V , remain unchanged. Hence an alternative way of
interpreting quantitative easing is an increase in the size of the balance sheet of the Fed, or a drop
in   V: ,   without changing the composition. We will use both the …rst and second interpretation to
study the implications of di¤erent QE episodes.

Observe that all the private-sector equilibrium conditions remain the same as when we studied the
consolidated budget constraint. We can now conduct the experiment of an increase in the central
bank’s balance sheet via decrease in            V;   holding          …xed. We can also conduct the experiment of
larger holding of long-term assets as an increase in ; holding                            V   …xed.
       In terms of the central bank’s objective, we take here an ad-hoc loss-function approach, which
has a rich and long history in monetary economics. We posit that the central bank directly cares
about transfers to the treasury for political economy reasons. This means that its period loss
function now incorporates a term related to target transfers to the Treasury, Vt , in addition to the
usual terms related to in‡ation and output. It is thus given by
                                                h                                 i

Does this objective make sense? There is some evidence that central banks care about the transfers
to the treasury.31 Moreover, as we have seen, to the extent that these transfers a¤ect tax collection,
the central bank should care also from a social welfare point of view.
       The discretionary central bank’s optimization problem can then be written recursively as a

lost money corresponding to 30% of GDP – usually …nd themselves without a job shortly thereafter. Berriel and
Bhattarai (2009) contains some other anecdotal evidence of such central bank worries. In related frameworks, Jeanne
and Svensson (2007) and Berriel and Bhattarai (2009) include the central bank’s net worth directly in the loss
function. Our modeling approach here is thus di¤erent.

rates will be rising during this transition. We think this provides the most natural interpretation
of the political economy objectives of a central bank as we further discuss in Section 4.2 when we
calibrate the model.

3.2.1     Interpreting data from QE through the lens of the model

This alternative model of QE provided by modeling an independent central bank leads one to
consider di¤erent aspects of the data relative to if we were to assume coordinated government
policy. Now we are not interested in the composition of the net government debt held by the
public, but instead the balance sheet of the central bank directly. Ratio of the assets of the Federal
Reserve (holdings of treasuries like our model) to average pre-crisis GDP is given below in Fig. 2.
                                                     1
This is the counterpart to the parameter             V
                                                         in the model above.32 Average maturity of treasury
holdings by the Federal Reserve is given below in Fig. 3. This is the counterpart to the parameter
    in the model above.33 Again, the vertical dashed lines are important events associated with the
Federal Reserve buying long-term treasury bonds: November 2008 and March 2009 (Quantitative
Easing 1); November 2010 (Quantitative Easing 2 (QE 2)); September 2011 (Maturity Extension
Program (MEP)); and September 2012 and December 2012 (Quantitative Easing 3 (QE3)). The
baseline parameterization of our model will be based on the November 2010 or the Quantitative
Easing 2 (QE2) program. Fig. 2 shows that the de…ning feature of that program was an increase
in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet with the average maturity not changing by much.
The …gures also help us assess the macroeconomic impact of the September 2011 or the Maturity
Extension Program (MEP). Fig. 3 shows that the de…ning feature of that program was an increase
in the maturity of treasury holdings, with the size of the balance sheet not changing by much.


4        Results
4.1      Coordinated monetary and …scal policy
Let us start with our baseline model where the budget constraints of the treasury and the central
bank are consolidated and the government maximizes the welfare of the representative household
under discretion. We discuss the calibration of this model next. As we mentioned before, the
baseline calibration of this model will be based on the e¤ects of the QE2 program. For the steady-

state level of debt-to-taxes,     T    =   T;   we use data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas to get
the long-run average of market value of debt over output ( bS
                                                           Y ) and NIPA data to estimate the ratio
of taxes over output ( YT ): This gives us the value        bS
                                                            T    =   T   = 7:2: We start with a baseline maturity
of 16:87 q., which is the level at the beginning of the QE2 program. Then, as a measure of the
e¤ects on the average maturity of outstanding government debt from QE2, we take the di¤erence
    32
     In the model, this parameter is the Ratio of assets to remittances to Treasury and that is what we indeed use for
calibration. For ease of interpretation, we present in the …gure the Ratio of assets to annual GDP, which is a scaled
version. These two measures are simply related by a ratio: that of pre-crisis remittances to Treasury to GDP.
  33
     We used data from publicly available sources to construct these …gures (FRED and the Federal Reserve Board
of Governors website).

in Fig. 1 between QE2 and the MEP (the third and fourth dashed vertical lines), which is 0:67 q.
That is, according to our measure, the reduction in maturity was from 16:87 q to 16:2 q, with a
di¤erence of 0:67q.
       To model the case of a liquidity trap, we follow Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and assume
a negative shock to the exogenous e¢ cient rate of interest, rte ; which makes the zero lower bound
binding.34 The process for rte follows a two-state Markov process with an absorbing state: From
period 0 on then rte takes on a negative value of rL
                                                   e : It remains at this value with probability                              in
every period, while with probability 1                    ; it reverts back to steady-state and stays there forever
after. This means that the economy will exit the liquidity trap with a constant probability of 1
every period and that once it exits, it does not get into the trap again. The appendix contains
details about the computation algorithm.
       To parameterize the model we use a mix of calibration/estimation based on the e¤ects of QE2
on in‡ation and yields calculated by Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) as well as the
expected duration of the zero lower bound episode and its e¤ects on output and in‡ation. We pick
the quarterly discount factor of               = 0:99 and we …x the elasticity of substitution among varieties
of goods at a standard value of 8: We allow for debt while at the liquidity trap to be 30% above
its steady-state value, which is in line with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas data.35
       Then, we estimate ( ,                     e;
                                        T,    ; rL     ) by matching …ve targets. Our …rst two targets are a
reduction in 8 quarters ahead yield of                 i (8) =         16 b.p. and an increase in expected cumulative
in‡ation over 10 years of                (40) = 5 b.p. as a result of the QE2 program when the economy is
initially in a ZLB situation. These were the estimates in Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen
(2011) of the e¤ects of the QE2 program. Our third target is a 3-year average duration of the ZLB
period (for an average ZLB duration of about 3 years, we target                              = 0:91). Finally, our fourth
and …fth targets are a drop in output of 10% and a 2% percent drop in in‡ation during the ZLB
episode to make the experiment relevant for the recent “Great Recession” in the United States
(Y (1) and        (1) of       0:10 and -0:02 respectively).36

     One can think of this here as being driven by a preference shock. For an alternate way of generating a liquidity
trap in monetary models, based on an exogenous drop in the borrowing limit, see Eggertsson and Krugman (2012).

     We also adjust the quantity of debt level after QE2 to keep the market value of the debt …xed during the QE2
intervention (it has to be adjusted to 0.297).

     One can alternatively impose some priors on the parameters we estimate using Bayesian methods, but we felt
this strategy is more transparent, given that our estimated value for the parameters are relatively reasonable.




                                                                  19
4.1.1        Solution at positive interest rates

We start by showing the solution at positive interest rates to show how debt maturity changes
the policy incentives of the government. The complication in solving a MPE is that we do not
know the unknown expectation functions               E;   Y E ; and S E : To solve this, we use the method of
undetermined coe¢ cients. All the details of the derivations are provided in the appendix.
   Let us …rst consider the most basic exercise to clarify the logic of the government’s problem.
How do the dynamics of the model look like in the absence of shocks when the only di¤erence from
steady state is that there is some initial value of debt with some …xed value for debt duration?
Fig. 4 shows the dynamics of the endogenous variables in the model for an initial value of debt
that is 30 percent above the steady state. We see that if debt is above steady state, it is paid over
time back to steady state. For our baseline duration of 16:87 quarters (solid line), the half-life of
debt repayment is about 12 quarters. In the transition in‡ation is about 0:75 percent above steady
state and the real interest rate is below its steady state. As a consequence, output is also above
its steady state value. This result is in contrast to the classic Barro tax smoothing result whereby
debt follows a random walk. The reason is that debt creates an incentive to create in‡ation for a
discretionary government as further described below. By paying down debt back to steady state,
the government eliminates this incentive and achieves the …rst best outcome in the model.
   The …gure illustrates that for a given maturity of government debt, debt is in‡ationary and
implies a lower future real interest rate until a new steady state is reached. What is the logic for
this result? Perhaps the best way to understand the logic is by inspecting the government budget
constraint (24). Recall that debt issued in nominal terms, although in the budget constraint we
                                        Bt
                                             b
have rewritten it in terms of ^bt =     Pt
                                         b
                                                 : This implies that for a given outstanding debt ^bt   1;   any
actual in‡ation will reduce the real value of the outstanding debt. Accordingly we have the term
  1         term in the budget constraint which re‡ects this in‡ation incentive. As the literature has
        t
stressed in the past (see e.g. Calvo and Guidotti (1990 and 1992)), if prices are ‡exible then this
will reduce actual debt in equilibrium only if the in‡ation is unanticipated. The reason for this
is that otherwise anticipated in‡ation will be re‡ected one-to-one in the interest rate paid on the
debt.
   Apart from the incentive to depreciate the real value of the debt via in‡ation, there is a second
force at work. In our model, the government is not only able to a¤ect the price level, it can also
have an e¤ect on the real interest rate. Hence, we see that in Fig. 4 the real interest rate is below
steady state during the entire transition path back to steady state. This reduces the real interest
rate payments the government needs to pay on debt – in contrast to the classic literature with
‡exible prices where the (ex-ante) real interest rate is exogenous. We refer to this as the rollover
incentive of the government.
   Intuitively, it may be most straight forward to see the rollover incentive by simplifying the
model down to the case in which         = 0 and there is only one period debt: In that case, the budget




                                                          20
constraint of the government can be written as

                                    ^bt =        1^
                                                  bt 1             1
                                                                       t   + ^{t          T^t                                     (29)

and now ^bt is the real value of one period risk-free nominal debt in period t which is inclusive of
                                                                                                                    Bt       (1+it )BtS
interest paid (to relate to our prevision notation in (2) then when                             = 0 we have bt =    Pt   =      Pt
where BtS was the one period government debt that did not include interest payment). This
expression shows that while     t   has a direct e¤ect by depreciating the real value of government
debt, the government has another important margin by which it can in‡uence its debt burden.
The term ^{t re‡ects the rolling-over-cost of the one-period debt. In particular, we see that if the
interest rate is low, then the cost of rolling over debt is smaller. This latter mechanism will be
critical when considering the e¤ects of varying debt maturity since its force depends on the value
of :
   How are these dynamics a¤ected by the term structure of government debt? We now consider
the importance of variations in . As noted before, our main interest in understanding this e¤ect
is that a natural interpretation of QE is that it corresponds to a reduction in                                as in our model the
duration of debt is given by (1         )   1:   In Fig. 4 we consider a reduction in duration from 16:8
q to 16:2 and 15:6 q. As the …gure shows this increases in‡ation in equilibrium considerably, but
also reduces the real rate further. Similarly, we see that the debt is now paid down at a faster clip
as higher output gap and in‡ation causes increased distortions, a point we will return to.
   To obtain some intuition for this result, let us again write out the budget constraint, this time
substituting out for St to obtain

                     ^bt =    1^
                               bt 1         1
                                                  t   + (1         )[^{t           S^E (^bt ; rte )]   T^t :                      (30)

We observe here that the rollover interest rate is now multiplied by the term (1                                    ). Intuitively,
if a larger part of government debt is held with long maturity, the short-term rollover rate matters
less, as the terms of the loans are to a greater extent predetermined. Hence, the incentive of the
government to lower the short-term interest rate is reduced.
   Again, considering special cases here can be useful. We already noted the case in which                                           =
0 (only one-period debt) which gave us equation (29). It shows that the short-term interest rate
a¤ects debt burden in next period one-to-one, this is the rollover incentive of the government.
Consider now the other polar case in which               = 1 (with classic console only). Then we get

                                      ^bt =           1^
                                                       bt 1            1
                                                                            t       T^t

which shows that the short-term nominal interest rate does not a¤ect debt dynamics at all. Thus
the rollover incentive is completely eliminated by making debt long-term. This is the key reason
why short-term debt creates more in‡ationary and lower interest rate incentive than long term
debt.


                                                              21
     Having established intuitively and numerically that at positive interest rates, decreasing the
duration of debt increases the incentives of the government to lower short-term real interest rates,
we now move on to analyzing the case where the nominal interest rate is at the zero lower bound.
At the ZLB, manipulating this incentive can be particularly valuable.

4.1.2    Solution at the ZLB: QE2

 Consider the following policy experiment: In the liquidity trap, the level of debt is constant at
^bL . When out of the trap, then ^bL is optimally determined by the government according to the
MPE previously described. Why is this an interesting environment? Now we can ask the following
question: What would be the e¤ect of changing the duration of debt once-and-for-all, while the zero
lower bound is binding? In other words, we are interested in the comparative static of the model as
we vary the duration of debt in the liquidity trap, but at the same time holding aggregate debt, ^bL ;
constant. We think this is an interesting comparative static, because it corresponds so closely to
QE. QE did not involve increasing aggregate government debt, as pointed out in the introduction.
Instead it just involved exchanging long-term government debt with short-term government debt
(money), which we interpret here as a reduction in . In our experiment the steady-state market
value of debt to taxes is always kept …xed. For now, however, a key abstraction is that the value
of   is …xed so that once you change     (QE), it does not revert back to where it was. We will come
back to this issue in Section 5.
     Before exploring the comparative static at the heart of this section, let us review …rst how the
model behaves in the absence of any intervention, i.e., the evolution of each of the endogenous
variables in the face of the shock we chose in the last section. Figs. 5 and 6 show the response
of in‡ation and output to a negative shock to the e¢ cient rate of interest in the benchmark
economy, when the duration of government debt is …xed at 16:87 quarters. We will be interested
in understanding if QE can improve upon the outcome we see in these …gures, which feature an
output drop of approximately 10 percent and in‡ation drop of 2 percent (by construction of our
calibration).
     Some comments are in order about the baseline economy in the absence of QE. First note that
the shock here generates a considerable recession and a drop in in‡ation. This is driven entirely by
the fact that the central bank cannot accommodate the shock via cuts in the nominal interest rate.
This creates a gap between the equilibrium real interest rate, rt , and the e¢ cient rate of interest rte
(i.e. the real interest rate needed for output to remain at the …rst best steady state). This interest
rate gap is shown in Fig. 7. It is well known from the existing literature (see e.g. Eggertsson and
Woodford (2003)), that this situation can be greatly improved if the central bank could commit
to keeping the nominal interest rate low for some time after the shock is over. This is bene…cial
because aggregate demand depends not only on the current interest rate gap but the entire path
of future interest rates.
     The optimal commitment analyzed by Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) is not possible in our
environment, however. The reason is that we are considering a MPE, so the government cannot


                                                   22
commit to future policy that is dynamically inconsistent (this is the so called “de‡ationary bias”
of discretionary policy at the ZLB, see Eggertsson (2006)). The optimal commitment involves
promising real interest rate below the e¢ cient rate of interest rate when the shock is over –but at
that time the government has little incentive to deliver on this promise.
       Another point worth stressing in Fig. 5 is that once the shock is over (and each of the thin
lines revert up) then in‡ation overshoots its long run value in our MPE. This is a feature of our
calibration, as we assumed that there is outstanding government debt of 30 percent above steady
state. Thus the government does already have some incentive to in‡ate which is re‡ected in these
numbers. The fact that output drops by about 10 percent in Fig. 6 simply suggests that this
incentive is not strong enough for the government to be able to escape the ZLB. One solution to
this problem, then, would be simply to issue even more nominal debt (this is a solution analyzed
in Eggertsson (2006)), an approach we abstract from here by virtue of ^bL being constant.37
       To motivate this abstraction, i.e. …xed ^bL ; we can think of some political or economic limits on
how much total aggregate government debt can be issued (e.g. a debt limit imposed by Congress
or that too high debt gives rise to perception of default, a consideration we have not included in
our model). Moreover, when we consider the case of the independent central bank, the option of
raising total number of government bonds may not be available. In any case, when the government
has two instruments –the stock of nominal debt and its composition in terms of duration –we want
to understand how both margins work, and our focus is on the latter. This leads us to consider
next the central comparative static of this paper: What happens when you permanently reduce the
duration of government debt in the MPE? Can manipulating the term structure make expansionary
future monetary policy “credible” without further cuts in the current nominal interest rate?
       In Figs. 8 and 9 we see what happens if the government reduces the duration of government
debt from 16.87 quarters to 16.2 quarters, this is the number we computed on the basis of the
data from QE2. The …gures shows the change in output and in‡ation as a result of this policy
intervention. The bottom-line is that in‡ation now increases by 14 basis points (annualized) and
output increases by 30 basis points. We can also ask how large intervention would have been needed
to fully close the output gap. The answer to this question is that the duration would have had to
go down from 16.87 to 8.5 quarters.
       What is the key logic? Because government has more short-term debt the central bank keeps
the short-term real interest rates lower in future in order to keep the real interest rate low on the
debt it is rolling over. Thus, QE provides a “signal” about the future conduct of monetary policy.
In particular it generates a credible signal about the future path of short-term interest rates. This
then enables it to have e¤ect on macroeconomic prices and quantities at the zero lower bound. The
change in the response of the real interest rate is given in Fig. 10, where one can see that the real
interest rate is lower throughout the horizon post QE.38
  37
     Note that we keep the market value of debt constant (before and after change in duration) in our numerical
experiments via appropriate adjustments.
  38
     This result thus connects our paper with Persson, Persson, and Svensson (1987 and 2006), who show in a ‡exible
price environment that a manipulation of the maturity structure of both nominal and indexed debt can generate an



                                                        23
4.1.3      Capital losses from reneging on optimal policy

We have emphasized so far that the reason why lowering the duration of debt during a liquidity
trap situation is bene…cial is that it provides incentives for the government to keep the real interest
rate low in future as it is now rolling over more short-term debt. We have shown these results by
comparing the path of the real interest rate under optimal policy at a baseline and lower duration
of debt.
    Another way of framing this is that otherwise it would su¤er capital losses on its balance sheet.
These losses then would have to be accounted for by raising costly taxes. One way to illustrate the
mechanism behind this result is to conduct the following thought experiment: suppose that once
the liquidity trap is over, the government reneges on the path for in‡ation and output dictated by
optimal policy under discretion and instead perfectly stabilizes them at zero. In such a situation,
how large are capital losses, or equivalently, how high do taxes have to rise out of zero lower
bound compared to if the government had continued to follow optimal policy? In particular, is
this increase in taxes more when debt is of shorter duration ? We show in Fig. 11 the change
in taxes (which are scaled as a fraction of output) if the government were to renege on optimal
policy at di¤erent durations of debt. The increase in taxes out of zero lower bound are higher at
a shorter duration of outstanding debt. Thus, lowering the duration of government debt provides
the government with more of an incentive to keep the real interest rate low in future in order to
avoid having to raise costly taxes.

4.1.4      Quantitative assessment of MEP/QE3

Given the parameter estimates based on QE2 and its e¤ects on expected in‡ation and future
short-term interest rates given in Table 1, we now conduct an assessment of the macroeconomic
e¤ects of MEP/QE3. This policy involved a reduction in the duration of outstanding government
debt as well, as can be seen from Fig. 1. Our experiment is based on the di¤erence in duration
between September 2011 and September 2013 (we thus use the entire period following MEP for
this calibration), which is equal to 1:8 q and bigger than the e¤ect from QE2.39 Accordingly, the
macroeconomic e¤ects, as shown below in Figs. 12-13 are larger as well as the drop in the real
interest rate, as shown in Fig. 14 below, is now bigger. The extent of de‡ation is now reduced by
30 basis points, and output is higher as a consequence on the order of 90 basis points.

4.2     An independent central bank
We now model the e¤ect of QE using the political economy set-up where the central bank directly
cares about transfers to the treasury. To parameterize the model we use quarterly average from
2003-2008 of remittances to Treasury from the Federal Reserve to get the steady state value of V .
                           1       S bCB       Ql
Our baseline value of      V
                               =     V     =   V    = 111:47 corresponds to the average ratio of holdings of

equivalence between discretion and commitment outcomes.
  39
     As noted before, this measure of policy intervention will also include policy changes brought about by QE3.



                                                          24
Treasuries by the Federal Reserve to remittances to Treasury over the period of 2003-2008. When
considering QE as an increase in the scale of the balance sheet, we assume V is …xed at the steady
state value while the scale of assets and liabilities (S bCB = Ql) increases. In Fig. 2 we show the
asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet as a ratio of annual GDP, where we use Treasury holdings of
the Fed as a proxy for the asset side. This gives a baseline ratio of the Fed’s assets over annual
GDP pre-crisis as 5:1%. Then, as a measure of the e¤ects on the size of the Federal Reserve’s
balance sheet from QE2, we take the di¤erence in Fig. 2 between QE2 and the MEP (the third
and fourth dashed vertical lines), which is an increase in the Fed’s balance sheet (ratio of asset
to annual GDP) from 5:1% to 10:6%. Finally, we also pick the value of                         based on the average
maturity of Treasury holdings of the FED during 2003-2008, which is equal to 7:57 q. We model
the liquidity trap in the same way as before.
      For the other structural parameters of the model, like before for the consolidated budget con-
straint case, we estimate them using a mean squared relative error criterion. Unlike for the con-
solidated government debt, however, since there is no clear metric on the net asset position of the
Federal Reserve during the crisis (in terms of deviation from steady-state), we choose to estimate
that parameter bN;CB
                L    , along with …ve others from before.40 The targets in the criterion are the
same as before and the values of the targets for our best match are                   (1) =     0:02; Y (1) =      0:10;
      (40) = 5:1 b.p.,      i (8) =     16:5 b.p., and       = 0:85 (6.7 quarters). Our estimated parameter
values are given in Table 2:

4.2.1      Solution at positive interest rates

Let us again …rst consider the most basic exercise to clarify the logic of the central bank’s problem.
How do the dynamics of the model look like in the absence of shocks when the only di¤erence
from steady state is that there is some initial negative value of net asset of the central bank (thus,
net assets is below steady-state) with some …xed value of asset duration? We consider transition
dynamics when net asset is below steady-state initially, while in the consolidated budget constraint
case we had considered a case where debt is above steady-state initially. These are exactly the
same thought experiments because in both cases there is asset accumulation along the transition.
Moreover, in both cases, the real interest rate is rising along the transition, which is the main
mechanism behind our paper. Our assumption is saying that the Fed would like to have higher
net worth at the onset of our experiment, which we believe is a reasonable assumption under QE
when the Fed exposed itself to possible balance sheet losses.
      We will be looking at comparative statics of those transition dynamics with respect to the size
of the central bank balance sheet (holding the duration of the assets …xed) as well as the duration of
the assets on the central bank’s balance sheet (holding the size of the balance sheet …xed). These,
as we have already stressed, is how we interpret QE2 and MEP/QE3.
      Fig. 15 shows the dynamics of the endogenous variables in the model for an initial value of net
asset of the central bank that is 15 percent below the steady state. Analogous to the consolidated
 40
      We also adjust this to keep the market value of the net asset position constant as a result of the QE intervention.


                                                           25
government budget constraint model, we see that if net asset is below steady state, it is accumulated
over time back to steady state. Moreover, in this transition, in‡ation is above steady state and the
real interest rate is below its steady state. As a consequence, output is also above its steady state
value. What is the logic? Consider the linearized budget constraint of the central bank (28)

                                ^bN;CB =       1^N;CB

                                                                                                 t

 ^{t + Et St+1 : If = 0 then its assets are simply equivalent in duration to the liabilities and
cutting or raising the nominal interest rate has no e¤ect on the evolution of the net worth of the
bank, ^bN;CB : Once > 0; however, then cutting the nominal interest rate will have a bigger e¤ect
       t
on the rollover cost of the liabilities of the bank than on the price of the long-term assets, thus
generating capital gains. That is precisely what you want to obtain when ^bN;CB < 0 and the more             t
so, the higher is :
   We now consider the e¤ect of increasing the size of the balance sheet. We de…ne the size as the
ratio of assets to transfers to the treasury while holding the duration of the assets on the balance
sheet …xed. In Fig. 15 we show that bigger the size of the balance sheet (our baseline calibration
is 5:1), bigger is the drop in the real interest rate. What is the intuition for this result? Consider
                                                                                                                           1
the linearized ‡ow budget constraint of the central bank (28) again where recall that                                  V       is our
measure of the size of the central bank’s balance sheet. Now multiply both sides of the equation
                 1
above with   V       to get
                                                                             h                           i

                                                                         1
                                                                              (1         ) S^t      ^t

This shows that even if we hold                …xed, an increase in                      V       makes the e¤ect of the duration
mismatch between assets and liabilities of the central bank worse. Thus, when assets are long-term
                                                        1
and liabilities short-term, for a higher            V       ; the central bank’s balance sheet is more exposed to
interest-rate risk along the transition where assets are being accumulated and the interest rate is
rising, like in Fig. 15. Thus, in order to avoid capital losses on its balance, the central bank has
                                                                                 1
incentives to keep interest rates lower with a higher                        V       :
   Fig. 16 considers how increasing the duration of the assets of the central bank, while holding
the size of the balance sheet …xed, a¤ects the transition dynamics we described above. Fig. 16
shows that longer is the duration of assets held by the central bank (our baseline calibration is a
duration of 7:57 quarters), larger is the drop in the real interest rate along the transition. This is
a counterpart of our results for the consolidated government budget constraint model. Let us now
move to the case in which the ZLB is binding.




                                                                26
4.2.2   Solution at the ZLB: QE2 and MEP/QE3

At the ZLB we consider a thought experiment that is comparable to what we did with coordinated
policy. Suppose bN;CB
                 L    is …xed at some constant number at the ZLB but then optimally determined
by the central bank according to the MPE out of ZLB. We are interested in two comparative statics.
First, what is the e¤ect of increasing the scale of the balance sheet once and for all holding the
duration on the asset side …xed? Second, what is the e¤ect of changing the duration of the bonds
on the asset side, holding the scale of the balance sheet …xed? As we saw in Section 3.2.1, QE2
corresponds quite closely to a thought experiment in which the Fed increased the scale of its balance
sheet while holding the duration on its asset side …xed. Meanwhile, the MPE/QE3 corresponds
more closely to a change in the maturity of the bonds on its asset side, while the scale of the
balance sheet remained …xed.
   Figs. 17 and 18 show the response of in‡ation and output to a negative shock to the e¢ cient
rate of interest when the size of the central bank’s balance sheet is 5:1 and the duration of the
central bank’s assets is 7:57 quarters. As before, because of the zero lower bound constraint, the
economy su¤ers from de‡ation and because of the increase in the real interest rate that it creates
(that is, a gap between the real interest rate and its e¢ cient counterpart), also from a negative
e¤ect on output. The real interest rate gap is shown in Fig. 19. Thus again, optimal policy at the
zero lower bound would entail reducing the real interest rate gap at the present and in future, but
this is not credible in a MPE.
                                                                                                 1
   An increase in the size of the central bank’s balance sheet, given by the parameter       V       , helps
solve the problem. Figs. 20 and 21 show the change in response of output and in‡ation to a
negative shock to the e¢ cient rate of interest when balance sheet is more than doubled from 5:1 to
10:6 based upon the data from QE2 in Section 3.2.1 (again the duration of the central bank’s assets
is still …xed at 7:57 quarters). The extent of de‡ation is reduced by 14 basis points (annualized) as
well as the negative e¤ect on output by 45 basis points. Once the shock is over and the zero lower
bound is no longer a constraint, the change in response of in‡ation and output is positive. These
e¤ects are in the same order of magnitude as the e¤ects obtained with the consolidated government
budget constraint.
   The main reason why this is achieved is that because the central bank’s balance sheet bigger, it
magni…es the e¤ects of interest rate changes on the balance sheet due to the mismatch in duration
between its assets (which are long-term) and liabilities (which are short-term). The central bank
then keeps the short-term real interest rates lower in future, especially once the zero lower bound is
not binding, in order to keep the real interest rate low. Otherwise, it would su¤er from capital losses
which are costly for the central bank. Thus, quantitative easing indeed provides a signal about
the future conduct of monetary policy and in particular, the future path of short-term interest
rates. The change in the response of the real interest rate comparing smaller to bigger duration
of debt is given in Fig. 22, where one can see that the real interest rate is lower through out the
horizon. This, then, is a rea¢ rmation of the central result of our paper: quantitative easing acts
as a commitment device during a liquidity trap situation.


                                                  27
    Consider now the e¤ect of increasing the duration of the bonds on the asset side of the Fed,
holding the scale of the balance sheet constant. As we pointed out in Section 3.2.1 this corresponds
relatively closely to MEP/QE3. For this exercise we compute the average maturity of the treasuries
on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at September 2011 (13:6 q) and September 2013 (18:95 q).
The di¤erence between the maturities is 5:4 q. Figs. 24-25 show the associated increase in output
and in‡ation while Fig. 26 shows the resulting decrease in the real interest rate due to this policy
intervention that increases maturity of central bank assets by 5:4 q compared to baseline maturity.
We see that output increases by 12 bp while in‡ation by 2:5 bp. For an independent central bank
the MEP is therefore less powerful than QE2. This is in contrast to our previous result under
coordinated policy which suggested that MEP was more e¤ective than QE2.

4.2.3    Capital losses from reneging on optimal policy

As in the model with a consolidated government, we now provide an alternative illustration of the
mechanisms behind the model with an independent central bank. The exercise shows the capital
losses on the balance sheet if the central bank were to renege on optimal policy. These balance
sheet losses would be costly for the central bank in the model as it would reduce remittances to
the treasury too sharply.
    We thus conduct the following thought experiment: suppose that once the liquidity trap is over,
the central bank reneges on the path for in‡ation and output dictated by optimal policy under
discretion and instead perfectly stabilizes them at zero. In such a situation, how large are capital
losses, or equivalently, how much lower are transfers to the treasury out of the zero lower bound
compared to if the government had continued to follow optimal policy? In particular, is this decline
in transfers more when the central bank’s balance sheet is bigger ? We show in Fig. 23 the change
in transfers to the treasury if the central bank were to renege on optimal policy at di¤erent balance
sheet sizes (the transfers here are scaled as a fraction of output). The decrease in transfers out of
zero lower bound is higher at a larger balance sheet of the central bank. Thus, increasing the size
of its balance sheet provides the central bank with more of an incentive to keep the real interest
rate low in future in order to avoid having to su¤er from costly capital losses.


5    Extensions
In the previous section with coordinated monetary and …scal policy, we focused on analyzing a
situation where the duration of government debt is reduced once-and-for all. That is, we have
studied comparative statics experiments with respect to : A natural question that arises in this
context is whether there is an incentive for the government to increase the duration of debt once
the economy has recovered and if by not considering that, we are overstating our results.41 Another
interesting extension to consider is whether the particular way we have modeled the term-structure,
  41
     Similar considerations would apply for the independent central bank model. We focus on the …rst model only
for brevity.



                                                      28
using a perpetuity bond that pays geometrically declining coupons, might be overly restrictive and
driving some of our results. While this was a very convenient modeling device, in particular while
calibrating the model to various average debt durations using a single parameter, it is natural to
explore a model with zero-coupon nominal government bonds with …nite maturity.

5.1      Time-varying optimal duration
To address the …rst question, we now extend our model to allow the government (again, we only
consider the consolidated government model here for brevity) to pick the duration of government
debt optimally, period by period. That is, now,                       is time-varying. In particular, the government
                                                                         j
issues a perpetuity bond in period t (Bt ) which pays                    t   dollars j + 1 periods later. Following very
similar manipulations as for the …xed duration case, the ‡ow budget constraint of the government
can be written as
                                                                                      1
                                St ( t )bt = (1 +         t 1 Wt ( t 1 )) bt 1    t       + (F     Tt )                             (31)
                                                                                                  j
where St ( t ) is the period-t price of the government bond that pays                             t   dollars j + 1 periods later
                                                                                                       j
while Wt (     t 1)   is the period-t price of the government bond that pays                           t 1   dollars j + 1 periods
                            Bt
later. Moreover, bt =       Pt :   Given these types of government bonds, the asset-pricing conditions then
take the form
                                                    uC (Ct+1 ; t+1 )       1
                               St ( t ) = Et                             t+1 (1   +       t St+1 ( t ))                             (32)
                                                      uC (Ct ; t )
                                                uC (Ct+1 ; t+1 )         1
                        Wt (   t 1)   = Et                             t+1 (1    +    t 1 Wt+1 ( t 1 ))        :                    (33)
                                                  uC (Ct ; t )
The rest of the model is the same as before.
      The government’s instruments are now it ; Tt ; and                  t.   Moreover, it follows from the expressions
above that in addition to bt            1;   now,   t 1   is also a state variable in the model. Then, we can write
the discretionary government’s problem recursively as

                                J (bt    1; t 1; t)    = max [U (:) + Et J (bt ;             t ; t+1 )]


subject to the three new constraints, (31)-(33), as well as the other private sector equilibrium
conditions that are common from the model in the previous section. Here, U (:) is the utility
function of the household in (1) and J(:) is the value function.42 The detailed formulation of
this maximization problem and the associated …rst-order necessary conditions are provided in the
appendix. We discuss below why we take this non-linear as opposed to a linear-quadratic approach.
      We proceed by computing the non-stochastic steady-state and then taking a …rst-order approx-
imation of the non-linear government optimality conditions as well as the non-linear private sector
equilibrium conditions around the steady-state. Of particular note is that a …rst-order approxima-

variables as given by (35), (34) takes the same form as (24), the linearized government budget
constraint when there was no time variation in duration. Thus, time-variation in duration does
not play a separate role in government debt dynamics up to …rst order.43 Therefore, if we had
taken a linear-quadratic approach, like before, then with the quadratic loss-function (26) and the
linearized private sector equilibrium conditions including (34), we would not be able to solve for
optimal debt duration dynamics at all.
      Given this appropriate rede…nition of the state variable, we can show that the (bounded)
solution of the model at positive interest rates takes the form
                                                                                     2           3        2           3

where,      v;   Yv ;   v;   and rv are functions of the model parameters. Here, for simplicity, we are only
focussing on solution of some of the endogenous model variables and do not consider shocks.
      Two results stand out: …rst, ^t follows a random-walk like behavior; second, ^t                                                       1   does not
a¤ect directly other variables such as output, in‡ation, and the real interest rate. This suggests
then that even if we allow the government to pick the duration optimally period by period, there
is no incentive for it to increase the duration of debt after the economy has recovered following a
liquidity trap episode. Therefore, the simple comparative static analysis that we focussed on in
the main part of the paper does not appear to be overstating our results. We show the transition
dynamics at positive interest rates with debt above steady-state in Fig. 27 below that highlights
the solution of this extended model. Given these two properties of the solution, it is now clear that
if we consider the su¢ cient state variable v^t 1 similar to ^bt 1 ; then this model with time-varying
duration would lead to similar results as our baseline model with a …xed duration.

5.2      Alternate model of maturity structure
We now consider a model where the government issues zero-coupon nominal bonds with …nite
maturity (again for brevity, we only consider the baseline model with a consolidated government).
Since the goal of this section is only qualitative, we consider a simple environment of one-period
(BtS ) and two-period BtL zero-coupon nominal bonds. Total bond supply then is given by Bt =

      This is also the case in the portfolio choice literature based on approximations, e.g. Berriel and Bhattarai (2013).

bonds is given by             = BtL =Bt : Thus, a reduction in                                     will imply that a larger fraction of government
debt is short-term. Again, similar to the notation above, we will denote the two bond prices by
(1 + it )   1   and St respectively.
    We can write down the ‡ow budget constraints of the consumer and the government respectively
as follows

Note here that in writing these ‡ow budget constraints, we already impose some arbitrage restric-
tions. For future purpose, using the market clearing condition we can write the government budget
constraint in real terms as

                                       (1     )                                                                                1

where bt =       Pt     and        t   =   Pt 1 :     The asset pricing conditions then are given by the two relationships

    Like before, we can now proceed with a log-linearization around a zero-in‡ation steady-state,
                                                                                                                                                                             T
where we will use                  for the steady-state ratio of taxes to market-value of debt                                                                  =     b(1    +   )   .
Then, (37) log-linearized gives
                                                                           S^t =         (^{t + Et^{t+1 )                                                                        (38)

which is an illustration of the expectation hypothesis in the model while (36) log-linearized gives

                        ^bt =          1^                                            1        2

                                                                   t   +                                   ^{t                           S^t            T^t :                    (39)
                                                                               (1            )+                      (1     )+

Further, using (38), one can then write (39) as

                ^bt =     1^                                               1     2

                                                       t   +                                      ^{t +                        (^{t + Et^{t+1 )                      T^t :
                                                                   (1           )+                        (1          )+

    To get some insights on how the maturity composition of debt a¤ects the roll-over incentives of
                                                                                                                                                Et^{t1

rate of mean reversion of debt. That is, suppose that bt is the only state variable (as is the case
in this simple model), which in the stationary Markov-perfect equilibrium solution with no shocks,
gives ^bt = bb^bt 1 and ^{t = b bt 1 . Then this rate is constant over time and equal to = bb < 1.
This rate is, in general equilibrium, an endogenous function of the model parameters (including ).
But for now, we will next take it as given to gain some insights using only the government budget
constraint, like we did before to illustrate the intuition of our mechanism. We can then re-write


                                                                                             31
the …nal log-linearized government budget constraint as

                                       ^bt =      1^
                                                   bt 1        1
                                                                   t   + ^{t     T^t                         (40)

                     1   +       (1+      1)
where    ( ; ; ) =                              < 1 for    <           1   and   > 0. (Note that in a stationary
                             1     +
equilibrium,   < 1). What we call the“roll-over incentive” in the paper is captured by how much
the current, short-term interest rate a¤ects debt/tax dynamics in the ‡ow budget constraint. That
is, we are interested in how, in (40),             is a¤ected by : In particular, for our mechanism to be
at work, we need      to decrease as            increases. Here, since we hold          constant in this thought-
experiment, we have directly that              depends negatively on

                                       @ ( ; ; )                      1
                                                 =                          < 0:
                                          @        ((              1) + 1)2

Thus, longer is the maturity composition of government debt, lower is the e¤ect on debt dynamics
of the current, short-term interest rate. This is the main mechanism behind the results in our
paper and it continues to be in operation in this alternate model of the term structure.


6    Conclusion
We present a theoretical model where open market operations that reduce the duration of out-
standing government debt or change the size/composition of the central bank’s balance sheet, so
called “quantitative easing,”are not neutral because they a¤ect the incentive structure of the cen-
tral bank. In particular, in a Markov-perfect equilibrium of our model, reducing the duration of
outstanding government debt or increasing the balance sheet size and duration of assets held by
an independent central bank, provides an incentive for the central bank to keep short-term interest
rates low in future in order to avoid balance sheet losses. When the economy is in a liquidity trap,
such a policy is thus e¤ective at generating in‡ationary expectations and lowering long-term in-
terest rates, which in turn, helps mitigate the de‡ation and negative output gap that would ensue
otherwise. In other words, quantitative easing is e¤ective because it provides a “signal” to the
private sector that the central bank will keep the short-term real interest rates low even when the
zero lower bound is no longer a constraint in future.
    In future work, it would be of interest to evaluate fully the quantitative importance of our model
mechanism in a medium-scale sticky price model, along the lines of Christiano, Eichenbaum, and
Evans (2005) and Smets and Wouters (2007). Computation of Markov-perfect Equilibrium under
coordinated monetary and …scal policy at the ZLB appears to not have been investigated for such
models in the literature. Moreover, as a methodological extension, it would be fruitful to allow for
time-varying duration of government debt to a¤ect real variables. To do so, it will be necessary to
take a higher order approximation of the equilibrium conditions and modify the guess-and-verify
algorithm to compute the Markov-perfect equilibrium accordingly. Needless to say one could also
do such higher order approximations to more accurately characterize the current model. We leave

8.1.1     The perpetuity nominal bond and the ‡ow budget constraint
Following Woodford (2001), the perpetuity issued in period t pays j dollars j + 1 periods later, for each j 0 and
                               1
some decay factor 0       <      : The implied steady-state duration of this bond is then (1     ) 1:
    Let the price of a newly issued bond in period t be St ( ) : Given the existence of the unique stochastic discount
factor Qt;t+j , we can write this price as
                                                           1

This is highly convenient since it implies that one needs to keep track, at each point in time, of the equilibrium price
of only one type of bond.
    Next, we derive an arbitrage condition between this perpetuity and a one-period bond. By simple expansion of
the in…nite sums above and manipulation of the terms, one gets
                                                                h               i
                                                                         O
                                      St ( ) = [Et Qt;t+1 ] + Et Qt;t+1 St+1 ( ) :

Since
                                                                           1
                                                     Et Qt;t+1 =
                                                                         1 + it
we get                                                         h               i

Substituting further for St+1 ( ) = St+1 ( ); we then derive

                                                      1
                                        St ( ) =           + Et [Qt;t+1 St+1 ( )] :                                          (42)
                                                    1 + it
    Finally, consider the ‡ow budget constraint of the government

                        BtS + St ( )Bt = (1 + it         S
                                                    1 ) Bt 1   +      0
                                                                          + StO ( ) Bt              1   + Pt (Ft    Tt ) :

                             O
This can be simpli…ed using St+1 ( ) = St+1 ( ) to

                         BtS + St ( )Bt = (1 + it         S
                                                     1 ) Bt 1   + (1 + St ( )) Bt               1   + Pt (Ft       Tt ) :

This is the form in which we write down the ‡ow budget constraint of the household and the government in the main
text.

8.1.2     Functional forms

                                                   S T = s1 (T               T )2

where we only consider a discount factor shock . Note that = 1 in steady-state and that in steady state, we scale
hours such that Y = 1 as well. This implies that we can derive

                                                                  1             1+

8.2     E¢ cient equilibrium
As benchmark, we …rst derive the e¢ cient allocation.
    Using Gt = Ft s(Tt T ) = F s(Tt T ); the social planner’s problem can be written as

                                     max u (Ct ; t ) + g (F           s(Tt       T ))     v~ (Yt )

st
                                                          Yt = Ct + F:

     Formulate the Lagrangian

                                     Lt = u (Ct ; t ) + g (F          s(Tt         T ))   v~ (Yt )
                                        +   1t   (Yt      Ct     F)

     FOCs (where all the derivatives are to be equated to zero)

                                                 @Lt
                                                     = v~Y + 1t
                                                 @Yt
                                                 @Lt
                                                     = uC + 1t [ 1]
                                                 @Ct
                                                 @Lt
                                                     = gG s0 (Tt T )
                                                 @Tt
     Eliminating the Lagrange multiplier gives
                                                               uC = v~Y

                                                  gG        s0 (Tt    T ) = 0:

Note that we make the following functional form assumptions on the tax collection cost

                                                       s(0) = 0; s0 (0) = 0:

Thus, when taxes are at steady state, that is, Tt = T; then s(Tt                T ) = s0 (Tt         T ) = 0: But note that we will allow
     00
for s (0) > 0:



                                                                 47
    E¢ cient allocation thus requires
                                                                                    uC = v~Y

                                                                                    Tt = T:

    In steady state, without aggregate shocks, we have

                                                                               Y =C +F

                                                                                    uC = v~Y

                                                                                    Tt = T:

8.3.2       Steady-state
A Markov-perfect steady-state is non-trivial to characterize because generally, we need to take derivatives of an
unknown function, as is clear from the FOCs. Here, we will rely on the fact that given an appropriate production
subsidy, the Markov-perfect steady-state will be the same as the e¢ cient steady-state derived above.
    First, note that this requires no resource loss from price-adjustment costs, which in turn requires

                                                                                                          d( ) = 0

and thereby ensures
                                                                                                      Y =C +F

This means that we need
                                                                                                                = 1:

Also, this implies
                                                                                                          d0 ( ) = 0:

Next, note from the Phillips curve that this means, we need

                                                                                        "        1
                                                                                                     (1 + s) uC                v~y = 0:
                                                                                            "

                                                                                                                49
Now, since the e¢ cient steady-state has uC = v~Y ; the production subsidy then has to satisfy

                                                  "        1
                                                               (1 + s) = 1:
                                                       "
    We will be looking at a steady-state with positive interest rates

                                                                          1
                                                           1+i=

which means that
                                                                1   =0

and that from the FOC wrt it we have
                                                                2   = 0:
                                                           0
    Also, given that taxes are at steady-state, gG ( s (Tt               T )) = 0; from the FOC wrt Tt

                                                                1   = 0:

Given this, in turn, we have from the FOC wrt St

                                                                3   = 0:

Then, given that d0 = 0 in steady-state and d00 is not, and since                  1   = 0; it gives from the FOC wrt to   t


                                                                4   = 0:

    Note that this is highly convenient since these Lagrange multipliers being zero implies

                                                   1   =        2   =     3   = 0:

Thus, we do not need to worry about the derivatives of the unknown functions.
   This proposed steady-state is consistent with other FOCs. For example, the FOC wrt Yt is now given by

                                                               5    = v~Y

and that the FOC wrt Ct is given by
                                                           uC =           5

which implies
                                                           v~Y = uC :

Finally, FOC wrt bt implies
                                                                                        1
                                          Jb =    1            (1 + S( ))                   =0

which is also consistent with the conjectured guess.
    Finally, the guess of the steady-state is also consistent with the other model equilibrium conditions, with S( )
given by
                                                 S( ) = [(1 + S( ))]

that is
                                                   S( ) =                      :
                                                                     1
Then b and F are linked by
                                          S( )b = (1 + S( )) b + (F                         T)

that is
                                                                      1
                                                 T =F +                         b:
                                                                     1


                                                                   50
8.3.3         First-order approximation
We now take a log-linear approximation of the Markov perfect FOCs and the private sector equilibrium conditions
around the steady-state above. Also, lets normalize the scale of the economy (with appropriate scaling of hours) so
that Y = 1: This implies C = 1 F: Also the shock t takes a value of 1 in steady-state.

Private sector equilibrium conditions We …rst start with the private sector equilibrium conditions.
We denote variables that are in log-deviations from their respective steady-states by hats, except for ^{t :We denote
variables in steady-state by bars.

8.4       Linear-quadratic approach
8.4.1      Linear approximation of equilibrium conditions
We approximate around an e¢ cient non-stochastic steady-state where        = 1: For simplicity, from here on we will
assume that the only shock that hits the economy is a discount factor shock given by . Standard manipulations
that are prevalent in the literature, for example in Woodford (2003), and as shown above in the Markov perfect

8.4.2      Quadratic approximation of household utility
For household utility, we need to approximate the following three components

                                              u (Yt       F       d(       t ); t ) ;        g (F             S(Tt                 T ); t ) ; v (Yt ; t ) :

Standard manipulations that are prevalent in the literature, for example in Woodford (2003), give as a second-order
approximation to household utility

the scaling that Y = 1 and Y = C + F = 1; to get

    We now show some properties of b analytically. First, note that we will be restricting to stationary solutions,
that is one where j bb j< 1: Manipulations of (43)-(48) above lead to the following closed-form expression for b


                                                                                                                         (1            bb )
                b   =        T                                                                                                                                                                                      1

                            lV
                                                                                                    1
                                1       1                             1       bS
        where       = [                     (1          )+                ]            T                :
                                                                              T

Since j bb j< 1; it is clear that b > 0 for all < 1: What happens when > 1? Numerically, we have found that often
  b > 0 still, but sometimes in fact it can hit zero (and then actually go negative if     is increased further). It is in
fact possible to pin-down analytically when b = 0: Note that from (46), if b = 0; then Yb = 0: This then implies
that for this to be supported as a solution for all possible values of Tb , from (43), it must be the case that

                                                                                        1                               1              1
                                                                               [            (1                  )            +             ]=0

which in turn implies that
                                                                                                                              1
                                                                                                     =1+                               :
                                                                                                                                                                                                   1
In this knife-edge case, note that one needs > 1: Moreover, since the upper bound on                                                                                                     is            ; one needs to ensure
that
                                               1        1
                                           1+      <      or     <1     :

This is a fairly restrictive parameterization (not ful…lled in our baseline, for example). Still, it is instructive to note
that in this case of when b does reach 0; then it is indeed possible to show analytically that b declines as duration
                                                      1                              1
is increased while comparing = 0 with = 1 +                or = 1 with = 1 +            .

For now, we are not analyzing the e¤ects of the shock, and hence not carrying around r ; Yr ; Sr ; ir ; br ; and Tr since
our key area of interest at this state is not the e¤ect of the shock at positive interest rates. Instead, we will start
focusing on the shock once the zero bound becomes binding.

which along with (22)-(25) de…ne the equilibrium in the approximated economy. The …nal step to computing the
solution is then to plug in the conjectured solution and to match coe¢ cients on various variables in (22)-(25), (51),
and (52), along with the requirement that expectation are rational, to determine b ; Yb ; Sb ; ib ; bb ; and Tb : The details
of this step are in the appendix.
     The most important relationships emerging from our analysis are captured by (51) and (52). (51) is the so
called “targeting rule” of our model. That represents the equilibrium (static) relationship among the three target
variables t ; Y^t ; and T^t that emerges from the optimization problem of the government. (51) thus captures how
target variables are related in equilibrium as governed both by the weights they are assigned in the loss function
(     and T ) as well as the trade-o¤s among them as given by the private sector equilibrium conditions ( 1 and
[   1
      (1     ) 1+       1 1
                         ] ): Note in particular that      1
                                                             represents the trade-o¤ between t and Y^t as given by (23)
while [    1
             (1    )   1
                         +    ] represents the trade-o¤ between t and Y^t vs. T^t as given by the combination of (22),
                             1 1

(23), and (24).
     (52) is another optimality condition characterizing the Markov-perfect equilibrium and represents the “tax-
smoothing objective” of the government. In contrast to similar expressions following the work of Barro (1979),
which would lead to taxes being a martingale, output appears in (52) because of sticky-prices, which makes output
endogenous. Finally, because of the dynamic nature of (52), as opposed to (51), the unknown coe¢ cients that are
critical for expectations of variables, b ; Yb ; and Sb ; appear in (52). As we shall see –and this is again in contrast to



                                                                                              59
the classic tax smoothing result in which debt is a random walk – the government will in general have an incentive
to pay down public debt if it is above steady-state due to strategic reasons.


8.6.1         Polar cases on price rigidities
To clarify what is going on in the model, we …rst …nd it helpful to consider two special cases.

a) Fully ‡exible prices When prices are fully ‡exible, then as is well-known, monetary policy cannot control
the (ex-ante) real interest rate r^t : Then, the only way monetary policy can a¤ect the economy is through surprise
in‡ation as debt is nominal. In fact there is a well-known literature that addresses the issue of how the duration of
nominal debt in a ‡exible price environment a¤ects allocations under time consistent optimal monetary policy. For
example, Calvo and Guidotti (1990 and 1992) address optimal maturity of nominal government debt in a ‡exible
price environment while Sims (2013) explores how the response of in‡ation to …scal shocks depends on the maturity of
government debt under optimal monetary policy. We conduct a complementary exercise here and want to characterize
how in‡ation incentives depend on the duration of debt under optimal monetary and …scal policy under discretion.
Thus, we are interested in how b depends on duration of debt.
     For this exercise, we can think of this special case of fully ‡exible prices as ! 1: Note however, that from
the two optimality conditions (51) and (52), while under ‡exible prices Tb = 0; there is indeterminacy in terms of
in‡ation and nominal interest rate dynamics.4 4 This is a well-known result in monetary economics under discretion
in a ‡exible price environment, and comes about because the government cannot a¤ect output and taxes can be put
to zero with various combinations of in‡ation and interest rate choices. To show our result on the role of the duration
of debt, we follow the literature such as Calvo and Guidotti (1990 and 1992) and Sims (2013) and include a ( very
small) aggregate social cost of in‡ation that is independent of the level of price stickiness. Then, the objective of the
government under ‡exible prices will be given by
                                                        h 0             i
                                                  Ut =       2
                                                             t + T Tt
                                                                     ^2

          0                                                                                   0
where      parameterizes the cost of in‡ation that is independent of sticky prices. Using       = 0:001 and the rest of
the parameter values from Table 1, Fig A1 shows how b depends on duration of debt (quarters). We see that with
shorter duration, there is more of an incentive to use current in‡ation. The intuition for this result is that from (24),
we see that everything else the same, when (and thereby, duration) decreases, then there will be a greater period by
period incentive to increase S^t ; that is, keep nominal interest rates low to manage the debt burden. This, however,
will increase current in‡ation further in equilibrium according to our result. As a consequence –and perhaps a little
counterintuitively – equilibrium nominal interest rate will generally increase as well with lower duration since the
real rate is exogenously given under ‡exible prices. In particular, observe that ^{t = Et t+1 (since Y^t = 0 and there

b) Fully rigid prices Next we can consider the other extreme case: that of fully rigid prices. In this case,
in‡ation is zero in equilibrium and hence b = 0: Then, one can directly consider the e¤ects on the ex-ante real
interest rate by analyzing the e¤ect on the nominal interest rate since rb = ib         b bb = ib . Thus, we are interested

in how ib depends on the duration of debt. Using the parameters from Table 1, Fig A2 shows how ib depends on
duration of debt (quarters). We see that with shorter duration, there is more of an incentive to keep the nominal
interest rate lower. The intuition for this result is again that from (24), when (and thereby, duration) decreases,
then there will be more of an incentive to increase S^t ; that is keep interest rates low, to manage the debt burden.

    We now move to discussing in detail properties of the solution for the partially rigid price cases that underlies
our baseline calibration.


8.6.2     Real interest rate incentives and duration of outstanding debt
How does the duration of debt a¤ect the real interest rate incentives of the central bank for the partially rigid cases
that underlies our baseline calibration? The e¤ect on the real interest rate of lower duration is at the heart of the
matter because what in‡uences output is eventually the real interest rate and the aim in a zero lower bound situation
is precisely to be able to decrease the short-term real interest rate (today and in future) even when the current
short-term nominal interest rate is stuck at zero. That is, we are interested in the properties of

                                      r^t = ^{t   Et   t+1   = (ib         ^
                                                                      b bb ) bt 1   = rb^bt   1


where r^t is the short-term real interest rate. This is important because in a liquidity trap situation, as is well-known,
decreasing future real interest rate is key to mitigating negative e¤ects on output, and so, if rb depends negatively
on duration, then we are able to provide a theoretical rationale for quantitative easing actions by the government.
     Having established the results in the two special cases above, we now move on to the main mechanism in our
paper in the intermediate and quantitatively relevant case of partially rigid prices. Fig A3 shows how rb depends
on duration of debt (quarters). When the duration of debt in the hands of the public is shorter, it unambiguously
provides an incentive to the government to keep the short-term real interest rate lower in future. The intuition again
is that by doing so, it reduces the cost of rolling over the debt period by period. That is, if the debt is short-term,
then current real short rates will more directly a¤ect the cost of rolling the debt over period by period, while the
cost of rolling over long-term debt is not a¤ected in the same way period by period.

8.6.3    In‡ation incentives and duration of outstanding debt
While the dependence of real interest rate incentive of the government on the duration of debt is the main mechanism
of our paper, given the attention in‡ation incentives receive in the literature, we now study how b varies with the
duration of outstanding government debt?4 5 Moreover, it helps us emphasize a point that just focusing on in‡ation
incentives might not be su¢ cient to understand the nature of optimal monetary and …scal policy in a liquidity trap
situation.
    While an analytical expression for b is available in the appendix and it is possible to show that b > 0 for
all < 1, a full analytical characterization of the comparative statics with respect to the duration of debt is not
available and so we rely on numerical results. Fig A4 below shows how b depends on duration of debt (quarters) at
di¤erent levels of : As expected, b is positive at all durations in the …gure.4 6 More importantly, note that that at
our baseline parameterization of = 0:02; b does decrease with duration over a wide range of maturity.4 7 At the
same time, however, there is a hump-shaped behavior, with b increasing when duration is increased at very short
durations.
  45
     For some recent discussion and analysis of how in‡ation dynamics in sticky-price models could depend on duration
of government debt, see Sims (2011).
  46
     Again, it is possible to show analytically that for all < 1; b > 0: In a very similar model but one with no
steady-state debt, Eggertsson (2006) proved that b > 0 for = 0 (that is, for one period debt).
  47
     Some limited analytical results on the properties of b with respect to are available in the appendix. For
example, it can be shown that b is positive for all < 1 and that when = 1 + 1            (and thus, > 1); b = 0: In
this sense, for a speci…c case, one can show that b is declining in by comparing some extreme cases (such as
  = 0 with = 1 + 1 ): Please see the appendix for details. Note also here that the upper bound on is            1

     What drives this result? First, note from (24) that everything else the same, when (and thereby, duration)
decreases, then there will be an incentive to decrease S^t ; that is keep interest rates low to manage the debt burden.
This will then increase in‡ation in equilibrium. At the same time however, the government’s incentives on in‡ation
are not fully/only captured by this reasoning. This is because what ultimately matters for the cost of debt is the
real interest rate, which because of sticky prices, is endogenous and under the control of the central bank, and which
we have seen before robustly depends negatively on the duration of debt. Therefore, to understand the overall e¤ect
on the government’s in‡ation incentives, it is critical to analyze the targeting rule, as discussed above and given by
(51). Here, the term [ 1 (1       ) 1+        1
                                                ] plays a key role as it captures the trade-o¤ between t and Y^t vs. T^t
                     1
. Note …rst that       here simply captures the role of surprise in‡ation in reducing the debt burden as government
                                                                                                            1
debt is nominal. This term would be present even when prices are completely ‡exible. The term                 (1    ) 1
however, appears because of sticky prices. This re‡ects how the real interest rate is a¤ected by manipulation of the
nominal interest rate and how it in turn a¤ects output.
                                          1     1
     Thus, in situations where either       ;     , or (1   ) is high, this term can dominate and it can be the case that
                                                                                                                      1
decreasing the duration (or decreasing ) actually leads to a lower b : This means, for example, that when               is
low (or when prices are more ‡exible), the hump-shaped behavior of b gets restricted to very short maturities only
as the channel coming from sticky-prices is not that in‡uential. We in fact showed this above in the case of fully
‡exible prices, where in‡ation response depends negatively throughout on duration of debt.


8.6.4     Debt dynamics and duration of outstanding debt
While the primary focus so far is on properties of rb as it determines the real interest rate incentives of the central bank,
it is also interesting to consider the properties of bb ; the parameter governing the persistence of government debt. This
exercise is interesting in its own right, but more importantly, it is also worth exploring because as explained before,
what is critical is the behavior of the real interest rate, and that gets a¤ected by bb as Et t+1 = b^bt = b bb^bt 1 :
Unlike for b ; it is not possible to show a tractable analytical solution (or any property) for bb as it is generally a
root of a fourth-order polynomial equation. We thus rely fully on numerical solutions.
      Fig. A5 shows how bb depends on duration of debt. It is clear that the persistence of debt increases monotonically




                                                             64
as the duration increases.4 8 In fact, for a high enough duration, debt dynamics approach that of a random walk
(bb = 1), as in the analysis of Barro (1979). The persistence of debt increases with duration mainly because the
response of the short-term real interest rate decreases, as we discussed above. Some of this e¤ect is re‡ected in
the response of in‡ation decreasing as also discussed above. Thus, the existence of long-term nominal debt has an
important impact on the dynamics of debt under optimal policy under discretion.

8.7    Computation at ZLB
 In our experiment the debt is kept …xed at the zero lower bound at bL . Moreover, at the zero lower bound,

^{t = 1       . Given the speci…c assumptions on the two-state Markov shock process, the equilibrium is described by
 the system of equations

                           Y^t =                 b (1       )^bt    rte         L   + ^{t + (1    )^bt Yb + YL ;

                           ^t =         b (1            )^bt +     L      + Yt ;
                                             1

  48
    There is thus, no hump-shaped pattern, unlike for in‡ation. The reason is that what matters directly for
persistence of debt is the real interest rate and there is no hump-shaped pattern there as we show later. Note also
that for one-period debt, often bb is negative (even here, recall that b is still positive). A negative bb is not very
interesting empirically as it implies oscillatory behavior of debt.
