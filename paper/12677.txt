                                           ABSTRACT

We present evidence on the differences in the intensity with which ten major technologies are used
in 185 countries across the world. We do so by calculating how many years ago these technologies
were used in the U.S. at the same intensity as they are used in the countries in our sample. We denote
these time lags as technology usage lags and compare them with lags in real GDP per capita. We find
that (i) technology usage lags are large, often comparable to lags in real GDP per capita, (ii) usage
lags are highly correlated with lags in per-capita income, and (iii) usage lags are highly correlated
across technologies. The productivity differentials between the state of the art technologies that we
consider and the ones they replace combined with the usage lags that we document, lead us to infer
that technology usage disparities might account for a large part of cross-country TFP differentials.

How large are cross-country differences in technology? Are they comparable to cross-country

differences in income per capita?

       A substantial literature1 has tried to answer these two questions by constructing indirect measures

of technology based on the Solow residual. This approach, however, suffers from the problem that the

Solow residual captures not only differences in technology, but also variation in capacity utilization

(Basu, 1995), labor hoarding (Burnside et al., 1995), and the inefficiencies of the economy (Weil, 2005,

ch.10).

       Concerning the second question, Weil (2005, Ch. 15) argues that technology adoption lags are most

likely much smaller than per-capita income lags; if technology were responsible for the cross-country

variation in income per capita and grew at an annual rate of 2 percent a year,2 India would currently be

using technologies that the U.S. employed 100 years ago. This is obviously not the case, since producers

in India also use recent technologies such as computers and cell phones.

       Weil correctly highlights the importance of using direct measures of technology to answer the

questions that motivate this paper. However, his argument ignores the importance of cross-country

variation in the intensity of adoption of new technologies.

       That is, most discussions of technology adoption differentials, including Weil’s, focus on whether

or not, or what fraction of users, have adopted a technology. This is the extensive margin of adoption.

This ignores, however, it what intensity the adopters use the technology, i.e. the intensive margin.




1   Klenow and Rodríguez-Clare (1997), Hall and Jones (1999), and Benhabib and Spiegel (2005) among others.
2   This is the rate necessary to sustain the growth rate in labor productivity observed during the last 120 years in the U.S.



                                                                       -2-
Hence, it is not only relevant whether computers and cell phones are being used in India, but also how

many of them are used.

       An older literature initiated by Griliches (1957) and Mansfield (1961) directly measures technology

adoption by considering the fraction of the potential adopters using a technology. Calculating this type

of measure requires micro-level data at the producer level which is not available for a broad sample of

countries and technologies.3 Just like Weil’s argument, this approach also does not capture the intensity

with which each adopter uses the technology. As shown by Clark (1988), this margin may be critical to

explain cross-country differences in labor productivity.

       In this paper, we explore the questions posed above by constructing per-capita usage intensity

measures of technology, including kWh of annual electricity production per capita and personal

computers per capita. These measures include both the extensive and the intensive margins of

technology adoption. Furthermore, their construction only requires aggregate data that is available for a

wide sample of countries and technologies.

       We consider ten technologies that all share three properties. They are (i) technologies with

important roles in production, that, at the point in time that for which we consider them, (ii) represent

the cutting edge in the production of a particular good or service, and (iii) for which we have data for a

wide range of countries.4

       Rather than analyzing the level of the technology usage measures, we analyze time lags with respect

to the U.S. The usage lag of technology x in country c at year t is defined as the answer to the following

question: How many years before year t did the United States last have a usage intensity of technology x

that country c has in year t?


3   The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (1996) has an informative description of the historical diffusion patterns of consumer technologies
     in the U.S.
4   The technologies we consider are the subset of those introduced in Comin, Hobijn, and Rovito (2006).



                                                                    -3-
       For example, the amount of kWh of electricity produced in Uruguay in 1990 was last observed in

the United States in 1949. Thus, the electricity usage lag in Uruguay in 1990 is 41 years. Similarly, the

number of personal computers per capita in Spain in 2002 was comparable to that in the United States

in 1989. Hence, the 2002 PC usage lag of Spain is 13 years.

       Usage lags make measures of technology adoption comparable across technologies and also with

income per capita. In addition, by considering the intensive margin of adoption, they enable us to shed

light on Weil’s claim.

       Our analysis uncovers three main facts: (i) Technology usage lags are large, often comparable to lags

in real GDP per capita; (ii) usage lags are highly correlated across countries with lags in per-capita

income, and (iii) usage lags are highly correlated across technologies.



                                                  2. The concept of time lags

We further explain the concept of time lags with an additional example. Consider Figure 1. It plots real

GDP per capita as a fraction of the 2003 U.S. level (in log-scale) for the U.S. as well as China, France,

Japan, and Mexico. Using this figure we can answer the following question: how many years before the

year 2000 did the United States last have the real GDP per capita that China had in 2000?

       When we look at Figure 1, we see that the U.S. last passed China’s 2000 level of GDP per capita in

1894, 106 years before 2000. Similarly, in 2000 the U.S. led Mexico by 60 years and France and Japan by

14. 5

       More formally, let Xj,t be the usage level of a given technology in country j at time t. We compare

this observation with the historical time series for the United States. Let this series be given by {XUS,s}

where s indexes the observations. These are not necessarily consecutive observations because of


5   Jovanovic (2006b) also considers this type of time lags in a theoretical model of endogenous growth and technology adoption.



                                                                    -4-
missing data in the U.S. historical time series. Let S denote the set of observations available in the

historical time series for the United States.

    We define the following two observations in the time series for the U.S. The first is the last time the

U.S. passed level Xj,t. That is

                              s = arg min{s X US ,s ' ≥ X j ,t for all s '∈ S and s ' ≥ s}               (1)
                                       s∈S

The second is the last time the U.S. recorded a technology usage level lower than Xj,t. That is

                                             s = arg max{s X US ,s ≤ X j ,t }                            (2)
                                                    s∈S

Because of these definitions, we know that observation s is the one after observation s in the U.S.

historical time series.

    We impute the time that the U.S. last had the technology usage level Xj,t, say τ, by linear

interpolation. That is, we calculate

                                         ⎛ X     −X         ⎞     ⎛ X        −X        ⎞
                                  τ = ⎜⎜ t , j       US ,s
                                                             ⎟ s + ⎜ US ,s
                                                             ⎟ ⎜X
                                                                                 t, j
                                                                                        ⎟s
                                                                                        ⎟
                                                                                                         (3)
                                       ⎝ X US , s − X US , s ⎠ ⎝     US , s − X US  , s ⎠
The technology usage lag between the U.S. and country j at time t is then given by t-τ.

    The analysis of time lags has two major advantages over that of disparities in technology usage

levels across countries.

    First, time lags are independent of the units of measurement of the variables considered. This

flexibility is important when one aims to consider a broad range of statistics and compare them across

countries and technologies, as we do for measures of technology usage here.

    Second, the calculation of these lags does not require a very long time series for countries other

than the U.S. It only requires a long historical time series for the U.S.




                                                           -5-
       A couple of practical details are relevant for the calculation of the time lags. Sometimes, the U.S.

historical time series does not go back so far as to include the invention date of the technology. We

initialize the U.S. historical time series by setting XUS,invention year=0. The invention years that we use are

described in Appendix A. GDP, however, does not have an invention date. For GDP we use

Maddison’s (2007) historical time series of U.S. GDP per capita, which goes back to 1600.

       For some countries, we find right-truncated lags in GDP per capita because they have GDP per

capita levels lower than that of the U.S. in 1600. We have this problem for only a very limited number

of Sub-Saharan African countries, including Guinea-Bissau and Botswana in 1950 and Zaire in 1990

and 2000. We also find some cases in which our technology usage lags are censored because the U.S.

never achieves the level Xj,t. In this case the U.S. is not the technological leader.6

       The number of censored technology usage lags in our sample is so small, though, that these

censored observations do not affect the gist of our results.



                                                  3. Real GDP per capita lags

                                                            Size of real GDP lags

Differences in standards of living across the world are very large. For example, U.S. real GDP per

capita in 2000 was almost 19 times higher than the average over the continent of Africa. For the

poorest country in the world, which in 2000 was Zaire, this ratio is almost 130! By comparison, U.S.

real GDP per capita in 2000 was 23 times higher than it was in 1820.

       Our time lag measures allow us to translate these differences across countries into years behind the

United States. Figure 2 shows the time lags in real GDP per capita for all countries in the world in


6   This is particularly relevant for our results for cell phones in 2002, as can be seen from the many zero lags depicted in Figure 7. These
     lags are zero because 2002 is the last year for which we have data for the U.S, and the U.S. is not the global leader in cell phone
     adoption.



                                                                      -6-
2000. As can be seen from the figure, most of the world population is living in countries with real GDP

per capita levels that have not been observed in the United States in the post World War II era.

Moreover, most of Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as Afghanistan and Mongolia, have per-capita income

levels that have not been observed in the United States since 1820.

                                           Catch-up in GDP lags

After documenting the magnitude of the per-capita income lags, it is natural to explore their dynamics.

One way to do this is by studying the relationship between the change in the per-capita GDP lag

between 1950 and 2000 and the initial lag in 1950. Figure 3 shows this relationship.

    As can be seen from the figure, the countries that started off lagging the U.S. by the most years

tended to have a bigger decrease (negative change) in their lag, suggesting that, on average, they caught

up with the U.S. more quickly than the countries that were relatively richer in 1950.

    For example, Ireland’s GDP per capita lag was 56 years in 1950 and 13 years in 2000. Thus, its

change was -43 years. This suggests that over the period 1950 through 2000, Ireland’s GDP per capita

increased by the same amount as the U.S.’s GDP per capita over the period 1894 through 1987. Some

additional countries with big leaps forward during the last five decades of the last century include

Botswana, from more than 350 to 100 years; China, from 316 to 106 years; South Korea, from 183 to

34 years; and Taiwan, from 172 to 24 years.

    Not all countries saw their GDP lags decrease over the 1950 to 2000 period. Some countries,

including some of the poorer nations, like Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Ecuador, saw their distance

from the U.S. increase by two decades or more. Argentina is also an interesting case, with its GDP lag

relative to the U.S. increasing from 16 years in 1950 to 59 years in 2000.

    To formalize this analysis, we estimate a regression of the 1950-2000 change in the real GDP lag of

a country on its initial 1950 real GDP lag for a sample of 138 countries. The regression results are



                                                   -7-
                ∆GDP lag i,1950-2000 = 16.61− 0.25 GDP lag i,1950 , R 2 = 0.12, i = 1,K,138
                                      (9.95 )   (0.06 )

and show that the GDP lags became significantly smaller for countries that started off more years

behind the U.S. than for countries that started closer. The initial (1950) GDP lags explain 12% of the

cross-country variation in the reduction in GDP lags relative to the U.S. over the second half of the 20th

century.

    This result may seem to be in sharp contrast with standard cross-country convergence analyses that

do not find unconditional convergence in per-capita income, such as Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992).

The reason for this discrepancy is that we are asking a different question than the convergence

literature.

    The convergence literature considers whether countries that had relatively low per-capita GDP

levels in 1950 grew faster than countries with higher levels of per-capita GDP. Our convergence

analysis considers whether countries with relatively low per-capita GDP levels in 1950 grew faster in

the 1950-2000 period than the U.S. did in the 50 years after it had the same per-capita GDP level as the

countries in 1950.

    This somewhat subtle, but important, difference means that our regression does not compare the

countries over the same period in history but, instead, compares the countries at similar points in their

per-capita GDP paths. This analysis offers a new perspective on the development process that allows

us to understand whether it takes longer, on average, for currently developing economies to become

developed and enjoy a sustained growth rate in per-capita income than that it took for the U.S. during

its development period.

    Hence, the convergence regression presented here compares the growth patterns of economies at a

similar development stage rather than during a similar time period. Our analysis from this point of




                                                          -8-
view offers an illuminating conclusion: on average, it takes less time for currently developing economies

to achieve development than that it took for the U.S.

       This different perspective on the convergence question allows us to reconsider the predictions of

different growth models. In particular, existence of the type of catch-up in real GDP lags documented

here and the absence of unconditional convergence in conventional growth regressions suggest that real

GDP dynamics are more consistent with the model presented in Lucas (2000) than with the dynamics

implied by the neoclassical growth model, on which Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992) base their analysis.

       Lucas (2000) provides a model, based on Tamura (1996), of take off where countries are in

stagnation and there is a random variable that determines when each country will start growing. When

they start growing, they catch up with the countries that started the growth process earlier.

                                                  From GDP lags to technology usage lags

There is an extensive literature that tries to find the main sources of the cross-country differences in

per-capita GDP levels. This literature is mainly based on the assumption that GDP is produced with

two factors of production, namely capital and labor, and that these production factors are used with a

particular level of efficiency, called total factor productivity (TFP), that varies across countries. Much of

the evidence, as in Lucas (1990), Klenow and Rodríguez-Clare (1997), and Hall and Jones (1999),

suggests that the majority of per-capita GDP differences come from differences in TFP, rather than

from differences in the capital per worker used in production.

       What causes cross-country disparities in TFP levels is a controversial topic in economics.7 One way

of thinking of TFP differentials is to decompose them into two parts. The first part consists of the

cross-country differential in TFP levels common to all technologies that are in use. The second part



7   See Prescott (1997) for a discussion of why a theory that explains such differences is crucial to explain cross-country differences in per-
     capita income levels.



                                                                      -9-
reflects the cross-country TFP differentials due to differences in the intensity of use of cutting-edge

technologies that embody a higher level of productivity than older technologies.

    This second source of TFP differentials may reflect cross-country differences in adoption costs that

prevent modern technologies from being used, as in Parente and Prescott (1994,1999) and Chari and

Hopenhayn (1991), or from differences in the costs of implementing technologies that result in newer

technologies being used below their potential productivity level, as in Jovanovic (2006b) and Comin

and Hobijn (2007).

    In what follows, we present evidence that indicates that a significant part of cross-country

differentials in TFP and per-capita income is driven by cross-country differences in the intensity of

adoption of new technologies.



                                       4. Technology usage lags

For our analysis of technology usage lags we use data on ten technologies from the Cross-country

Historical Adoption of Technology (CHAT) data set introduced in Comin, Hobijn, and Rovito (2006).

The technologies we consider are all the technologies that satisfy the following three criteria. First, they

are mainly production technologies. Second, at the point in time for which we perform our analysis,

they are cutting-edge technologies in that they are much more productive than other existing

technologies that might be used to produce a similar good or service. Third, for the reference year for

which we do our analysis, data on technology usage is available for a large sample of countries (at least

95). This requirement results in more meaningful global cross-country comparisons.

    The ten technologies can be classified in five broad categories (technologies in parentheses): (i)

electricity (electricity production), (ii) information technologies (internet and PCs), (iii) communication

technologies (telephones and cell phones), (iv) transportation technologies (cars, trucks, plane



                                                   - 10 -
passengers transport, and plane cargo transport), and (v) agricultural technologies (tractors). Appendix

A contains a description of these technologies, our data sources, the year in which we measure the

technology, and the invention dates we use for the calculation of the usage lags. Just as for real GDP,

we measure the intensity of usage of these technologies in per-capita terms.

   All of these technologies satisfy the three criteria described above and, in particular, the use of each

of them is associated with significant increases in productivity. Comin and Hobijn (2005) document the

large productivity gains associated with the use of PCs, cell phones, telephones, cars, trucks, and planes.

These productivity increments range from 1/3 for cell phones to many orders of magnitude for PCs.

   The use of electricity as a power source led to significant increases in productivity. David (1990)

estimates that “approximately half of the 5 percentage point acceleration recorded in the aggregate TFP

growth rate of the U.S. manufacturing sector during 1919-29 (compared with 1909-19) is accounted for

… by the growth in manufacturing secondary electric motor capacity during that decade.”

   Many growth accounting studies, including Oliner and Sichel (2000), suggest that information

technology, in large part driven by the internet, has led to surge in U.S. productivity growth in the

second half of the 1990s.

   For tractors, Easter, Abel, and Norton (1977) estimate the marginal product of various factors of

production using the value of wheat produced and the extent to which each input was used in 73

Indian districts. During the period 1967-69 they find that the marginal product of tractors is over 1000

times larger than the marginal product of work animals and over 2200 times larger than the marginal

product of labor.

   Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7 depict the technology usage lags of the ten technologies in our sample versus

those of real GDP per capita. Figure 4 compares the 1970 electricity, tractors, and telephone usage lags

with the 1970 real GDP per capita lags. Figures 5 and 6 do the same for the 1990 usage lags in



                                                  - 11 -
transportation technologies. Figure 7 shows the 2002 cell phone, PCs, and internet usage lags plotted

against the 2000 real GDP per capita lags.

       The first conclusion from these figures is the following.

                               Conclusion 1: Cross-country disparities in technology usage lags are very large

    As can be seen from Figure 4, for countries with real GDP per capita lags smaller than 50 years in

1970, technology usage lags in electricity, tractors8, and telephones were generally at least as high as

GDP lags. Moreover, countries with 1970 real GDP per capita levels comparable to those in the pre-

World War I U.S. also largely have pre-World War I levels of technology usage in electricity and road

transportation.

       To put this in perspective, the countries that lagged the U.S. by more than 50 years in electricity

production in 1970 are countries where electricity production in 1970 was not enough to light one 60-

watt light bulb per person continuously.

       The results for road transportation, reported in Figure 5, are similar. In 1990, 70 out of the 112

countries for which we have data had levels of car usage comparable to or lower than those in the U.S.

in 1908 (technology usage lag of 82). It was in 1908 that Henry Ford sold his first Model T, which is

generally considered the car that “put America on wheels”. For trucks, there are 24 countries with lags

bigger than 82 years. Moreover, virtually all countries with real GDP per capita levels in 1990 that have

not been observed in the U.S. since the start of World War II also have road transportation lags that are

bigger than 50 years.




8   We also calculated our results for tractors per member of the agricultural labor force. These results turned out to be very similar to the
     ones reported here in per-capita terms. They, however, covered a much smaller sample of countries because of the limited sample of
     countries for which agricultural labor force statistics are available. Thus, we present only the results for tractors per capita here.



                                                                      - 12 -
    For aviation, in Figure 6, we find slightly smaller technology lags. This difference largely reflects the

fact that, although modern airplanes were invented by the Wright brothers in 1903, it was only after

1945 that civil aviation really took off, even in the U.S.

    Figure 7 focuses on three more modern technologies: PCs, cell phones, and the internet. We find

that, in 2000, PCs are used at an intensity level in most countries that predates the U.S. 1990 level. In

fact, one third of the countries in our sample have an intensity of PC usage that is less than that in the

United States in 1981, the year that the first IBM-PC was introduced.

    In contrast, the internet and cell phones are technologies in which the U.S. is not the leader in their

intensity of usage. In 2002, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Singapore, and Sweden had more internet

users per capita than the U.S. At the same time, 51 out of the 123 countries for which we have data had

internet usage levels in 2002 that have not been observed in the U.S. since the introduction of web

browsers in 1993. The U.S. is also not the leader in cell phone usage. In 2002, cell phone usage in 32

out of the 145 countries in our sample exceeded that in the U.S. These countries include, among others,

almost all the nations of Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, as

well as the Czech Republic and Slovenia.

    These large cross-country dispersions in technology usage lags, together with the substantial

productivity improvements associated with the use of the new technologies in our sample, indicate that

cross-country variation in the use of state-of-the-art technologies may be responsible for a significant

part of the cross-country variation in per-capita income and TFP.

    Besides the actual levels of the usage lags, we can also study the cross-country relation between

technology usage and per-capita GDP time lags.

                 Conclusion 2: Technology usage lags are highly correlated with real GDP per capita lags




                                                       - 13 -
This property is already fairly evident from Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7. For all the technologies depicted in

these figures, the average technology usage lag is increasing in the real GDP lag. The actual correlations

that this conclusion is based on are listed in the “correlations and joint sample sizes” part of Table 1.

The first four rows of this part of the table list the correlations of the technology usage lags with real

GDP lags in 1950, 1970, 1990, and 2000.

       When we compare the technology usage lags with the real GDP lags in the corresponding years, as

is also done in Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7, we find that the average correlation of technology usage lags with

GDP lags is 0.76. The minimum is cargo aviation at 0.66. The maximum is the internet with 0.87.

These correlations are high, in spite of the non-linear relationship between GDP lags and technology

lags, which is evident from Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7.9

       For electricity we not only find a high correlation in the levels of usage lags with those of real GDP,

but also in the changes in each of the lags between 1950 and 1990. This relationship can be seen from

Figure 8. This figure has only three observations in the lower right-hand quadrant, which illustrates that

all (but three) countries that were catching up with the United States in terms of electricity production

from 1950 to 1990 reduced their per-capita income lags as well. The regression line, based on a sample

of 95 countries is as follows:

                ∆Electricity lag i,1950-2000 = 12.77 + 0.17 ∆GDP lag i,1950-2000 , R 2 = 0.27, i = 1,K,95
                                                    (1.31)   (0.03 )

This result shows that countries that caught up more than average with the U.S. in terms of GDP lags

also did so in terms of electricity lags. It suggests that electrification, as a general purpose technology,

played a crucial part in economic development in the last century.



9   This observation is consistent with (1) a positive correlation between levels of per-capita GDP and technology usage documented in
     Comin and Hobijn (2004) and Comin, Hobijn, and Rovito (2006), (2) the positive partial correlations of per-capita GDP and PC usage
     found by Caselli and Coleman (2001), and (3) per-capita GDP and the timing of adoption of real time gross settlement systems for
     interbank payments found by Bech and Hobijn (2006).



                                                                       - 14 -
        It is often argued that, after electricity, the computer is the next general purpose technology.10 It

turns out that the countries that lagged the U.S. the most in electricity in the middle of the 20th century

also tend to be the countries that lag the U.S. the most in PCs at the end of the 20th century. This

property can be seen from the technology usage lag correlation between electricity in 1950 and the

internet in 2002, which equals 0.81, and in the correlation between electricity in 1950 and PCs in 2002,

which equals 0.82.

        This finding holds more generally.

                           Conclusion 3: Usage lags are positively correlated across all technologies in our sample

This positive correlation is apparent for the technologies that are jointly plotted in Figures 4, 5, 6, and

7. The correlations across all technologies can be found in the “correlations and joint sample sizes” part

of Table 1. The average correlation across technology lags is 0.79, while the minimum is 0.51 for cargo

aviation and tractors, and the maximum is 0.93 for electricity in 1970 and 1990. Considering only

correlations between different technologies, the maximum is also 0.93, between cars in 1990 and

telephones in 1970.

        One interesting implication of this conclusion is that the positive correlation in usage lags is not

only observed contemporaneously. It is also true between lags for different technologies decades apart.

Skinner and Staiger (2005) document similar correlations in cross-state adoption patterns of several,

seemingly unrelated, technologies over time for U.S. states.

        Some other interesting dynamics are also evident in the technology usage lags. As Figures 4, 5, 6,

and 7 illustrate, many developing countries lag the U.S. much less in the use of the technologies that

have driven a large part of economic growth in industrialized countries in recent decades, like mobile

communications and information technology, than in older technologies such as electricity or cars. It is,


10   David (1990) puts this claim into a historical perspective.



                                                                   - 15 -
however, too early to tell if this result is driven by the low age of these new technologies, which limits

the size of the gaps that can currently be observed. If these results were to persist as these technologies

age, though, it would suggest that usage lags have become smaller for more recent technologies, which

would indicate an increase in the rate of international technology diffusion.



                                              5. Conclusion

The U.S. leads the world in the intensity of use of a broad range of technologies. For many countries,

the degree to which they use various technologies, including electricity, cars, trucks, and phones, lags

the technology usage level in the U.S. by several decades.

   The evidence on usage lags, that measure how many years ago the ten technologies that we consider

were used in the U.S. at the same intensity as they are used in the countries in our sample, that we

presented in this paper uncovers three main regularities.

   First, usage lags are sizeable. Second, usage lags are highly correlated across technologies. Third,

technology usage lags are also highly correlated with the level of economic development of a country,

as measured by per-capita income.

   The productivity differentials between the state of the art technologies that we consider and the

ones they replace combined with the usage lags that we document, lead us to infer that technology

usage disparities might account for a large part of cross-country TFP differentials. If so, then (the

intensity of) adoption of new technologies is a key mechanism for understanding the development

process.

   Our analysis of real GDP per capita lags uncovers a type of catch-up in GDP lags that suggests that

real GDP dynamics is more consistent with Lucas (2000) than with the neoclassical growth model

analyzed by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992).
