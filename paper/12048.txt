State Age Protection Laws and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act

                                           ABSTRACT

Some anti-discrimination laws have the perverse effect of harming the very class they were meant
to protect. This paper provides evidence that age discrimination laws belong to this perverse class.
Prior to the enforcement of the federal law, state laws had little effect on older workers, suggesting
that firms either knew little about these laws or did not see them as a threat. After the enforcement
of the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) in 1979, white male workers over
the age of 50 in states with age discrimination laws worked between 1 and 1.5 fewer weeks per year
than workers in states without laws. These men are also .3 percentage points more likely to be retired
and .2 percentage points less likely to be hired. These findings suggest that in an anti-age
discrimination environment, firms seek to avoid litigation through means not intended by the
legislation – by not employing older workers in the first place.

1 Introduction

       Although the hope is that anti-discrimination laws will raise employment and

wages for members of protected groups, a number of studies suggest that these laws may

be counter-productive. For example, Gruber (1994) finds that although mandates which

stipulated that childbirth be covered comprehensively in health insurance plans did not

change employment, they caused a decrease in wages of women of child bearing age.

Similarly, DeLiere (2000), Acemoglu and Angrist (2001), and Jolls and Prescott (2004),

among others, find a negative effect on employment prospects for disabled workers

following the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. In this paper I examine the impact

of state and federal legislation meant to protect older workers.         The 1968 Age

Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits discrimination against older

workers in hiring, laying off, firing, compensation, or other conditions of employment.

       This paper examines whether age discrimination laws have unintended

consequences for older workers. There are three margins upon which these laws can

affect older workers’ employment: firing, hiring, and retirement.      Employment may

increase or decrease for older workers depending on which margins are most affected by

the laws. First, a firm affected by these laws will be unlikely to outright fire an older

worker for fear of a lawsuit.       However, it is very difficult to prove or detect

discrimination in hiring, and thus employers may choose not to hire older workers who

will be difficult to fire (Donohue and Siegelman 1991). Finally, since the line between

unemployment and retirement tends to blur for older workers (Choi 2002), firms who

wish to avoid being sued may increase retirement incentives for these workers (rather

than fire them outright), thus decreasing the employment of older workers. At first



                                            2
examination, increasing incentives for retirement for older workers may seem to benefit

both the worker and the company. However, if the increase in retirement incentives is

coupled with an increased threat of layoffs, then the resulting increase in retirement may

not be entirely voluntary.    Because it is difficult for older workers to find new

employment, the possibility of losing one’s job without the retirement package is a worse

prospect for the older worker who may feel that he or she has no choice but to accept the

retirement package, than for the younger worker who has a higher probability of finding

new employment (Lahey 2005). Indeed, Schuster and Miller (1984) find that 31% of

cases brought under the ADEA before 1981 involved involuntary retirement.

       This paper uses state age discrimination laws matched by state and year to the

March monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) to look at retirement outcomes for

protected workers. To investigate the impact of hiring and job separation outcomes for

older workers, I constructed measures of separations and accessions (hires) by matching

CPS rotation groups as in Bleakley et al. (1999).       My empirical strategy uses the

assumption that, because of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)

backlog, workers in states with their own age discrimination laws are more likely to be

affected by the federal ADEA law.         Under this law, workers in states with age

discrimination laws have almost twice as long to file. Additionally, in states with laws

state Fair Employment Practices (FEP) offices may be able to process claims more

quickly than the EEOC. Thus, I compare workers in states with laws who are affected by

the law and workers in states with laws who are not affected by the law to those who are

in states without laws.




                                            3
         I find that ADEA laws, including state laws, had no negative effects (using CPS

March monthly data) on labor market outcomes before the 1968 federal law was enforced

and given to the EEOC in the late 1970s. Even after enforcement, these laws also do not

affect older women or minorities, possibly because minorities are granted stronger

protections under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and this cohort of older women in general

does not bring about lawsuits.1 After the 1978 legislation, white male workers over the

age of 50 in states with ADEA laws worked fewer weeks per year and are less likely to

be hired or separated from their jobs, but are more likely to be retired (perhaps

involuntarily). These findings suggest that firms do not wish to hire older workers most

affected by the law, are afraid to fire older workers, but remove older workers through

incentives to retire in states where lawsuits are less of a hurdle for the worker.

         The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.                        Section II provides

background information on the legal environment surrounding age discrimination laws,

including a brief literature review. Section III explains my empirical strategy. Section

IV gives information on data and descriptive statistics.                   Section V presents results,

including robustness checks. Section VI concludes.


2 Background

         The first state age discrimination law came on the books in 1903 in Colorado. By

1960, eight states had age discrimination laws.2 Although the US Civil Service had


1
  Although the decision of whether to file under the Civil Rights Act or the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act (or both) is dependent on the individual circumstances of a case, from the hiring
employer’s perspective, race and gender may be more salient features, or employers may have different
beliefs about the propensity to sue of older women and older minorities than older white men.
2
  I have not been able to find any pattern to the introduction of these laws. States with and without laws
look very similar across measured characteristics. In the robustness checks portion of the results section I
run a test as if states with laws had introduced them 5 years earlier and find no evidence of any underlying
differences between states that introduce and have not yet introduced laws.


                                                      4
banned maximum hiring ages in federal employment in 1956 and legislated against age

discrimination in federal contracting in 1964, federal legislation protecting older workers

overall did not appear until 1967 with the introduction of the Age Discrimination in

Employment Act, or ADEA. The 1967 ADEA prohibited age-based discrimination for

those aged 40-65 in firms with 20 or more workers. Under this act, employers were

barred from using age in hiring, laying off, firing, compensation, or other conditions of

employment.        It also prohibited employers from using age-specific language in

advertising. Although Adams (2004) finds a small effect of the introduction of this law,

most researchers agree that the federal law had little effect until the 1978 amendment to

the ADEA3 (Neumark and Stock 1999, O’Meara 1989). In 1978, Congress extended the

protected age group to 40-70 and eliminated mandatory retirement for most federal

employees. A second major change, in terms of enforcement, came in 1979 when the

Department of Labor (and, for federal employment, the US Civil Service Commission)

gave administrative responsibility to the US Equal Employment Opportunity

Commission (EEOC). Most researchers agree that this change strengthened the power of

the ADEA because the change came with an increase in resources and an increase in

“pattern and practice” lawsuits (Neumark 2001).4

        In 1986, Congress amended the ADEA to eliminate the upper protected age range

for age discrimination, effectively eliminating mandatory retirement for all except in

cases where a safety issue related to age might be considered a bona fide occupational

  Neumark and Stock (1999) note that the existence of the law may have given plaintiffs higher standing in
court even in the absence of enforcement mechanisms.
4
  Although some law scholars argue that EEOC pattern and practice lawsuits are irrelevant, publicity
surrounding the laws and the lawsuits could be the driving force behind differences in employer reaction to
age laws. O’Meara (1989) argues that while the 1964 law was passed with little publicity, the events
surrounding the 1978 amendment and enforcement were well publicized.

qualification (BFOQ), such as for pilots, or where the existence of job tenure would

impose an undue hardship on the employer, such as for professors.5 In 1990, the Older

Workers Benefits Protection Act (OWBPA) imposed restrictions on the financial tools

employers could use to induce worker retirement (Neumark 2001, O’Meara 1989).

         The procedure to file a claim under the ADEA differs importantly between states

with and without their own age discrimination laws. Because the EEOC has a large

backlog of cases, it rarely prosecutes claims itself. Instead, if a state has its own age

discrimination statutes, then the ADEA requires the claimant to file with the state Fair

Employment Practices (FEP) office within 300 days. Otherwise, in states that do not

have statutes, the claimant must file with the EEOC within 180 days.6 The EEOC can

then dismiss the claim, at which point the claimant may pursue a civil action in court, or

the EEOC can seek to settle or mediate. If the settlement or mediation is unsuccessful,

the EEOC can then sue, or if it chooses not to sue, the claimant may sue (Neumark 2001).

Over 95% of employment discrimination cases are brought by private attorneys, not the

EEOC (Gregory 2001).7 Since claimants have more time to file if their state has a law,

and, because the claim may be processed faster by the state FEP than the backlogged

EEOC, claimants in states with age discrimination laws have less of a hurdle to suing

than claimants in states without those laws.

         Awards are limited to “make whole” status and lawyers’ fees, that is, the award

returns the plaintiff to where he or she would have been had he or she not been the

subject of discrimination. These awards include hiring, reinstatement or promotion, back

  As a side-note, only 8% of employment discrimination cases filed in federal court proceed to the trial state
(Gregory 2001).

pay and restoration of benefits and lawyers’ fees. Attorney’s fees often make up the bulk

of the payment by the firm. Unlike race cases covered by the Civil Rights Act (CRA),

additional damages are not awarded except in cases involving willful violation of law and

these are limited to twice the amount of actual damages (Gregory 2001, Levine 1988,

O’Meara 1989).8 Thus, among those who believe that they have been discriminated

against during this time period, suing under the CRA may be more attractive to women

and minorities, but the ADEA is the best option for older white men.9

        The motivation behind the ADEA seems to be lawmakers’ concern that

employers incorrectly perceive older workers to be less productive or unwilling to make

modest adjustments to accommodate them.10 Additionally, lawmakers may worry that

capable individual older workers are not granted opportunities based on beliefs about

average characteristics of the elderly.          Although the labor market fortunes of older

workers tend to be better than those of younger workers, older workers are less likely to

find employment after being separated from a job (Diamond and Hausman 1984). When

older workers do find new jobs, they are clustered into a smaller set of industries and

occupations than younger workers (Hutchens 1988).

        The majority of people who sue under the ADEA are white male middle

managers or professionals over the age of 50.11 Employment termination in the form of

wrongful discharge and involuntary retirement, not differential hiring, is the cause of

most suits. It is thus possible that the ADEA acts as a form of employment protection. At

the beginning of EEOC enforcement, 14% of claimants were women. By 1995 this

number had risen to only 30% (Donohue and Siegelman 1991, Gregory 2001, Schuster

and Miller 1984).         As mentioned before, women and minorities may have greater

protection under the Civil Rights Act, which also allows punitive damages. Thus my

identification strategy focuses on white men over the age of 50, who are most likely to

sue under the law.

         This paper is the first to examine the impact of the ADEA from its early years

through a significant time period after its enforcement. It also uses yearly CPS data and

examines the effects on many segments of the labor force, not just those over or under the

age of retirement. Adams (2004) looks at the introduction of the federal law in 1968 and

finds an increase in employment for those protected by the federal law and a decrease for

those older than the protected ages. His identification strategy relies on the assumption

that states with laws prior to the introduction of the ADEA are not affected by its

passage, an assumption which may or may not be valid since the 1968 ADEA had no

enforcement mechanism. There is also some question about the validity of the early CPS

which Adams uses in his pre-period. Neumark and Stock (1999) look at censuses from

1940 to 1980, and thus have only one data point after the enforcement of the ADEA.12

The census may not be the best source of data to examine the impact of these laws since

it cannot follow year to year changes.

         The end of mandatory retirement in 1986 and 1994 has been more extensively

studied than other aspects of the ADEA. Till von Wachter (2002) looks at the shift of

mandatory retirement to age 70 in 1978 and its end in 1986 using imputed probability of

  I update Neumark and Stock’s list of state laws for use in this paper. In some cases I made corrections,
but these corrections to their list were for laws after 1980 and thus do not affect their results.


                                                     8
being covered by mandated retirement and finds that the labor force participation of

workers age 65 and older increases by 10 to 20% in 1986. Mitchell and Luzadis (1988)

find that in 1960, pension plans rewarded delayed retirement, but by the 1980s, union

plans actively encouraged early retirement. However, non-union plans still rewarded

delayed retirement.            Ashenfelter and Card (2000) show that the abolition of retirement

for college professors in 1994 reduced retirement for those age 70 and 71. Although the

end of mandatory retirement is important, it does not tell the story of the entire effect of

the ADEA, particularly the consequences of this legislation on older workers wishing to

be hired or promoted and the effects on workers who are over the age of 50 (and thus

“old”) but too young for mandatory retirement to have affected them. This paper fills

these gaps in the literature.


3 Empirical Strategy

        To study the effect of state age discrimination laws, I use an OLS Differences in

Differences specification:

      y it = X i β1 + β 2 (H st * A iover 50 ) + β 3 (H st * A iunder 50 ) + θ t + ∂ a + ϕs + ζ st + ε ist   (1)

where i denotes individuals and t denotes time; y it is either weeks worked, a dummy

indicating employed, a dummy indicating retirement, a dummy indicating hired this

month, or a dummy indicating being separated from a job this month; Xi is a set of

controls including a dummy for married and a dummy for high school graduate. H is an

indicator that is equal to one if the state s in which the individual resides has an age

discrimination law in year t. A iover 50 is an indicator equal to one if the individual is over

the age of 50, and A iunder 50 is an indicator equal to one if the individual is age 50 or under.




                                                                   9
θ t is a set of time dummies; ϕs is a set of state dummies; ∂ a is a full set of age dummies;

and ζ st is a state specific linear time trend. The assumption behind this strategy is that it

is easier for workers to sue, and thus to enforce age discrimination laws, in states that

have their own age discrimination laws than in states which do not. Thus workers over

the age of 50 in states with laws will be more affected than workers in states without

laws.

        Equation (1) varies somewhat from the standard differences in differences

equation which would be:

                  y it = X i γ 1 + γ 2 (H st ) + γ 3 (H st * A iover 50 ) + θ t + ϕ s + ∂ a + ζ st + ε ist

where γ 3 is the effect of the law on workers over the age of 50 compared to workers

under the age of 50 in states with laws. This equation is equivalent to equation (1), in

that β 2 = γ 2 + γ 3 and β 3 = γ 2 . The reason for using equation (1), which compares

workers over and under the age of 50 in states with laws to workers in states without

laws, as the specification, is that one can more clearly see the effects of the law on the

two different age groups in the sample. β 2 is the effect of having a law on workers over

the age of 50 and β 3 is the effect of having a law on workers age 50 and under, relative to

workers in states without laws. Age 50 was chosen as the age cutoff because white men

over 50 are most likely to sue under the law.

        A second possible way of identifying is through a Differences in Differences in

Differences strategy using women as a second control group. These early cohorts of

women are historically less litigious than older men or than women in later cohorts.

Additionally, since women’s attachment to the labor force is weaker than men’s,




                                                            10
employers may figure that women will leave or retire on their own before they become a

liability due to their age. Thus employers may not see older women as constituting as

much of a threat due to age discrimination laws as they do men. My strategy is:

y it = X i β1 + β 2 (M i * H st * A iover 50 ) + β 3 (M i * H st * A iunder 50 ) + β 4 (M i * A iover 50 ) +

 β 5 (M i * A iunder 50 ) + β 6 (M i * A iover 50 ) + β 7 ( H st * A iover 50 ) + β8 ( H st * A iunder 50 ) +   (2)

+ θ t + ϕs + ∂ a + ζ st + ε ist

where i denotes individuals, t denotes time; y it is either weeks worked, a dummy

indicating employed, a dummy indicating retirement, a dummy indicating hired this

month, or a dummy indicating being separated from a job this month; Xi is a set of

controls including a dummy for married and a dummy for high school graduate. M i is an

indicator which equals 1 if the individual is male. H is an indicator that is equal to one if

the state s in which the individual resides has an age discrimination law in year t. Aiover 50

is an indicator equal to one if the individual is over the age of 50, and A iunder 50 is an

indicator equal to one if the individual is age 50 or under. θ t is a set of time dummies;

ϕs is a set of state dummies; ∂ a is a full set of age dummies; and ζ st is a linear state time

trend. The assumptions behind this strategy are that it is easier for workers to sue, and

thus to enforce age discrimination laws, in states that have their own age discrimination

laws than in states which do not and that women are less likely to be affected by these

laws than men. Thus men over the age of 50 in states with laws will be more affected

than either workers in states without laws or than women.

          Finally, I try a more stringent identification strategy in terms of possible state and

time trends by allowing state times year effects:



                                                              11
      y it = β1 (H st * A iover 50 ) + θ t + ϕ s + ∂ a + ϕ s * θ t + ε ist                        (3)

with variables defined as before.


4 Data and Descriptive Statistics

        The first sample I use to look at the impact of age discrimination laws is drawn

from the 1968-1991 March CPS and is limited to white men aged 25 to 85. I break this

set up into two smaller sets, one covering 1968-1977 and the other covering 1978-1991,

because the Congressional committee reported on the ADEA in 197713 (amendments

followed in 1978 and enforcement by the EEOC in 1979), and because of changes in the

CPS beginning in 1976. I limit to 1991 because the introduction of the ADA provides

new protection to older workers.14 The impact of the ADEA on employment levels is

evaluated by looking at data on weeks worked during the calendar year preceding the

March income supplement. The impact on wages is measured using the average weekly

earnings, computed using annual earnings data.                               After 1979, the CPS prompted

respondents to be sure to include overtime pay, tips, bonuses, commissions, and money

from employers other than the primary employer.15 The impact on retirement and labor

force participation is measured using the self-reported retirement and labor force coding

from the CPS employment status variable. The second sample I use is a matched

monthly CPS. I follow the algorithm developed in Bleakley et al. (1999) to match job

flow variables. These matched data allow me to measure the impact of the ADEA on

hiring and job separation outcomes.

   Results are robust to removing 1978 as a year from the wage regressions.

       CPS questions about weeks worked and income refer to the previous year. The

year reported in the tables and figures is the year in which the CPS was administered, not

the year referred to in the questionnaire.       Questions about labor force status and

retirement refer to the respondent’s main occupation in the previous week. From 1968 to

1976 in the early period, the CPS does not identify all states but groups some of them

together. For state groups in which all states in the group have the same law status for

the year, I code these as having or not having the law depending on status. If any state in

the group does not have the same status as the others for the year, I drop these states for

the years in which they disagree. The basis for state laws was taken from Neumark and

Stock (1999) and checked against several secondary sources. When Neumark and Stock

(1999) disagreed with the secondary sources, these laws were checked against primary

sources from Westlaw and from microfiche and hard copies of compiled state laws.

Additionally, the list was updated for years not in Neumark and Stock using Monthly

Law Review updates and Westlaw.

       Descriptive statistics can be found in Table 1. As mentioned before, the universe

is restricted to white males. As workers get older, they are less likely to be unemployed

and more likely to be out of the labor force. The employment rate, weekly wage, and

total income increase by age until age 45 in the early sample and age 50 in the later

sample, after which they begin to drop. Men in the set are more likely to be married as

they get older until their mid-50s in the early sample and mid-60s in the later sample

Older cohorts are also less likely to be high school graduates.        Wage income and

education levels are higher on average for workers in states with laws. Average weeks

worked is larger for workers in states with laws in the early period but not in the later

period. Men are more likely to claim to be retired in states with laws in the later period.

Figure 2 shows the dates that states implemented their age protection laws. States

without laws in the later period are more likely to be in the South.16


5 Results

5.1 Employment, Wage, and Retirement Effects

            Figure 1 plots average weeks worked by white men age 25-50 and those age 51-

85 who worked in states with and without laws for those who worked a positive number

of hours. The number of weeks worked in Figure 1 is taken as the average of the

midpoint of intervalled weeks worked per year. The number of weeks worked by older

men has been declining during this time period, although this decrease has leveled out in

the 1980s. Older men in states with laws work more weeks per year than older men in

states without laws until the late 1970s, when the two lines begin to look more similar

while those corresponding for the younger men retain the same trend. This convergence

suggests that the possibility of a new enforcement mechanism may have had an effect

before the enforcement actually came in place in 1979 in states which were more aware

of age discrimination legislation. Weeks worked by younger men dropped as well from

1979 to 1982 and then increased through the rest of the 1980s. In general younger men in

states without laws worked more weeks per year than those in states with laws.

            Table 2 reports ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of equation (1). The

universe is white men between the ages of 25 and 85, inclusive. The dependent variables

are weeks worked, log weekly earnings and retired.17 The controls in these regressions

are dummies for married and high school graduate, and a set of age dummies, state

     The coefficient reported for retired is the marginal effect of the probit.

dummies and year dummies.18 Regressions are clustered on state. The coefficients of

interest are havelaw*over50, which is the interaction of the observation being over age 50

and being in a state with a law, and havelaw*under50, which is the interaction of the

observation being the age of 50 or under and being in a state with a law.19 The table also

reports estimates from specifications including a linear time trend interacted with state.

        The results in Table 2 suggest a substantial and statistically significant decline in

weeks worked per year for people over the age of 50 after it was announced that the

ADEA would begin to be enforced in 1978.20 For example, in Table 2A, columns 3 and

4 show a drop of between -1.1 and -1.5 weeks worked for older white men, those over 50,

in states with age discrimination laws and essentially no effect on white men under 50 in

those states. In the early period, there is no effect on weeks worked for either older or

younger workers, though this lack of finding may be due to measurement error in weeks

worked per year, since prior to 1976, they were only reported in intervals.

        Panel 2B reports estimates on log weekly wages of white men 25-50 and 51-85 in

states with and without laws. Once state trends are added, there is no evidence of any

effect on either older or younger workers in the early period, although again, since the

variable, weekly wages, is manufactured from weeks worked and not all states are




18
   Adding college graduate instead of high school graduate as a control changes the coefficient on
over50*havelaw to range between -1.045 without a state year trend to -1.37 with a state trend, compared to
-1.5 and -1.16 respectively.
19
   Recall that people in states with laws have more time to file a claim and can work with the state FEP
agency rather than directly with the EEOC; thus they have less of a hurdle to file a lawsuit. Even though
the law covers workers over 40, in practice white men over the age of 50 are the most likely to sue. Some
states with laws also protect workers in firms with fewer than 20 workers. Neumark and Stock (1999) code
three states, Colorado, Georgia, and North Dakota as having “weak” laws in the post period. Coding these
states as not having a law does not appreciably change the results; for example, the coefficient on weeks
worked in Table 2A(3) changes from -1.5 to -1.2 and is still significant at the 5% level.
20
   Weeks Worked variable includes zeros for people who did not work any weeks.


                                                   15
included in the early period, this may be an artifact of the data.21 Additionally, without

state trends, there is a significant positive effect on wages of older workers in states with

laws and the point estimate remains positive once trends are added. In the later period,

there is a positive effect on wages of older workers in states with laws, but this effect is

not significant. Thus age discrimination laws may increase wages of older workers, but

this wage effect is not significant once state trends are added.22

         Panel 2C reports estimates on self-reported retirement of white men over and

under 50 in states with and without laws. Note that unlike the weeks worked and income

questions, the retirement question is asked about the previous week, rather than the

previous year. In the early period, the effect on retirement is small and insignificant for

older workers, and negative and significant for younger workers. In the later period,

older workers are .2 to .3 percentage points more likely to say they are retired in states

with laws than men in states without laws though this effect is only marginally significant

once state trends are added.23 This provides suggestive evidence that age discrimination

laws encourage retirement in older workers. This effect could be through two different

channels. It could be that companies prefer to offer retirement packages to older workers

rather than laying them off or firing them, thus decreasing the chance of a lawsuit.

Alternatively, it could be that unemployed older workers who face decreased chances of

re-employment prefer to refer to themselves as retired rather than unemployed.


Robustness Checks

21
   No evidence is found for an effect in the early period using annual wages either, suggesting that the lack
of an effect on weeks worked may be real and not just an artifact of the interval data and missing states.
22
   If there is a genuine positive effect on wages, it may be because, as is shown later, firms are both less
likely to either hire or fire older workers. Since firms often offer lower wages to new hires than to workers
with long tenure, the average wage in this sample may go up.
23
   The base rate of retirement for all white men is .125, and .325 for those over the age of 50.


                                                     16
       Although Figure 1 suggests that the possibility of the enforcement of the federal

age discrimination law may have affected employment of older workers in states with

laws as early as 1977, when committees reported on the ADEA, an argument can be

made for using the year 1978, when the enforcement was announced, or 1979, when the

enforcement actually took place as the start year for the later period. Results using these

later cut-off dates can be found in Table 3. Again, the age range refers to the dates the

CPS was administered, and thus refers to the earlier year for questions on weeks worked

and income. These results are substantively the same as those from 1978-1991, although

in general the magnitude of the coefficients is somewhat smaller. Additionally, the

results for weeks worked per year lose significance at the 5% level once state trends are

included in the regression.

       The age 85 was chosen as the top age in order to allow a generous top age

specification while still eliminating possible outliers. The typical person who sues under

the ADEA, however, is a white male between the ages of 50 and 59. To test for

sensitivity to the top age used, I run separate regressions using topcodes of 75, 65, and

59. These results can be found in Table 4. Again, there is no evidence of an age

discrimination law effect on relative wages for these smaller age universes.            The

magnitude of the coefficient of havelaw * over 50 drops for both weeks worked per year

and retirement as the age universe is trimmed, suggesting there might be a stronger effect

on older workers. Weeks worked per year is no longer significant when state time trends

are added once 75-84 year olds are removed and loses significance entirely once the

universe is restricted below 65, although this result is not unexpected since the universe is

smaller. Retirement remains positive and significant for the 25-74 year olds without state




                                             17
trends but drops when the range is restricted to those under 65. Coefficient magnitudes

are larger with older top age tails, suggesting that much of the effect of these laws is

concentrated at later ages.

       Similar regressions shown in Table 5, looking at women and minority groups,

found no effect of age discrimination laws on weeks worked. Protected minority groups

are afforded greater protection under the Civil Rights Act (CRA) and can be awarded

punitive damages in addition to “make whole” damages from the CRA, but not the

ADEA and older women from these cohorts are not litigious. Thus employers may not

worry about age for these groups as they are more likely to be sued under the CRA and

would have to pay out a larger settlement under the CRA. Additionally, I may be finding

no effect because employers may believe that, since women have weaker labor force

attachment, they may leave before a lawsuit becomes an issue. Sample sizes for blacks

are small and are even smaller for other minority groups and thus may not be big enough

to pick up an effect of age laws. I do find a positive effect on weekly wages for black

men of all ages in states with laws once state time trends are added in, but that may be a

spurious result. I also no effect on retirement for these groups.

       Older white men in middle-management positions are most likely to sue.

Therefore it may be of interest to break up the set by college education, since managers

are more likely to be college educated. Columns 5-8 of Table 5 report results for white

men by college graduation. In table 5A, results on weeks worked for both of these

groups are very similar to those of the whole sample, with the coefficient of

havelaw*over50 decreasing in magnitude and significance with state specific trends for

the group of non-college graduates but increasing in magnitude and significance for those




                                             18
with a college education. If there is a state specific time trend to weeks worked that

varies by education, then this would suggest that age discrimination laws do hurt those in

demographic groups that are more likely to sue.         Table 5C shows similar results for

claiming retirement as an outcome; older non-college graduates are significantly more

likely to claim retirement without a state specific time trend but older college graduates

are significantly more likely when a state specific time trend is included.

       Table 6A reports OLS estimates of equation (2). The universe is all white men

and women between the ages of 25 and 85. The dependent variable is weeks worked.

The controls in these regressions are dummies for married and high school graduate, and

a set of age dummies, state dummies and year dummies. Regressions are clustered on

state. The coefficients of interest are male*over50*havelaw, which is the interaction of

the observation being male, age 50 or over and being in a state with a law, and male*

under50*havelaw, which is the interaction of the observation being male, under the age

of 50 and being in a state with a law.         Women are less likely to sue under age

discrimination laws than men, and as explained above, men in states with laws have less

of a hurdle to suing than men in states without laws.

       The results in Table 6A agree substantially with the Differences in Differences

results for older men using having a law as identification in Table 2. There is still no

significant effect of laws for either group prior to the discussion of federal enforcement of

the law. In the later period, the magnitude for older men is somewhat larger than the

largest estimate in Table 2, with men in states with laws working almost 1.7 fewer weeks

using women and not having a law as controls. The triple difference for men under the




                                             19
age of 50 is negative here whereas in the earlier calculation its sign depended on the

inclusion of state trends, though again it is not significant.

        Table 6B reports OLS estimates of equation (3). The universe is white men

between the ages of 25 and 85. The dependent variable is weeks worked. The controls in

these regressions are dummies for married and high school graduate, and a set of age

dummies, state dummies and year dummies. Regressions are clustered on state. The

coefficient of interest is havelaw*over50, which is the interaction of the observation

being age 50 or over and being in a state with a law. These results also find a negative

effect on weeks worked for older workers, with older workers working about 1.5 fewer

weeks in states with laws. These results are within the bounds of those found by equation

(1) presented in Table 2, Panel A.

        On average, there is little clear evidence of an age discrimination law effect on the

relative wages of older workers. Therefore the rest of this paper focuses on a further

investigation of the employment and labor force participation effects, and the analysis is

limited to the demographic groups for which the evidence for employment effects is

strongest—white men between the ages of 25 and 85.


Endogeneity of state laws

        To test for the possible endogeneity of state laws, in addition to adding state and

year effects and trends, I run a specification check looking at the weeks worked outcome

at a point 5 years before each state law was passed. The assumption is that employers do

not know that a law will be passed prohibiting age discrimination 5 years prior to the law.

No evidence is found that having a law 5 years in the future affects employment or hiring

of either older or younger workers in the current period. The coefficient for weeks



                                              20
worked per year for older workers ranges from -0.091 (with no controls) with a standard

error (SE) of 0.836 to -0.529 (with controls and a state trend) with an SE of 0.714.

Coefficients for younger workers range from -0.330 with an SE of (0.570) to 0.310 with

an SE of (0.824). Thus there is no evidence that the introduction of state laws is related

to something that directly affects the differential employment of older and younger

workers using this test.


5.2 The Impact of Age Discrimination Laws on Hiring and Separations

       Workers may also be working fewer weeks per year not just because they are

more likely to retire but also because they are having difficulty finding work once they

have separated from a previous job. Additionally, the law may be helping workers by

decreasing fires and layoffs for older workers, since employers do not want to be sued. I

used matched CPS rotations groups for the entire year to investigate the effect of age

discrimination laws on hiring and separation rates (see Bleakley et al. (1999) for a

detailed description of the match). An accession (hire) is recorded when someone who

was not employed in month m is employed in month m+1. Similarly, an individual is

coded as having experienced a separation in month m if he is employed in any month m

and not in month m+1 (individuals employed in December and not in January are coded

as hired or separated in the January year). This definition includes people who move

from being employed to no longer being in the labor force as separated, and thus captures

those who have voluntarily retired in addition to those subject to layoffs, fires, and other

quits. Neither hires nor separations include people who change jobs without leaving




                                            21
employment.24 These measures of accessions and separations are the same as those used

by Bleakley et al.(1999).

         As theory would predict, I find that older workers in states with laws are less

likely to be hired than workers in states without laws. I also find that workers are less

likely to be separated from their jobs, though these results are not significant. Results of

a probit using equation (2) with Hired and Separated as outcome variables can be found

in Table 7. Workers over the age of 50 in states with laws are .2 to .3 percentage points

less likely to be hired than workers in states without laws.25 There is also a small but not

significant (once controls are added) positive effect on hiring for workers under the age

of 50 in these states. Results on job separations are not as clear. There is a trend of

reduced job separations for workers over the age of 50 in states with laws and increased

job separations for workers under the age of 50, but these results are not significant at the

5% level. Since separations include retirements, which are more likely for older workers

in states with laws, I should be picking up two separate effects: increased retirement

incentives and decreased firing and layoffs.26 Still, I find that older workers in states with

laws are .1 percentage points less likely to be separated than workers in states without,

and this effect is probably a lower bound.27


6 Concluding Comments

         Employment of workers over the age of 50 has dropped since the ADEA was

enforced in 1979. This drop is greater for workers in states where lawsuits are less of a
24
   Since older workers may be more likely to be unemployed before finding a new job (Diamond and
Houseman 1984), this definition may overestimate older “hires” and “separations” and underestimate
younger “hires” and “separations.”
25
   The base for hired is 1.7 percentage points, and 1.8 and 1.5 for younger and older workers respectively.
26
   Simply limiting to people who do not say they are retired will not fix this effect since many people who
are actually unemployed would call themselves retired for status reasons (Choi 2002).
27
   The base for separated is 1.9 percentage points for the universe regardless of age category.


                                                     22
hurdle for older workers, i.e. those states with their own age discrimination laws.

Workers over the age of 50 in states with laws work between 1 and 1.5 fewer weeks per

year than workers in states without laws. Because, on average, older workers work 26.7

weeks per year and all workers work 45.5 weeks per year, ease of age discrimination

lawsuit explains 5-8% of the gap in working weeks between older workers in states with

laws and the general population. This drop in weeks worked may seem high, but it is

comparable to the effect that Acemoglu and Angrist (2001) find for the disabled after the

introduction of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1991, where weeks worked

for disabled men fall 1.4 weeks in 1993 and another 1.5 weeks between 1993 and 1995.

       Retirement has also increased for these older workers. Older workers in states

with laws are .3 percentage points more likely to consider themselves retired than

workers in states without. Hiring has decreased significantly for older workers in states

where it is easier to sue; older workers are .2 percentage points less likely to be hired in

states with laws. Finally, separations have dropped, though not at a significant level.

       I find no significant decline in the employment or retirement for younger workers,

non-white workers and female workers based on state time variation in ease of age

discrimination lawsuit. A possible explanation for the difference in findings by race and

gender is that before the advent of the ADEA, female and minority workers were already

protected by the Civil Rights Act (CRA), which allows for more damages; white men

over the age of 50 are the most likely to sue under the ADEA. Additionally, since these

groups are not as strongly attached to the labor market, employers may think that they

will leave their jobs before possible productivity declines due to age become an issue.




                                            23
       Since the ADEA provides a form of employment protection, it should lead to a

lower separation rate for older workers. There does seem to be a protection benefit of

this sort, although the results are not conclusive. However, there is also a large effect on

increased retirements for these older workers. Employers appear to be reacting to age

discrimination legislation and threats of lawsuits by failing to hire older workers, being

less likely to fire or lay-off older workers but trying to remove older workers through

retirement incentives. In general, it appears that these age protection laws have had very

little effect on workers under the age of 50.
