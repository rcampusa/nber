                 The Interaction of Residential Segregation and
                           Employment Discrimination


                                    ABSTRACT


    This   paper seeks to disentangle the impact of residential segregation from

that of employment discrimination in determining black employment share. The

major finding is that distance of a workplace from the main ghetto is one of the

strongest and most significant determinants of both changes over time and levels

of the racial composition of the workforce. This paper presents evidence of

more heterogeneous micro labor supply within SMSA's than has usually been

recognized for policy purposes.

     Comparing Chicago with Los Angeles, we find that distance from the ghetto

has a stronger impact in Chicago, and that this effect increased during the late

1970's. In contrast, residential segregation is relatively less important in

determining workplace demographics in Los Angeles, despite its rudimentary

public transit system and prototypical job dispersion.    In both cities,

residential segregation strongly influences black employment patterns and limits

the efficacy of efforts to integrate the workplace.

I. Introduction
    The burning ghettos of twenty years ago focused attention on the plight of the
poor urban black. The violence and disorder of that time generated interest in peace-
ful means of accommodation and integration. Among these may be numbered
affirmative action in employment, residential desegregation, and improved urban tran-
sportation. While attention has since lapsed, the problems of that day have not gone
away. In an early and controversial study, John Kain demonstrated that blacks may
have greater difficulty in finding jobs because of the geographical isolation of black
ghettos from jobs. Poor urban transportation systems may translate residential
segregation into employment segregation and unemployment. Indeed, part of the
recent unprecedented unemployment rates among blacks has been attributed to the
suburbanization of employment as jobs have moved out of the central city, blacks
have been unable to follow because of residential segregation compounded by inade-
quate transportation.'.
    Taking black and white residential patterns as given, this paper seeks to deter-
mine how much of the level and change over time in racial employment patterns
across establishments can be explained by distance from concentrations of black
population. This study extends Kain's analysis to a dynamic framework by studying
the change over time in black employment in establishments as a function of distance
from the ghetto. These effects are then compared between a highly segregated city
with radial transport corridors and extensive mass transit - Chicago, and a relatively
integrated city with a grid transport structure and minimal public transit -         Los

Angeles. This is the first such analysis of a Western U.S. city. Given the ongoing
migration to cities of the South and West, and the continuing suburbanization of major
cities, Los Angeles can be thought of as the city of the future. Given residential segre-
gation, few observers of this situation would expect employment opportunities for
blacks to improve as jobs continue to disperse.

        This paper presents evidence that black employment patterns are strongly
influenced by residential patterns demonstrating the importance of detailed analyses
of localized labor markets within a city. In contrast to some recent studies emphasiz-
ing the fluid and mobile nature of urban labor markets where distance between job
and home counts for little this study finds evidence of very differently colored labor
markets within a few miles of each other. We also examine the impact of affirmative
action in promoting black male employment when fine geographic effects are con-
trolled for.
        There are only a handful of establishment level datasets with geographic detail.
Among these few, perhaps only one also contains information on the racial composi-
tion of the workiorce. This study gee-coded Equal Employment Opportunity establish-
ment level demographic data, and breaks new ground in using such data to address
the question of the importance of distance between work and residence on black
employment. In so doing, we reverse the usual assumptions inherent in monocentric
models of employment. Rather than modeling the distribution of residential location
about monocentric employment, we allow employment to be dispersed. We take advan-
tage of detailed employer characteristics to help separate demand from supply
e ife c t s

       The local labor market is a concept that that has not only been routinely
accepted by economists in theory, but has also been embedded by courts in practice
in the enforcement of equal opportunity law and affirmative action regulation. Yet the
courts' and regulators' views of local labor markets rarely reach levels of detail less
coarse than an entire undifferentiated city or SMSA. Differences across establish-
ments in the same SMSA and industry are commonly taken as prima facie evidence of
employment discrimination, under the assumption that all such establishments face
the same labor supply. If employment patterns across firms within an SMSA are
significantly affected by variations in labor supply schedules caused in part by
                                         -3-
residential segregation then we must ask as a matter of law and public policy how
much of the burden should be placed on the employer to undo the effect of residential
segregation? If all, then we place a considerable tax on employers in segregated cities
that is not necessarily related to employment discrimination. If none, then we create
a great incentive for discriminating employers to move to the suburbs. This paper
exploits the fine geographic detail of a unique establishment level data set and
presents evidence of far more heterogeneous micro labor markets within SMSAs than
has usually been recognized for legal or policy purposes.
    The second section of this paper reviews Kain's work and that of a few of his sub-
sequent critics. The third section develops a model of an urban labor market taking
residential location as given. The fourth section discusses our results, comparing the
level and changes in black employment share across establishments in Chicago and
Los Angeles in the late 1970s. The fifth presents our conclusions, chief among which is
that residential segregation severely limits employment integration.

H. The Kain Controversy: Residential Segregation and Spatial Mismatch
     John Kain's work was the first to link discrimination in the housing market to the
distribution and level of non-white employment in urban areas. Kain used data on
place of work and place of residence obtained from the Detroit Area Traffic Study of
1952, and the Chicago Area Traffic Study of 1956 to test three hypotheses: First,
residential segregation affects the geographic distribution of black employment.
Second. residential segregation increases black unemployment, and third, the post-
war suburbanization of employment has hindered black employment. The central
tests in this work are regressions for each city of the percent black employed across
workplace zones on the percent black resident in each workplace zone and on dis-
tance from the major black ghetto. Kain's major finding is that blacks' share of
 employment is significantly higher in heavily black neighborhoods and close to the
 major ghetto. One interpretation of this result is that residential segregation causes
                                          -4-
employmcnt segregation. From this it follows that the undcrrcprcscntation of blacks
in employment may overstate employment discrimination, and that the suburbaniza-
tion of employment will tend to reduce black employment opportunities and increase
black unemployment.
     Kain's work attracted much criticism on both empirical and theoretical grounds.
Offner and Saks reanalyzed the Chicago data and found that the original results were
sensitive to specification. In particular, Offner and Saks found evidence of tipping
behavior: black employment share increases at an increasing rate as black residential
share increases. One possible policy interpretation of this result is that residential
integration might decrease employment opportunities for blacks. While this point pro-
voked further controversy, for our purposes here it is important to bear in mind that
Ofiner and Saks' results agree with Kain's in showing that black employment share
decreases with distance from the major ghetto.
     Once stated, this result seems obvious. But does it then follow that black unem-
ployment can be partly blamed on the physical inaccessibility of jobs? Some recent
work by Ellwood has argued that, surprisingly, the answer may be no. Examining
youth unemployment in Chicago during the 1970's, Eliwood finds that distance and
travel time from potential jobs cannot account for much of black unemployment, sug-
gesting that, in some sense, there may be "enough" jobs for blacks near the ghetto.
Hence the Ellwood aphorism: "The problem isn't space. It's race.". Nevertheless, this
may be true at the same time that black access to jobs beyond the ghetto is con-
strained.
     In another recent paper using a national CPS sample, Price and Mills [1983]
reach a similar conclusion. They find that only 6 percent of the black-white earnings
differential can be explained by the greater concentration of blacks in the central
city, while at least 15 percent is due to employment discrimination.
     Adding support to this view, Meyer [1981, p. 231.] reviews a number of studies of
                                          -5-
transit demonstration projects funded by the federal government in the aftermath of
the Watts riots to test the hypothesis that improved bus service to outlying employ-
ment centers would reduce inner-city unemployment. He concludes that "there was
little evidence that many jobs were found because of the new bus service... When com-
pared with racial discrimination or lack of skills and education, employment decen-
tralization and inadequate or expensive public transportation appeared to be rela-
tively minor causes of unemployment (or underemployment) among low-income
central-city residents." Taken together, these studies present us with an apparent
paradox: spatial considerations can explain a good deal about where blacks work, but
they do not appear to have much to say about whether blacks work or about their
earnings if they do work.
    The theoretical criticism of Kain's work, which Kain himself notes, is that his
results are consistent with a world in which blacks are chosing the optimal place to
live. The issue is essentially one of simultaneity and reverse causation. If there were
no residential discrimination, but strong and pervasive employment discrimination,
blacks might find it advantageous to live near establishments that would employ them.
While this is unlikely to be the dominant trend, it would make improvements in urban
transport and efforts at residential integration largely beside the point in ameliorating
the employment problems of urban blacks.
    It is difficult to give this argument much credence. First, there is an abundance
of independent evidence demonstrating the strength of residential discrimination and
segregation2. If anything, one lesson from the history of federal efforts to integrate
neighborhoods and workplaces over the last two decades is that it is far easier to get
whites and blacks to work side by side than it is to get them to live side by side.
Secondly, tastes for discrimination are not uniform. While a neighborhood may tip, it
is difficult to believe that the reason so few blacks live in the suburbs is because all
suburban employees discriminate against them. After all, if there were no residential
                                              -6-
 discrimination, all it would take to integrate a neighborhood would be one enlightened
employer. Third, given, that housing, on a quality adjusted basis, is more expensive in
 the central city (Kain and Quigley), why should all the non-discriminating firms cluster
around the central city when they could presumably offer their black workers lower
wages elsewhere? Fourth only a small and decreasing fraction of blacks report a
desire to live in all black neighborhoods3.
      Finally, a recent paper by Kain and Zax reminds us again of the importance of
residential segregation. In a carefully structured case-study, they find that when an
integrated firm moves from the central-city to the suburbs, black employees are
significantly less likely than whites to follow and keep their jobs. This is interpreted as
strong evidence of a constraint on black residential choice. Similarly, working from a
sophisticated theoretical base, Straszheirn finds a positive wage gradient with lower
wages in the central city, for low education black workers but not for whites, and con-
cludes that this is persuasive evidence in support of Kain's view that residential segre-
gation reduces employment opportunities for blacks.
     In this paper we take residential patterns as given. In the following section, we
develop a simple model for testing the impact of residential segregation on employ-
ment segregation.

ilL A Model of an Urban Labor Market
    This section develops a model of an urban labor market to analyze the proportion
of black workers within establishments at various distances from a central ghetto. For
tractability, we assume immobile residences and a monocentric black residential
population. We relax the usual assumption of monocentric employment and allow
firms to be dispersed over the urban area.
    Since residential location is fixed, there are no housing prices in the model. The
employee's problem is then to maximize utility conditional on location as a function of
wages (W) and commuting costs (C):
                                         -7-
     max UU(PY,C)                                                                   (1)
with U1>0, U11<0, (12<0, (122<0.
    For smooth geographic wage distributions and smooth commuting costs, black
employment will be clustered about the ghetto. Further from the ghetto, blacks would
require higher wages to compensate then for increased commuting costs, so:

      WÂ°XDGHETTO                                                                    (2)
where WS is the supply wage of blacks, IJGHETTO is distance from the ghetto, and X >0.
This in itself will cause the geographic distribution of black employment to resemble
the distribution of residence.
    The firm's demand for black labor is given by:

     PB=fl1Gâ€”2D+fl3Tâ€”p4w                                                            (3)
where PB is the proportion of blacks demanded. G is affirmative action pressure, D is a
Beckerian taste for discrimination, T is skill requirement, and W is the wage4. Substi-
tuting equation 2 into equation 3 gives the reduced form equilibrium equation:

     PB=fl1 C â€”fl2D + fl Tâ€”4XDGHETTO                                                (4)
    This reduced form is our basic estimating equation. We shall also estimate it in
growth form. We are interested in determining the magnitude of the effect of distance
from the ghetto on both the level and growth of black employment share within estab-
lishments5.

IV. A Comparison of Chicago and Los Angeles
    Los-Angeles and Chicago differ in terms of residential segregation, Chicago being
among the most highly segregated major American cities, and Los Angeles being rela-
tively more integrated. In 1970 the Taeuber index of segregation between whites and
non-whites, where one is perfectly segregated and zero is perfectly integrated, was
88.5 in Chicago and 78.4 in Los Angeles, and had fallen in both cities since 19606. But
even the most integrated cities in America are still essentially segregated. The Watts
riots of 1965 demonstrated that blacks in Los Angeles. as in other cities, felt disen-
                                           -8-
franchised and disenchanted. The MeConc Commission report on the causes of the
riot recognized the problems faced by blacks in finding and holding a job, and pointed
out that the inadequate and costly transportation currently existing throughout the
Los Angeles area seriously restricts the residents of the disadvantaged areas such as
South Central Los Angeles While the Census of Population and Housing reports that
33% of all employed blacks use public transit to get to work in the Chicago SMSA in
1950, the comparable figure for the Los Angeles SMSA is only 13%. This knife cuts both
ways however. If jobs disperse faster than public transit can keep up, reliance on the
aid of public transit can become a burden. Along these lines it is worth noting that
while the use of public transit overall increased very slightly in Los Angeles between
1970 and 1950, it fell markedly in Chicago from 23% to 15%. Have the changes since
1965 made any difference in terms of employment?
    Table 1 compares employment to population ratios (EPRs) from Census data in
1970 and 1980 for blacks and whites in the cities and the remainder of the SMSAs of
Chicago and Los Angeles. These EPRs are always lower for blacks than for whites.
lower in the city than the suburbs, and lowest of all for city blacks in Chicago in 1980.
In fact while black EPRs are rising in the suburbs, they are falling in the city, and fal-
ling the fastest in the city of Chicago. While Black ERRs in Chicago are almost identi-
cal to those in Los Angeles in 1970, the two areas differ considerably by 1980. In par-
ticular, the ERR of Chicago city blacks falls more than that of any other group, includ-
ing Chicago city whites, and it falls while suburban EPRs are rising for both blacks and
whites.


Empirical Strategy
    We estimate the impact of distance from the ghetto on the level of black employ-
ment share across establishments in Chicago and Los Angeles in the late 1970s by
using log-odds regressions of the following form:

     log(j_&5y)X$+e                                                            ,      (5)
                                          -9-
where X is a vector of establishment characteristics including distancc from the
ghett67. We also estimate the impact of distance on the change in employment share
over time by estimating a variant of equation 5 that includes past employment share
as an independent variable. The strategy here is to let the regression tell us what a
mile of distance means in each city in each year. This is the advantage of using miles
rather than a direct measure of travel time, and of using distance from central ghetto
rather than distance from the nearest concentration of blacks. The key concept is
that the effect of distance from ghetto will yield an independent summary measure of
both the extent of residential segregation in each city and of the usefulness of its
transportation system in moving blacks to jobs. For example, imagine two different
cases in which distance from the ghetto would have no impact on establishment demo-
graphics. The first would be a city that was effectively integrated residentially. The
second would be a segregated city with an excellent transportation network that
brings ghetto and jobs close together. In either case, we would expect a distance to
ghetto variable to play an insignificant role in explaining percent black in workplaces.
     The interesting tests in the following tables are then of two types: a comparison
across cities, and a comparison within each city over time. One might expect distance
from ghetto to play a stronger role in determining workplace percent black in Chicago
than in Los Angeles because Chicago is more segregated residentially. Distance from
the central ghetto should be a less meaningful measure of the supply of black workers
in relatively integrated Los Angeles than in residentially segregated Chicago. Since
 there is little reason to expect discriminating employers to sort themselves geographi-
 cally more strongly in one city than in the other, the major countervailing force is the
 transport system. The point is simple: a good urban transport system can undo the
 effect of residential segregation on employment segregation by literally spanning the
 miles and figuratively bringing the jobs closer to the ghetto. If the Chicago transport
 system were better than Los Angeles's at bringing jobs closer to blacks, then distance
                                           - 10   -


 to ghetto might have a stronger impact in Los Angeles than in Chicago,
                                                                        even though
 Los Angeles is more residentially integrated. Given the conclusions of the MeCone
 Commission Report on the inadequacy of mass transit in Los Angeles, this is a possibil-
 ity with important implications for policy.
     Comparing each city with itself in an earlier year allows us to summarize changes
 over time in the extent of residential segregation and the effectiveness of urban tran-
 sport systems. As blacks are brought closer to jobs, either by residential integration
 or by transportation improvements1 the impact of distance from ghetto on workplace
demographics should weaken.

Sample Characteristics
     For this study I assembled a longitudinal sample of establishment level data in
1974 and 1980 starting with EEO-1 reports provided by the UFCCP's Division of Pro-
gram Analysis. These in turn were matched against OFCCP internal administrative
records to identify establishments which had undergone a compliance review in the
intervening years. EEO data on establishment demographics in the intervening years
was not available, so no fine dynamic tests can be made. Details of this sample are dis-
cussed in other work. The sample includes establishments in all of the private sector,
although sectors typified by establishments with fewer than 100 employees are under-
represented. Other work compares white-collar with blue-collar workers1 and male
with female. Here we focus in detail on patterns for male blue-collar workers.
    Distance from the ghetto is measured as miles from the center of the
establishment's zip code zone to the border of the central black ghetto in each city,
where contiguous zones with twenty percent or more black residential population are
included within the ghetto. In Los Angeles, this is the contiguous area stretching
across a sixteen mile long oblong in South Central Los Angeles, whose best known
neighborhood is Watts. In Chicago. the ghetto has two lobes: one stretches 7.5 miles
due West from Grant Park, the other runs sixteen miles South from the park. For this
                                         â€”11-

study, the Chicago sample includes establishments within Cook, DuPagc, and Lake
Counties in Illinois; an area sixty-six miles across at its longest. The Los Angeles sam-
pie includes establishments in Los Angeles and Orange Counties in California; an area
whose extremes are seventy-six miles apart. The greater dispersion of establishments
in Los Angeles than in Chicago may be seen in Table 2, which defines the variables
used in the regressions that follow and gives summary statistics for each. The longitu-
dinal samples include 1911 Chicago establishments and 2389 Los Angeles establish-
ments in all industries. The major employment sectors in Los Angeles and their
respective shares of sample establishments are retail trade 34%, manufacturing 33%
and services 14%. In Chicago the respective shares are 25%, 36% and 13%. The average
establishment in Los Angeles is about 1.3 miles further than its Chicago counterpart
from the respective ghetto boundary. The standard error of the mean in both cases is
about .16. so as expected Chicago employment is significantly more concentrated8.
The contrast in local economic conditions in each city is evident in the fact that the
average rate of growth of blue-collar employment between 1974 and 1980 was twice as
great in Los Angeles as in Chicago. It is worth noting that among blue-collar occupa-
tions there is no consistent evidence in this sample of a spatial mismatch in skills, or
that establishments with skill-intensive jobs sort themselves into the suburbs. Before
proceeding, it is also useful to note that blacks' employment share has started at a
higher level and grown faster in Chicago than in in Los Angeles. Hispanics have played
a much larger role in Los Angeles, reflected here in the much sharper drop in white
male share,

Cross-Tabulations by Geographic Zone
    Table 3 presents some of the basic results of this paper in cross-tabulations of
employment data in each city in each year by geographic zone. We classify the estab-
lishments in each city into three geographic zones, show the change over time in
employment in each zone, and ask how employment opportunities for blacks might be
                                         - 12-

affected by changes in the dispersion of total cmploymcnt across zones. The ghetto
includes all establishments in zones that have at least 20 percent black population.
The border includes all establishments within 5 miles of the edge of the ghetto, and
the suburb lies beyond that. The greater suburbanization of employment in Los
Angeles is immediately apparent in the greater proportion of establishments and
employment lying outside the ghetto. This employment suburbanization increased in
both cities, although it is partially offset in Los Angeles by an increase in ghetto
employment in the wake of the discovery of downtown Los Angeles9. In both cities,.
establishment size falls with distance from the central city- perhaps the central city is
no longer the incubator It is also interesting to note that Chicago establishments are
roughly twice the size of their Los Angeles counterparts in every zone. It is important
to realize that employment is growing in every zone in Los Angeles, and growing fastest
in the ghetto. In contrast, employment is falling in every zone in Chicago, except in
the suburbs. In other words, the only new jobs created in the Chicago sample are in
suburban establishments.
    Racial residential patterns are clearly reflected in racial employment patterns.
The proportion of all black employees who are employed in the ghetto is higher in Chi-
cago. and more importantly has increased between 1974 and 1980 in both cities. It is
also important to realize that in both cities blacks' share of employment falls dramati-
cally with distance from the ghetto. By no means do these employment patterns
reveal a homogeneous labor market, or one in which distance between ghetto and
workplace is inconsequential for black employment.
    Consider the implications of Table 3 for the impact of employment decentraliza-
tion on blacks. A simple decomposition identity is:

     Pa=EPB5                                                                          (6)
where PB is the aggregate proportion of blacks among employees, PB, is the black pro-
portion of employment within geographic zone i, and 5 is zone i's share of total
                                          - 13 -

employment.
    We may then use equation 7 to roughly ask two questions. First, what would we
expect black employment to be in Chicago in 1980 if the geographic distribution of
employment had not changed since 1974. If the ghetto and border areas had main-
tained their 1974 share of jobs, we would expect aggregate black male employment
share to be .168 in 1980, or 47551 jobs. This is greater than the actual share of .167
in 1974. and of .165 in 1980. It equals an increase of .05% over actual 1974 jobs, and of
2.05 % over 1980. To carry this rough simulation a step further, the second question is
what would black employment be in Chicago in 1980 if employment were as dispersed
as in Los Angeles in 1980. In this case, black male employment share would fall to
.16 1, or 45,691 jobs, a 4 % decline from the actual 1974 base,
even though it is only 1.3 miles further from the ghetto border to the average estab-
lishment in Los Angeles than in Chicago. Analogously, if Los Angeles employment did
not shift geographically between 1974 and 1980, the imputed black male employment
share is .0572, while if Los Angeles employment were as concentrated as Chicago's in
1980, imputed black male employment share increases to .0905. These are both
greater than the actual black male shares of .0760 in 1974 and .0865 in 1980. The
greater dispersion of employment in Los Angeles than in Chicago. and the dispersion
over time of jobs to the suburbs would seem to work to the detriment of blacks. In Los
Angeles, this effect outweighs the contemporaneous growth of ghetto employment. Of
course these are only rough simulations, and are only partial equilibrium in nature.
Obviously, as jobs move to the suburbs we would expect some blacks Io follow over
time either by moving or commuting. These calculations are presented as rough indi-
cations of expected demand changes facing blacks that set the stage for the more
detailed analysis in the following sections.

The Impact of Distance From the Ghetto in ths Angeles and Chicago

       Table 4 presents estimates of the reduced form equations comparing Los Angeles
and Chicago in the effect of distance in miles from the ghetto on the change in work-
place demographics between 1974 and 1980. These are log-odds estimates, weighted
by establishment size in 1974, of black males' and white males' shares of blue-collar
employment regressed on 1974 share, distance from the ghetto, distance squared, and
a vector of other establishment characteristics including contractor and review
status, size, growth rate, and proportion of craft workers among the blue-collar work-
ers.
       Table 4 shows three interesting patterns. First, distance from the ghetto is the
single strongest and most significant determinant of changes over time in black males'
employment share. Residential segregation is clearly and strongly carried over into
increasing employment segregation over time in both cities. The further the distance
from the ghetto, the greater the loss of black employment share between 1974 and
1980, ceteris paribus. While causation is hardly so simple, the pattern is as if the
ghetto exercised a gravitational pull on blacks. The positive coefficient on the squared
distance term indicates that this negative geographic gradient levels off eventually, as
one would expect. In neither city have racial integration or improvements in tran-
sport systems progressed so far as to make distance from the ghetto irrelevant to the
employment of blacks.
       This marks a significant extension of Rain's work, moving it for the first time from
a static to a dynamic frame. Kain. as well as Offner and Saks, showed that black male
employment share is higher closer to the ghetto. Here we strengthen that early result
by extending it to changes over time: black male employment share increases faster
closer to the ghetto. Moreover, this holds true even in a city where the only overall
employment growth by zone takes place in the suburbs. It is doubtful that this merely
reflects the simultaneous operation of optimal residential location decisions by blacks
                                         - 15-

in a world without residential segregation, in other words that blacks, but not whites,
within a city freely flock to the ghetto for the jobs. The far more plausible alternative
is that residential segregation has limited employment opportunities for blacks. From
a broader perspective, this is also evidence of the generalized tipping behavior under-
lying Kain's thesis10.
    The second notable finding in Table 4 is how similar such dissimilar cities are. In
both cities distance from the ghetto plays a strong role and the coefficients are of the
same order of magnitude despite marked differences in the extent of racial residential
segregation and in the structure of urban transport. The impact of greater residen-
tial integration in Los Angeles may be tempered by the impact of a less effective mass
transportation system for poor blacks who remain in the central ghetto.
     Distance matters greatly in both cities, but it matters more in Chicago. Five miles
from the ghetto border in Chicago, black male employment share between 1974 and
1960 falls by an average of 3.8 percentage points, holding other variables, including
past share, fixed. In Los Angeles the corresponding drop is 2.8 percentage points. Ten
miles out, the drop is 6.8 percentage points in Chicago, compared to 5.1 in Los Angeles.
The third finding in Table 4 is that the detrimental impact of residential segregation
on employment segregation is worse in Chicago. At standard significance levels, F-
tests reject the identity of coefficients on distance terms across equations. Distance
from the ghetto leads to a stronger and more significant reduction in black males'
employment share in Chicago than in Los Angeles. Think of this in a different way: a
new and different measure confirms that residential segregation is worse in Chicago
than in Los Angeles, and worse in ways that may be interpreted as reducing employ-
ment opportunities for blacks11. This last interpretation is not unavoidable, but it is
highly plausible. There is little apparent reason why discriminating employers should
sort themselves along a geographic gradient more perfectly in Chicago than in Los
Angeles. Neither is there compelling reason to believe that black males in Chicago are
                                           - 16-

 happily expressing a stronger preference for life in the ghetto than do their brethren
 in Los Angeles12.


 The Impact on Levels of Employment
    So far we have analyzed the impact of distance on changes over time in employ-
 ment share. Table 5 asks what impact distance has had on the level of employment
 share in each city. Table 6 interprets the effect of distance in Table 5 by showing the
 cumulative change in the level of black male share of blue-collar employment as dis-
 tance from the ghetto increases. Black male employment share falls at a faster rate
 with distance in Chicago than in Los Angeles. At the 99% confidence level, F-tests indi-
 cate that the coefficients on distance terms differ significantly across cities. In 1980
for example, black males' employment share was 12.4 percentage points lower ten
miles from the ghetto than in the ghetto itself in Chicago, but only 9.1 percentage
points lower in Los Angeles. This finding of a steeper geographic gradient in levels of
employment share in Chicago than rn Los Angeles reinforces the finding in Table 4 of a
similar pattern of geographic gradient for changes over time in employment share.
Note that there is no clear reason to expect this steepness to vary with the level of the
initial state. Moreover, the initial state here, the percent black at the border, has
been selected to be of equal magnitude, twenty percent in each city. It is unlikely
then that the gradient is steeper in Chicago simply because the edge of the Chicago
ghetto may be blacker. Again, it is unlikely that the relevant transportation system is
better in Los Angeles, or that discriminating firms sort themselves geographically
more strictly in Chicago than in Los Angeles. A plausible explanation for the steeper
gradient in Chicago is the more intense residential segregation there.
    The interpretation that greater residential integration in Los Angeles has reduced
the potential negative impact on blacks of job dispersion is considerably strengthened
by examining relative travel times in the two cities. The Census of Population and
Housing reveals that the mean 1930 travel time for all workers, and for black workers
                                        - 17-

in particular. is surprisingly lower in Los Angcles than in Chicago. Black workers in
Chicago average 36 minute commutes, 29% greater than the 25 minute average for all
workers. In contrast, the mean commute for Los Angeles black workers is 28 minutes.
only 17% greater than the 24 minute mean for all workers. In other words, while
employment is more dispersed in Los Angeles, so is residential location, including that
of blacks, and it is not obvious that a lack of public transit seriously impedes most
employed blacks in Los Angeles.
   Has the impact of distance from the ghetto changed over time in either city? One
would expect increases in residential integration, which has certainly occurred in Los
Angeles. and possible improvements in urban transport to reduce over time the impor-
tance of distance from ghetto in determining workplace demographics. We do not
observe this. Tables 5 and 6 indicate that there has been some slight decay in Los
Angeles, together with a marked deterioration in Chicago between 1974 and 1950. At
95% confidence levels, the distance effects in both cities are stable over time accord-
ing to F-tests. If employment decentralization changed the gradient over time, we
might expect the Chicago gradient to become more like that in Los Angeles, the proto-
typical decentralized city. Instead, the opposite is occurring: the gradient in Chicago
starts steeper than in Los Angeles and becomes yet steeper over time. This suggests
that to explain the change in the gradient over time we must look beyond employment
decentralization. These cross-section regressions from the longitudinal sample do not
correct for establishment growth, and so may be sensitive to differences across the
cities in the impact of the business cycle and the sectoral decline of manufacturing in
 Chicago. In particular. the recession that was developing in 1980 hurt Chicago more
 than Los Angeles. When combined with the possibility that black males in outlying
 areas have lower seniority on average, this may account for the increasing negative
 impact of distance from the ghetto on black male employment in Chicago between
 1974 and 1980. While caution must be exercised in view of the longitudinal nature of
                                            - 18-

  the sample, the comparison in Table 5 does suggest that over time cetcris paribus, the
  geographic segregation of employment has come to more closely resemble the geo-
  graphic segregation of habitation in Chicago.
       Surprisingly, black male employment in the Chicago sample did collapse towards
  the ghetto between 1974 and 1950, as a return to Table 3 makes clear. In 1974, 33.5
  percent of the black male blue-collar
                                      employees in the Chicago sample worked in
 ghetto establishments. By 1980 this had increased slightly to 34.3 percent. What
 makes this increased concentration of black male blue-collar employment more strik-
 ing is that total blue-collar employment was dispersing at the same time in the same
 sample. 27.4 percent of all blue-collar jobs were in ghetto establishments in 1974, but
 this had fallen to 26.6 in 1980. While the average job in the sample moved farther from
 the ghetto, the average job held by a black mate moved closer. This holds for a fixed
 ghetto border and a fixed sample of establishments over time. If we were to recognize
 the movement of establishments to the suburbs'3 and the expansion of ghetto bord-
 ers. the suburbanization of employment and the concentration of black employment
in the ghetto would be even stronger.
     This striking result comes about because blue-collar employment is in decline
except in the suburbs more than five miles from the ghetto border. Blue-collar
employment fell by 4 percent within the ghetto, fell by 2 percent in the border zone
within five miles of .the ghetto boundary but increased by 2 percent beyond five miles
from the ghetto. Ghetto establishments were in slow decline over these years. What
employment growth there was took place in the suburbs but the number of black
males employed out there actually declined a bit. While 14 percent of all suburban
blue-collar employees were black males in 1974, this fell to 13.5 percent in 1980. In
the border zone, black male share fell from 17.1 to 16.4. Within the ghetto itself, black
male share increased from 20.4 to 22.1, but this was largely oflset by a declining
base14. The result is that while total blue-collar employment fell by a half a percent in

Chicago, black male blue-collar cmploymcnt fcll by two pcrccnt.
   The evidence in this sample is unique and important. For a fixed and extensive
sample of Chicago establishments between 1974 and 1980. the average blue-collar job
moved farther away from the ghetto -because ghetto establishments contracted while
suburban establishments expended- but black males did not follov the jobs. Exactly
how much of the contemporaneous increase in black unemployment this accounts for
remains to be seen. Certainly, it cannot have helped black employment'5.

V. Conclusions
    Our results may be simply summarized. First, distance from the main ghetto is
one of the strongest and most significant determinants of levels and changes in the
racial composition of the workforce. The further away an establishment is from the
ghetto the fewer blacks it employs and the slower the rate at which it adds blacks to
its workforce over time. Residential segregation not only limits where blacks can live,
it also influences where they work. Patterns of residential segregation are strongly
reflected in patterns of employment segregation. This is a phenomena both the courts
 and the OFCCP have only roughly taken into consideration in comparing an employer's
 demographic patterns with those of the local labor market. To approach this from
 another perspective, the results here certainly indicate that neither Title VII nor
 affirmative action, which both tend to consider an SMSA as an undifferentiated geo-
 graphic whole, have yet caused black employment to be as evenly dispersed as are
 jobs across an SMSA.
     Second. the impact of distance from the ghetto on black male employment share
 can be thought of as a summary measure of the extent of residential segregation and
 of the efficacy of urban transport in bridging the gap between jobs and the ghetto.
 The evidence here indicates that distance from the ghetto has had a stronger and
 more significant effect in reducing black male employment in Chicago than in Los
 Angeles. In other words, residential segregation limits black male employment
                                          - 20 -

opportunities more strongly in Chicago than in Los Angeles.
     Third, to the extent that the future is here today in Los Angeles, it does not look
worse for blacks. To the uncertain extent that Los Angeles is a guide, the negative
impact of employment dispersion on blacks may be ameliorated by accompanying
residential dispersion.
    Employment patterns for blacks have been strongly influenced by residential
segregation. Both the rate of growth and the level of black employment share are
higher closer to the ghetto. The efficacy of efforts to integrate the workplace are still
limited by residential segregation.

     See Harrison [1974] and Mills and Price [forthcoming] for a fuller discussion of
     these issues.

4.   For simplicity, this implicitly assumes uniform white wages. Whites are usually
     found to have a negative wage gradient (Straszheim). If we allow for this, then
     black relative wages rise with distance from the ghetto a fortiori. If tastes are
     identical across races, and blacks and whites are perfect substitutes in produc-
     tion, then a finding of a negative relation between black employment share and
     distance from the ghetto, or equivalently a positive relative wage gradient, will
     suggest residential segregation that limits black employment opportunities.
5.   Although there is no evidence that firms chose their location within an SMSA with
     regard to the racial composition of the nearby population. it is not inconceivable
        that firms with strong discriminatory tastes would sort themselves into the
        suburbs. To the extent that this happens, the coefficient on DGHETTO will reflect
        this taste for discrimination as well as the commuting costs for blacks. We con-
        trol for a number of other establishment characteristics that may reduce this
        second effect. For example, we control for whether or not an establishment is a
        federal contractor or has undergone an affirmative action compliance review.
        Although there is no evidence to support it. one might expect discriminating firms
        to avoid federal contracts and their attendant affirmative action obligations, or to
        be the target of a compliance review if they were contractors. More importantly,
        given that both the OFCCP and the courts rarely recognize labor markets finer
        than an SMSA, it is doubtful that firms can escape affirmative action or Title VII
        pressure by moving to the edges of an SMSA.

     6.      Sorenson ct. al. [1974] find
                                        a mean segregation index of 81.6 in a study of 109
             American cities ranging from 57.6 in Cambridge, to 97.4 in
                                                                          Shreveport. The
             Hispanics in Los Angeles lower its
                                                segregation index. Considering just blacks and
            whites, Sorensen et. al. report an index of 93.0 in Chicago and 90.5
                                                                                 in Los Angeles.
            According to this index, Los Angeles is just slightly more integrated
                                                                                    residentially
            than Chicago.
     7.     The log-odds specification is appropriate because the
                                                                     dependent variable
            employment share, is bounded by zero and one. We weight by establishment
                                                                                            size
            to reduce the heteroskedasticity
                                           arising from more precise share data in larger
            establishments The main findings here are not altered in a linear
                                                                              probability
            specification.
 8.        The higher proportion of establishments that have
                                                                     undergone a compliance
           review in Los Angeles is best interpreted as an artifact of the
                                                                           oversampling of DOD
           reviews and the concentration of defense industries in Los
                                                                          Angeles. Note also
           that contractor establishments subject to the affirmative action
                                                                            obligation are no
           more likely to be hiding away in the suburbs in either city. This
                                                                             suggests either
           that the affirmative action obligation is not on net costly to
                                                                            meet, or that all
           establishments within an SMSA are held to the same standard no matter
                                                                                      how far
          from the ghetto they are. Concerning compliance reviews, in both
                                                                           cities they are
          more likely in the border zone than in either the ghetto or the suburbs.
                                                                                        Given
          residential segregation, this may be where they will do the most good,
                                                                                   although I
          doubt this reflects conscious strategy on the part of the OFCCP.
9.        This is not an artifact of our sample. Similar patterns are observed
                                                                           in Census
    data between 1970 and 1980 companng each city with its surrounding SMSA.
10. The log-odds specification used in this paper is singularly
                                                                Hi-suited for tests of
          tipping. In linear regressions of 1980 employment share on 1974 share, its
          square, and other variables, we do not find evidence of tipping within establish-
                                        - 23-

    ments. The higher past share, the smaller the increase in currant share.
11. Note that affirmative action among contractors is effective for blacks even when
    distance from the ghetto is controlled for, although reviews have an insignificant
    perverse effect in Chicago. In both cities, black males share has grown
    significantly faster in contractor than in non-contractor establishments. The
    substitution of white males for Hispanic females in contractor establishments in
    Los Angeles is evidenced by a significant positive impact of contractor status on
    white male employment share, which we would not expect from a fully effective
    program.
12. Regressions not shown here indicate that in Los Angeles manufacturing plants,
    black male share grows faster in union than in non-union plants, even when dis-
    tance from the ghetto is controlled for. Other regressions control for the
    residential proportion black in each estab]ishment's neighborhood, distance from
    the nearest concentration of black population, and the square of each of these
    variables. None of these variables are significant, and their exclusion does not
    appreciably affect the results of interest here. In other words, in Los Angeles dur-
    ing the 1970s, the bone that Offner and Saks picked with Kain isn't on the table.
    We can unambiguously state that residential integration would improve black
    employment opportunities.
13. One might be tempted to use a non-longitudinal sample to focus on newly created
    establishments. Ashenfelter and I-Ieckman carefully document the pitfalls of this
    approach: sample exits and entrances are largely random and are not closely
    related to establishment births and deaths.
14. At the same time, the unweighted average black male share across establishments
    increased in each zone because black employment losses were overrepresented
     at larger establishments.
                                            - 24   -


15.   Returning to the question of affirmative action, the impact of contractor status
      on the, level of black male employment share has increased over Lime in both
      cities. Contractor status has a cumulative erect that grows over Lime as
      employers continue to adjust. Black male employment share increases faster
      among federal contractors subject to afffi-mative action even when detailed
      residential demographics and distance from the main ghetto are controlled for.
      Contractors are not located closer to concentrations of black population in
                                                                                    any
      significant way, as one simultaneity argument would run. By promoting the
      integration of the workplace, affirmative action holds out the promise of reducing
      residential segregation in the long run.
