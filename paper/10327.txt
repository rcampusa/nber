                                           ABSTRACT

We propose a dynamic equilibrium model of a multi-asset market with stochastic volatility and

transaction costs. Our key assumption is that investors are fund managers, subject to withdrawals

when fund performance falls below a threshold. This generates a preference for liquidity that is time-

varying and increasing with volatility. We show that during volatile times, assets' liquidity premia

increase, investors become more risk averse, assets become more negatively correlated with

volatility, assets' pairwise correlations can increase, and illiquid assets' market betas increase.

Moreover, an unconditional CAPM can understate the risk of illiquid assets because these assets

become riskier when investors are the most risk averse.

1        Introduction

Financial assets diﬀer in their liquidity (i.e., the ease at which they can be transacted), and an
important question is how liquidity aﬀects asset prices. One way to get at this question is to
measure the price diﬀerential (liquidity premium) between two assets of diﬀerent liquidity but very
similar other characteristics. Many examples of such asset pairs come from the government bond
market. Consider, for instance, a just-issued (on-the-run) thirty-year US Treasury bond, and a
thirty-year bond issued three months ago (oﬀ-the-run). The two bonds are very similar in terms of
cash ﬂows, but the on-the-run bond is signiﬁcantly more liquid than its oﬀ-the-run counterpart.1

        The analysis of liquid/illiquid asset pairs reveals that liquidity premia vary considerably over
time, widening dramatically during extreme market episodes. A term often used to characterize
these episodes is ﬂight to liquidity, suggestive of the notion that investors experience a sudden and
strong preference for holding liquid assets. An example of such an episode is the 1998 ﬁnancial
crisis. During the crisis, the yield spread between oﬀ- and on-the-run thirty-year US Treasury
bonds increased to 24 basis points (bp), from a pre-crisis value of 4bp. Similar increases occurred
in other on-the-run spreads, as well as in other spreads for which liquidity plays some role.2

        An important factor driving the variation in liquidity premia seems to be the extent of un-
certainty in the market. For example, during the 1998 crisis there was a dramatic increase in
uncertainty, as measured by the implied volatilities of key ﬁnancial indices.3 A link between liq-
uidity premia and volatility has also been empirically documented for less extreme times.4

        In this paper, we propose an equilibrium model in which (i) assets diﬀer in their liquidity, and
(ii) the extent of uncertainty, represented by the volatility of asset payoﬀs, is stochastic. Our model
generates liquidity premia that are time-varying and increasing with volatility. Thus, times of high
volatility are associated with a ﬂight to liquidity.
    1
      For example, Sundaresan (1997, pp.16-18) reports that trading volume for on-the-run bonds is about ten times
as large as for their oﬀ-the-run counterparts. See also Boudoukh and Whitelaw (1991), who document the on-the-run
phenomenon in Japan, and Warga (1992), Krishnamurthy (2002), and Goldreich, Hanke, and Nath (2003), who study
the yield spread between oﬀ- and on-the-run bonds.
    2
      For example, the on-the-run ﬁve-year spread increased from 7bp to 28bp, the ten-year spread from 6bp to 16bp,
and the ten-year spread in the UK from 6bp to 18bp. The spread between AA-rated corporate bonds (for which
default plays only a minor role) and government bonds increased from 80bp to 150bp in the US, and from 60bp
to 120bp in the UK. For more information, and a comprehensive description of the crisis, see the report by the
Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS (1999)).
    3
      According to CGFS (1999), the implied volatility of the S&P500 index increased from 23% to 43%, that of the
FTSE100 index from 27% to 48%, that of the three-month US eurodollar rate from 8% to 33%, and that of the
thirty-year US T-bond rate from 7% to 14%.
    4
      For example, Kamara (1994) considers the yield spread between T-notes and T-bills with matched maturities.
He shows that the spread (which is mainly due to the notes’ lower liquidity) is correlated with interest-rate volatility.
(See also Amihud and Mendelson (1991) and Strebulaev (2003).) Longstaﬀ (2002) considers the yield spread between
the securities of Refcorp, a US government agency, and Treasury securities. He shows that the spread (which is
mainly due to the lower liquidity of the Refcorp securities) is correlated with a consumer conﬁdence index.




                                                           1
       In our model, times of high volatility are associated with several other interesting phenomena,
often mentioned in the context of ﬁnancial crises. We show that during volatile times, investors’
eﬀective risk aversion increases. Thus, there is a ﬂight to quality, in the sense that the risk premium
investors require per unit of volatility increases. We also show that assets become more negatively
correlated with volatility, and can also become more correlated with each other. Moreover, illiquid
assets become riskier, in the sense that their market betas increase. Some of these phenomena
have been documented anecdotally or empirically, and some are new and testable predictions of
our model.5 To our knowledge, our model is the ﬁrst to show that all these phenomena are related,
and are also related to ﬂight to liquidity.

       Finally, our model has the implication that one cost of illiquidity is to make an asset riskier, and
more sensitive to the volatility. We also show that an unconditional CAPM can understate the risk
of illiquid assets because of this risk’s time-varying nature: illiquid assets become riskier in volatile
times, when investors are the most risk averse. This has implications for evaluating the performance
of strategies investing in illiquid assets: if performance is evaluated under an unconditional CAPM,
the strategies could appear better than they actually are.6

       We consider a continuous-time, inﬁnite-horizon economy with one riskless and multiple risky
assets. The riskless rate is exogenous and constant over time. The risky assets’ dividend processes
are exogenous, and are characterized by a common volatility parameter which evolves according to
a square-root process. The volatility parameter is the key state variable in our model.

       The risky assets diﬀer in their liquidity. To model liquidity, we assume that each asset carries
an exogenous transaction cost. These costs diﬀer across assets, and could arise for reasons outside
the model such as asymmetric information, market-maker inventory costs, search, etc. We assume
that transaction costs are constant over time. Thus, the time-varying liquidity premia arise not
because of the transaction costs, but because of the investors’ willingness to bear these costs.

       Our key assumption is in the modelling of investors. We assume that investors are fund man-
agers, managing wealth on behalf of the individuals who own it. Managers receive an exogenous
fee which depends on the amount of wealth under management. They are facing, however, the
probability that the individuals investing in the fund might withdraw their wealth at any time.
Withdrawals occur both for random reasons, and when a fund’s performance falls below an ex-
   5
      Section 5 presents the empirical evidence. Anecdotal evidence for increased risk aversion during volatile times
can be found in the CGFS (1999) report. In page 6, the report describes investment decisions at the onset of the
1998 crisis as follows: “More fundamentally, investment decisions reﬂected some combination of an upward revision
to uncertainty surrounding the expected future prices of ﬁnancial instruments ... and a reduced tolerance for bearing
risk.” The dramatic increases in the yields of speculative-grade corporate bonds and emerging market bonds during the
crisis can also be viewed as evidence for increased risk aversion. Flight-to-quality phenomena are hard to rationalize
within a frictionless representative-investor model, because risk aversion is driven by preferences and should be stable
over short time intervals.
    6
      Strategies long on illiquid assets were followed by many hedge funds prior to the 1998 crisis.


                                                           2
ogenous threshold. Managers choose a risky-asset portfolio to maximize the expected utility they
derive from their fee, taking into account the probability of withdrawals.

       Modelling investors as fund managers subject to performance-based withdrawals generates a
natural link between volatility and preference for liquidity. Indeed, during volatile times, the
probability that performance falls below the threshold increases, and withdrawals become more
likely. Thus, managers are less willing to hold illiquid assets during those times. The notion that
withdrawals from a fund are based on the fund’s performance is closely related to that of the limits
of arbitrage (e.g., Shleifer and Vishny (1997)). It also related to the notion of leverage, whereby a
trader’s levered position must be liquidated when its value falls below a threshold.

       We ﬁrst solve the model in the benchmark case where withdrawals do not depend on perfor-
mance. In that case, we can determine the equilibrium price process of the risky assets in closed
form. (Thus, one contribution of this paper is to derive a simple, closed-form solution for a multi-
asset dynamic equilibrium model with stochastic volatility and transaction costs.) We show that
the assets’ market betas, their pairwise correlations, and the correlations between the assets and
the volatility are all constant over time. Moreover, assets are priced by an unconditional two-factor
CAPM adjusted for transaction costs, where the two factors are the market and the volatility.

       When withdrawals depend on performance, the equilibrium price process can be determined up
to a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. This system can be studied both numerically, and
through closed-form solutions in the special case where the time-variation in volatility is small.

       Because managers are less willing to hold illiquid assets during volatile times, liquidity premia
are increasing with volatility. We show that the eﬀect of volatility on liquidity premia can also be
convex. The intuition is that when volatility is low, managers are not concerned with withdrawals
because the event that performance falls below the threshold requires a movement of several stan-
dard deviations. Thus, liquidity premia are very small, and almost insensitive to volatility. When
volatility increases, however, the probability of withdrawals starts increasing rapidly, and so do the
liquidity premia.7

       Interestingly, volatility can have a convex eﬀect not only on the liquidity premia, but also on
the risk premia. This is because risk premia are aﬀected by the managers’ concern with with-
drawals. Indeed, withdrawals are personally costly to the managers (because the managers’ fee
is reduced), and holding a riskier portfolio makes them more likely by increasing the probability
that performance falls below the threshold. When volatility is low, managers are not concerned
with withdrawals. Thus, the component of the risk premium that corresponds to withdrawals is
very small, and almost insensitive to volatility. That component starts, however, increasing rapidly
   7
    Because the probability is bounded above, it must eventually become concave in the volatility. In Section 4 we
argue, however, that the convexity region is the more relevant.


                                                        3
when volatility increases. Because of the convexity, the managers’ eﬀective risk aversion is higher
during volatile times, and so are the risk premia per unit of volatility.

    The convexity in the risk and liquidity premia generates time-variation in asset correlations
and betas. Indeed, because of the convexity, the volatility shock becomes increasingly important,
relative to the other shocks, in driving asset returns as volatility increases. Thus, during volatile
times, assets move more closely with volatility, and the correlation between returns and volatility
decreases (becoming more negative). Moreover, the pairwise correlation between assets can in-
crease, because assets move more closely with volatility and thus there is greater scope for common
variation. Finally, because of the convexity in the liquidity premia, illiquid assets become increas-
ingly sensitive to volatility, relative to other assets, as volatility increases. Thus, during volatile
times, the negative eﬀect of volatility on the average asset is reﬂected more strongly on illiquid
assets, giving rise to an increased market beta.

    In equilibrium, assets are priced by a conditional two-factor CAPM, but not by its unconditional
version. The unconditional CAPM can understate, in particular, the risk of illiquid assets because
these assets become riskier when investors are the most risk averse.

    Our model has a rich set of empirical implications. Some of the implications are sketched above,
and concern (i) the time-variation of expected returns, betas, correlations, and liquidity premia,
with aggregate volatility, and (ii) the eﬀect of liquidity on cross-sectional expected returns. An
additional set of implications concern the role of a volatility or a liquidity factor in explaining
returns (i.e., liquidity as a risk factor rather than as an asset characteristic). Our model provides a
theoretical foundation to the recent empirical studies that show the presence of such a factor.8 It
also provides insights into the factor’s risk premium and the assets’ loadings along the factor. In
Section 5, we present the empirical implications of our model, and link our results to the empirical
ﬁndings.

    This paper is closely related to the theoretical literature studying the eﬀects of transaction
costs on equilibrium asset prices.9 In most of that literature, liquidity premia are constant over
time. This is because transaction costs are constant, and so are investors’ expected horizons (which
determine the investors’ willingness to bear the transaction costs). Acharya and Pedersen (2003)
assume that transaction costs are time-varying and investors have one-period horizons, and they
show the existence of a liquidity factor. Our work is complementary to theirs, in that we are
   8
     See, for example, Amihud (2002), Acharya and Pedersen (2003), Pastor and Stambaugh (2003), and Sadka (2003),
for a liquidity factor, and Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2003) for a volatility factor.
   9
     See, for example, Amihud and Mendelson (1986), Constantinides (1986), Heaton and Lucas (1996), Vayanos
(1998), Vayanos and Vila (1999), Huang (2002), Acharya and Pedersen (2003), and Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang (2003).
In some of these papers (e.g., Constantinides (1986) and Vayanos (1998)), there is a cross-sectional relationship
between liquidity premia and asset volatility. (See also Duﬃe, Garleanu, and Pedersen (2003), for a similar result in
a setting where transaction costs derive from search.) Volatility, however, is assumed constant over time.

assuming constant transaction costs but time-varying horizons (horizons are determined by the
probability of withdrawals, which depends on the volatility).

       This paper is also related to the literature on delegated portfolio management, and espe-
cially to papers emphasizing the relationship between a fund’s performance and inﬂows. Starks
(1987), Chevalier and Ellison (1997), and Basak, Pavlova, and Shapiro (2003) examine how the
performance-ﬂow relationship aﬀects a fund manager’s behavior in partial equilibrium settings.
Shleifer and Vishny (1997) show that professional arbitrageurs who are subject to a performance-
ﬂow relationship might be unable to bring prices close to fundamentals. This is because when prices
diverge from fundamentals, arbitrageurs realize capital losses, and this leads to an outﬂow of funds
from the arbitrage sector.10 In this paper, we examine the implications of the performance-ﬂow
relationship for the pricing of liquidity.

       Kyle and Xiong (2001) derive some of the same phenomena as in this paper through a wealth
eﬀect. They show that subsequent to a noise shock that depresses prices, arbitrageurs’ wealth
decreases, risk aversion increases, and volatility and asset correlations increase. Danielsson and
Zigrand (2003) derive the increase in risk aversion through value-at-risk (VaR) constraints: sub-
sequent to a noise shock, some traders hit their VaR constraints, and the market’s eﬀective risk
aversion increases. In those papers, assets do not carry any transaction costs. Also, the time-
variation is generated through noise shocks rather than through exogenous changes in uncertainty.

       Scholes (2000) points out that liquid assets have an option-type feature because they give their
owner the option to convert them easily into cash if needed. Thus, liquid assets are more valuable
during volatile times, a result that we show formally in this paper.11 In fact, liquid assets in our
model are similar to out-of-the-money digital options. This is because substituting a liquid asset for
an illiquid one saves the manager the transaction cost of selling the illiquid asset when performance
falls below the threshold, but makes no diﬀerence otherwise.

       The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 considers
the case where withdrawals do not depend on performance, and Section 4 allows withdrawals to
be performance-based. Section 5 presents the model’s empirical implications. Section 6 concludes,
and all proofs are in the Appendix.
  10
     The literature has pointed out several other general-equilibrium implications of delegated portfolio management.
Scharfstein and Stein (1990) show that the fund managers’ desire to signal themselves as high-ability can lead them
to herd on the same asset. Allen and Gorton (1993), Dow and Gorton (1997), and Dasgupta and Prat (2003) show
that the same signalling concern can lead managers to engage in asset churning. Brennan (1993) and Cuoco and
Kaniel (2001) show that benchmarking managers on a subset of available assets can aﬀect these assets’ risk premia
relative to the other assets.
  11
     Scholes’ argument is exposed in more detail in Dunbar (2000, pp.196-197). See also Longstaﬀ (1995), who uses
option-pricing theory to derive an upper bound on the cost of illiquidity.

2         Model

We consider a continuous-time, inﬁnite-horizon economy. The riskless rate is exogenous and equal to
r. There are N risky assets, whose dividends exhibit stochastic volatility. Volatility is characterized
by a parameter vt , which is common to all assets, and evolves according to a square-root process

                                                             √
                                       dvt = γ(v − vt )dt + σ vt dBtv .                                    (1)


The dividend ﬂow δnt of asset n = 1, .., N , evolves according to the process

                                                    √
                           dδnt = κ(δ − δnt )dt +       vt (φn dBt + ψn σdBtv + dBnt ) ,                   (2)


reverting to a long-run mean δ at rate κ, and subject to three independent Brownian shocks dBt ,
dBtv , and dBnt . The shock dBtv is that of the volatility process, and represents systematic volatility
risk. The shock dBt represents residual systematic risk, and dBnt represents idiosyncratic risk. The
eﬀects of the systematic shocks dBt and dBtv are ampliﬁed by the coeﬃcients φn and ψn , which are
speciﬁc to asset n.12 The eﬀects of all shocks are also ampliﬁed by the square root of the volatility
parameter vt . For brevity, we refer to vt simply as the volatility from now on. The assumption that
systematic volatility aﬀects also the idiosyncratic shocks is for simplicity, and plays only a small
role in our analysis.

         Asset n is in supply of Sn shares. Trading these shares is subject to an exogenous cost n per
share, paid by both the buyer and the seller. Thus, asset n can be bought at the price pnt + n , and
sold at pnt − n , where pnt denotes the average of the two prices. We refer to pnt as asset n’s price,
and evaluate an investment in the asset at that price. Transaction costs can diﬀer across assets, and
we refer to assets with low (high) transaction costs as liquid (illiquid). While transaction costs are
taken as exogenous, they could arise for reasons outside the model such as asymmetric information,
market-maker inventory costs, search, etc.

         Our modelling of investors is based on the notion that these are fund managers, subject to
withdrawals that depend on the fund’s performance. We attempt to capture this notion in the
simplest possible manner, to keep our dynamic asset pricing model manageable.

         We denote a fund’s size by Wt , and assume that the manager has full discretion over the
allocation of Wt across assets. The manager cares about fund performance through an incentive
fee that depends on fund size. This fee is exogenous, and accrues to the manager at the rate
aWt , where a is a positive constant. The manager is inﬁnitely lived and has preferences over
    12
   We multiply ψn by σ to ensure that the eﬀects of dBtv on the volatility and the dividend ﬂow are comparable.
We could, of course, eliminate σ by redeﬁning ψn .

intertemporal consumption. Consumption is derived from the fee, and the manager can save or
borrow using the riskless asset. The manager’s preferences are of the CARA type

where ct denotes the consumption rate. There is a continuum of managers with mass one.

    The individuals investing in a fund can decide to withdraw their wealth. For simplicity, we
assume that withdrawals are extreme in that when they occur, a fund’s size is reduced to zero
and all assets are liquidated. Liquidation can occur after poor performance, and also for random
reasons. To motivate our modelling of liquidation, suppose that individuals monitor performance
at discrete times k∆t, where k ∈ Z and ∆t > 0. Suppose further that performance at time t = k∆t
is measured by the change in fund size during the interval [t − ∆t, t].13 (Thus, individuals have
short memories, focusing on performance only in the most recent period.) Suppose ﬁnally that
individuals monitor with probability µ̂, and decide to liquidate if performance is below a threshold
−L̂. Then, liquidation at time t occurs with probability
                                                              
                                        µ̂Prob Wt − Wt−∆t ≤ −L̂ .

                                                            √
We next assume that ∆t is small, and set µ̂ = µ∆t and L̂ = L ∆t. Liquidation then occurs at the
rate µπt , where
                                                            √ 
                                πt ≡ lim Prob Wt − Wt−∆t ≤ −L ∆t .                                              (4)
                                      ∆t→0

To this rate, we add a constant λ, capturing the notion that liquidation can also occur for random
reasons. The rate λ can be arbitrarily small, and its purpose is to ensure that trade occurs even
when µ = 0.

    The limit probability πt depends on the liquidation threshold and the instantaneous variance
of the fund’s portfolio. The latter depends on the fund’s investment in the risky assets, and the
assets’ equilibrium price process. Quite importantly, it also depends on the volatility vt , and it is
this link that generates the manager’s time-varying preference for liquidity. We compute πt as part
of the equilibrium in Section 4.

    After liquidation, a manager starts a new fund whose size is an increasing function of the old
fund’s liquidation value (a low liquidation value might, for example, reduce a manager’s reputation,
and ability to raise the new fund). For simplicity, we assume that the manager starts the new fund
immediately after liquidation, and the new fund’s size is exactly equal to the old fund’s liquidation
   13
      Note that we are measuring performance by the change in fund size, rather than the fund’s return. This is
consistent with the assumption of CARA preferences, since under these preferences the investment in the risky assets
is independent of fund size.

value.14

       We ﬁnally assume that in addition to the liquidating withdrawal, the individuals investing in a
fund perform a continuous withdrawal at the rate (r − a)Wt . This assumption is for simplicity, to
ensure that the total outﬂow while a fund is in operation (i.e., the manager’s fee plus the continuous
withdrawal) is equal to rWt , the annuity value of the fund’s size.

       Some of our assumptions are admittedly quite strong. For example, we are assuming that
the individuals investing in a fund base their liquidation decision only on the fund’s very recent
performance, rather than on a longer-term measure. Moreover, a fund is evaluated in isolation,
rather than relative to other funds (which in equilibrium, have the same performance because they
are holding the same portfolio). A more satisfactory model of liquidation would be based on an
explicit agency problem between rational fund investors and the fund manager. For example, we
could assume that managers diﬀer in their ability, and investors decide to liquidate when they are
suﬃciently convinced that the manager is of low ability.15 Allowing for manager heterogeneity
would, however, complicate the model because managers would hold diﬀerent portfolios. Further-
more, the inferences on ability might depend on a fund’s full history, and this would introduce
additional state variables.

       The assumption that the size of a new fund depends on the old fund’s liquidation value ensures
that managers care about the transaction costs incurred at liquidation. An alternative, and perhaps
less ad-hoc, way to ensure this is to assume that transaction costs are not veriﬁable. That is,
individuals receive the fund’s market value at liquidation (computed using the average of buying
and selling prices), minus a penalty that does not depend on the transaction costs that liquidation
entails. This seems an accurate description of how mutual funds manage withdrawals: investors
are not charged for the speciﬁc transaction costs incurred in selling assets to meet a withdrawal,
but are sometimes charged a ﬁxed withdrawal penalty.

       Our motive in making the above assumptions is not to derive an elaborate model of delegated
portfolio management, but one that is simple enough to embed into a dynamic asset pricing setting.
At the same time, our results should hold under more general assumptions. Suppose, for example,
that managers diﬀer in their ability, and hold diﬀerent portfolios. Then, diﬀerences in relative
performance would increase in volatile times, and so would the probability of liquidation. The
ideas in our model might also apply outside the fund-management context. Suppose, for example,
that investors are holding levered positions. Then, a decrease in the positions’ value could trigger
  14
     Penalizing the manager for liquidation, by assuming that the new fund’s size is lower than the old fund’s liqui-
dation value, would strengthen our results.
  15
     Heinkel and Stoughton (1994) show that performance-based liquidation can be the outcome of optimal contract-
ing. They consider a two-period model, in which managers’ ability is unknown to investors, and managers can exert
unobservable eﬀort. In their model, managers are screened not through their choice of ﬁrst-period contract, but at
the end of that period when they can be ﬁred based on the fund’s performance.

liquidation of assets. Moreover, investors would have a preference for holding liquid assets in volatile
times, when liquidation is more likely.

         Finally, our model is formally equivalent to a representative-investor model with “liquidation
events.” Suppose that a continuum of identical investors manage their own wealth, with preferences
given by (3). Suppose also that these investors are subject to liquidation events which arrive at
the rate λ + µπt , forcing them to liquidate their portfolio and immediately form a new one. Then,
asset prices would be the same is in our fund-manager model, provided that the investors’ risk-
aversion coeﬃcient is equal to αa/r.16 The representative-investor model requires a smaller set
of assumptions than the fund-manager model. (For example, we do not need to introduce the
incentive fee, or distinguish between the fund’s size and the manager’s own wealth.) We use the
fund-manager model, however, because of its more transparent interpretation.17



3         No Performance-Based Liquidation

In this section, we study the equilibrium in the benchmark case where liquidation is not based on
the fund’s performance, but can occur only for random reasons. Liquidation thus occurs at the
constant rate λ, and the monitoring rate µ is equal to zero.


3.1        Equilibrium

An equilibrium is characterized by price processes for the N risky assets, and portfolio policies by the
fund managers. Since managers have CARA preferences, their risky-asset portfolio is independent
of fund size. Thus, all managers hold the same portfolio, which by market clearing is the market
portfolio, i.e., Sn shares of asset n = 1, .., N .

         To determine the equilibrium price process, we must consider the managers’ optimization prob-
lem, and write that the solution to that problem is to hold the market portfolio. A manager is
facing two budget constraints: one describing the evolution of the fund’s size and one the evolution
    16
      The modiﬁed risk-aversion coeﬃcient is because the investors consume the annuity value of their wealth, rWt ,
while the managers’ consumption is derived from the incentive fee aWt .
   17
      Our model can also be given an interpretation based on value-at-risk (VaR) constraints. Suppose that a trader’s
position is liquidated if the trader breaches a VaR constraint, and if the trader’s superiors happen to monitor the
position. Since a VaR constraint is of the form πt ≤ π, the position is liquidated at a rate F (πt ), where F (πt ) = 0
if πt ≤ π, and F (πt ) = µ if πt > π. Thus, the liquidation rate is a monotone transformation of πt . Note that under
the VaR interpretation, the assumption that performance is evaluated over a very short time interval becomes quite
natural.

where xnt denotes the number of shares invested in asset n. The ﬁrst term in equation (5) is the

where x+       −
       nt and xnt denote the investment in asset n by the new and the old fund, respectively. The
fund size decreases due to the transaction costs incurred in liquidation and in establishing new
positions.

       The manager’s own wealth wt evolves according to


                                              dwt = (rwt + aWt − ct ) dt,                                             (7)


where the ﬁrst term is the return on wealth (the manager can save or borrow using the riskless
asset), the second is the fee, and the third is the consumption. The manager chooses the fund’s
risky-asset portfolio (x1t , .., xN t ) and his own consumption ct to maximize the utility (3), subject
to the constraints (5)-(7) and a no-Ponzi condition stated in the Appendix.

       To simplify the analysis of the manager’s optimization problem, we make a conjecture as to the
form of the equilibrium price process. We conjecture that in equilibrium, the price process of asset
n is of the form
                                                      δ δnt − δ
                                              pnt =     +       − qn (vt ),                                           (8)

for some function qn (vt ). The intuition for equation (8) is very simple. The ﬁrst two terms represent
the present value of expected dividends discounted at the riskless rate. This present value depends
on the long-run mean, δ, of the dividend ﬂow, and the deviation, δnt − δ, between the dividend ﬂow
and the long-run mean. Since the deviation is temporary, it has a smaller impact on the present
value. The third term, qn (vt ), measures the extent to which the price is discounted relative to
the present value. It is a combination of a risk and a liquidity premium, and is a function of the

    We are restricting attention to processes xnt that are diﬀerentiable almost everywhere. This is without loss since
in equilibrium the process xnt is constant (and equal to Sn ).

    Using the conjectured form of the price process, we can simplify the budget constraint (5). To
state the budget constraint in its simpler form, we introduce some notation that we use throughout
this paper. For a risky-asset portfolio xt ≡ (x1t , .., xN t ), we denote by

    Lemma 1 shows that the drift of the fund’s size is determined by the price discount of the fund’s
portfolio, and the price discount’s own drift. The diﬀusion is, in turn, determined by the diﬀusion


                                                            11
of the present value of the portfolio’s expected dividends, and the diﬀusion of the portfolio’s price
discount. Note that neither the drift nor the diﬀusion involve the assets’ dividend ﬂows {δnt }n=1,..,N .
Thus, dividend ﬂows do not appear as state variables in the manager’s optimization problem, and
do not inﬂuence the manager’s optimal risky-asset portfolio. Because of CARA preferences, the
optimal portfolio is also independent of fund size, and can thus only depend on the volatility vt .
Writing that the optimal portfolio is independent of vt (and equal to the market portfolio, i.e.,
xt = S) is what determines the functions {qn (vt )}n=1,..,N .

      To solve the manager’s optimization problem, we must consider the maximum utility that the
manager can achieve under the equilibrium price process (i.e., the value function). We conjecture
that it is of the form
                                V (Wt , wt , vt ) = − exp [−A [Wt + zwt + Z(vt )]] ,                    (15)

where A ≡ αa, z ≡ r/a, and Z(vt ) is a function of vt . Utility over the wealth variables (i.e.,
the fund’s size Wt and the manager’s own wealth wt ) is of the CARA type, as is the utility over
consumption. Utility is more sensitive to the manager’s own wealth than the fund’s size as long as
r > a, i.e., the manager’s fee is lower than the annuity value of the fund’s size. Utility also depends
on the volatility vt , because vt aﬀects the manager’s investment opportunity set.

      The manager’s ﬁrst-order condition takes a simple and intuitive form. Deﬁne the instantaneous
return on asset n as
                                           dRnt ≡ dpnt + δnt dt − rpnt dt.

This return is per share (i.e., is the dollar return times the share price), and is in excess of the
riskless rate. Deﬁne also the instantaneous return on the market portfolio as

                                                          N
                                                          
                                                dRM t ≡         Sn dRnt .
                                                          n=1


This return is again per share, and the market portfolio is treated as one big share. The manager’s
ﬁrst-order condition (i.e., that holding the market portfolio is optimal) is


       Et (dRnt ) = ACovt (dRnt , dRM t ) + AZ  (vt )Covt (dRnt , dvt ) + [r + 2λ exp(2A)] n dt.19   (16)


Equation (16) is a conditional two-factor CAPM, adjusted for transaction costs. Asset n’s expected
return is determined by the asset’s covariance with the market portfolio, the covariance with volatil-
ity, and the asset’s transaction costs. The covariance with volatility matters because vt enters into
the value function, introducing a hedging demand. Transaction costs increase the asset’s return
 19
      We derive this ﬁrst-order condition as part of the proof of Proposition 1.




                                                           12
because the manager must be compensated for incurring these costs every time liquidation occurs.
From now on, we refer to the adjustment for transaction costs as the asset’s liquidity premium,
and to the covariance terms as the asset’s risk premium.

   The ﬁrst-order condition (16) can be written as an ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE), in-
volving the functions {qn (vt )}n=1,..,N and Z(vt ). In the proof of Lemma 1, we show that asset n’s
return is

                                                                 1

Multiplying equation (17) by Sn , and adding over assets, we ﬁnd that the return on the market
portfolio is

There are N ODEs (19), one for every risky asset. An additional ODE can be derived by the
manager’s Bellman equation. Taken together, these constitute a system of N + 1 ODEs for the
functions {qn (vt )}n=1,..,N and Z(vt ). In the case of no performance-based liquidation, this system
has a simple, aﬃne solution.

The coeﬃcients q1 ≡        n=1 Sn qn1   and Z1 are positive.


      The coeﬃcient qn0 is the average value of asset n’s price discount qn (vt ) (since E(vt ) = v).
The discount arises because of asset n’s risk premium and liquidity premium. The risk premium
is reﬂected in the ﬁrst term of equation (21). Asset n’s risk is measured by the parameters φn
(sensitivity of dividend ﬂow to residual systematic risk), ψn (sensitivity of dividend ﬂow to volatility
risk), qn1 (sensitivity of price discount to volatility risk), and Sn (asset supply), since these determine
the asset’s covariance with the market portfolio and the volatility. The liquidity premium is reﬂected
in the second term of equation (21). This premium is increasing in asset n’s transaction costs n ,
and in the liquidation rate λ. It is also increasing in the costs  of liquidating the overall portfolio
because high costs make liquidation a bad outcome, increasing the marginal utility associated with
it.

      The coeﬃcient qn1 measures the sensitivity of asset n’s price discount to changes in the volatility.
Volatility aﬀects the discount because it aﬀects the risk premium. Thus, qn1 depends on the
characteristics of asset n that determine the risk premium, i.e., φn , ψn , and Sn . It also depends on
the rate γ at which volatility reverts to its long-run mean: a high γ means that volatility shocks
are transitory and have a small eﬀect on the discount.

      In the case of no performance-based liquidation, the liquidation rate is independent of the
volatility, and so is the liquidity premium. Thus, the coeﬃcient qn1 does not depend on asset’s n’s


                                                          14
transaction costs n . In other words, transaction costs do not introduce any variation in an asset’s
price, and do not aﬀect the asset’s risk premium. This will no longer be the case when liquidation
is performance-based.


3.2   Betas and Correlations

We next compute asset betas and correlations. We show that in the case of no performance-
based liquidation, conditional betas and correlations are independent of the volatility, and are
thus constant over time. Furthermore, the constant values of these variables coincide with the
unconditional betas and correlations. These results provide a simple benchmark for our subsequent
analysis: for example, any dependence of the conditional betas on volatility can be only because
liquidation is performance-based.

   For each asset n, we consider the conditional beta w.r.t. the market portfolio:

                                        M       Covt (dRnt , dRM t )
                                       βnt ≡                         ,
                                                  Vart (dRM t )

the conditional beta w.r.t. the volatility:

                                          v      Covt (dRnt , dvt )
                                         βnt ≡                      ,
                                                   Vart (dvt )

the conditional correlation with any other asset m:

                                                 Covt (dRmt , dRnt )
                                  ρmnt ≡                                  ,
                                               Vart (dRmt )Vart (dRnt )

and the conditional correlation with the volatility:

                                              Covt (dRnt , dvt )
                                     ρvnt ≡                         .
                                             Vart (dRnt )Vart (dvt )

We also consider the unconditional counterparts of these betas and correlations, and denote them
without the subscript t. In the case of no performance-based liquidation, conditional betas and
correlations are independent of the volatility, and are thus constant over time.

Proposition 2 For µ = 0, conditional betas and correlations are independent of vt .

   The intuition behind the proposition can be seen from equation (17) which determines the
return on an asset:

                                                             1
               dRnt =       rqn (vt ) − qn (vt )γ(v − vt ) − qn (vt )σ 2 vt dt
                                                             2

                                                      15
                                √        φn        ψn                      1
                               + vt         dBt +     − qn (vt ) σdBtv +     dBnt .

The diﬀusion component of the return is generated by the three shocks dBt , dBtv , and dBnt . Quite
crucially, the relative eﬀects of these shocks are independent of the volatility, and are thus constant
over time. Indeed, the relative eﬀects of dBt to dBtv to dBnt are
                                                                      
                                       φn          ψn                       1
                                                      − qn (vt ) σ            ,                                   (24)
                                      r+κ         r+κ                      r+κ

and are constant because the function qn (vt ) is aﬃne. Since the relative eﬀects are constant and the
                                            √
multiplicative eﬀect of the volatility is in vt , the conditional covariance matrix of returns is equal
to a constant matrix times vt . The same applies to the conditional covariance matrix of returns
                                                                     √
and volatility because the diﬀusion component of the volatility is in vt . Since conditional betas
and correlations are homogeneous functions of degree zero in the elements of the latter matrix, they
are independent of vt .

    Two assumptions of our model are critical for Proposition 2. The ﬁrst is that the relative eﬀects
of the shocks dBt , dBtv , and dBnt on the dividend ﬂow are independent of the volatility. This ensures
that the shocks’ relative eﬀects on the present value of expected dividends are constant. The second
assumption is that vt follows a square-root process. This ensures that the diﬀusion component of
                                      √
the aﬃne price discount qn (vt ) is in vt , as are those of the present value of expected dividends,
and of the volatility itself. While our assumptions are plausible, they are also special, and one
could envision plausible alternatives.20 An advantage of these assumptions, however, is to provide
a simple benchmark for isolating the new eﬀects introduced by performance-based liquidation.

    We next consider the unconditional betas and correlations, which are determined by the uncon-
ditional covariance matrix of returns and volatility. In continuous time, an unconditional covariance
is the expectation of its conditional counterpart. Indeed, since


                                Cov(dXt , dYt ) = E(dXt dYt ) − E(dXt )E(dYt ),


and the second term is negligible relative to the ﬁrst, we have


                  Cov(dXt , dYt ) = E(dXt dYt ) = E [Et (dXt dYt )] = E [Covt (dXt , dYt )] .                      (25)


Therefore, the unconditional covariance matrix of returns and volatility is the expectation of the
  20
     One alternative is that the systematic volatility vt does not aﬀect the idiosyncratic shocks. Under this assumption,
the pairwise correlations between assets would increase in vt , and so would the correlation between an asset and vt .
(Since with high systematic volatility, idiosyncratic shocks would have small relative eﬀects.) Asset betas would,
however, be independent of vt , and so would the correlation between vt and the market portfolio. (Assuming, of
course, a large number of assets, so that idiosyncratic shocks have no eﬀect on the market portfolio return.)


                                                           16
conditional covariance matrix. Since the latter is equal to a constant matrix times vt , the former is
equal to the same constant matrix times the expectation of vt . Therefore, the unconditional betas
and correlations coincide with their conditional counterparts.


Proposition 3 For µ = 0, unconditional betas and correlations coincide with their conditional
counterparts.


3.3     Expected Returns

In equilibrium, expected returns are determined by a conditional two-factor CAPM, adjusted for
transaction costs. This CAPM is given by equation (16), and the two factors are the market and
the volatility. In Lemma 2, we restate this CAPM, using the asset betas instead of the covariances.


Lemma 2 In equilibrium, conditional expected returns are given by

                                  M          v
                                                                           
                     Et (dRnt ) = βnt ΛM t + βnt Λvt + [r + 2λ exp(2A)] n dt,                  (26)


where                                                      2                
                                   φ2             ψ               2    S2
                      ΛM t   ≡A          +           − q1        σ +            vt ,
                                (r + κ)2         r+κ                 (r + κ)2

                                          Λvt ≡ AZ1 σ 2 vt .


   Starting from the conditional CAPM, we can easily derive an unconditional CAPM. Since
conditional and unconditional betas coincide, the unconditional CAPM follows immediately by
taking expectations in the conditional CAPM equation.


Proposition 4 In equilibrium, unconditional expected returns are given by

                                                                       
                       E(dRnt ) = βnM ΛM + βnv Λv + [r + 2λ exp(2A)] n dt,                     (27)


where ΛM ≡ E(ΛM t ) and Λv ≡ E(Λvt ).


   Proposition 4 implies that an asset’s risk can be characterized completely by two coeﬃcients:
the unconditional market and volatility betas. This result provides a benchmark for the analysis
of performance-based liquidation, where the characterization of asset risk is more complicated.

   The coeﬃcients ΛM and Λv are the factor risk premia. The volatility risk premium arises
because of the managers’ hedging demand, i.e., because volatility aﬀects the managers’ investment
opportunity set. When volatility is zero, all assets have the same return as the riskless asset,

                                                  17
and thus the opportunity set is equivalent to that asset. An increase in volatility improves the
opportunity set because managers have more options. Therefore, holding wealth constant, managers
are better oﬀ with high volatility. (Formally, Proposition 1 shows that Z1 , the derivative of the
function Z(vt ) which characterizes the eﬀect of volatility on the value function, is positive.) This
implies that holding the covariance with the market portfolio constant, managers prefer assets that
pay oﬀ when volatility is low. Thus, assets that are positively correlated with volatility carry a
positive premium, and this means that the volatility risk premium is positive.21



4     Performance-Based Liquidation

In this section, we allow for liquidation to be based on the fund’s performance. We assume that the
monitoring rate µ is positive, so that the liquidation rate λ + µπt depends on the probability πt of
poor performance. The probability πt depends on the equilibrium price process, and we compute
it below as part of the equilibrium.


4.1    Equilibrium

We conjecture that the equilibrium price process takes the same form as in the case of no performance-
based liquidation: it is given by equation (8), for a possibly diﬀerent set of discount functions
{qn (vt )}n=1,..,N . Given this process, we can compute the probability πt of poor performance. Re-
call from equation (4) that πt is the probability that the change Wt − Wt−∆t in fund size over the
                                                    √
small interval [t − ∆t, t] is below the threshold −L ∆t. The change in fund size is approximately

Equations (28) and (29) determine the probability πt of poor performance. This probability depends
on the instantaneous variance zt of the fund’s portfolio, through the function g(zt ). In turn, zt
depends on the volatility vt , the fund’s investments xt , and the equilibrium discount functions
  21
     The result that managers prefer assets that pay oﬀ when the investment opportunity set is poor follows because
of CARA preferences. It also holds for an investor with CRRA preferences, provided that risk aversion is greater
than in the logarithmic case.

{qn (vt )}n=1,..,N . In what follows, we often denote πt by π(vt , xt ) and zt by z(vt , xt ), to emphasize
the dependence on vt and xt . We also set π(vt ) ≡ π(vt , S) and z(vt ) ≡ z(vt , S).

       Figure 1 plots πt as a function of zt . For small values of zt , πt cannot be distinguished from
zero, because the event that performance falls below the threshold requires a movement of several
standard deviations. As zt increases, πt moves away from zero, and increases in an approximately
linear manner. For larger values of zt , πt becomes concave. This concavity is necessary because πt
must converge to 1/2 when zt goes to inﬁnity: for large portfolio variance, performance falls below
the threshold with almost any negative movement.

       The convexity or concavity of πt matters for some of our results. For example, market betas
of illiquid assets, as well as asset correlations, increase with volatility only when the latter takes
values in the region where πt is convex. This makes it important to determine whether the convexity
region is the more relevant.

       The convexity region is consistent with the intuitive notion that liquidations are rare during
normal times but pick up dramatically in volatile, crisis times. A more detailed argument in
support of convexity can be constructed by mapping our model more closely to the real world.
A simplifying, and somewhat unrealistic, feature of our model is that liquidation is based only
on a fund’s very recent (“current”) performance. Suppose instead that liquidation is based on a
longer-term performance measure, to which current performance contributes only slightly. Then,
current performance has a small impact on the liquidation probability, except in two cases. The
ﬁrst is when past performance has already brought the fund close to liquidation. More to our point,
the second case is when current volatility is high, because current performance can then contribute
signiﬁcantly to the long-term measure. Consider now the liquidation probability as a function of
current volatility (for an average level of past performance). This probability is almost independent
of volatility when volatility is low, and increases for larger values, thus being convex.22

       In what follows, we give greater emphasis to the results obtained in the convexity region (while
also noting that some results hold in both regions). This is primarily because the convexity region
seems the more relevant. Relevance aside, the results requiring convexity can also be viewed as a
set of joint predictions such that if one holds, all others should hold as well.

       When liquidation is performance-based, the manager’s ﬁrst-order condition is


                      Et (dRnt ) = ACovt (dRnt , dRM t ) + AZ  (vt )Covt (dRnt , dvt )
                                                           exp(2A) − 1

                                                                A
  22
    A diﬀerent way to phrase this argument is that when liquidation is based on a long-term performance measure,
to which current performance contributes only slightly, it takes an extremely high value of current volatility to get
into the concavity region.



                                                         19

Compared to the case of no performance-based liquidation (equation (16)), there are two diﬀerences.
First, the liquidation rate used in computing the liquidity premium (i.e., the last term in the RHS) is
λ+µπ(vt ) instead of λ. Second, there is a new term (third term in the RHS) involving the derivative
of the probability of poor performance w.r.t. the investment in asset n. This term is a risk premium
that arises because of the manager’s concern with liquidation: increasing the investment in asset n
aﬀects the risk of the fund’s overall portfolio, thus aﬀecting the probability that performance falls
below the threshold. We refer to this term as a liquidation risk premium, to distinguish it from the
standard risk premium that arises because of the risk aversion in the manager’s utility function.
(The standard risk premium corresponds to the ﬁrst two terms in the RHS).

   Using equations (28) and (29), we can write the liquidation risk premium as

                                              exp(2A) − 1
                             2µg  [z(vt )]                Covt (dRnt , dRM t ).                  (31)
                                                   A

The liquidation risk premium involves the covariance between asset n and the market portfolio,
exactly as the standard risk premium. This might seem surprising, given that liquidation is a tail
event. The intuition is that because performance is evaluated over a short interval, asset returns
are normal, and thus variance is the only measure of risk.

   Substituting equation (31) into (30), we ﬁnd


                  Et (dRnt ) = A(vt )Covt (dRnt , dRM t ) + AZ  (vt )Covt (dRnt , dvt )
                                  + [r + 2[λ + µπ(vt )] exp(2A)] n dt,                          (32)


where
                                                              exp(2A) − 1
                                A(vt ) ≡ A + 2µg  [z(vt )]                .                      (33)
                                                                   A
The manager’s ﬁrst-order condition takes the form of a conditional CAPM adjusted for transaction
costs, as in the case of no performance-based liquidation. The existence of the liquidation risk
premium, however, modiﬁes the coeﬃcient multiplying the covariance with the market portfolio.
When liquidation is not performance-based, the covariance is multiplied by A, the coeﬃcient of
absolute risk aversion of the manager’s value function. When liquidation is performance-based,
the coeﬃcient becomes A(vt ), and it incorporates both the risk aversion inherent in the manager’s
preferences, and that arising because of the concern with liquidation. From now on, we refer to
A(vt ) as an eﬀective risk-aversion coeﬃcient.




                                                       20
       The coeﬃcient A(vt ) increases with volatility in the convexity region of Figure 1.23 Intuitively,
when volatility is low, managers are not concerned with liquidation because the event that per-
formance falls below the threshold requires a movement of several standard deviations. When
volatility increases, however, liquidation becomes a concern, and managers choose their portfolios
in a more risk-averse fashion.

       The result that eﬀective risk aversion can increase with volatility is consistent with anecdotal
descriptions of ﬂight-to-quality phenomena, i.e., of sharp increases in the market’s risk aversion
during periods of turmoil. (See Footnote 5 for references.) Such phenomena are hard to rationalize
within a frictionless representative-investor model, because risk aversion is driven by preferences and
should be stable over short time intervals. They can, however, be readily generated in our model:
risk aversion increases during volatile times because managers become concerned with liquidation.24

       The ﬁrst-order condition (32) is equivalent to an ODE, as in the case of no performance-based
liquidation. As in that case, there is one ODE for every asset, and one following from the Bellman
equation. These N + 1 ODEs determine the functions {qn (vt )}n=1,..,N and Z(vt ). In Proposition 9
(stated in the Appendix), we characterize the equilibrium and derive the ODEs.

       The ODEs are quite complicated because they involve the cumulative distribution function of
the normal distribution. To determine the functions {qn (vt )}n=1,..,N and Z(vt ), we focus on the
special case where the parameter σ, which determines the volatility of volatility, is small. In this
case, volatility stays close to its long-run mean v, and we can solve the ODEs in closed form by
approximating all functions by Taylor expansions. The solutions provide signiﬁcant insight into the
qualitative properties of the equilibrium. To study the quantitative properties, we need to solve
the ODEs numerically for general values of σ. We plan to do so in a companion paper where we
will calibrate the model.25

       For our analysis, it suﬃces to consider Taylor expansions up to the second order. We thus set

                                                                 1
                                  qn (vt ) = qn0 + qn1 (vt − v) + qn2 (vt − v)2 ,                                  (34)
                                                                 2
  23
     This is because z(vt ) is increasing in vt , and g  (zt ) is increasing in zt in the convexity region.
  24
     At a methodological level, our model shows that asset-pricing formulas derived in the presence of constraints
(e.g., liquidation) can be equivalent to formulas without constraints, but with modiﬁed preference parameters. At
the same time, we show that constraints cannot be ignored, because the modiﬁed parameters can have properties
that are hard to rationalize based on preferences. (In particular, the eﬀective risk-aversion coeﬃcient A(vt ) depends
on the volatility.) Other models with constraints also have implications along those lines. For example, Grossman
and Vila (1992) show that a portfolio problem with leverage constraints is equivalent to an unconstrained problem in
which the investor’s risk-aversion coeﬃcient is diﬀerent. Basak and Cuoco (1998) show that representative-investor
pricing holds even when markets are incomplete, provided that the investor’s utility function is constructed using
stochastic weights.
  25
     The ODEs become simpler to solve if g(zt ) is replaced by a piecewise-linear function (which from Figure 1 is not
a bad approximation), and the interest rate r is assumed small relative to the rate γ at which volatility reverts to its
long-run mean. In that case, the ODEs are of the Ricatti type, and solutions can be derived in terms of the Gamma
and Kummer functions.

       The main diﬀerence relative to the case of no performance-based liquidation is in the coeﬃcients
qn1 and qn2 . The coeﬃcient qn1 measures the average sensitivity of asset n’s price discount to
changes in the volatility (since E [qn (vt )] = qn1 + qn2 E(vt − v) = qn1 ). One reason why volatility
aﬀects the discount is because it aﬀects asset n’s risk premium. This eﬀect is as in the case of
no performance-based liquidation, with the diﬀerence that the risk premium now consists of the
standard and the liquidation risk premium. The eﬀect of volatility on the risk premium corresponds
to the ﬁrst term in equation (37): the two terms in the bracket capture the two components of the
risk premium, and both are multiplied by the coeﬃcient z n which is the instantaneous covariance
between asset n and the market portfolio.

       A second reason why volatility aﬀects the discount is because it increases the liquidity premium.
This is a key new eﬀect introduced by performance-based liquidation. The intuition is that at times
of high volatility, there is an increased probability that performance falls below the threshold. Thus,
liquidation is more likely, and this reduces a manager’s willingness to invest in illiquid (i.e., high
transaction cost) assets. The eﬀect of volatility on the liquidity premium corresponds to the second
term in equation (37). This term is increasing in asset n’s transaction costs n , meaning that
volatility has a greater impact on the discount of illiquid assets.

       The coeﬃcient qn2 measures the convexity of the price discount, i.e., how the price discount’s
  26
    Since the Taylor expansions are up to the second order, and vt − v is of the same order as σ, the coeﬃcients qn0
and Z0 can be determined up to order two in σ, qn1 and Z1 up to order one, and qn2 and Z2 up to order zero.


                                                        22
sensitivity to volatility changes with volatility. In the case of no performance-based liquidation, qn2
is zero because the price discount is aﬃne. Performance-based liquidation can introduce convexity
through the liquidation risk premium and the liquidity premium. Intuitively, both premia are very
small, and almost insensitive to volatility, when volatility is low and liquidation is not a concern.
For larger values of volatility, however, liquidation becomes a concern, and the two premia start
increasing rapidly.

       More precisely, the liquidity premium is convex in the volatility when the probability of poor
performance is convex, and the liquidation risk premium is convex when the marginal increase
in that probability, by taking more risk, is convex. Recall from Figure 1 that the probability of
poor performance is convex when the risk of the fund’s portfolio is small relative to the liquidation
threshold. The exact condition is that , the number of standard deviations required to reach the
                  √
threshold, exceeds 3 ≈ 1.73. Under this condition, the second term in equation (38) is positive.
The marginal increase in the probability of poor performance is convex under the more restrictive
condition      > 2.34, which ensures that the ﬁrst term in equation (38) is positive.27

       Since the liquidity premium depends on the volatility, it accounts for a fraction of asset-price
movements, thus adding to the risk in an asset’s return. This risk is priced because it is systematic.
Thus, transaction costs have not only a direct eﬀect on returns through the liquidity premium, but
also an indirect eﬀect through the risk premium. In other words, assuming that transaction costs
aﬀect returns only through the liquidity premium (as is implicitly done in several empirical studies)
would understate their impact. We return to this point in Section 5, where we present the model’s
empirical implications.


4.2      Betas and Correlations

When liquidation is performance-based, conditional betas and correlations depend on the volatility,
and are thus time-varying. In this section, we characterize the dependence on volatility for small σ.
We show, in particular, that convexity of the assets’ price discounts, together with the assumption
that volatility aﬀects asset returns negatively, imply several interesting and testable properties: the
correlation between an asset and the volatility becomes more negative when volatility increases,
the pairwise correlation between similar assets increases with volatility, and the market betas of
illiquid assets increase with volatility.


Proposition 6 For small σ:
  27
    Convexity of the liquidity premium requires the probability of poor performance to be convex in the volatility.
In Figure 1, however, that probability is treated as a function of the instantaneous variance of the fund’s portfolio.
We do not emphasize the diﬀerence √  because for small σ, convexity under one variable implies convexity under the
other, and they both hold when  > 3.

                                                                       
                          φn            ψn                                   1
                                           − [qn1 + qn2 (vt − v)] σ             .

When liquidation is performance-based, the relative eﬀects depend on the volatility because the
price discount is not aﬃne. To illustrate the role of volatility, we focus on the case where the
average eﬀect of the volatility shock dBtv is negative. This amounts to assuming that

                                                  ψn
                                          χn ≡       − qn1 < 0,
                                                 r+κ

i.e., any positive eﬀect of volatility on asset n’s dividend ﬂow is dominated by the negative eﬀect
on the price discount.

   Suppose now that asset n’s price discount is convex (qn2 > 0). Then, the negative eﬀect of
volatility on asset n’s return becomes even more negative at times of high volatility. At those
times, the volatility shock plays a greater role relative to the other shocks in driving asset n’s
return, and the asset moves more closely with volatility. Thus, the correlation between the asset
and the volatility becomes more negative (i.e., decreases), as the ﬁrst result of the proposition
shows.



                                                     24
       The second result concerns the pairwise correlation between assets. One would expect this cor-
relation to increase with volatility when (i) volatility aﬀects asset returns negatively (χn < 0), and
(ii) price discounts are convex (qn2 > 0): these conditions ensure that at times of high volatility
assets move more closely with volatility, and thus there is more scope for common variation. Con-
ditions (i) and (ii) are, however, not fully suﬃcient. Suppose, for example, that asset m is almost
insensitive to volatility, i.e., χm and qm2 are close to zero, and φm = φn . Then, the volatility shock
does not aﬀect the covariance between assets m and n, but its relative impact on asset n’s variance
increases with volatility. Thus, the correlation decreases with volatility (as can also be conﬁrmed
from equation (39)). Conditions (i) and (ii) ensure that the correlation increases with volatility
when, for example, χm /φm ≈ χn /φm , i.e., assets m and n are similar in terms of the relative eﬀects
that the two systematic shocks have on their returns.

       The third result of the proposition is that the market betas of illiquid assets increase with
volatility when (i ) volatility is negatively correlated with the return on the market portfolio (χ < 0),
and (ii ) the market portfolio’s price discount is convex (q2 > 0).28 To explain the intuition, we
examine how the eﬀect of volatility on an asset’s market beta depends on the characteristics of the
asset’s price discount.

       First, the eﬀect depends on the discount’s convexity. Suppose, for example, that asset n’s con-
vexity exceeds that of the average asset. Then, as volatility increases, asset n’s negative sensitivity
to volatility increases faster than that of the average asset. Thus, at times of high volatility, the
negative eﬀect of volatility on the average asset (χ < 0) is reﬂected more strongly on asset n, giving
rise to an increased market beta.

       Second, the eﬀect depends on the discount’s average sensitivity to volatility. When the market
portfolio’s price discount is convex (q2 > 0), the fraction of market movements driven by volatility
increases with volatility. Then, if asset n’s sensitivity to volatility exceeds that of the average asset,
asset n exhibits greater common variation with the market at times of high volatility, and has an
increased market beta.

    Illiquid assets have exactly the properties that lead to an increased market beta at times of high
                                                                                                √
volatility. Recall that liquidity premia are increasing in volatility, and are convex when > 3, a
condition which is satisﬁed when q2 > 0. Since illiquid assets carry greater liquidity premia than
liquid assets, their price discounts are more sensitive to volatility, and more convex than those of
liquid assets. Thus, the market betas of illiquid assets increase with volatility.

                                                                   25
4.3      Expected Returns

In equilibrium, expected returns are determined by a conditional two-factor CAPM, adjusted for
transaction costs. This is as in the case of no performance-based liquidation. The complication rel-
ative to that case arises in deriving an unconditional CAPM. When liquidation is not performance-
based, conditional betas are constant over time and equal to the unconditional betas. Thus, an
unconditional CAPM follows immediately by taking expectations in the conditional CAPM equa-
tion. When liquidation is performance-based, this no longer applies because the conditional betas
depend on the volatility.

       To characterize unconditional expected returns, we take expectations in equation (32).29 Using
equation (25) and the fact that


                                    E(XY ) = E(X)E(Y ) + Cov(X, Y ),


we ﬁnd

                                                              
        E(dRnt ) = E [A(vt )] Cov(dRnt , dRM t ) + E AZ  (vt ) Cov(dRnt , dvt )
                                                                                          
                   +Cov [A(vt ), Covt (dRnt , dRM t )] + Cov AZ  (vt ), Covt (dRnt , dvt ) + Ln dt, (41)


where
                                    L ≡ [r + 2[λ + µE [π(vt )]] exp(2A)] .

The ﬁrst two terms in the RHS involve an asset’s unconditional covariances with the two factors.
These terms represent an adjustment for risk that is fully captured by the unconditional CAPM,
because the covariances are linear functions of the unconditional betas. The unconditional CAPM
might, however, fail to capture the risk adjustment represented by the third and fourth terms.

       Consider, for example, the third term, which involves the covariance between the eﬀective risk-
aversion coeﬃcient A(vt ) and an asset’s conditional covariance with the market. To illustrate the
role of this term, consider two assets n1 and n2 that have the same unconditional covariance with
the market. Suppose, however, that the conditional covariance of asset n1 rises signiﬁcantly in
states where managers are more risk averse, while that of asset n2 varies less strongly. Then, asset
n1 has a higher unconditional expected return than asset n2 because of a very high conditional
expected return in the high risk-aversion states.

       Summarizing, an asset’s risk is characterized not only by the unconditional betas, but also
  29
    Our approach is similar in spirit to Jagannathan and Wang (1996). Notice that we are using the conditional
CAPM equation in its covariance form, rather than the beta form. This simpliﬁes the analysis because the expectation
of a conditional covariance is an unconditional covariance (in continuous time), while the same is not true for the
beta (unless beta is constant over time).


                                                        26
by the extent to which the conditional covariances covary with managers’ risk aversion. This
characterization is more complicated than in the case of no performance-based liquidation: in that
case, the coeﬃcients A(vt ) and Z  (vt ) are constants, and the third and fourth terms in equation
(41) are zero.

       Despite the more complicated characterization, the unconditional CAPM can still hold, if the
third and fourth terms in equation (41) are linear functions of the unconditional betas. In Propo-
sition 7 we show, however, that these terms involve cross-sectional variation which is not captured
by the unconditional betas.

Proposition 7 For small σ, equation (41) becomes approximately

and ΛM is determined in the Appendix.

       Proposition 7 shows that the adjustment for risk operates not only through the unconditional
betas βnM and βnv , but also through the term Kn . Thus, the unconditional CAPM does not adjust
correctly for risk, failing to capture the risk associated with illiquidity.

       To explain the intuition, suppose that the probability of poor performance is convex. Convexity
ensures that both the market betas of illiquid assets, and the managers’ eﬀective risk-aversion
coeﬃcient, increase with volatility. Thus, at times of high volatility, illiquid assets covary with the
market more strongly than other assets, and this is also when managers are the most risk averse.
As a result, illiquid assets carry a risk premium not fully captured by their unconditional betas.
Interestingly, the same risk premium applies when the probability of poor performance is concave:
at times of high volatility, illiquid assets covary with the market less than other assets, and this is
also when managers are the least risk averse. Thus, in both cases, the unconditional CAPM can
understate the risk of illiquid assets.30
  30
     The reason why the CAPM does not always understate this risk (i.e., K is not always positive) is because of the
hedging demand. Recall from Section 3.3 that the hedging demand is positive for assets that covary negatively with
volatility. During volatile times, illiquid assets covary with volatility more negatively than other assets. If during
those times, the coeﬃcient AZ  (vt ) (which determines the strength of the hedging demand) is larger, the conditional
hedging demand is very strong for illiquid assets, and this can make K negative. The eﬀect of the hedging demand
is, however, small when A is small. (Formally, for small A, the ﬁrst term in brackets in equation (43) dominates the
term AZ2 . This makes K positive, provided that χ < 0, i.e., volatility impacts negatively the return on the market
portfolio.)


                                                         27
       Equation (42) illustrates the direct and indirect eﬀects of transaction costs. The direct eﬀect is
through the liquidity premium, and corresponds to the term Ln . The indirect eﬀect is through the
risk premium, and arises because transaction costs make an asset more sensitive to the volatility, and
thus riskier. Part of the indirect eﬀect is through the unconditional betas. Because transaction costs
make an asset more (negatively) sensitive to volatility, they decrease the volatility beta (making it
more negative). They also increase the market beta, as long as volatility impacts negatively the
return on the market portfolio (χ < 0).


Proposition 8 For small σ:

       • The unconditional market beta of asset n increases with n if χ < 0.

       • The unconditional volatility beta of asset n decreases with n .


       The eﬀect of transaction costs on the unconditional betas represents the part of the indirect
eﬀect that is captured by the unconditional CAPM. The indirect eﬀect is, however, not fully
captured by the CAPM, and the part that the CAPM does not capture corresponds to the term
Kn .

       Ignoring the transaction costs’ indirect eﬀect can understate the full cost of asset illiquidity. The
indirect eﬀect is absent from most theoretical studies of transaction costs, because these consider
liquidity premia that are constant over time.31 The indirect eﬀect is also not accounted for in
empirical studies because these measure the impact of transaction costs controlling for risk (a point
to which we return in the next section). Our model explains why the indirect eﬀect can arise, and
allows us to compare it to the direct eﬀect. A precise comparison requires, of course, a calibration
of the model, which we plan to do in a companion paper.

       A ﬁnal implication of Proposition 7 concerns the volatility risk premium Λv . Recall that in the
case of no performance-based liquidation, the volatility risk premium is determined by the hedging
demand, and is positive. The eﬀect of the hedging demand corresponds to the ﬁrst two terms
in equation (44). (These terms involve Z1 , Z2 , and Z3 , the ﬁrst, second, and third derivatives
of the function Z(vt ) which characterizes the eﬀect of volatility on the value function.) Equation
(44) contains, however, an additional term which is not related to the hedging demand, and which
is generally negative.32 This term arises because of the time-variation in the conditional market
betas. Recall from Section 4.2 that the market beta of an asset which is very (negatively) sensitive to
volatility increases with volatility. Thus, the unconditional market beta of such an asset understates
  31
     See, for example, Amihud and Mendelson (1986), Constantinides (1986), Vayanos (1998), Vayanos and Vila
(1999), Huang (2002), and Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang (2003). An exception is Acharya and Pedersen (2003), who
assume time-varying transaction costs.                                      √              √
  32
     The third term in equation (44) is negative when q2 > 0 (since then  > 3) or when  < 3 (since then q2 < 0).


                                                       28
the asset’s risk (because times of high volatility are also times of high risk aversion), and the
unconditional CAPM attributes incorrectly the extra risk to the volatility beta. This can give rise
to a negative volatility risk premium.33 In the next section, we explain why this point is relevant
for the empirical studies that consider a volatility or a liquidity factor.

         So far, we have focused on the expected returns on individual assets. Our model has also
implications for the expected return on the market portfolio. Indeed, substituting RM t for Rnt in
equation (41), we ﬁnd

                                                            
            E(dRM t ) = E [A(vt )] Var(dRM t ) + E AZ  (vt ) Cov(dRM t , dvt )
                                                                                         

Using equation (45), we can explore how performance-based liquidation aﬀects the market port-
folio’s expected return. First, because the investors’ risk-aversion coeﬃcient increases from A to
A(vt ), the expected return becomes more sensitive to the market portfolio’s unconditional variance
(ﬁrst term in the RHS). Second, if the probability of poor performance is convex, the investors’
risk-aversion coeﬃcient A(vt ) covaries positively with the market portfolio’s conditional variance.
This raises further the market portfolio’s expected return, holding the unconditional variance con-
stant (third term in the RHS). Thus, performance-based liquidation can have implications for the
equity-premium puzzle, whereby the risk premium on the stock market is too high relative to what
is implied by investors’ risk aversion (characterized by A in our model). We plan to explore these
implications in a companion paper where we will calibrate the model.



5         Empirical Implications

In this section, we present the empirical implications of our model, and link our results to existing
empirical ﬁndings.


5.1         Time-Variation with Aggregate Volatility

Our model predicts that liquidity premia, correlations, betas, and expected returns, should vary
over time with aggregate volatility.

Liquidity Premia: Proposition 5 shows that liquidity premia increase with volatility. Empirical
support for this result comes from Kamara (1994), who shows that the yield spread between T-notes
and (more liquid) T-bills with matched maturities is correlated with interest-rate volatility.
    33
         The third term in equation (44) dominates the ﬁrst two terms when A is small.



                                                           29
Correlations: Proposition 6 shows that the correlation between an asset and volatility decreases
(i.e., becomes more negative) as volatility increases.34 While a negative correlation between ag-
gregate stock returns and volatility has been documented empirically (e.g., French, Schwert, and
Stambaugh (1987), Campbell and Hentschel (1992)), we are not aware of any study that examines
how this correlation depends on the volatility.

    Proposition 6 also shows that the pairwise correlation between similar assets (in terms of relative
loadings on the market and volatility portfolios) increases with volatility. Indirect support for this
result comes from studies documenting an increase in pairwise correlations during market downturns
(when volatility is also higher). See, for example, Longin and Solnik (2001) for international stock
indices, and Ang and Chen (2002) for US stocks.

Betas: Proposition 6 shows that the market betas of illiquid assets increase with volatility. To our
knowledge, this prediction of the model has not been tested empirically.

Expected Returns: Equation (32) implies that the market risk premium per unit of volatility
increases with volatility.35 Many empirical studies have examined the more basic question of
whether the market risk premium, per se, increases with volatility (see Lettau and Lydvigson
(2003) for a recent survey), but the overall evidence is inconclusive.


5.2     Liquidity and Expected Returns

In our model, transaction costs make an asset riskier, and more sensitive to the volatility. Thus,
they aﬀect the asset’s expected return not only through the liquidity premium (direct eﬀect), but
also through the risk premium (indirect eﬀect). Formally, Proposition 7 shows that the expected
return of asset n is
                                                                       
                                  E(dRnt ) = βnM ΛM + βnv Λv + (K + L)n dt,                                           (46)

where βnM and βnv are the asset’s market and volatility betas, and n are the transaction costs.
Transaction costs aﬀect the expected return through the liquidity premium Ln , through the market
and volatility betas, and through the term Kn which is the part of the risk premium not captured
by the CAPM. In particular, illiquid assets have higher market betas, as shown in Proposition 8.

    Accounting for the indirect eﬀect of transaction costs is relevant for the empirical studies that
  34
     For all implications listed in the remainder of this subsection, we require that (i) volatility is negatively correlated
with asset returns, and (ii) assets’ price discounts are convex.
  35
     Writing equation (32) as
                                                                                             

the market risk premium is ΛM t = A(vt )Vart (dRM t ). When price discounts are convex, the eﬀective risk-aversion
coeﬃcient A(vt ) is increasing in vt , and this implies that for small σ, ΛM t /vt is also increasing.


                                                             30
measure the impact of illiquidity on stocks’ expected returns (e.g., Amihud and Mendelson (1986),
Brennan and Subrahmanyam (1996), Eleswarapu (1997), and Chalmers and Kadlec (1998)). These
studies regress returns on a transaction-cost measure (e.g., bid-ask spread, market depth), and the
market beta (as to control for risk). Our model implies that such a regression (which corresponds
to equation (46) without the volatility beta) can understate the full eﬀect of illiquidity. Indeed,
illiquidity increases the market beta, and controlling for the market beta suppresses this eﬀect.


5.3    Liquidity Factor

According to equation (46), the cross-section of expected returns can be explained by the market
beta, the volatility beta, and the transaction costs. The presence of a volatility factor is consistent
with Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2003), who show that such a factor aﬀects stocks’ expected
returns. It is also broadly consistent with Amihud (2002), Acharya and Pedersen (2003), Pastor and
Stambaugh (2003), and Sadka (2003), who show the same result for a liquidity factor. Indeed, these
papers construct the liquidity factor through some measure of price impact. Since in our model,
price impact increases with volatility, the liquidity factor corresponds exactly to (the opposite
of) the volatility factor.36 In generating a volatility or a liquidity factor, our model provides a
theoretical foundation to the above empirical ﬁndings. It also has implications for the factor’s risk
premium, and the assets’ loadings along the factor.

Factor Risk Premium: Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2003) ﬁnd a negative volatility risk
premium. Likewise, Acharya and Pedersen (2003), Pastor and Stambaugh (2003), and Sadka (2003)
ﬁnd a positive liquidity risk premium (and thus a negative premium on the illiquidity factor). Our
model explains what can drive such a premium. We show that the volatility risk premium in
the conditional CAPM is positive because of the hedging demand. However, the premium can
become negative in the unconditional CAPM (Proposition 7) because of the time-variation in the
conditional market betas.

Factor Loadings Amihud (2002), Acharya and Pedersen (2003), and Pastor and Stambaugh (2003)
show that illiquid assets (i.e., assets whose own price-impact measure is high) are more sensitive
to the liquidity factor (i.e., to changes in the aggregate price-impact measure). Thus, the notion of
liquidity as an asset characteristic is related to that as a priced factor. This is consistent with our
model: in Proposition 8, we show that illiquid assets have low (i.e., more negative) volatility betas.
Acharya and Pedersen’s ﬁnding that illiquid assets have high market betas is also consistent with
   36
      If, for example, we introduce exogenous supply shocks in our model, these will have a higher price impact during
volatile times. Of course, we do not mean to imply that the actual liquidity factor is just volatility. However, there
is some correlation between the two factors. For example, the correlation between Pastor-Stambaugh’s or Sadka’s
liquidity factors and the volatility is around -40%.

6    Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a theory of time-varying liquidity premia, and explore its asset-pricing
implications. Our theory is based on the notion that investors are fund managers, subject to
withdrawals that depend on the fund’s performance. During volatile times, the probability that
performance falls below an exogenous threshold increases, and withdrawals become more likely.
This reduces the managers’ willingness to hold illiquid assets, and raises the liquidity premia.

    Our theory generates a rich set of empirical implications. These concern (i) the time-variation
of expected returns, betas, correlations, and liquidity premia, with aggregate volatility, and (ii) the
role of liquidity, both as an asset characteristic and as a risk factor, in explaining cross-sectional
expected returns. At a more theoretical level, a contribution of this paper is to solve analytically a
continuous-time equilibrium model with multiple assets, stochastic volatility, and transaction costs.

    This research can be extended in a number of directions. An obvious extension is to test the
model’s implications empirically. One can also calibrate the model, and evaluate the quantitative
importance of the various eﬀects. Such a calibration would reveal, for example, the relative im-
portance of the direct eﬀect of transaction costs (through the liquidity premium) relative to the
indirect eﬀect (through the risk premium).

    On the theoretical front, one extension is to endogenize the assets’ transaction costs, focusing
especially on their time-variation. (A time-variation in transaction costs has, in fact, been docu-
mented in several recent studies.37 ) If, for example, transaction costs increase during volatile times,
the convexity in liquidity premia would be stronger, reinforcing many of our results.

    Another extension is to consider a liquidation criterion that is based on a longer-term measure
of performance. Under such a criterion, past performance would be a state variable: for example,
after poor past performance, managers would become more concerned with liquidation and have
an increased preference for liquid assets. Thus, liquidity premia would increase in down markets,
and the same might apply to assets’ pairwise correlations, and the market betas of illiquid assets.
Deriving such results would broaden the empirical implications of our theory.

    Finally, it might be interesting to introduce heterogeneity across investors, assuming, for exam-
ple, constrained investors (the fund managers) and unconstrained ones. This would allow for an
analysis of portfolio policies (which in our model is straightforward because all investors hold the

     See, for example, Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam (2001), Hasbrouck and Seppi (2001), Huberman and Halka
(2001), and Jones (2002). Acharya and Pedersen (2003) incorporate exogenous time-varying transaction costs into a
multi-asset equilibrium model.

market portfolio). In particular, we could examine how the constrained investors should manage
the liquidity of their portfolios, given that illiquid assets become very risky in volatile times, when
constraints are the most severe.

Substituting into equation (47), and using equations (9)-(11), we ﬁnd equation (14).

Proof of Proposition 1: We proceed in two steps. First, we solve the manager’s optimization
problem, and show that optimality of the market portfolio is equivalent to the system of N + 1
ODEs. Second, we show that the solution of that system is as in the proposition.

Step 1: For brevity, we consider only buy-and-hold policies (i.e., policies where the manager buys
xn shares of asset n = 1, .., N , holds them until liquidation, buys the same number of shares again,
and so on), and show that optimality of the market portfolio within that set of policies implies the
system of ODEs. A proof that (i) considers the larger set of policies which are diﬀerentiable almost
everywhere, and (ii) shows that optimality is equivalent to the ODE system, can be constructed
using the calculus-of-variation method in Vayanos (1998).

   For a buy-and-hold policy x ≡ (x1 , .., xN ), the budget constraint (14) becomes

Consider the optimization problem where the manager follows a given buy-and-hold policy x, and
maximizes over consumption. To solve this problem, we use dynamic programming and conjecture
that the manager’s value function is of the form

of the market portfolio. Consider a manager who forms a new risky-asset portfolio after liquidation.
Buying xn , rather than Sn , shares of asset n, changes the transaction costs by n (xn − Sn ), thus
changing Wt by the opposite of that amount. The manager’s utility changes by

                           ∂                                               

                          ∂xn

where S −n ≡ (S1 , .., Sn−1 , xn , Sn+1 , .., SN ). Since buying the market portfolio is optimal, the above
derivative is zero, and thus
                                           Zxn (vt , x)|x=S = n .                                    (52)

Equation (52) implies that

                                                                        ∂n

and similarly
                                          Zvvxn (vt , x)|x=S = 0.                                     (54)

Diﬀerentiating equation (50) w.r.t. xn at x = S, and using equations (9)-(13) and (52)-(54), we
ﬁnd the ODE (19). Thus, optimality of the market portfolio implies the system of ODEs.

   To derive the ODEs, we used the Bellman equation of the manager’s optimization problem.
For the Bellman equation to ensure optimality, the set of consumption policies must be restricted
in a way that Ponzi schemes are ruled out (i.e., the manager must be prevented from borrowing
indeﬁnitely). Since Ponzi schemes arise because of the inﬁnite horizon, a simple way to rule them
out is to consider a ﬁnite-horizon economy and require that the inﬁnite-horizon equilibrium is the
limit of a ﬁnite-horizon one as the horizon goes to inﬁnity. Considering this limit will also provide
initial conditions for the ODEs.

   More speciﬁcally, we consider an economy ending at time T , with asset n paying a liquidating
dividend

We look for a ﬁnite-horizon equilibrium in which the price process is of the form

These equations are PDEs for the functions qn (vt , t) and Z(vt , t), and must be solved with the
terminal conditions qn (vT , T ) = Z(vT , T ) = 0. We require that the solution to the ODEs (51) and
(19) is the limit of the PDE solution as T goes to inﬁnity and t is held constant. This ensures that
the inﬁnite-horizon equilibrium is the limit of the ﬁnite-horizon one.

and is thus equivalent to equation (20). Since the LHS of equation (23) goes to −∞ when f1 goes
to ±∞, it is negative outside the roots and positive within them. Since, in addition, the LHS is
negative for f1 = 0, and has a positive derivative (from equation (61)), the two roots are positive.

   Given that f1 can take two values, there are two aﬃne solutions to the ODEs (51) and (19). To
determine which solution to select (and to explain why we consider only aﬃne solutions), we solve


                                                      38
the PDEs (55) and (56) with the terminal conditions qn (vT , T ) = Z(vT , T ) = 0. It is easy to check
that the solution is aﬃne:


                         f (vt , t) ≡ q(vt , t) − Z(vt , t) = f0 (t) + f1 (t)(vt − v),


                                   qn (vt , t) = qn0 (t) + qn1 (t)(vt − v),

where the functions f0 (t), f1 (t), qn0 (t), and qn1 (t), satisfy a system of ODEs. The terminal con-
ditions for the ODEs follow from qn (vT , T ) = Z(vT , T ) = 0 and are f0 (T ) = f1 (T ) = qn0 (T ) =
qn1 (T ) = 0. The ODE for the function f1 (t) is

                                                                                         2 

                  f1 (t) = (r + γ)f1 (t) − A           +                         − f1 (t) σ 2 .   (62)

To determine the behavior of f1 (t), we recall that the two roots of equation (23) are positive, and
the LHS of that equation is negative outside the roots and positive within them. Thus, the function
f1 (t) (which starts from zero at t = T ) increases as t decreases, stays below the smaller root, and
converges to that root as T goes to inﬁnity. This means that in the limit we obtain an aﬃne
solution, and furthermore, the one corresponding to the smaller root. Note that if condition (20)
does not hold, the LHS of equation (23) is negative and bounded away from zero, and thus f1 (t)
converges to inﬁnity.

   We ﬁnally show that q1 and Z1 are positive. Multiplying equation (22) by Sn , and summing
over n, we ﬁnd                                                             

Since f1 is a root of equation (23), we can write q1 as

                                                              r+γ

Since f1 is the smaller root, the derivative of the LHS of equation (23) at f1 is positive. Therefore,
                                                           

                                      A             r+κ

Since, in addition f1 > 0, equation (64) implies that q1 > 0 and Z1 = q1 − f1 > 0.

Proof of Proposition 3: The proof follows from the argument preceeding the proposition.

Proof of Lemma 2: Using the asset betas, we can write equation (16) as

                          M
           Et (dRnt ) = Aβnt Vart (dRM t ) + AZ  (vt )βnt

Equation (18) implies that
                                                                                                        

and equation (1) implies that
                                                   Vart (dvt ) = σ 2 vt dt.

Plugging into equation (69), and noting that q  (vt ) = q1 and Z  (vt ) = Z1 , we ﬁnd equation (26).

Proof of Proposition 4: The proposition follows immediately by taking expectations in equation
                               M = β M and β v = β v .

Setting x = S in equation (72), we ﬁnd equation (70). Taking the derivative of equation (72) w.r.t.
xn for x = S, and using equation (52), we ﬁnd equation (71).

   Equations (70) and (71) constitute a system of N + 1 ODEs in the functions {qn (vt )}n=1,..,N
and Z(vt ). The functions π(vt ) and πxn (vt , x)|x=S can be expressed in terms of {qn (vt )}n=1,..,N and
Z(vt ), using equations (28) and (29). These equations imply that π(vt ) = g[z(vt )],

   The initial conditions to the ODEs (70) and (71) follow from the behavior of vt at inﬁnity. When
vt goes to inﬁnity, π(vt ) converges to 1/2. The solution to the ODEs must then converge to the
aﬃne solution that these ODEs have when the function π(vt ) is replaced by 1/2 and πxn (vt , x)|x=S
by zero.

Proof of Proposition 5: We ﬁrst determine the Taylor expansions of z(vt ), π(vt ), and πxn (vt , x)|x=S ,
keeping terms up to order two in vt − v, but only up to order zero in σ. Equations (73) and (75)
imply that the Taylor expansions of z(vt ) and zn (vt ) are

                                                                         vt − v

Since π(vt ) = g[z(vt )], the Taylor expansion of π(vt ) is
                                                                                                        2

order zero, one, and two, in vt − v. Setting these terms to zero, we ﬁnd equations (36)-(38).

we can write equation (41) as

We will show that this equation is the same as (42), plus terms of higher order in σ.

       We ﬁrst compute CnA and CnZ . Equations (17) and (18) imply that

                                                     φn φ                  Sn

Using the Taylor expansions of qn (vt ) and q(vt ), we can write Xn X as

                                                                              
                           Xn X = χn χ − (χn q2 + χqn2 ) (vt − v) + O (vt − v)2 ,                                  (85)

    The function q(vt ) (associated to the market portfolio) is aﬀected if the diﬀerentiation w.r.t. n is interpreted as
a change in an asset’s transaction costs, holding the other assets’ costs constant. If, however, the diﬀerentiation is
interpreted as a cross-sectional comparison between assets that diﬀer only in transaction costs, q(vt ) is not aﬀected.

Since

Cov [A(vt ), (vt − v)vt ] = Cov [A(vt ), (vt − v)v] + Cov A(vt ), (vt − v)2 = vCov [A(vt ), vt ] + O(σ 3 ),


we can write equation (87) as

   To compute CnZ , we proceed similarly. Equations (1) and (17) imply that

Using the Taylor expansion of qn (vt ), we can write Xn as

Combining equations (89) and (90), and using equation (86), we ﬁnd

   We next determine whether CnA and CnZ can be expressed in terms of CnM and Cnv . Equations

Similarly, equations (25), (89), and (90) imply that

Using equations (92) and (93), we can write equations (88) and (91) as

we can write qn2 as
