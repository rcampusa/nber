                                             ABSTRACT

The positive association between the service sector share of output and per capita income is one of
the best-known regularities in all of growth and development economics. Yet there is less than complete
agreement on the nature of that association. Here we identify two waves of service sector growth,
a first wave in countries with relatively low levels of per capita GDP and a second wave in countries
with higher per capita incomes. The first wave appears to be made up primarily of traditional services,
the second wave of modern (financial, communication, computer, technical, legal, advertising and
business) services that are receptive to the application of information technologies and increasingly
tradable across borders. In addition, there is evidence of the second wave occurring at lower income
levels after 1990. But this change in the second wave is not equally evident in all economies: it is most
apparent in democracies, in countries that are open to trade, and in those that are relatively close to
the major global financial centers. This points to both political and economic conditions that can help
countries capitalize on the opportunities afforded by an increasingly globalized post-industrial economy.

1. Introduction

    The positive association between the service sector share of GDP and per capita

income is one of the best-known regularities in all of growth and development

economics. Or so one might think. In fact, far less is known about this regularity than

commonly asserted. The pioneers of the literature on structural change, such as Fisher

(1939) and Clark (1940), emphasized the shift from agriculture to industry in the course

of economic growth; they in fact said little about the share of services. Kuznets (1953)

concluded that the share of services in national product did not vary significantly with per

capita income.2 Chenery (1960), when regressing the share of services on per capita

income, found an insignificant coefficient on the latter, concluding that the relationship

between services and per capita income is not uniform across countries. Chenery and

Syrquin (1975) regressed the service-sector share of output on per capita income and per

capita income squared, concluding that the relationship was concave to the origin – that it

rose with per capita incomes but at a decelerating rate. Kongsamut, Rebelo and Xie

(1999) found, in contrast, the share of services in output to be linear in per capita income.

Evidently, the stylized fact is less than clear.3

         Moreover, the world has changed since most of these authors wrote. The

application of information and communications technology to the production of services

has thrown into doubt the presumption that their cost necessarily rises faster than that of

manufactures. It has allowed services that once had to be produced locally to be sourced


2
  Kuznets considered transport services separately.
3
  In two recent papers Buera and Kaboski (2008, 2009) find the relationship between the share of services
in GDP and log per capita income to be linear. They also find threshold effects at per capita income levels
of US $7,100 and $9,200, above which the linear relationship between the services share in GDP and log
per capita income is steeper.


                                                     2
at long distances and traded across borders. The traditional services that once dominated

– lodging, meal preparation, housecleaning, beauty and barber shops – have been

increasingly supplemented by modern banking, insurance, computing, communication,

and business services. It would be surprising if the association of the service-sector share

of GDP and per capita income had remained the same in the face of these developments.

       In this paper we therefore seek to provide new evidence about how the relative

size of the service sector evolves over the growth process. We establish three facts.

       First, there are two waves of service sector growth. The service sector share of

output already begins to rise at relatively modest incomes but at a decelerating rate as

growth proceeds, until it levels out at roughly US $1800 per capita income (in year 2000

US purchasing-power-parity dollars); this is the first wave. At roughly US $4000 per

capita income the share of the service sector then begins to rise again in a second wave,

before eventually leveling off a second time.

       Second, there was an upward shift in the second wave of service-sector growth

after 1990. That is to say, the second wave starts at lower levels of income after 1990

than before.

       Third, this two-wave pattern and specifically the greater importance of the second

wave in medium-to-high-income countries is most evident in democracies, in countries

that are close to major financial centers, and in economies that are relatively open to trade

(both in general and in services in particular). Intuitively, the increase in the service-

sector share at all levels of income but especially the second wave at higher income

levels reflects increased scope for producing and exporting modern (financial,

communications, computing, legal, technical and business) services in which medium-to-




                                               3
high-income countries specialize. And it appears that democracies, perhaps because they

have a lesser tendency to suppress the diffusion of information and communications

technologies; countries close to major financial centers, which have a comparative

advantage in the provision of financial services; and countries open to trade, which are in

a position to specialize and export those services in which they have a comparative

advantage, are in the best position to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by these

subsectors.

       In Section 2 we establish the relationship between the service-share of output and

per capita income in a large cross section of countries starting in 1950. Section 3

examines what economic variables explain, in a proximate sense, the patterns we

observe. Section 4 then considers some individual country experiences in more detail. In

Section 5 we analyze a much more limited sample of countries for which it is possible to

empirically distinguish between traditional and modern services directly. Section 6,

finally, concludes.



2. Relationship Between Log Per Capita Income and the Services Share in GDP

       Our data on the shares of agriculture, industry and services in GDP covering the

period 1950-2005 come from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI)

and Mitchell (various years). These are available for some 60 countries until the first half

of the 1960s, some 70 countries until 1980, and more than 80 countries since. Data on per

capita income are from WDI and Maddison (2003); information on trade openness,

urbanization, literacy, age dependency, and trade in services are drawn from WDI. Data

on geographical variables, such as latitude, and land in topical area are obtained from




                                             4
Gallup, Sachs and Mellinger (1999). Data on democracy are drawn from the Policy IV

database and on distance from CEPII. Complete data sources and summary statistics are

provided in Appendix Tables A1 and A2.

         We use lowess plots to explore the relationship between per capita income and

share of services in GDP. These locally-weighted regressions use a function that attaches

less weight to points far from the mean. We examine this relationship separately for the

1951-1969, 1970-1989, and 1990-2005 periods.4

         The relationship looks like a cubic or quartic.5 We therefore estimate a quartic

relationship between the share of services in GDP and per capita income. If the cubic (or

logistic) fits the data better, we would expect the coefficient on per capita income raised

to the fourth power to go to zero.

         The regression framework is given by equation 1. The dependent variable is

service sector output as a percentage of GDP, where (as throughout) i refers to country

and t to year. Regressors include the four powers of log per capita income. All

regressions include country fixed effects. In subsequent regressions we include different

intercepts for different time periods, different slopes of per capita income terms in

different time periods; and various explanatory variables which can explain the patterns

of services sector growth.



4
  Figure 1for example shows the Lowess plot for the default options in Stata 9.0 which include a bandwidth
of .8 (which means that in each regression 80 percent of the observations are included) and a Tricube
Weighting scheme (which means that the observations farther away from the mean get a lower weight).
Results are robust to changing the weighing scheme including to a rectangular weighting scheme (in which
all observations get equal weights) and to changing the band width.
5
  The quartic term is not very evident visually, but it is problematic to assume that the share of services
rises at an accelerating pace as incomes rise (the implication of a cubic), since that share of bounded by 100
per cent. We show below that statistical evidence of the quartic term, which would cause the share of the
service sector to grow more slowly at relatively high incomes, is stronger than the corresponding visual
evidence in Figure 1.

         Results are in Table 1. In all cases we obtain support for the hypothesis of a

quartic relationship. In Column 1 we estimate a quartic with a common intercept for all

years. In Column II we allow the intercept to differ in 1970-1989 and 1990-2005. In

Column III we allow the coefficients on log per capita income (PCY) terms to differ in

the different periods. In Column IV we do the same but combine the 1950-69 and 1970-

89 subperiods.6 We illustrate these relationships by plotting in Figure 2 the predicted

values corresponding to the coefficient estimates in column III. The corresponding

estimated relationship between the service sector’s share and per capita income when the

period 1950-1989 is clubbed together (as in column IV of Table 1) is Figure 3.

         This pattern is robust to changes in sample and specification, as shown in Table 2.

We exclude low income countries.7 We estimate the relationship assuming random

instead of fixed effects. We include individual year fixed effects rather than just

distinguishing two or three time periods. In each case the quartic relationship between log

per capita income and the share of the service sector continues to hold, as does evidence

of a more pronounced second wave (larger cubic and quartic terms) after 1989.

         In Table 3 we calculate the slope of services as a share in GDP with respect to per

capita income based on the coefficients in column IV, Table 1, at different income levels.
6
  The reason for doing so is that the coefficients on the per capita income variables in 1970-1989 are
statistically indistinguishable from those for 1950-1969. There the dummy variable for 1970-1989 (not
interacted) remains significant, but the dummy variable for the 1990-2005 subperiod (not interacted) goes
to zero, while the big and statistically significant coefficients on the post-1990 shifters are on the cubic and
quartic terms. The coefficient on per capita income squared after 1990 is also statistically significant, but it
is small relative to that on per capita income squared over the entire period.
7
  Specifically we drop observations with per capita income in the bottom 10 percent, which corresponds to
observations below log per capita income level 6.65 or income level of 770 year 2000 US purchasing-
power-parity dollars. Examples of countries below this threshold are Tanzania, Malawi, Madagascar,
Uganda and Rwanda.


                                                       6
The slopes indicate that in 1950-1989 the service sector’s share of GDP first rose with

per capita income before stabilizing at middle incomes. Note that a log per capita GDP of

7.5, where this stagnation sets in, is approximately 1800 U.S. year 2000 purchasing-

power-parity dollars. Then at still higher income levels the service sector’s share of GDP

starts rising again. Here a log per capita income of 8.25, where this second wave of

service-sector growth becomes apparent, corresponds to approximately US $3825. Since

we detect this pattern in the data for 1950-1989, it does not appear that the second wave

of service sector growth is exclusively a post-1990s phenomenon.8

         Figures 4 and 5 provide analogous evidence for industry and agriculture. In

Figure 4 we estimate the relationship for industry separately for 1950-1969, 1970-1989

and 1990-2005. The message of Figure 4 is that the share of industry in GDP peaks out,

after which it begins to fall, at both lower levels of GDP and a lower share of industry in

national income after 1989. That of Figure 5 is that the share of agriculture in GDP

declines gradually with per capita income. There is also a suggestion that the pace of

decline in agriculture’s share has slowed at least modestly over time.



3. Correlates of Service Sector Growth

         The pattern of coefficients when we estimate the quartic relationship suggests that

there are two waves of service sector growth: a first wave as a country moves from low to

middle income, and a second wave as it moves from middle to high income.



8
  Starting in the 1990s, it would appear, the relationship became steeper everywhere other than high income
levels – that is, at log per capita incomes above 8.75 (a log per capita income of 8.75 corresponds to
approximately $6300 U.S., the per capita income of Brazil, Turkey and Mexico). In addition, unlike in the
earlier period, the slope remains significantly positive – that is, the service sector continues to expand with
growth – in middle- as well as low- and high-income countries after 1990. A further difference of note is
that service-sector growth seems to slow faster at very high incomes after 1990 than before.


                                                      7
         The other interesting result is that the cubic and quartic terms in per capita income

kick in at lower income levels in the post-1990 period (as is apparent visually in Figure

3). In contrast, the coefficient on the linear term is insignificant and the coefficient on the

squared term for the post 1990 period, while significant, is small compared to the squared

term for the whole period. This suggests that countries are experiencing the first wave of

service sector growth more or less as they did in earlier years, but that they are now

beginning to experience the second wave at earlier stages of economic development.

         To understand where and why, we first identify correlates which when interacted

with the four terms in per capita income reduce or eliminate the significance of all four

per capita income terms. These are the factors that appear to be associated with our two

waves. The variables we consider as potential correlates include the size of the economy

(GDP), openness to trade (as measured by the trade-to-GDP ratio), openness to trade in

services (as measured by trade-in-services-to-GDP ratio); and vector of demographic,

geographical and political variables (including democracy, latitude, share of land area in

the tropics, the dependency ratio (both youth and old age), and proximity to the major

economic and financial centers).9 Some of these explanatory variables are highly

correlated with each other and with per capita income, as shown in Table 4. The overall

trade and trade in services ratios are highly correlated, for example. Latitude and area in

the tropics are obviously correlated. For this reason we do not always include all potential

explanatory variables in all equations.



9
  Data on trade in services begins only around 1970 for some countries in our sample. Availability
improves over the years and by 1975 data are available for about half the countries, and by 1980 for 80
percent of the countries in the sample; therefore regressions including this variable have been estimated on
fewer observations. The remaining variables are either time invariant or vary little. The geographical
variables are, of course, time invariant, while democracy, age dependency, and literacy vary over time but
show considerable persistence.


                                                     8
         We use a general to specific approach. We start with a very general specification

and then drop variables with insignificant coefficients. In this way we obtain a

parsimonious specification.

         In these parsimonious regressions the coefficients of the per capita income terms

are not significantly different from zero—implying that the two waves of service sector

growth are being driven by the factors included in the parsimonious regressions. We have

estimated these regressions first including total trade, and then including trade in services.

We first report results for total trade in Table 5.

         In Column I we include all of the potential explanatory variables interacted with

the four per capita income terms. In Column II we drop the variables interacting urban

population with per capita income; in Column III we drop the terms interacting

governance with per capita income; in Column IV we drop the terms interacting age

dependency with per capita income; and in Column V we drop the terms interacting area

outside the tropics with per capita income.

         While more urban countries have larger service sectors, the four powers of

urbanization are generally insignificant; urbanization does not appear to be explaining the

two-wave pattern in other words. In contrast, in countries more open to trade, more

democratic, and closer to the major financial centers, the four powers of per capita

income tend to be insignificantly different from zero in most specifications.10 Some

specifications also suggest a role for physical geography (share of land area in outside the

tropics). Importantly, the four powers of per capita income are now insignificantly



10
  This last result is not driven by Western Europe and Canada. When we drop these countries from the
sample, the terms involving minimum distance still have significant coefficients. Note that the significance
of the trade variable is evident only in the more parsimonious specifications.


                                                     9
different from zero.11 It would appear that these variables suffice to explain the two wave

pattern.

         In order to interpret the coefficients, we calculate the slope of our dependent

variable with respect to income at various income levels and at various values of the

explanatory variables. For example, taking the coefficients in Column V in Table 5, we

can compute the slopes at three sets of values for trade, distance from the major financial

center and democracy: low, medium and high (respectively values at the bottom quartile,

median and the top quartile of these variables). Estimated slopes for the low, medium and

high values of these variables at various income levels are presented in Table 6.

         At low values of trade, democracy and proximity, we do not see a second wave of

service sector growth – that is to say, the services share does not begin increasing again

with per capita income above middle income levels. In contrast, at high values of these

three variables we see the slope again becoming positive at higher income levels. This

supports our conclusion that the second wave of service sector growth is observed in

countries which are more open, more democratic and closer to the major global financial

centers.

         These results withstand a number of robustness checks. We include year dummies

rather than the dummies for 1970-1989 and 1990-2005; cluster the standard errors by

country and alternatively by year (to allow for standard errors to be correlated across

years within each country and to allow the standard errors to be correlated across

countries in each year). We also add back in the variables dropped in the earlier stages

(urbanization, age dependency or governance), interacting them with the four powers of

11
  They remain statistically significant as a group, which is telling us that per capita income still matters for
the size of the service sector (richer countries have larger service sector shares), but no longer for the two-
wave pattern.


                                                      10
per capita income. When we include these in our parsimonious specification, the

coefficients of these variables remain insignificant, and their inclusion does not affect the

coefficients on the trade, democracy and proximity-to-financial-center terms.12

        Table 7 substitutes trade in services for total trade.13 Trade in services is

significant in all specifications. Otherwise the results are essentially the same as before,

except that there is less support for the importance of climate. We conclude that openness

to trade in services, democracy and proximity to the major financial centers are drivers of

the two-wave pattern.

        Next we ask whether any of the variables considered so far can explain the shift in

the relationship in the services/GDP ratio since 1990. The equations in Table 8 now

include all four terms in PCY; these four terms interacted with the post 1990 dummy;

dummies for 1970-1989 and for 1990-2005; other potential explanatory variables

interacted with PCY terms; and the latter interacted with the post 1990 dummy.

         In Column I of Table 8 (which reproduces Column IV of Table 1 as a

benchmark), the coefficients on per capita income interacted with the post-1989 dummy

are all significant. In Column II we include additional variables affecting the size of the

service sector: GDP, urban population, trade, democracy. The coefficients on per capita

income and interaction with the dummy variable for the post-1990 period do not change.

This means that these variables by themselves cannot explain the post-1989 shift in the

pattern of service sector growth.

        In column III we add variables explaining the two wave pattern of growth:

democracy, trade and proximity to financial centers interacted with the powers of per

12
  Or the coefficients on the powers of per capita income.
13
  The general-to-specific procedure and the sequence in which we dropped insignificant variables remain
the same.


                                                   11
capita income. These variables seem to explain the first as well as the second wave of

service sector growth in pre-1990 period but not subsequently.

       In column IV we interact trade, democracy, and proximity with per capita income

as well with as the post-1990 dummy. Now the coefficients of the per capita income

terms interacted with post 1990s dummy are no longer significantly different from zero.

In column V we drop trade interacted with per capita income terms and the post-1989

dummy, since the coefficients on the trade variables were insignificant in column IV.

       The results suggest that democracy, proximity to major financial centers and trade

openness explain the post-1990 shift in the share of services in GDP, in that they make

the significance of the per-capita-income-post-1990 interaction go to zero.

       We can again calculate the slope of the share of services in GDP with respect to

per capita income at various income levels in the pre- and post-1990 periods for different

values of the explanatory variables, as in Table 9. We continue to see in Columns I-IV

our two-wave pattern of service sector growth, with a second wave at middle and high

incomes only in countries with relatively high levels of trade, democracy, and proximity

to the major financial centers. These variables also seem to be associated with the shift in

services income relationship after 1989, although that shift now does not seem especially

pronounced.

       When we include trade, democracy, and proximity interacted with per capita

income, as well as per capita income and the post 1990s dummy, we can explain the shift

in the services/GDP ratio since 1990s better (slopes not shown in Table 9). Finally, in

order to improve the fit of the regression, we drop the interaction of trade and the post

1990s dummy, thus allowing for the possibility that trade did not have a differential




                                             12
impact on the services and per capita income relationship post 1990s. The slopes

calculated using this specification are reported in Columns V-VIII in Table 9. Now the

second wave occurs only in countries with relatively high levels of trade, democracy, and

proximity to the major financial centers; and the post-1990 shift is more pronounced in

countries with these features.



4. Country-Specific Experience

         We now examine how growth of the service sector in individual countries

compares with the typical pattern in different sub-periods.14 The data for the United

States are highlighted in Figure 6. The size of the service sector is more or less in line

with the international norm in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s it then grows

significantly larger than predicted for a high income country. In other words, the U.S.

observations lie entirely above the two-standard-error bands. This story is well known: it

reflects the productivity-enhancing restructuring of retail, wholesale and financial

services, enabled by the application of new information technology; in part it reflects

rapid deregulation and ultimately unsustainable growth of the financial services industry.

         Japan was known in the third quarter of the 20th century for having a

manufacturing-heavy economy. In Figure 7 we see that the service share of GDP was not,

in fact, atypical in the 1960s. The period when the service-sector share is smaller than

expected was the 1970s and 1980s (mainly the early 1970s and late 1980s). There was

then convergence to the international norm after 1990, with relatively rapid growth in the

output shares of business, health and social services.


14
  The typical pattern is given in Figure 3 above, where we plot the predicted services/share in different
time periods and along with their two standard error bands.


                                                     13
           In contrast, Germany, another traditionally manufacturing-heavy country, shows

evidence in Figure 8 of having had an unusually low service-sector share in the 1950s

and 1960s, the decades of the manufacturing Wirtschaftswunder. This anomaly

disappeared in the 1970s and 1980s. In recent years the service sector grew unusually

rapidly by international standards, perhaps reflecting deindustrialization in the new

eastern lander.15 By the end of the sample period there is some sign of a service-sector

share slightly higher than expected.

           Figure 9 for the UK suggests that the service sector share was typical for a

country with its per capita GDP from the 1950s through the 1980s, notwithstanding the

debate over the country’s deindustrialization (which would lead one to expect a service

sector significantly larger than the international norm). Then in the 1990s the service

sector becomes unusually large by the standards of that international norm. Interestingly,

unusually large subsectors include not only financial services but also retail trade, legal,

technical, legal and other community, social and personal services.16

           Finally, Figure 10 considers a late-developing middle-income country, Korea. The

fact that Korea has a relatively underdeveloped service sector characterized by low

productivity is well known: OECD (2008) observes that the productivity gap vis-à-vis

other OECD countries is much larger for services than manufacturing, a problem that can

be ascribed in large part to restrictive regulations designed to protect small and medium-

sized enterprises from domestic and foreign competition. Figure 10 suggests that the

problem of a stunted service sector is relatively recent. It was barely visible in the 1970s

and 1980s but emerges clearly in the 1990s,when the typical relationship between the

service-sector share of output and per capita income shifts up but Korea lags behind.

This may reflect in part Korea’s lack of proximity to the major global financial centers,

New York and London, and difficulty of establishing itself as a financial hub for

Northeast Asia.



5. Traditional and Modern Services

           Direct evidence on the composition of service sector production at different

income levels can be constructed mainly for high-income countries on the basis of data

provided by the EU KLEMS project for the period 1970-2005. Data limitations limit the

analysis: we cannot analyze the compositional sources of the pre/post-1970 shift, for

example, or examine what has been going on in low-income countries.

           The EU KLEMS release of 2008 spans the period 1970-2005 for the 15 founding

(pre-2004) EU member states and for the US, South Korea, Japan and Australia. Series

from 1995 onwards are available for the new EU member states which joined the EU on

1 May 2004. Industries are classified according to the European NACE Revision 1

classification, but the level of detail varies across countries, industries and variables

owing to differences in national statistical procedure. We do not include the new member

states in our analysis and also drop Luxembourg and Portugal.17 Thus we consider

Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,

Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States in the

disaggregated analysis. We calculate the share of different services in GDP using value

added at current prices in local currency for various service industries and total GDP.18

         We distinguish three groups of services according to whether their shares of GDP

have fallen, risen slowly, or risen rapidly over time. First are traditional services: retail

and wholesale trade, transport and storage, public administration and defense. Their share

in GDP has fallen noticeably over time. The second group is a hybrid of traditional and

modern services consumed mainly by households: education; health and social work;

hotels and restaurants; and other community, social and personal services. Their shares

all show a tendency to rise slowly with time. The third group is modern services

consumed by both the household and corporate sectors: financial intermediation,

computer services, business services, communication, and legal and technical services.

We refer to them as modern because their share in GDP was only 7 per cent in 1970 but

has since risen to more than 15 percent. Details on these three groups are in Table 10.

         The quartic relationship between the share of services in GDP and per capita

income is again evident in this smaller sample, although it is not as pronounced as in the

larger sample of low- and middle- as well as high-income countries.19 Figures 12-14

show the fitted values for our three groups. That the GDP share of services such as public

administration and defense, retail trade, wholesale trade and transport and storage (Group


18
   We also use the data on total factor productivity from the EU KLEMS. Certain services that were very
small or did not seem to be following any specific pattern of growth are excluded. One sector which is
relatively large that we did not include is real estate activities (8 percent). Real estate services seem to be
quite volatile and do not fit any neat pattern of growth. This could be due to the fact that valuation of these
services changes with real estate prices and these are not adequately accounted for in the real prices. We
also test the robustness of results to including these services in different groups, where they seem to be
fitting e.g. activities related to financial intermediation in group III with financial intermediation; sale,
maintenance and repair of motor in Group I with retail trade; and private households with personal services
in group II. The results are robust.
19
   There are also some signs of a shift in the relationship after 1990, but this too is small in comparison with
the larger sample of countries.


                                                      16
I) declines steadily as countries move from middle- to high-income status, consistent with

a low income elasticity of demand for these services, is not in conflict with the existence

of a hump-shaped pattern, since here we do not observe the share of Group I in low-

income countries.

       As shown in Figure 13, the share of Group II services grows faster than the rest of

the economy all through the middle- and high-income range. This behavior is consistent

with a high income elasticity of demand.

       Finally, we see an increase in the GDP share of Group III over the entire range of

middle- and high-income levels. The share of these activities increases particularly

rapidly at high incomes, with no sign (in contrast to Group II) of that share growing more

slowly at the high end, indicating very high income elasticities of demand and/or the

greater tradability and therefore capacity to export these services. Although we do not

observe the share of such modern services in low income countries it seems safe to

conjecture that the importance of Group III rises steadily with per capita income.

       Having considered demand, we look also at some potential determinants of the

supply of these services. Productivity growth was highest, not surprisingly, in the Group

III modern services (Table 11). Interestingly, however, productivity increases have also

been relatively rapid within traditional services (Group I), some of which (retailing,

wholesaling) have made extensive use of new information technologies. This reinforces

the presumption that insofar as the share of output accounted for by Group I has declined,

this reflects relatively low income elasticities of demand. It is in Group II, the hybrid

cases, where the cost disease appears to be most serious. Suggestively, Group II ranks

lowest in terms of the penetration/application of new information technology. It also has




                                             17
the lowest international tradability, suggesting that limits on international competition

and on the ability to specialize contribute to this problem.20



6. Conclusion

         We have provided new evidence and analysis of the share of services in GDP in

the course of economic development. We identify two waves of service sector growth, a

first wave in countries with relatively low levels of per capita GDP and a second wave in

countries with higher per capita incomes. The first wave appears to be made up primarily

of traditional services, the second wave of modern (financial, communication, computer,

technical, legal, advertising and business) services that are receptive to the application of

new information technology and increasingly tradable across borders.

         There is evidence of an increase in the share of services in GDP at all levels of

income after 1970 and, in addition, of a further increase in the share of services in

countries with relatively high per capita incomes – in other words, of the second wave

occurring at lower income levels than before. But this change in the second wave is not

equally evident in all countries: it is most apparent in countries that are open to trade, that

are democratic, and that are relatively close to the major global financial centers. This

points to both political and economic conditions that can help countries capitalize on the

20
  The indicator of tradability is constructed using data in Jensen and Kletzer (2005). Since Jensen and
Kletzer work with the NAICS (North American Industrial classification system), we map their
classification into our NACE (European Classification of Economics Activities). Jensen and Kletzer
calculate the Gini Coefficient for the geographical dispersion of each activity and use it to identify tradable
and non tradable services. The underlying idea is that the services which are tradable can be geographically
concentrated in order to reap the economies of scale. The mapping was quite clear for all of our services
except for Transport and storage. Two different NAICS codes are assigned to these activities, each with a
different degree of tradability. Hence we leave this cell blank. Another case where the tradability was not
clear is the wholesale trade. For this service category Jensen and Kletzer find it to be having an almost
equal score for tradability and non tradability. Indicators for information and communication technology
(ICT) industries has been constructed using the data in van Ark, Inklaar and McGucken (2005).

communication technology. In the last column NT refers to non tradable services and T refers to
tradable services. Productivity refers to total factor productivity and the average annual growth
rates have been calculated using the data from EUKLEMS. The indicator of tradability has been
constructed using the data in Jensen and Kletzer (2005). Indicators for information and
communication technology (ICT) industries has been constructed using the data in van Ark,
Inklaar and McGucken (2005). See Section 5 for further details.
