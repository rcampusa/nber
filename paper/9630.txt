                                           ABSTRACT


Although the Surgeon General recently highlighted breastfeeding as “……one of the most important
contributors to infant health,” few health economics studies based in developed countries have
considered breastfeeding as an important health behavior that can be influenced by labor market
decisions and by public policies. This study examines the effect of the timing and intensity of
returning to work after childbirth on the probability of initiating breastfeeding and the number of
weeks of breastfeeding. Data come from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79).
Baseline probit models and family-level fixed effects models indicate that returning to work within

3 months is associated with a reduction in the probability that the mother will initiate breastfeeding

by 16-18%. Among those mothers who initiate breastfeeding, returning to work within 3 months is

associated with a reduction in the length of breastfeeding of 4-6 weeks. We find less consistent

evidence that working at least 35 hours per week (among mothers who return to work within 3

months) detracts from breastfeeding. Baseline and fixed effects models indicate that returning to

full-time work is associated with a reduction in the length of breastfeeding of 1-4 weeks; however,

we do not find consistent evidence regarding the association between returning to full-time work and

breastfeeding initiation. Overall, the findings suggest that maternal employment is negatively

associated with both breastfeeding initiation and breastfeeding duration.

    1.      INTRODUCTION

            As of the year 2000, 51% of mothers of infants less than 12 months old worked

outside of the home [1]. The number of employed mothers with infants has grown dramatically

since 1976, when the government first started to collect these data. Many researchers have

studied the effects of maternal employment on child development. Recent studies suggest that

some forms of maternal employment during the child’s first year may have negative effects on

children’s cognitive development and behavior problems, although these effects may be

outweighed by later benefits of having an employed mother [2-4]. There is much less research,

however, on the effects of maternal employment during the first year on the physical health of

infants and on maternal investments in infant health.

         In particular, there is only limited, conflicting information about how maternal

employment affects breastfeeding decisions. Although there is some evidence that maternal

employment is associated with a reduced duration of breastfeeding among mothers who have

initiated breastfeeding, this association may be confounded by unobserved factors that affect

both breastfeeding duration and maternal employment decisions, such as cultural beliefs about

breastfeeding and the level of family stress. Moreover, little is known about how decisions about

employment after childbirth affect breastfeeding initiation. Breastfeeding initiation is an

important outcome to study, as a sizeable proportion of mothers (32% in 2000) do not initiate

breastfeeding at all [5].

         The Surgeon General, in a report on breastfeeding published by the Department of

Health and Human Services in 2000, stated that breastfeeding is “…one of the most important

contributors to infant health [6].” Breastfeeding is linked to reductions in respiratory illnesses,

gastrointestinal illnesses, ear infections, asthma and other allergies, Sudden Infant Death

Syndrome, and childhood acute leukemia [7-11]. However, breastfeeding also is a time-

intensive activity that requires mothers either to be with their children at every feeding, or to
                                                  4
express and store breastmilk for later use. Although many working mothers do feed their

children breastmilk, returning to work, particularly full-time work, shortly after the birth of a

child may make establishing and continuing with breastfeeding difficult.

       This study is based on the hypothesis that among mothers who were employed before the

child was born, returning to work before the child is 3 months old (1) reduces the probability of

initiating breastfeeding and, (2) among mothers who initiated breastfeeding, reduces the number

of weeks of breastfeeding. We also hypothesize that among mothers who return to work within

3 months after childbirth, working full-time rather than part-time is associated with lower rates

of initiating breastfeeding and shorter breastfeeding durations. Unlike previous researchers, we

are able to take advantage of data on siblings, which allow us to examine breastfeeding and

employment decisions within mothers over time. Although this method has its own limitations,

we avoid the problem of needing to find good identifying variables, such as valid instruments in

an instrumental variables context.

       The findings suggest that maternal employment is negatively associated with both

breastfeeding initiation and breastfeeding duration. Baseline probit models and fixed effects

models indicate that returning to work within 3 months is associated with a reduction in the

probability that the mother will initiate breastfeeding by 16-18%. Among those mothers who

initiate breastfeeding, returning to work within 3 months is associated with a reduction in the

length of breastfeeding by 4-6 weeks. This reduction may have significant health effects since

the median number of weeks of breastfeeding among mothers who initiated breastfeeding in our

sample was only 12 weeks. We find less consistent evidence that working at least 35 hours per

week (among mothers who return to work within 3 months) detracts from breastfeeding.

Baseline and fixed effects models indicate that returning to full-time work is associated with a

reduction in the length of breastfeeding of 1-4 weeks. However, we do not find consistent



                                                  5
evidence regarding the association between returning to full-time work and breastfeeding

initiation.

    2.        BACKGROUND

         The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that mothers breastfeed exclusively

(without the use of infant formula or other liquids) for the first six months, and then continue

partial breastfeeding for at least a year [12]. In 2000, about 68 percent of mothers in the United

States initiated breastfeeding in the hospital, and 31 percent were still breastfeeding (exclusively

or partially) when their infants were six months old. These rates are much higher than they were

even ten years prior, when only 52 percent of mothers initiated breastfeeding and 18 percent

breastfed for at least 6 months [5]. However, breastfeeding rates among African-American

mothers and mothers who participate in WIC still lag far behind the Healthy People 2010

objectives of increasing the breastfeeding initiation rate to 75% and the rate of breastfeeding for

5-6 months to 50% [13]. In 2000, 51 percent of African-American mothers initiated

breastfeeding in the hospital and 12 percent were still breastfeeding at six months; these rates

were 57 percent and 20 percent respectively for WIC participants in 2000 [5].

         There is some empirical evidence that maternal employment may interfere with

breastfeeding. Visness & Kennedy (1997), for example, use 1988 data from the National

Maternal and Infant Health Survey and find that although returning to work within a year of the

child’s birth is not associated with breastfeeding initiation, returning to work is associated with

shorter duration of breastfeeding among those who initiate breastfeeding [14]. Similarly,

Lindberg (1996), using Cycle IV of the National Survey of Family Growth, find that part-time

working mothers are more likely to initiate breastfeeding and have longer breastfeeding

durations compared to full-time working mothers [15]. Fein & Roe (1998) also report that

expectations of full-time work during pregnancy and full-time work three months after childbirth

are associated with reductions in breastfeeding initiation and duration, respectively. Their work
                                                  6
is based on the Infant Feeding Practices Study, conducted in 1993 [16]. As the authors of these

papers acknowledge, the observed negative relationship between returning to employment and

breastfeeding may be confounded by reverse causality (e.g. the mother returns to work because

she has stopped breastfeeding) or by other unobserved factors, such as mothers’ unobserved

desire to wean the child.

       Roe et al. (1999), however, find the same result after using methods that account for the

simultaneity of the employment and breastfeeding decisions [17]. These authors estimate a

simultaneous model of maternal employment and infant feeding, using maternal occupation to

identify the breastfeeding equation. They limit the analysis to mothers who have initiated

breastfeeding, who were employed before the child’s birth, and who planned to return to work

before the child was a year old (although the analysis includes women who changed their plans).

The results suggest that the duration of maternal leave is positively associated with the duration

of breastfeeding, and working 8 hours per day reduces the number of daily breastfeeding

sessions.

       These results are based on the identification assumption that maternal occupation affects

return to work decisions but does not have direct impact on breastfeeding decisions. Although

the authors find that maternal occupation is not a significant predictor of breastfeeding practices,

certain occupations, particularly professional occupations where personal space for expressing

milk is available and many mothers breastfeed, may encourage a new mother to initiate or

continue to breastfeed. Work environment is likely to affect the ability to continue breastfeeding

and possibly the decision to initiate breastfeeding. Visness & Kennedy, in fact, report that among

white women, occupational category is associated with breastfeeding duration after controlling

for the duration of maternity leave. It is difficult to provide a strong argument for any personal

or family characteristics being a clearly good predictor of return-to-work decisions, but not



                                                 7
associated with breastfeeding decisions. In this study, because we have data on siblings, we

avoid the problem of needing to find suitable identifying variables.

   3.      THEORETICAL MOTIVATION

        After the child’s birth, mothers maximize the following multi-period, discrete time

objective function:

                                          T

                                         ∑ U (H , h , α , β )
                                         t =0
                                                         t       t   t   t




subject to the following constraints and identities

                                       H t = H t −1+ f t ( γ t , δ t , ε t )

                                                       H0 = H *

                                          h t = h t −1 + g t (δ t , φ t )

                                                       h0 = h *

                                        Z = β t + γ t + δ t + ηt

                            T                    T

                           ∑ (Et + η t w) = ∑ ( pα t + qε t + rφt ) + K + M
                           t =0                 t =0


The utility in each period is a function of the mother’s health (H), the child’s health (h), the

mother’s consumption (α), and the mother’s leisure (β). The mother’s health in a period is a

function of her health in the last period with adjustments for the time she invests in health

producing activities in a given period (γ), the time she invests in her child’s health in a given

period δ, and the health care expenditures she makes (ε). A mother has an initial health

endowment of H* at t = 0.

        Three additional points are notable with respect to δ. First, we are characterizing the time

investment in the child’s health as only including breastfeeding, and breastfeeding can affect the

mother’s health [18]. Second, we view the time invested in child health (i.e., time spent

                                                             8
breastfeeding) as being time above and beyond the time it would take for the mother to use

formula to feed the child. Although breastfeeding is not necessarily more time-consuming than

formula-feeding, we assume that breastfeeding requires more maternal time than formula-

feeding (e.g. time spent expressing milk, fewer opportunities for another caregiver to feed child).

Third, to simplify the model, we consider only exclusive breastfeeding.

       The child’s health in a period is a function of the child’s health in the last period with

adjustments for the time that the mother invests in the child’s health in a given period (δ) and the

medical care expenditures for the child (φ). The initial health endowment for the child is h* at t

= 0. Both f and g are subscripted because the investment in the child’s health through

breastfeeding has a dose response relationship and the marginal impact of breastfeeding on the

mother’s and child’s health will change over time. The dose response relationship suggests an

increasing marginal impact of breastfeeding on infant health when the child is very young, but,

eventually, the marginal impact will diminish and the marginal benefits will be lower than the

marginal costs of continuing to breastfeed.

       The fifth constraint indicates that the total time available in a period (Z) is the sum of four

choice variables: time spent investing in the mother’s health, time spent investing in the child’s

health, time spent in leisure, and time spent working (η). The final constraint is a lifetime budget

constraint with an interest rate of 0—having any other interest rate would complicate the

expression without adding significantly to the insight. This is not meant to disallow saving and

borrowing—only to simplify the expression. The left hand side represents resources available:

the sum of endowments (or non-labor income) plus the wage multiplied by the time spent

working in each period. The right hand side represents expenditures. The first three terms that

are included in the summation over time are straightforward. The price of consumption goods is

p, the price of medical care for the mother is q, and the price of medical care for the child is r. K

and M require additional explanation
                                                  9
       The decision to breastfeed at all and the decision on how long to breastfeed include

discrete costs that are only incurred if the mother decides to breastfeed (K=0 if δt = 0 ∀ t) and

only if the mother decides to breastfeed while working (M=0 if (δt = 0 or ηt = 0) ∀ t). The

decision to initiate breastfeeding involves start-up costs (K) above and beyond start-up costs

associated with formula feeding, such as purchasing nursing clothing and spending time and

effort learning about breastfeeding. The decision to breastfeed while working requires additional

start-up costs (M) such as the purchase of a breast pump and finding appropriate time and space

to express milk. The “startup” costs of breastfeeding are described only as financial in this case,

but they could be both financial and psychological.

       Without these two discrete costs, the mother would have six choice variables since ηt

(work time) is implied by the other choices and the expression can be rewritten without ηt. The

choices include the time to invest in the mother’s health (γ), the time to invest in the child’s

health (δ), the mother’s medical care (ε), the child’s medical care (φ), leisure (β), and

consumption (α). As with any economic optimization problem, the mother will choose to

breastfeed until the marginal costs (in terms of the opportunity cost of time when the expression

is rewritten without ηt) are just equal to the marginal benefits (in terms of the effects on the

mother’s health, the effect on the child’s health, and savings on formula expenditures).

       The two discrete costs allow corner solutions. First, a mother might choose to stop

breastfeeding when she returns to work rather than continuing to breastfeed longer if the fixed

startup cost of trying to breastfeed and work (M) is higher than the net marginal utility from

continuing to breastfeed after returning to work. In that case, the mother evaluates whether or

not to initiate breastfeeding by comparing two constrained optimization problems: breastfeeding

until she returns to work (δt = 0 ∀ t where ηt > 0) with a cost of K for initiating breastfeeding and

no breastfeeding (δt = 0 ∀ t).

                                                 10
        Thus, while returning to work is a decision that is a choice variable similar to the choices

to initiate and continue to breastfeed, the discrete cost of trying to work and breastfeed leads to a

potentially clear directional relationship between the decision to return to work and to breastfeed.

A decision to return to work may limit the time spent breastfeeding. Furthermore, if the

incremental net benefit of breastfeeding (excluding M) that would occur after the return to work

were necessary to offset some part of K to make it worthwhile to breastfeed at all, then the

decision to return to work could also affect the decision on whether or not to breastfeed at all.

   4.      METHODS

        This paper is based on the hypothesis that among mothers who were employed before the

birth of a child, returning to work, particularly full-time work, shortly after birth reduces the

initiation and duration of breastfeeding. To test this hypothesis, the study focuses on estimating

the following equation:

                            1) BFij = b0 + b1Eij + b2Xi + b3Yj+ ui + eij.

This equation is specific to the ith child of mother j. Two dependent variables (BF) are used in

this analysis: (1) a dichotomous indicator of whether or not the mother initiated breastfeeding;

and (2) among mothers who initiated breastfeeding, the log of the number of weeks the child was

breastfed. We have complete information on all breastfeeding spells, which eliminates the

problem of censored information about the dependent variable.

        The main independent variable of interest is maternal employment status after the birth of

a child (E). We are primarily interested in two aspects of employment status: (1) the age of the

child in weeks when the mother returned to work; and (2) among mothers who had returned to

work by the time the child was three months old, the number of hours worked per week. We

consider both the timing of return to work and the intensity of the work effort because previous

research suggests that both of these factors may interfere with breastfeeding. To measure

employment status after birth (Eij), we use a dummy variable indicating whether or not the
                                                 11
mother returned to work before the child was three months old. For mothers who returned to

work within three months, we consider a dummy variable indicating whether or not the mother

worked full-time (at least 35 hours per week).2, 3

         The vector Xi includes observed child-specific factors that may determine breastfeeding,

such as the child's gender and health endowment at birth, as proxied by low birth-weight, as well

as the child's birth order and year of birth. The child's year of birth is included to capture secular

trends in infant feeding practices. The vector Yj includes observed mother-specific factors that

may determine breastfeeding initiation and duration. These factors were selected based on

previous literature and include education, age, family size, Armed Forces Qualification Test

(aptitude test) score, marital status, family income, region of residence and whether or not the

family participated in the Food Stamp program. These variables are measured during the year of

the child's birth.

         The models also include a measure of maternal smoking during pregnancy. It is not

expected that maternal smoking will directly affect the decision to breastfeed. However,

smoking during pregnancy may proxy the mother’s unobserved motivation to make investments

in infant health, such as breastfeeding. Maternal smoking, along with low birth weight and some

other right hand side variables, may be endogenous in the model because they may be correlated

with unobserved factors that are associated with both breastfeeding and employment decisions.

For this reason, all of the models also were estimated with a parsimonious set of covariates

(child’s race, year of birth, and mother’s aptitude test score).

         Even with a rich secondary data set, there may exist important, unobserved factors that

affect breastfeeding decisions and that are not adequately captured by the available data. This

  Our results are not sensitive to changing the full-time work threshold to 40 hours per week.
3
  We also estimate these models using a continuous measure of the child’s age in weeks when his/her mother
returned to work and a continuous measure of the number of hours the mother worked per week when she returned
to work. In the paper, we do not present results from these analyses. These results are qualitatively very similar to
those presented here and are available upon request.

possibility is particularly relevant to this paper because the data set used in the study is a labor

market survey, which was not intended to focus on the determinants of infant feeding decisions.

The vector ui represents time-invariant, unobserved maternal factors that affect breastfeeding.

These factors may include the mother's cultural beliefs about breastfeeding, her mental and

physical health, her knowledge and interest in child health, and her social support system.

       It is possible that some of these unobserved maternal factors that affect breastfeeding also

are correlated with unobserved factors that determine maternal employment after the birth of a

child. It is also possible that the employment and breastfeeding decisions are made

simultaneously, with breastfeeding decisions affecting employment decisions and employment

decisions affecting breastfeeding decisions. For example, mothers who do not intend to

breastfeed their infants might be more likely than mothers who intend to breastfeed to

return to work shortly after the birth. Because intention to breastfeed is unobserved,

standard estimation of equation 1 would lead to a biased estimate of the impact of maternal

employment on breastfeeding, since, in this scenario, mothers who return to work shortly

after the birth are more likely than other mothers to not intend to breastfeed.

       Initially, ordinary least squares (OLS), and standard probit models are used to

estimate equation 1. Estimating equation 1 by OLS or a standard probit, however, can lead

to biased and inconsistent estimates if these endogeneity problems exist. This study uses

two approaches to address this problem. First, observed data on maternal characteristics is

used to proxy uj to the fullest extent possible, and we use informal and formal tests to assess

whether or not the problem of unobserved heterogeneity is important. The informal test consists

of comparing results from parsimonious and more fully specified models of breastfeeding. If

controlling for observed heterogeneity affects the estimated impact of maternal employment on

breastfeeding, it seems likely (although we can never know for certain) that unobserved

heterogeneity also is important in this relationship. More formally, we also use the Breusch-
                                                  13
Pagan Lagrange Multiplier test to determine whether or not the disturbance term includes a

group-level component.

       These tests suggest that unobserved heterogeneity may be important in the relationship

between maternal employment and breastfeeding. Therefore, we attempt to account for

unobserved mother-specific factors by estimating family-level fixed effects models. These

models take advantage of the fact that most mothers in the data have multiple children.

Consequently, we have repeated observations on employment and breastfeeding decisions for

much of the sample. Ideally, we would have used random effects models to account for a

random, unobserved mother-specific factor that affects breastfeeding and employment decisions.

However, a Hausman test rejected the null hypothesis that the right hand side variables in the

model were exogenous with respect to the error term, which indicates that the random effects

model would not lead to consistent estimates of the parameters.

       Fixed effects models are robust to correlation between right-hand side variables and the

disturbance term. These models also address the problem of time-invariant, mother-specific

factors, such as the mother’s fixed, cultural beliefs about breastfeeding. However, because these

models are based on “within” variation only, we cannot estimate the impact of time-invariant

factors, such as race and aptitude test score, on breastfeeding. Moreover, we cannot account for

unobserved, mother-specific factors that might change between the birth of two children, such as

her level of family stress. It is possible that the causation runs the opposite way, with mothers

returning to work later because they are breastfeeding. Roe et al. find little empirical support for

this direction of causality, but it remains a possibility. The fixed effects models will not

eliminate this simultaneity problem if the unobserved factor that governs both decisions, such as

the intention to breastfeed, is time-varying. This issue suggests that these findings should be

interpreted and generalized with caution.

       A Breusch-Pagan test based on a standard fixed effects model shows evidence of
                                                 14
heteroscedasticity in the random component of the error term. For this reason, a heteroscedastic

fixed effects model is estimated using feasible generalized least squares. This model allows for

family-specific variances, but not for cross-sectional correlation within panels. A standard fixed

effects model led to very similar results.

       This study does not use the instrumental variables (IV) method or the bivariate probit

model to address the problem of unobserved heterogeneity. These methods do have certain

advantages over the fixed effects models, but practical implementation of these methods

requires that we have at least one exogenous variable that is a predictor of the maternal

employment decision after the birth but is not correlated with either breastfeeding or the

error term in the breastfeeding equation. Unfortunately, there are few, if any, characteristics of

the mother or family that would be appropriate as identifying instruments. Roe et al. (1999), in

their study of maternal employment and breastfeeding, identify their breastfeeding equation

using occupational category as an identifying instrument. It seems likely, however, that

occupational category also affects breastfeeding decisions since some occupations (e.g.

professional) offer more flexibility and personal space than other occupations (e.g. clerical).

Although no national survey of workplace attitudes towards breastfeeding exists, small-scale

surveys indicate that employers generally do not view providing breastfeeding support as a

priority and attitudes towards breastfeeding vary by employer characteristics such as firm size

[19-20].

       State-level policies are more likely than individual-level characteristics to be exogenous.

However, state-level policies are likely to be very poor predictors of individual mothers’

decisions to return to work. Bound et al. (1995), Bollen et al. (1995), Nelson & Startz (1990),

Staiger & Stock (1994) and others all have noted that a low first stage F-statistic for the

identifying instrumental variables may suggest that the TSLS estimates are no better than biased

OLS estimates [21-24].

   5.      DATA

        Data used in the study come from the 1998 releases of the National Longitudinal

Survey of Youth (NLSY79) and the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth

(CoNLSY). NLSY79 is an annual, national survey that was initiated in 1979 with a sample of

12,686 young people who at that time were aged 14-21. The original sample includes a

nationally representative sample of civilian youth as well as over-samples of African-Americans,

Hispanics, indigent Whites, and Armed Forces personnel. Children of NLSY79 mothers

(CoNLSY respondents) are interviewed and/or assessed in a separate, linked survey. We limit

the sample to children born before 1997 in order to have data on completed breastfeeding spells

for all children. As of 1996, 7,103 CoNLSY respondents ranging in age from infant to over 21

years old were assessed and/or interviewed. Of these 7,103 respondents, 21% were Hispanic,

33% were African-American, and 46% were White/Other.

        Two analysis samples are used in this study: (1) the full sample (N=5,804), which

includes children born between 1974 and 1996 to mothers who were employed full-time or part-

time at some point during the year that preceded the child’s birth; and (2) the sibling sample

(N=3,947) which limits the full sample to children who have at least one sibling in the sample.

The sibling sample is used to estimate family fixed effects models. We limit both samples to

children born to mothers who were employed before the birth of the child in order to focus on

how the timing and intensity of return to work affects breastfeeding decisions. When we focus

on the intensity of return to work, we limit the sample to children of mothers who returned to

work within three months after the birth of the child. When we analyze breastfeeding duration as

an outcome, we limit the sample to children whose mothers initiated breastfeeding.

        Both samples exclude observations with missing data on breastfeeding or missing data on

the mother’s employment status during the year before or during the year after the child’s birth.

The samples include respondents with missing data on Food Stamps participation, birth weight,
                                                16
education, family income, marital status, family size, AFQT score, and smoking during

pregnancy. For these respondents, missing variables are replaced by unconditional means. In

order to check the sensitivity of the results to this imputation, the models were re-estimated after

dropping respondents with missing information. The results were almost identical to those

presented here, and suggest that the results are not sensitive to the imputation method used to

deal with missing data.

6.     DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

       Table 1 presents means and standard deviations for the full and sibling samples. In both

samples, about 23% of the respondents are African-American and about 19% are Hispanic. The

average maternal age is 25, and the average number of years of education is 12.6. Most mothers

(about 70%) were married at the time of the birth, and about 31% reported smoking during

pregnancy. Employment after the birth of the child was common in both samples, with 55-59%

of mothers returning to employment within 3 months after the child’s birth, but only 34-36% of

the samples returned to full-time work before the child was 3 months old. Klerman & Leibowitz

using 1986-1988 data from the Current Population Survey find that about 40 percent of new

mothers return to work within three months, but their sample includes part-time workers and

mothers who were not working before the child’s birth [25]. (The mean year of birth in our

sample is 1986.) About 51% of each sample initiated breastfeeding, and, among those who

initiated, the mean duration of breastfeeding was 18-19 weeks.

       Table 2 presents means and standard deviations by the mother’s employment status after

the child’s birth. Columns 1-2 compare maternal characteristics between mothers who returned

to work before the child was 3 months old and mothers who did not. Columns 3-4 compare

maternal characteristics between mothers who returned to work full-time within 3 months after

the birth and mother who had returned to work within 3 months, but not full-time.



                                                 17
       The timing of return to work (Columns 1-2) appears to be associated with breastfeeding

duration, but not initiation. Mothers who returned to work within 3 months were just as likely to

initiate breastfeeding, but they breastfed for about 3.5 fewer weeks than mothers who did not

return to work within 3 months. There were other interesting differences between the two

groups. Mothers who returned to work within 3 months were older, more educated, more likely

to be married, had higher family income and were less likely to have smoked during pregnancy

compared to mothers who did not return to work within 3 months. These differences were

consistent, but less striking, when the comparison is made between full-time working mothers

and mothers who were working within 3 months, but were not working full-time (Columns 3-4).

Working full-time, however, appears to be associated with decreased likelihood of breastfeeding

initiation and a decline of about 5 weeks of breastfeeding. These findings suggest that the small

differences in breastfeeding between these groups of mothers may be confounded by the higher

socioeconomic status of mothers who return to work shortly after childbirth.

       Table 3 displays a more detailed breakdown of breastfeeding patterns by return-to-work

status. As the top panel of Table 3 shows, mothers who return to work within a month after

childbirth are only slightly less likely to initiate breastfeeding than mothers who return later.

Mothers who return to work when the child was 1-3 months old, however, have lower rates of

breastfeeding initiation than mothers who did not return to work within 3 months. There was no

consistent pattern between the timing of return to work and breastfeeding duration. As the

bottom panel of Table 3 demonstrates, there is a much stronger relationship between hours

worked and breastfeeding among mothers who had returned to work within 3 months after

childbirth. The number of hours worked is inversely associated with both breastfeeding

initiation and duration. These results suggest that the timing of return to work may or may not

be important in breastfeeding decisions, but among mothers who return to work within 3 months,



                                                 18
working more hours detracts from breastfeeding. Clearly, other observable and unobservable

factors may confound these relationships.

       Fixed effects models rely solely on within-family variation in employment and

breastfeeding practices since all other variation is eliminated from the model. Tables 4a and 4b

assess whether or not there is sufficient within-family variation in the data. For clear

presentation, the tables focus only on breastfeeding initiation and only on families with 2

children. We note, however, that there is much more scope for variation within larger families

(which essentially have more repeated observations) and when the number of weeks of

breastfeeding is considered as an outcome. Our assessment of within-family variation therefore

focuses on the scenario where within-family variation is likely to be the lowest. Approximately

67% of the children in the sibling sample lived in 2-child families.

       Table 4a shows variation within 2 child families in returning to work within 3 months,

initiating breastfeeding, and returning to full-time work within 3 months. About 35% of mothers

returned to work within 3 months with one child, but did not return within 3 months with another

child. Approximately 31% of mothers worked full-time before one child was 3 months old, but

did not work full-time within 3 months with another child. Variation in breastfeeding initiation

within families was less common; only about 19% of mothers initiated breastfeeding with one

child but not with another child.

       Table 4b limits the comparison to mothers who show variation between two children in

both breastfeeding initiation and work decisions after childbirth. These “switchers” actually

determine the estimate of maternal employment on breastfeeding in the fixed effects models.

Within 90 switcher families, about 41% of mothers initiated breastfeeding when the mother

returned to work within 3 months, while about 59% of mothers who did not return to work

within 3 months initiated breastfeeding. However, within switcher families, full-time work did

not appear to negatively affect breastfeeding decisions. The fixed effects models presented in
                                                 19
the next section enhance this simple comparison by controlling for time-varying and time

invariant covariates, such as the mother’s marital status and the birthweight of the child, that may

confound these relationships.

       Regression diagnostics revealed that one of the dependent variables, the number of weeks

the child was breastfed, was highly right skewed. Once this variable was transformed to its

natural log form, several regression problems were solved at once, including a problem of non-

normal error distribution and several influential data points. For this reason, all weeks breastfed

models were estimated in semi-log form.

7.     ESTIMATION RESULTS

       Tables 5 and 6 show estimates of the timing of return to work (Table 5) and the intensity

of return to work (Table 6) on breastfeeding initiation and breastfeeding persistence. Columns 1-

3 in each table focus on the initiation of breastfeeding as an outcome, while columns 4-6 in each

table show results from models in which the log of the number of weeks breastfed is the

dependent variable. The weeks breastfed models are limited to children whose mothers initiated

breastfeeding. All of the models in Table 6, which focuses on the intensity of work, are limited

to children whose mothers returned to employment before they were three months old.

Timing of Return to Work and Breastfeeding

       Column 1 in Table 5 shows results from a parsimonious model of breastfeeding initiation.

This model includes as independent variables a dummy indicator of whether or not the mother

returned to work before the child was 3 months old, race, the year of the child’s birth, and the

mother’s aptitude test score. Column 2 expands this model to include a larger number of child

and maternal characteristics, some of which are potentially endogenous. In both the

parsimonious and fully specified models, returning to work within 3 months is associated with a

decrease in the probability of .08 -.09 in the probability of initiating breastfeeding. At the



                                                 20
sample means, this reduction translates into a 16-18 percent decrease in the probability of

initiating breastfeeding.

       The inclusion of additional covariates (Column 2) has little impact on the magnitude of

the estimated impact of returning to work on breastfeeding initiation. Many of the additional

covariates, however, appear to be important predictors of breastfeeding initiation. Older, more

educated, and married mothers are more likely than others to initiate breastfeeding. African-

American and Hispanic mothers are less likely than mothers of other races and ethnicities to

initiate breastfeeding. Children who are first-born are more likely to be breastfed, and low

birthweight children are much less likely to be breastfed. Mothers who report smoking during

pregnancy are less likely to initiate breastfeeding. It appears that selection along unobserved

characteristics may not be particularly important because: (1) observed maternal and child

characteristics are good predictors of breastfeeding initiation; and (2) the inclusion of these

characteristics does not have much impact on the estimate of maternal employment on

breastfeeding initiation.

       If selection on observed characteristics is not particularly important, it seems unlikely

that selection on unobserved characteristics is important [26]. This informal test suggests that

controlling for unobserved heterogeneity may not be important in this context, but it is by no

means a definite indication of the importance of unobservable factors. In this case, in fact, a

Breusch-Pagan Lagrange Mulitplier test for random effects suggested that the disturbance term

includes a mother-specific error component. This finding is consistent with breastfeeding

research, which suggests that mother-specific factors that are difficult to measure in a secondary

data set, such as a mother’s cultural beliefs about breastfeeding, are very important in the

decision to initiate breastfeeding. For this reason, we estimate a fixed effects model using a sub-

sample of the data that only includes children of mothers with more than one child. This model



                                                 21
differences out the fixed, mother-specific component of the error term, leaving an unbiased

estimate of the impact of returning to work on breastfeeding initiation.

       Column 3 of Table 5 shows fixed effects model results. The models ignore the fact that

the dependent variable is binary. A random effects probit would have accounted for the binary

dependent variable, but a Hausman test suggested the existence of correlation between right hand

side variables and the disturbance term. For this reason, a standard fixed effects model was

estimated. (It was not possible to test for heteroscedasticity because of the large number of

mothers in the sample.) The fixed effects model results are consistent with the baseline probit

results – returning to work within 3 months is associated with a reduction in the probability of

breastfeeding. It is difficult to interpret the magnitude of this estimate, however, since the binary

nature of the dependent variable was ignored.

       Columns 4, 5 and 6 present results of models in which the log of the number of weeks

breastfed is the dependent variable. These models are limited to children whose mothers

initiated breastfeeding. Columns 4 and 5 present findings from a parsimonious OLS model and a

fully specified OLS model. As before, the inclusion of a full set of covariates does not change

the magnitude of the coefficient on maternal employment very much. In both models, returning

to work before the child is 3 months old is associated with a 33-34% decrease in the number of

weeks of breastfeeding, among children whose mothers initiated breastfeeding. At the sample

means, this percentage decrease translates into 6 fewer weeks of breastfeeding.

       Older, more educated, married mothers breastfed their infants longer than younger, less

educated, unmarried mothers. First-born children actually were breastfed for fewer weeks than

later-born children, even though previous results showed that mothers were more likely to

initiate breastfeeding with first-born children. Mothers who smoked during pregnancy breastfed

their infants for fewer weeks compared to mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy. As in



                                                 22
the breastfeeding initiation models, maternal smoking during pregnancy may represent a

mother’s lack of knowledge or interest in child health.

       As before, a Breusch-Pagan Lagrange Multiplier test supported the existence of a fixed,

mother-specific component in the disturbance term, and a Hausman test suggested that fixed

effects models rather than random effects models are appropriate in this case. In the

breastfeeding duration models, however, the sample size was reduced because the models were

limited to children whose mother initiated breastfeeding. The smaller sample size allowed us to

perform a Breusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity in the standard fixed effects model. Because

we did find evidence of heteroscedasticity, we estimated a heteroscedastic fixed effects model,

which allows for mother-specific variances.

       Findings from the heteroscedastic fixed effects model support the baseline results.

Returning to work within 3 months is associated with a 22% decrease in the number of weeks of

breastfeeding, among mothers who initiated breastfeeding. At sample means, this percentage

decrease represents a reduction in breastfeeding of about 4 weeks. In summary, then, all of the

models support the idea that returning to work within 3 months of childbirth is associated with a

reduced probability of initiating breastfeeding and, among mothers who initiate breastfeeding, a

reduction of 4-6 weeks in the duration of breastfeeding.

Intensity of Return to Work and Breastfeeding

       It is assumed that returning to work interferes with breastfeeding because both activities

are time-intensive. Because working full-time is clearly more time-intensive than working part-

time, it is possible that among mothers who return to work within 3 months, working more hours

may have more detrimental effects on breastfeeding than working fewer hours. The descriptive

statistics presented in Table 3 show that full-time, working mothers are less likely to breastfeed

than part-time working mothers. However, in Table 4b, there does not appear to be a clear trend



                                                23
in the rate of breastfeeding within mothers who had different working intensity between 2

children.

         Table 6 presents results from models that are limited to mothers who returned to work

within 3 months after childbirth. Columns 1-3 show findings from models of breastfeeding

initiation, while columns 4-6 show results from models with log of the number of weeks of

breastfeeding as the dependent variable. All of the baseline results (columns 1-2 and 4-5)

suggest that among mothers who returned to work within 3 months, working full-time reduces

the probability of breastfeeding by about 18% and reduces the number of weeks of breastfeeding

by about 4 weeks (among those who initiated breastfeeding). The comparison group includes all

mothers who returned to work within 3 months, but were working less than 40 hours a week.

The median hours worked in the comparison group was 25 hours per week.

         The fixed effects models (Table 6, columns 3 and 6) do not completely support these

results. The models suggest that working full-time may have a negative impact on the number of

weeks of breastfeeding of about 1 week among mothers who initiate breastfeeding (column 6).

This result is consistent with our previous findings. However, after differencing out an

unobserved, mother-specific effect, working full-time appears to have a positive association

(rather than a negative association) with breastfeeding initiation (column 3). This positive result

is inconsistent with both the theoretical motivation and all of the other empirical results in this

paper.

   8.       DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

         Breastfeeding is one of the most important maternal investments in infant health during

the first year of life, but very few health economics studies focused on the United States consider

breastfeeding as a health behavior that can be influenced by labor market decisions and by public

policy. This study provides evidence that return to work decisions after childbirth can have

important effects on breastfeeding. Therefore, policies that affect return to work decisions after
                                                 24
childbirth, through their effects on breastfeeding, have considerable potential to improve infant

health. We find that returning to work within the first three months of the infant’s life is

associated with a reduction in the probability of initiating breastfeeding by 16-18 percent, and a

reduction in the duration of breastfeeding by 4-6 weeks among mother who initiate

breastfeeding. Full-time work among mothers who return to work within 3 months has no

consistent effect on breastfeeding initiation, but it is associated with a reduction in the duration

of breastfeeding of about 1-4 weeks.

       Our results are novel and policy-relevant for several reasons. First, we use data on

siblings, which allows us to build on previous literature on employment and breastfeeding by

addressing the problem of unobserved heterogeneity without relying on potentially weak

identifying variables. Past studies, with the exception of Roe et al., ignore the problem of

unobserved heterogeneity. Our results on the effects of return to work decisions on

breastfeeding duration are consistent with previous work, which suggests that the length of

maternity leave and the number of hours worked are positively associated with breastfeeding

duration.

       We also consider the effect of return-to-work decisions on breastfeeding initiation. This

outcome is important to address because: (1) a sizable proportion of mothers do not initiate

breastfeeding; (2) as we describe, theory suggests that returning to work can affect initiation; and

(3) most previous research focuses on the effect of employment on breastfeeding duration among

mothers who have already initiated breastfeeding. We find that returning to work within 3

months detracts from breastfeeding initiation. Because the decision to breastfeed is made

immediately after childbirth, we interpret this association as a mother’s plans to return to work

within 3 months (which we cannot measure directly) having a negative association with

breastfeeding initiation. Plans to return to full-time work rather than part-time work do not

appear to have a consistent association with breastfeeding initiation.
                                                 25
       Finally, the magnitude of the associations we find are large and important from a public

health perspective. A reduction in breastfeeding duration of six weeks implies that, at the mean,

a mother would stop breastfeeding her child when he is between two and three months old

instead of when he is about four months old. Clinical literature suggests a dose response

relationship between the length of breastfeeding and health benefits for infants such as decreased

otitis media, acute respiratory infection, diarrhea, gastroenteritits, and allergic disease [27-30],

although these findings are not universal [31]. Our results suggest, therefore, that decisions

about employment after childbirth, through their impact on breastfeeding, may have important

ramifications for infant health.
