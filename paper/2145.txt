     The relationship between the ct.ipensation policies a firm pursues

and the firlirs econanic performance Is a central issue in industrial

relations. Yet, while a variety of theories exist about    the   effects of

various ccuiipensatton policies, surprisingly little evidence exists on

the extent to which caipensation p01 cies vary across firms and more

inçortantly on the effects of puriing alternative cipensation

strategies.1 This paper attenpts to sim.uarize the available ejipirical

evidence and to lay out an agenda for future research.

    The study of employee cawensation has a long history in the

literatures of labor econanics and personnel. Wages are at the core of

employment relationships; consequently, their determination is a

central issue of interest in both fields. At the risk of over

simplifying to draw a contrast, econciiilsts have tended to focus on wage

differentials and their correlates. Much of the work in the 40's and

So's examIned employer's wage policies and their relationship to

industry, union, regional and occupational characteristics.2 During the

1960s and 19?Os the association between human capital characteristics

such as age, experience, education, gender and the I Ike and wage

differentials were studied. Only recently has econaElsts' focus

shifted to why alternative censatIon policies mltt arise and their

effects on firm performance.

     In contrast, the study of personnel has traditionally dealt with

the techniques involved in alninistration of eiç,loyee caipensation.

Much of this work focuses on caliparisons   of the properties of various
techniques, and their effects on employee work attitudes and
behaviors.3 Censation research in the personnel          iterature draws

heavily upon econanic and psychological theories. Studies report the

relationships of pay with employees' satisfaction, as well as their

decisions to apply, join and remain   with   a firm. Further, relying

heavily on motivation theories, personnel research also examines

ciipensat'on's role as a reward or incentive to influence employee

performance. More recently, interest has expanded to examine the

effects that strategic choices ii, ccmpensation policies and practices

may have on finns'   economic performance, as well as employees' behavior
and atti tudes.

     The effect of differences in compensation policies and practices

on the firm's thottan line1 is perhaps the most inportant measure of

their economic impact.    bfriile the literature in both fields speculates

about the effects of various caipensation policies and practices on

firm performance little research has been directed to assess this

relationship. One reason for the lack of such research is that the

data required, detailed Individual compensation and performance data

gathered across firms, is difficult to collect. Another reason is that

relationship between any personnel system, be it conpensation. staffing

or training and a firm's economic performance is indirect. At best.

personnel p01 icies and practices operate directly upon other more

intermedLate variables such as employee behavior and perhaps on local

plant or subunit performance. These in turn affect overall economic

performance.

     Granted some nieajres eilwloyed may be considered proxies for a

firm's performance. Size. measred by nunter of ewployees, assets, or
                                       $

sales revenues, Is an exawle. But typically thes. measures are

considered in terms of their effects on a firm's cciiipensatior,

decisions, such as its wage level and the shape of its employees'

experience—earning profile., rather than focusing on how cpensatIon

policies and changes an them affects a firm's financial performance and

its value to shareholders.4 As we shall discuss in the next section,

most of the work on the direct effects of cailpensation policies has

been limited to high—level executive cpensation. Beyond executive

pay, the plain fact is that we know very little about whether different

employee ctpensation policies and practices affect firm performance.

Speculation is rife; research rare.

        At the onset, it is lucortant to stress that calcensation policies

may vary on several dimensions. First, the 'level' of clI,en.atlon

varies. From a policy perspective, the level refers to the average

cuiensatjon paid Dy a firm relative to that paid by its competitors.

Evidence suggests that firms pursue different policies, some lead,

others match and still others pay less than their cetitors. hiy the

level    of conç.ensation should vary across finite, has been the subject of
considerable research by economists.5 However,      while   the consequences
of a    firm's relative compensation level on Its ability to attract.

motivate and retain a stable workforce has received ewirical

attention, the consequences for the firm's financial performance has

not been studied.6

        Second, it is well known that the caiensation structure varies

          firms.7   Structures refer to the distribution of rates or

internal pay hierarchies. In Sr finns, the hl.est paid work
                                        4

receives    over 100 times the c.Tjpensation of the lowest paid and the

differentials in other finns may be less than ID times, Of importance

to us is the implications of these different structures for employees

work behaviors and firm performance.8

        A third dimension of a firm's caiiensation strategy pertains to

the forms or the mix of various elements of total censation. Total

cc.,pensatjon may include base pay, a variety of Incentive schemes,

COLAs, various farms    of   stock options and an Increasing array of

benefits. Firms differ in terms of the number of pay forms offered.

the degree to which employees are offered a choice among different

forms, the relative Importance of each form (e.g. base wage/total

canpensatlon ratio or incentive/base wage ratio,) and the proportion

of the workforce eligible for each form beyond the legal requirements,

Ce.. in sane firms all employees receive profltsharlng, in others only

a handful of executives are covered). Various types of employee

benefits, such as pensions, may have Important Incentive effects that

can influence employee behavior and firm performance.9

        Fourth, policies for granting cpensation Increases vary among

firms and, even within a firm, among occupational groups. Scme firms

grant increases across the board, based strictly on time worked, while

others base increases on incentive mechani.uis such as profit—sharing,

team awards, gain—sharing, or pay for individual performance. Such

performance—based   schemes vary widely. Some     emphasize the short term,

(e.g.   merit pay increases and bonus awards to key performers) others
long term (e.g. stock options). Scie        firms use subjective measure of

performance (e.g. merit ratings, project cletion), others used
                                       5

quantitative meaakres <unit, produced, return on equity, stock value).

the unit of analysis employed in performance n,eaairement also vary

(e.g. individual employee, work teams or cells and unit/organization

wide). Some extend eligibility to cover all employees, others limit

participation depending on the incentive plan Involved. Once again,

the effects of such differences on the performance of the firm is not

well investigated)0

     Finally, the or by which          compensation is athlnistered   also
differs. AU,iinistratiye processes may vary on several dimensions.

Anng these are the extent to which pay Information (e.g.. rates,

ranges, rationales, market data) is disclosed to employees, the nature

of employee participation in the determination and alministratlon of

pay, the existence of dispute resolution proceóares and the degree to

which policy design and implementation is decentralized. Scme firms

have formalized job evaluation systems that aid In determining internal

pay hierarchies, while other firms allow for considerable wage

flexibility across positions. Some firms operate in a unionized

environment: others do not. Similarly, some allow for employee

participation and disclosure in compensation decisions, while others do

not. Since several papers in this volume address these latter two

differences, our treatment of them will be brief.11

     These five basic dimensions of cnpensation policy——the level,

reflecting   the competitiveness   of total couipensation; the structure

reflecting   the internal pay hierarchies; the mix of different
compensation forms; the nature of pay increases and the process
employed to aUuinister censation——can serve as the framework for
                                             6

examining the relationship between catipensation and ftrm performance.

But disentangling the effects of each of these dimensions will be a

difficult and perhaps unfeasible task. It is possible that                   a firm's
economic performance is affected by its ccoipensation strategy in tntn.

If this is the case then we need to examine a                firm's behavior   on these

policy dimensions simultaneously rather than                 reating each as discrete

decisions. Empirically, a firi's censat ion strategy nee to be

measured as a tt. of interrelated dimensions.

        Once the censation policy variable is focused on                  the next

issue is how to measure firm performance. In                 general, ones concern

should be with a measure of         the overall ecoimli ic well—being of the

organization. So, as       we shall see below, many          studies   primarily those

relating    to executive comp en sa tion, focus on the total return

(dividends • capital gains) on shareholders' equ ity. Others focus on

accounting measures, such as            eported   profits.    Sti   others   argue that

what is relevant is       ow    stock   market or accounti ng measures are doi 09

after controlling for      general      and inthjstry sped ftc econ,ic

conditions; these studies        ofte     use relative (to other firms) in the

industry performance measures             (A more complete     discussion   of the

measurement of firm performance is found in the Becker—Olson paper in
this volume.)
        As noted earlier, studies of non—executive employee             compensation

have    not examined how compensation policies or practices (or changes in
them)    affect   the overall   economic well—being of an organi2ation. The
unstated premise underlying these studies is that ccensation systems
can directly affect variables such as employee productivity,
                                        7

absenteeio.     turnover and job satisfaction. The issue of the indirect

effects of caipensation policies and practices on more general

accounting or market return measures has been left unaddressed.         It is

possible that direct affects can be observed only for executive jobs

where decisions may directly affect econcelic measures, while decisions

by non—executive employees have at best very distant relationships to a

firms performance.

     It s important to stress that a causal relationship between

crensatlon policy and firm performance cannot be inferred directly
from simple correlations of the two variables. So, for example, a

positive correlation between      wage levels   and firm profitability might

indicate that a high wage policy causes high profits gj that high

profits   provide a surplus ihich    workers can share In the form of high
wages. ht.lle sane    of the studies we discuss below provide correlations
between firm performance and co.wensation policies, very few actually
provide   convincin; evidence that coiiipensatlon policy affects firm
per formance.

     We   begin   in the next section with a discussion of the evidence on
the relationship between the compensation of high—level executives and
firm performance. There      is   a substantial body of research findings
here that draw heavily on both the finance and economics literature.
Section III discusses the evidence on employee cpensation and firm
performance; in the main the research findings here draw heavily frau
the human resource and personnel literatures, although the economic5
literature also has sthir.g to add. Finally, section IV           provides a
                                                8

sumary       of what we have learned from these literatures and a discussion

of research Issues that still need to be addressed.



11.   Executive Censation
      Given the widely (but as we will see below not always correctly)

perceived separation between the ownership and management of

corporations, concern has been expressed that corporate executives may

pursue objectives such as sales maximization, growth maximization, or

market share maximization that are not necessarily in the                best
interests      of shareholders who are concerned with short run (accounting

profits) and long—run (total stock market return) measures of the

economic profitability of the corporation. Theoretical models that

seek optimal ways to resolve this Drincinal—ant problem, that Is ways

to provide incentives for executives to take actions that are In the

best interests of shareholders, always come to the conclusion that

executive compensation somehow should be structured to provide such

i ncent   i yes.   12


      Early        empirical studies of      executive   compensation were cross-
section in nature and focused on whether across firms, executive
compensation was more highly correlated with sales or accounting
profits. In             the main the   correlations with sales were highest
suggesting, at           first glance, that corporate executives' ca,ensation

was not structured in such a way to maximize stockholders' well—

being.13 However, these correlations may reflect only that arge firj

employ more ab'e executives and thus nnast pay them more. These
                                      9

correlations   then, tell us little about   the incentives facing any given
executive at a point in time.

     Note recently, a number of studies have used longitudinal data and

examtned whether changes in tøp level executives' caTpensation tends to

be correlated with changes In the economic performance of firms.14 The

aefinition of economic performance varies across studies. Salle use

accounting measures like reported profits, while others use measures of

the total return on a firm's securities; salle use absolute performance

measures while others use performance measures relative to other firms

in the same industry (most theoretical models suggest that executive

performance should be measured net of industry effects). The

definition of censatlon also varies; salle use salaries and bonuses,

*ile others try to include the values of stock options exercised

and/or   deferred payments.
     Virtually all of these studies find, however, that changes In
executive camensation are hiiy positively correlated with the
econanic   performance measures. That is.    corporate executives'

caipensation does seem to     be at least inplicitly   structured   in a way to
provide    them with incentives to maximize the economic performance of

their firms. Several studies also show that relatively poor economic

performance in one yeat is associated with a higher probability of

executive turnover in later years; this further siggests that

incentives that operate in the cortect direction exist.5

     Of course to say that a correlation exists between executives

censation changes and their firms' economic performance Is in Itself

not evidence that tying their compensation to performance will lead to
                                     10

improved economic performance. One possibility is that corporations

initially don't know what the true productivity of their executives

are. However, to the extent that executives productivity can be

imperfectly sional Led by corporate performance1 relating their

ccoipensation to corporate performance is a way of 'paying them ithat

they're worth', If this is occurring, the cnensation—performance

nexus would reflect learning about executives' 'true ability' over

time, not necessarily any Incentive arrangement to stimulate economic

performance,16 Furthermore, even if appropriate incentives              exist,

it doesn't necessarily follow that they will have their intended

effect.

     Disentangling whether the observed correlation is ae to

incentives" or 'learning" is not an easy task. One study that

attempted to do this used InformatIon on the stage of the executives'

careers (presumably earning occurs primarily at early stages) and the

variability of executives' ccaçensation over their life cycles (if

learning a, driving the process, an executive's variability in earnings

should decline over time) and concluded that while both 'incentives'

and 'learning" may exist, there was sane evidence that 'learning

effects were most wortant,7 Other studies, however, showed that the

correlation    of measures of performance and comipensation growth were
highest for better performing firms,      which is at   least suggestive that
better incentives in executive compensation do lead to better corporate
performance. '
     Another   strand of research, which draws heavily on the        finance

literature, focuses   on particular provisions. of      executive   ca,ipensation
                                          II


agreements and examines whether adoption of such provisions is

associated with abnormally high stock market returns for          shareholders.
For exaile, studies of the adoption of executive stock option plans

and executive     incentive cropensation agreements based on short—run or
long—run accounting profits measures have all shown that          the

announcement of the plan, lead to increases in          shareholder   wealth.19
At   least   one study has also   found   that corporate capital investments
tend to tncrease after the adoption of long—run executive incentive
calipensation (or performance plan) agreements.20
       At least   three explanations can be given for these findings. The

first is that these provisions S have favorable incentive effects and

that the increases in shareholder wealth reflect anticipated increases

in profits that will occur &e to the adoption of the provisions.

       The second is that      these provisions are proposed   by management and

adopted      by boar   of   directors only when management believes management
will benefit      fr the provisions. As such their adoption siiaIs to

the market that management expects good times are ahead; this would

have   a positive effect on      shareholder wealth (since It conveys new

positive      Information) even If no incentive effects were      Involved.

       Finally, the provisions may be adopted for Sa reasons.            To the

extent that capital gains historically have been taxed at lower rates

than earned ince (at least up until 1987). adoption of stock option

plans may have allcc.ted corporations to provide management with

increased (or equal to preadoption) after—tax cçensatIon levels at

l.,er   total costs to the corporation.        If   this occurred shareholder

wealth would of course increase.
                                      12

      As above, disentangling c.A.ich subset of these expanatlons I,

'correct'   is a difficult task. One study has provided some evidence in

favor of the incentive hypothesis.2t Specifically, it found that the

adoption of forms of stock option plans that do not have tax advantages

led to increases in shareholder wealth, that boards of directors'

statements often claimed anticipated incentive effects would result

fran stock option adoptions, and that privately held firms often have

stock option plans for executives. The former two forms of evidence,

however, do not enable one to strongly discriminate between the

incentive and s,cnallinn hypotheses.

      To take another example, a second set of studies has analyzed

golden parachute'      agreements; agreements that provide for (often
substantial)     calipensation for a corporate executive if   a change In

ownership   of   voting stock and/or shift in the majority of    the board of

directors of a corporation occurs that leads to the termination of the

executive's enployment. No hypotheses have been put forth          for the
existence   of these agreements. On the one hand, these arrangements may

increase the costs of takeover bids and reduce their probability of

occurring. This would make the executive's position more secure but

would not necessarily be in the best interests of shareholders; in a

sense   it is argued then these agreements transfer wealth      from

shareholders to management.

      On the other hand, one might argue that these plans help to alii
the   incentives   of executives and shareholders. By protecting
management fran harm, they encourage executives to negotiate takeovers
that increase the value of shareholders' equity, This protection is
                                       La

particularly important in situations in which management censatiori

has been structured so that cnpensation increases with         tenure,   with

part of this increase being a deferred reward for prior performance.

Such deferred canpensation schemes prove to be optimal In a theoretical

sense in situations in which estimates of an executive's performance

are very "noisy•' but     improve with his tenure.22

      In fact, the available empirical evidence suggests that on balance

the second hypothesis is the correct one; the adoption of "golden

parachute agreements appears to be associated empirically with

favorable security market response (i.e., positive excess returns in

the short—runL23 ile such evidence cannot disentangle the incentive

al i.....nt   hypotheses from the hypotheses that such adoptions simply
si,al   situations In which takeover bids, and hence excess returns, are

likely, it Is Interesting that another study found that executives'

tenure—earning profiles wre steeper in firms          that had golden parachute
agreements     than they were in firms that did not, ceteris paribus.24
That Is, In situations where deferred caipensation appeared to be more
important,    golden   parachutes were more likely to exist.
      One mist caution, however, that all of the studies that find an
association    between the adoption   of    particular provisions of executive

calipensat 'on agreements and abnormally hI stock market returns are

drawing conclusions about the effect,vene of executive incentive

canpensation    agreements fran short—run changes in stock market prices.
Many of these provisions are designed to encourage executives to take
the long—run interests of the firm into account when decisions are
made. Yet surprisingly, save for Larker's (3983) study, it appears
                                      14

that these studies do not address whether the adaption of these

provisions actually alters executives' decisions in any systematic way

or leads to higher long—run accounting profits.

     in addition to the research described above on the relationship

between executive ccnpensation and firm performance in the for—profit

sector of the economy, a number of studies have examined the

relationship between executive ceijipensation and 'performance in the

public ana nonprofit sectors of the econny. Of course. in the absence

of a profit—maximiztng objective, performance is much harder to define

in these sectors. Essentially each of these studies defined 'that it

considered to be a reasonable    measure of performance and then sought to
ascertain   if   executive coiwensation and/or turnover was related to this

performance measure ceteris paribus. That is. these studies asked if

the censat on of executives in the public and nonprofit sectors was

structured in such a way to encourage executives to try to Improve the

performance measure.

     For example, one study of the censatlon of chief business

agents of local building trade unions, who are salaried officers

resonsible (among other things) for negotiating contracts, found that

their salaries tended to be positively related to the relative wage

advantages their members had over 'members of the same union in other

cities and over other building trades union members in the same city.25

Thus, incentives appear to have existed for the business agents to try

to maximize their members' wage Increases.

    A second study focused on appointed municipal government

officials, specifically city—managers, and pal ice and fire department
                                        15

chiefs. Performance in this study was defined in term, of how well

the officials were doing relative to what might be expected given the

socioeconco,ic characteristic, of the city ——        or Ilre precisely, by
resi&als from estimated 1output equationr.             Positive performance      for
the three officials were assumed to be, respectively, lower than

predicted property tax rates but       higher than predicted expenditure
levels (which could occur oliwitaneously only If           the   city-manager was
good   at   attracting aid fri higher levels of government), lower than

prefficted cr,me rates, and better than predicted fire insurance

ratings. For all three types of executives, salaries were positively

correlated across areas, ceteris paribus, with the performance

measures, again suggesting that somne incentives for the officials to

perform' existed.

       A third study of this type focused on public school district

superintendents and defined school dlstrict         performance using a

residual approach as above.27        Distri ets that were   performing   well   were

assumed     to be those in   which student test   scores exceeded their
predicted    values, given the character istics of the district, and where
tax   rates were   lower than   predicted,   again given school district
characteristics.      In this longitudinaI    study both   salary changes and

the probability of moving to a better        changing job were seen to be
positively related to the performance        nleamgres. However, the     magnitude

sector positions   provided   incentives for the executives to pursue

specified performance objectives, none actually examined if the

existence of these Incentives did lead to liwroved performance. One

recent study, however, was able to observe several measures of

performance of local social security adninistration offices both before

ana after the adoption of formal merit       pay   plans that partially tied

managerial salary increases to these performance measures.28 Using a

quasi—experimental design and statisttcal prooeajres to eliminate

trends and cycles in the performance measires, the study found that the

adoption of the merit pay plans led to no short—run effects on

performance, the authors noted, however, that the system was stfl              In

its early stages and that effects mlt possibly be observed after it

became more institutionalized and better understood.

     In concluding this section, it is interesting to note that there

appear to be no studies In either the private—for—profit, nonprofit, or

public sectors on how the level of executive compensation affects

economic performance. Similarly, there are no studies of how the

rewards for seniority, probabilities of pranotion, or salary structure

across executive positions within a firm affect economic performance.

That is. we do not know whether paying hi, salaries to attract and

retain high quality executives 'pays', whether offering executives

rewards for seniority "pays', whether offering within—firm promotional

opportunities (e.g., fran     vice   president to president or from president

to chief executive officer), 'payV and thether the caipensation levels

across executives within a firm are structured in such a way to

encourage   improved firm performance.29

     The purpose of this section of the paper is to examine the

literature pertaining to a firm's ccmpensation policies for employees

not covered under executive pay systems and the relationsiap of these

policies to the performance of firms.

     Evidence of variations in the censation policies and practices

of firms can be found in several scarce,. Typically the data are

incomplete, collected for other purposes, or of limited use for

determining any direct effects of compensation on firm performance.

Sufficient signs of differences in firm's policies do exist and they

are considered in terms of the basic dimensions discussed earl icr.

     Certainly, differences in pay levels and the cspetitive position

among firms is well established in both the economics and personnel

literatures. Reports iss'ed by private consulting firms that survey

enployer practices detail differences in pay levels by characteristics

of the firm e.g. in&stry, revenues, workforce size), Job (e.g.

function. cescription. job evaluation points and number of incumbents)

and geography and Area Was &zrvevs conjcted by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics   also show wide variations in   wages within narrowly defined
Job classifications in a metropolitan area.30

     One study, which had access to a private consulting firm's survey

data frau aerospace ccqanles, reported that after controlling for

firm size (number of employees and revenues), substantial variations

existed in the average salaries paid among these firms (e.g the two

highest paying finns paid more than 16 percent above the market average

w,tch the average paid by the lowest two was more than 11 percent below
                                     18

the market average).31 These firms also exhibited dif ferent

ciipetitive positEons for different functional special ties. For

example, in Dne, the average pay for 9 of 13 functions exceeded the

market average for each function, while in another the average pay

exceeded the market average in only 5 of the 13 functions.

      These data do not permit one to distinguith whether these

differences across functions reflect differential contributions of the

functions to the fi rms objectives or to other factors such as

differences in empi oyee age or experience nistributlons across

functions. Whether conensation levei policies tend to be occupation—

specific or cnpany wide is unclear. It is possible that firms

ciipeting within an industry may have one policy for occupations

critica     to the firm's objectives and another for those less critical.

Recent evidence found by Leonard (1985) tentatively agrees with the

data reported above that occupation—weelfIc as well as company wide

p01 i des   exist.

      Anecdotal accounts of different compensation policies are also

available. A study of the personnel policies of large non—union firms,

reports a variety of competitive poli cy statements about relative

cipensatiorj evej positions32 Smie firms with centralized personnel

systems reportedly adhere to corporate—wide copensation policies for

all business units, others report that each of their business units

adopt their own canpetitive posture in thei    markets. The former seem
to be most cmnon in firms with integrated lines of business, the

latter is more casnon in cong'omerates with multiple and unrelated

proict lines.

       The efficiency wage literature In        econallics suggests various
reasons    why saoe enIoyers night set higher wages than their
canpetitors    for employees of equal quality. Examples include
differences    in turnover costs, differences in the need f or close

supervision (so—cal led 'worker shirking') and difference in employee

ccuiultment. Evidence of different pay levels within a product market

or industry is also widely available in studies of iritra-industry wage

differentials. Thanns (1906) study of the effects of firm size on wage

levels in the plastics industry, Groshen's 0906) study of employer

effects on wage dispersion in plastics, industrial chemical and woolen

yarn industries, and Leonard's (19%) study of wages in California's

high—technology sector are recent examples.

       Generally these studies confirm earlier findings. For example, it

is well    known that differences In Intra—industry wage rates are

correlated with firm size. Numerous explanations are ccuipnonly advanced

to explain this relationship including (1) larger firma use more

advanced technoiogies and require greater employee skills and

discipline. (2) cc.lensating differentials are required to offset the

greater disutility of working in larger firm,, (3) labor unions in

larger    firms have been able to appropriate sane of the firm's higher
profits,   and (4) large firms   pay   higher   wages to   rethce e,çloyee
shirking and thus supervision     costs. Note that these          explanations

inly   that a firm's econquic    performance     and the conditions It faces
permit, or provide econanic Incentives for It to adopt a particular pay

posture. Unless one tautolocloally accepts these explanations as

valid, however, they do DQtI   provide    any evidence that a firm's pay
                                      20

 el/el, as part of its overall canpensation strategy, actually has had

any effect on its econanic performance.

     Sane survey evidence, thoui      limited   In coverage, compares the

canpensation policies of high tech firms with 'traditional' fErms. In

one study forty percent of both the high tech firms and traditional

firms reported foIloing policies in which their pay level matched

their competition. About 20 percent In each group reported they lead

the:r competitors and the rest fol loijed ('less than market averages).

Obviously caution needs to be exercised in interpreting these data:

they are based on reports of cauipensatlon managers and the mechanics

used to translate a poZicy into practice often vary. For example, two

thirds of the firms reported they matched their range mioints with

the median rate paid in the market. However, the specific firms

included in such calculation often vary, the surveys used differ, aria

differences in average rate paid by firms may be due to demographic

differences in each firm's workforces (e.g. seniority) rather than any

intended cetittve policy differences.

     Considered together, the consultant survey information, the

anecdot& accounts, the economic research and the personnel surveys

support the contention that employers' characteristics are related to

the dispersion   fl   pay level and to a firm's relative cai'ensatlon

position among its competitors. But we are interested in evidence on

the effects of differences in relative compensation policy on firms'

financial performance or shareholder value. And here the research

literature is lean.
                                     2!

       Our search of the literature yielded very few studies of the

 effects of different pay levels on performance measres such as

ccnpensatlon—to—revenue ratios. labor cost—to—total cost ratios or

shareholder value. One Suomers' (1906) case study of what happened to

Ford   Motor Canpany when Henry Ford lntro&ced the   $5/day wage In the

early 20th century. found that while absenteeis,i, voluntary turnover,

ann discharges declined after the wage increase and productivity

increased, these changes probably were not sufficiently large In

themselves to allow one to conclude that the new policy Kpaid for

itselP. A second Abowas' (1985) study of recent union wage

settlements. found that unexpectedly high union wage settlements were

reflected virtually dollar for dollar in changes in shareholder value

(see the Becker and Olsen piece in this volume tor more details).

Thus, higher than expected wage settlements do not appear to improve

firm performance. Finally, interin&stry studies of the determinants

of wage levels that specify that high profits cause high wages rather

than vice versa, typically do find that Industry profit levels are an

important explanatory variable In wage equations.36

       A few studies do examine the effects of pay level on eiiiployee and

employer recruiting and turnover behaviors. For example m evidence

suggests that establishing a relatively high pay level increases the

applicant queue permitting firms to select higher quality and thus

potentially more projctive employees. Evidence on the

wage/recruitment expenditure relationship seen. contradictory. One

study reports that high pay levels and high recruiting costs are

substitutes, while another suggests they are clple1lnts ——     that
                                  22

employers who offer relatively hi,er wages also exhibit relatively

greater recruiting expenses.7     Thus, employers that search more are

likely to pay more. But the evidence here is drawn from limited low—

level occupational groups and only limited industry and firm

characteristics are considered. Obviously more work is needed, perhaps

under certain conditions (e.g., critical jobs or long—term unfilled

vacancies), pay levels and recruiting costs are complements, while

under others they are used as substitutes.

     Sane evidence of the effects of pay level on job seekers and

employees choice behavior is also available. For example, studies of

the correlations between wage levels and turnover and absentee,su have

already been cited. Wage levels also appear to be an important factor

when job seekers have a wide range of pay levels fran which to choose

and higher paid workers, ceteris DariSis, report they put more effort

into their jobs and are more sattsfked. Research also exists that

shows that higher military pay leve's Increase the flow of volunteers

to the armed forces.39

     Another dimension of a firms' cailpensatton strategy is its

internal wage hierarchy. Wage hierarchies differ across firms in

different industries that employ differing technologies. For examp'e.

Dreweries have relatively flat hierarchies compared to steel or

automotive firms. But within an industry or firm, managers have

considerable latitude in the design of wage structures. Relatively

flat structures (e.g. fewer grades and wider pay ranges) tend to

obscure differences in task and/or ski   Ii   requirements and offer

managers flexibility in deploying the workforce without necessarily
                                     23

requiring pay changes. Greater hierarchical arrangements e'iiphasaze

greater specification of work rules and Sail requirements and tend to

require pay adjustments mare often.

     Wage structures possess several characteristics. including the

number of levels, the differentials between      levels   and the distribution

of ewloyees among the levels. There is a tendency, especially in

larger organizations for the nwter of employees being paid higher

wages    to be less than the number paid lower   wages. Several atterrpts to

examine    this feature have been reported. For    example,   one study used
the Lorenz curve as an analog and carpared the distribution of
annualized salaries bY cumulative percent of the workforce across

firms.40 Others analyzed the nature of the differentials between

levels in the hierarchy. At least one study found the functional form

of differentials between hierarchical levels to be a constant

proportion.41 Another, based on the analysis of the discretionary

content of work and    norms ascribed to enployees, reports pay ratios of
1.3$ between adjacent managerial levels.42
        Another feature of pay hierarchies is that wages often tend to be

associated with jobs rather than individual eflployees. Thus deploying

workers to new jobs often necessitates wage changes. The alternative

systeii of wages being tied to workers, regardless of       the job performed,
underlies knowler ba Day                  and aturl ty curve arran...nts.
to date, no atte.ipts to systematically examine the effects of Job—based
as ccupared to employee—based pay structures have been conducted.44
        There Is also a tendency, at least in larger firms,     for   a large
proportion of eloyees In hi,er paid jobs to         have been prctnoted fri
                                       24

lower paid joos within the same firm and for new hires to enter at

specific points in the hierarchy. Auninistrative proceJres documented

as part of internal labor markets serve to reQulate these promotions

an wage hierarchies.45 Finally there is ,ne evidence that pay rates

rise with seniority and experience and that the variance of earnings

increases with experience and age.

        The literature contains many explanation! for these feature. at

pay hierarchies. Theoretically, variations In internal wage

hierarchie, are seen as influencing a wide array of employees'

behaviors.7 These include their decisions to file grievances, invest

in training, take on added responsibilities, improve their performance.

turnover, form unions and the like. But to our knowledge 112 attention

has been devoted to examining empirically the effects of variations in

the pay hierarchies and workforce profiles on firms'        performance.
        Recent news report,   do describe caoes   of employers' attempts to
re1ce labor casts and improve prothctivity by modifying their pay
hierarchies. They report drastic reductions in the         nuiiter of levels

(grades)    in the pay structure as wI I as workforce reduction schemes
aimed not only at shrinking the overall     workforce level but

reconfiguring the distribution of employees within the structure (e.g.

early    retirement programs and demotions). But systematic study of the
effects of    these events has not been reported.
     A renewed interest in wage hierarchies within firms        has also

occurred among labor economists. However, most        of this work has     been

at the theoretical level; empirical research is much sketchier.48

Economists   have found that union policies produce reductions      in the
                                       25

dispersion at the plant level; wage dispersion within unionized firms

(measured as standard deviations of the log of wages) averages 1/3 less

than In non—union firms.49        Considering the effects of within—firm

wage differentials, this same study found that the wider the dispersion

the more I ikey union certification drives wil I be successful. Studies

of this type, however, provide little direct evidence on how wage

differentials influence firm performance.

      We turn next to research that addresses the impact that different

methods used f or determining pay increases have on performance. Much

of this work focuses on crAiçaring different methods (e.g. merit versus

across the board) rather than cnparing different caitlnatlons or mixes

of approaches in total cmpensation. For example, a recent survey by

the Conference Board reports that merit pay plans (performance

appraisal based) are in widespread use for exempt eiiployees.50 Perhaps

the most tefling result of the survey, which was based on responses

fr caipensation directors, is that there were no apparent differences

in the features of the merit plans between those who claimed their

plans were Ivery successful' and those claiming theirs to be a

Nfai lure.

      Typical of the research studies are those that ciipared employee

performance   in organizational   units with merit pay to those in which

pay   increments were based on COLAs and/or seniority. In studies

COLA/seniority plan), the employees were reported to be more productive
                                   26

In the merit based units.5'    In another study, the discontinuation of

an incentive plan among welders in a manufacturing firm resulted in a

temporary decrease in their productivity. And in a series of studies

of tree plantets, lumber jacks and fur trappers, incentive based plans

were found to be increased performance over previous levels or when

canpared to hourly straight time pay with seniority basea Increases.52

     Merit pay did not fare as well in studies in the pubLic sector.53

The most elaborate of these was the longitudinal analysis of the

effects of the Federal Ierat System in the Social Security

Anninistration, which we discussed briefly    ri section U. Unit level

performance data e.g. monthly series of types of claims processed and

time to process) were collected and while the results were not

unajitiguous ie to court challenges that delayed the implementation of

the merit plan and low merit budget funding, the authors concluded that

the merit pay plan did not have any discernable affect on unit

performance. Several reviews of merit pay plane in public education

a190 concluded that there is no systematic evidence that the

institution of merit pay plane for teachers lead to any improvements of

teaching and, more importantly, to improvements in student

performance .

     Unfortunately   both the private and public sector studies utilize

nonrigorous quasi—experimental designs and suffer fran methodological

and/or measurement problems (e.g. selection bias, uncontrolled

variables). This leads us to conclude that we know very little about

the effects of merit pay schemes on enployee performance and even less

about their effects on firms' financial well being.
                                            27

        It should be   understood,      however just how great a gap exists
between    theories   of   pay for performance and how       It actually gets
practiced.      Personnel researchers have long recognized this gap. Many

'merit   pay'   schemes    are   underfunded, fail to offer pay increases that

are meaningful to employees and fail to establish a clear relationship

between performance and pay increments. Further, only a relatively

uaIl share of most employees canpensatlon is contingent on

performance under these plans. So the poor Sowang               of   merit pay

schemes   should not cl,e as too much of a surprise.
       The gap between theory and practice appears to differ by

occupation. Sales incentive plans appear to be more consistent with

theory than the merit plans often used              for managers or professionals.
This   suggests   that     sales jobs   may offer   an attractive opportunity to

study    the effects of various pay for performance approaches.
       Another series of studies correlates earnings levels with previous

earnings, experience. performance ratings, ejcation and other

factors.55 Using data collected within firme,               they all reached similar
conclusions: that pay level is weakiy or not significantly correlated

with performance rating and is more strongly related to seniority and

education. For example, one study reported that earnings were more

attributable to experience than performance, but              it failed   to report if

the three firms, which provided           the data, used merit based pay.56 Other

studies reportea loi.        correlations   between performance ratings and

salary levels for managers In           four   private and three public

organizations.57
                                    28

     Correlations in these studies reveal very little about   the   nature

of pay—performance relationship. It is the increments in pay, not the

pay eve), that merit pay plans to use to affect performance. Not

unexpectedly then, the correlation between the changes in pay f or

managers and thetr performance rating in one study was very much higher

(.65) than the correlation between performance and pay level <.25)58

Obviously, none of these correlation studies sheds lit on the effects

merit pay may have on individual or firm performance, Hogever, in

spite of the failure to distinguish between pay level and changes In

pay, many still refer to the weak pay level—performance relationship as

proof that merit pay does not affect performance.59

     A few studies considered the effects of the all of different forms

of compensation or, employee performance. In one, merit pay and bonuses

(individual oriented pay increases), were found to be less effective

than profltsharing, stock o.rnership, and team based bonuses.60      Of

the latter three, team based bonus were reported to be nest   effective.
This study a'so suffers fri,   limitations similar to most pay—
performance studies; effectiveness was measured in terms of managers'

percept ions of turnover, ability to attract and the like rather than by

more objective measures. Further the authors recognize that the study

is based on a convenient sampie and that data imitations did not

permit them to control for different provisions in the incentive plans

such as size of awards, eligibility, timing etc.

    Two other studies contrast the earnings of workers paid by the

hout and those paia by a piece—rate scheme. The first found that among

18$ male punch—press operators in Chicago. workers paid by the piece
                                                    29

received approximately 7             percent more, even        after controlling for

differences      In schooling, experience, race, and union status.61 The

second, used Bureau of Labor Statistics data on the earnings of over
100000 employees in 500               finr     in   the footwear and men's and boys'
clothing inoustries and              found that      workers paid by the piece earned

approximately 14 percent more                  after controlling for differences in

sue (but not jJj) chara cteri stics of workers and firms.62

        It is   unfortunately         cliff   icult to interpret what these estimated
different'as mean. In part, they may reflect an intended incentive

effect; workers employed under piece rates may work                     harder, produce
more, and hence get             paid more.       In part, they may reflect a wage

In the    latter case.           firms offering piece—rate plans potentially benefit

not because      the plans induce any given worker to work harder but

rather because        hey serve to help attract higher quality workers.

Neither of these studies,              however, draw any conclusions abait the
effects of such plans on the current profitability or stock market

performance of            i   rms.

        A renewed a nterest In, and even popularity of, gainsharing and

other productivi ty sharing schemes                  is   evident in industrial

relations.63 WI dely perceived as an approach throu, which pay

increases can successfully affect group                     and unit performance,
                                        so

proponents claim the plans hold considerable promise and even

demonstrated success. The benefits ascribed to these plans include

better use of capital assets and the facilitation of employee—

management cooperation, caiinitment and trust.64

     Conceptually the notion is straightforward and appealing, as part

of an overall employee     relations philosophy, sharing the returns from

pro&ctivity gains will engender suggestions              for further     iniproveiitents,
and motivate added     performance.    Typically these       gains are shared in
the form of bonuses and are not tolled into         employees' base         pay. Hence

increases in cth,lpensatlon costs vary direct ly          with performance levels.
     Unfortunately,     much of the   literature    onproductivity sharing is
testimonial and   anecaotai.      The substantive    empirical evaluations of
gainsharing have c1ie in two waves. The fi          rst    came   frail the
Massachusetts institute     of Technology with      its historical connections
to proponents   such   as Scanlon and Lesieur, as well as Frost and his
colleagues at Michigan State and Scanlon         Plan Associates. Beyond
dissertations and      technical reports itt le of this work has been
published.65
     More recently the question of the eff ects            of gairisharing and

other programs was the focus of two surveys conducted               in   the early
19805.66   The New   York Stock    Exchange   survey revealed that
approximately 15% of all US companies with 500 or more enipl oyees had
sane form of productivity sharing plan         and that over      70% of    these
reported gainsharing lead to improving productivity. Based                  on the
                                     31

'ninn aata of this type, the NYSE         Office   of Econcaic Research

conclude 'On the basis of the evidence and the         theory Ceøçhasis   added),

it appears that gainsharing can play an inportant role in motivating

people to be mote productive.1

       The other survey, a GAO Report, concluded that the results of

pro&ctivlty sharing plans suggest that these plans offer a viable

method of enhancing productivity and at the firm level.' This

conclusion was based on information obtained from interviews with 36

firms. However of these, only 24 fIrms provided some financial data,

only 9 fInns indicated they made           formal assesnent of these plans

and only 4 of these could document their analyses. Nevertheless, the

oft quoted GAO results are that gainsharing i'Teroved performance by

17.3% at 13 firms with sales less than 100 million and in the II ftrms

with sales of 100 million or greater, the average inprovement was

16.4%. Na, seriously one S,ould take these results is obviously open

to question. Beyond these two surveys and some earlier evaluation

studies, case descriptions of applications dominate the llterature.6?

       Schuster's work C1984a, 1984b) is an exception. Be         reports
longitudinal case studies of the effects of gainsharing schemes, the

Scanlon plan, and the Rucker plan.        In the most thorou. study1

productivity   (measured as output per hour),,eloyment. voluntary
turnover, and suggestion rates by employees         were   collected on a monthly
basis over approximately seven years.       Based    on a time—series design,
the   results revealed an inmiediate upward shift in prottictivity and
suggestions upon irelementation of    a   Scanlon plan, followed by a

slitly positive trend thereafter. In other studies of four Scanlon

and two Rucker applications, similar flndln were reported.

    This 'plateau effect. an abrupt positive shift in performance

followed by a slii,t positive trend or steady performance      level, is
consistent   with observations in the earlier descriptive literature.

Schuster notes that other coincidental changes (e.g., capital

improvements, new     union or management leader,, etc.) may have affected
productivity to a greater degree than the gainsharing schemes did. He

attenpts to account for these possibilities throui rather exhaustive

interviews of the parties involved and analysis of capital expenditure

data during the study periods.

     A nuoter   of monographs on profi tsharing have been published by the

Profit Sharing Research Foundation.68 Most of them describe various
profitsharing applications and their       supporting philosophies. A few

cppare     the financia' performance of firii with profitoharing to TMnon—

profitsharers .       In one study by Howard and Dietz <1969), financial

performance measures used      include levsln and tren in operating
incne,     vanous rates of return, earnings per en,loyee, earnings per

share. aivadends per share, and market price per share. Nine

tndustries were selected using a four—digit SIC classification and data

were collected fran CONPUSTAT tapes for the 1948—66 period. The

analyses caupared the financial performance of profitsharers with non—

profttsharers. Profitsharers exhibited superior performance in 50

percent    of the   cases and inferior performance In about 24 percent.

Howard    and Dietz concluded that "the financia' performance of
                                    $$

profitsharing cawanies was clearly superior to non—profitsharers for

the nine industries as a group.'

       Limitations in COMPUSTAT data did not permit accounting for

systematic differences beyond profitsharing that could account for the

observed performance differences. Beyond such obvious ones as capital

expenditures, technological and product differences, a variety of

critical cclm,ensation and personnel factors need to be considered. A

few of the more obvious ones are differences in pay levels, employment

levels, other incentive schemes and whether profltsharing was

considered part of an eiiployees total cailpensatton (thus placing a

portion of it 9at risk" in a manner similar to gainsharing) or a

benefit (thus placing it along with pensions as an entitlement). Put

another way, simple clpartsons of mean outcalies tell us little about

the effects of profiteharing.

       Our overall conclusion in this section echoes the conclusion in

our am.nary of the executive caiensation literature. It Is well known

that the basic dimensions of employee cc.wensation strategies differ

widely across organizations. Yet there are few rigorous studies of

whether these differences make a difference. We do not know if a

farm's pay position relative to Its cetltors. the nuither of pay

grades It offers, pay differentials between these grades, or the

profile of employees In a firm's pay hierarchy make any difference

regarding employee behavior or the firm's economic performance.

       There is evidence that indivijal and group based incentive plans

do affect employee performance but even it is not unambiguous. We do

not   know whether changes in the mix of total compensation pay off.
                                      34

Does it pay to shift fran a base pay system that emphasizes

entitlements (emphasis on seniority, COLA's, across the board increases

and economic security) to a contingency based system with emphasis on

short and long term incentives such as gairisharing, team awards, and

stack ownership. Unaer what conditions (e.g. stage of product life

cycle, market share. etc.) might different criiipensatton policies pay

off and what are the performance implications of changing pay policies?

     Considering the resources devoted to employee compensation and its

management, we do not even know if the overall pay strategies adopted

make any difference. That is. we simply do not know whether managing

ciipensatson pays off.

        Perhaps one reason is that cnpensatlon strategies do not operate

in a vacuum. Compensation is only one part, albeit an important part.

of a firm's total human resources strategy. Some firms, for example.

may emphasize contingent cc.opensation while others may emphasize

employment security. Disentangling the effects of one part of an

overafl pattern is difficult. But perhaps a more plausible reason for

the dismal state of knowledge is that industrial relation, researchers

haven    t   attempted the research. It is to a suggested research agenda

that we no'J turn.


IV. Concluding ReØjt
        Our survey of   the literature on the relationship between the

cwensation policies a firm pursues and its economic performance leads

us InevitaDly to the conclusion that we know very little about this

relationship. Partially this is because compensation policies, by
                                         35

their nature, are very caiplex. Firms differ in terms of the level of

their wage offers relative to their caupetitors. the returns within an

occupation that accrue Sje to seniority, their wage structures across

and within occupations, the level and mix of fringes they offer, their

use of indivithal or group incentive pay policies, the proceãires by

which wage increases are granted, and the processes enployed to

aflulnister caipensation. Moreover, within a firm different policies

may be followed for hi level executives, other managerial employees,

professional employees, technical        employees, office workess, and blue
collar workers, and still further        distinctions made among salaried and
hourly,    or    unionized and nonunloni zed employees. Finally. caiensation

policies are often established at the individual establ istunent level

rather than at the firm level; we return          to   the inçlicatlons of this

point belo%J.

        Developing an understandIng oI why firms pursue different policies

for    various   occupations instead of a single consistent policy for all

enloyee groups is inçortant. On the one hand, It nay be that certain

strategically critical occupations            such as engineers in hi.

technology firms, or executives in most firms, have greater effects on

a firm's financial performance than do other occupations. Thus

variations in pay policies for tnt ical occupations are more likely to

affect    I ir'    economic   performance than policies directed at other
groups. On the other hand, execut lye           cpensatlon usually makes up a

very minor portion of total labor costs.           Consequently any pay schemes
that    shift portions of employeew labor        costs frau entitlements (e.g.
COLA'S OC   seniority    based) to cont ingency    based   (e.g.   gainsharing or
                                     36

lump 1m bonuses) seem likely to have noticeable effects on financial

performance.

       The vast majority of the studies we have surveyed have tended to

focus only on a single dimension of caipensatlon policy. However, a

firits econc.nic performance is undoubtedly affected by its cc.npensation

policy in tnto. Future research needs to examine a firm's     policy about
the various dimensions of cipensation policy simultaneously rather

than focusing on one policy to the exclusion of others. ipirically. a

firm's compensation strategy needs to be measured as a        of
interrelated dimensions. Developing a scheme to parmaterize such a

complex policy in terms of a manageable number of dimensions will not

be a sinple task.

       Of course, one mijit think that one could eliminate the need for

such   efforts by   studying ho., chans In one dimension of compensation

policy affect changes n     firm performance. The studies cited in
Section II on the relationship between the adoption of particular
provãsions in executive crensation agreements and performance, or

those cited in Section III on the relationship between the adoption of

merit pay and public sector productivity, fall Into this class.

Unfortunately, the inferences one can draw fran such studios depend

crucially on whether other aspects of couipensation/industrial relations

policy changes at the same time; unless other critical aspects are

accounted for, causal inferences .,iiI be distorted. In addition, they

depend crucially on one's ability to control for other forces besides

compensation policy that might be expected    to influence performance.
                                   3?

Since adoption of a particular provision may we' I be influenced by

other forces, this is also not always easy to do.

     An argument might be made that each pay policy dzmension may

affect a different outcme, thus diminishing the ailportance of

analyzing all dimensions sinwiltaneously. The pay level of a firm, for

example, may principally affect its ability to attract and retain a

stable work force and the price canpetitiveness of its products, while

a finns policy regarding the methods by which employees are

canpensated (e.g. team based incentives versus seniority) may directly

affect their productivity.   If such a separation of theoretical effects

exists, then the need to consider sintiltaneously the entire pay

strategy   diminishes. Ciim,n sense suggests ho,ever, that ewe
thresholds of all pay policies may have   to exist   for the separate pay
dimensions to have any effect. Thus, for example, merit     pay schemes

may have little effect on performance if the pay level is relatively


     The endogeneity of the adoption of particular provision, suggests

another thorny issue. Not only are changes over time in ocupensation

policy for a given firm likely to be nonrandcui. but so are differences

in ccupensation policies across firms at a point in time. There are

long literatures in both econn'cs and personnel that suggest the

situations in which different caipensation policies may prove optimal.

     For example, the efficiency wage literature in economics suggests

that situations in which turnover costs are high, or the costs of

monitoring worker productivity are high, are the ones in which above

market—clearing wages and/or earnings profiles that increase with
                                  38

seniority may arise. The compensation literature in personnel suggests

that business units that exhibit simi ar business strategies or operate

in the same stages of pronuct life cycles will adopt similar

compensation policies, and that these policies will differ from those

of firms in the same industry in different stages or with different

Dusiness strategies.69 Thus, variations in calipensation policies

across firms may reflect conscious decisions by firms each trying to

maximize its economic welfare.

     At first glance, we appear to be left with two options. On the

one hand, researchers can treat variations in cçensation policy

across farms as being randomly determined and ignore issues of possible

simultaneity. On the other hand, researchers can acknowledge that at

least sane of the observed variations in farms' caipensation policies

are purposeful and designed to effect a firms performance and then try

to empirically model the determinants and effects of these variations.

Given the latter, the effects of censation policy on firm

performance cart be estimated only in the context of a model that treats

these policies as being endogenously determined.

     Our own preferences are to go the latter route. A start has

already been made by some research. For example, economists have tried

to see if empirical explanations exist for why the prevalence and

strength of cost—of—living adjustment clauses vary across union

contracts, why the fringe benefit/wage ratio varies over time and

across areas, or why the probab, ity of observing mandatory retirement

provisions and above market clearing wages varies across individuals.70
                                  39

These types of studies have only begun   to   scratch the surface and much

more research is needed on the determinants of compensation strategies.

     We must stress, however, that pursuing this type of research will

not be easy for a number of reasons. On the one hand, it is not a

trivial matter to paraiitterize any particular caipensation policy. For

example, knowledge of the incentive/nonincentive pay dichotomy is

probably less useful than knowledge of the magnitudes of the incentives

that exist (i.e., the marginal return to the workers from altering

their behaviors). Similarly, how a plan is actually aministered may

De quite different frau what is recorded in written plan statements.

The mere process of collecting data on censation policies will

require considerable efforts.

     On the other hand, once such data Is collected researchers mist

still develop enpirical models to explain variations In censation

policies. Unless such models have a good deal of explanatory power,

attempts to treat caipensation policies as encs,genous are unlikely to

lead to statistically precise estimates of the effects of ccAlpensatlon

policies on firm performance, both because of the Imprecision of the

 instrunents' for caipensatlon policies that would result         the

Indirect relationship between canpensation policy and ultimate

financial performance.

     Indeed this problem is exacerbated by the fact that caipensation

policies are often set at the indivithal establts,rnt level and are

designed to effect establishment level variables such as absenteeisi,

the quality of new hires, turnover, and proo.ictiv,ty. Yet the
                                         40

financial   performance (stock market or accounting) measures available

are typically avaiiable only at the firm or corporate level.

        These difficulties suggest a third option. Researchers might

focus on the establisinent level to estimate the effects of

cc.,çensation   pal ides on the outcaies that they are designed to
d,rectly    intiuence, such as recruitment, absenteeisn, and turnover and
individual, group and business unit performance;       all in   the context of
models in which one attempts to control for the endogeneity of these

policies.    Assuming that censatlon policies are shown to influence

these   outcnes, establishment level data could then be used to estimate
the effects of these outcanes on total costs of production and thus on
underlying profitability. Related research on the effects of
industrial relations type policies on establishments' costs and

productivity in the autanobile and paper mill industries has recently

been undertaken and can serve as a starting point for these

endeavors.7 These related studies do ng. treat industrial relations

variables as    endogenous, however, and it Is important that attempts be
made to treat cnpensation policies as endogenous in future analyses.

        Indeed, it may be   that   financial and stock market measures simply

have too much "noise in many situations to be useful measures of the

direct effects of various crensation policies and practices. By

considering only the ultimate' performance measures and ignoring the

intermediate outccqnes of cajipensation systems, we run the risk of

concluding nothing" matters when in fact what matters depends on the

outcQiies and models selected. Research on the effects of caupensation
                                  41

policies on tic-rn performance thus needs to focus on th firm—level

performance measures and more intermediate level measures.

(1985). Benson also studied the incane of executives in 29

conglanerates during the 1970—75 period and found that the annual gains

(or losses) they incurred due          to    changes   in   the value of their stock

the abnormal       stock   market returns experienced by "bidder firms" in

mergers fran       the 'bid" to the approval1 date. They found these
returns positively related to the percentage of the bldder                  firms"
stock owned by senior management. Thus, executives' ownership of their
firms'    securities       helped to align    the interests of stockholders and
managers, at least in this case. The latter found that corporate

performance (in terms of both accounting profits and stock market

performance)       was highest when management owns between 5 and 20 percent
of the corporation's stock. They hypothesize that when nai er amounts

are ownea, managers have less incentive to pursue a profit maximizing

strategy.   i*j le when       larger amounts are owned,       managers may feel more
secure and not work as hard.
