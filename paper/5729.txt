                           UNRAVELING        IN ASSIGNMENT        MARKETS



                                              ABSTRACT



        We present a two-period model of the assignment market with uncertainty in the first period

regarding productive characteristics    of participants.   This model is used to understand incentives

toward early contracts or unraveling in labor markets for entry-level professionals.      We study two

contractual situations, one where firms are bound by ex post unsuccessful early contracts, and the

other where they can buy out of unsuccessful early contracts.      The economic benefit of unraveling

is to provide insurance in the absence of complete markets, but it can come at the cost of inefficient

assignments.    Without reentry, unraveling need not occur. It is more likely, the smaller the applicant

pool or the proportion     of more promising applicants in the pool, and the greater the degree of

heterogeneity in the pool. A ban on early contracts always hurts firms and benefits less promising

applicants,    but the welfare effects on more promising applicants depends on how the gains from

early contracts    are shared.   With buyouts, inefficiencies     in assignments   are eliminated,   and

unraveling always occurs between firms and the more promising applicants.          The efficiency gains

of buyouts can be distributed unevenly and sometimes firms benefit from a ban on buyouts.

                                                 1. Introduction



The timing of transactions              is important     in markets where buyers and sellers need to be

matched      to each other.         There are many examples.            Elite colleges have both re~lar           and

early admission         programs.      Most graduate and mdergraduate                admission   procedures      agree

not to inform applicants             prior to a common          date.   Yew entrants into many professional

spores competitions         choose when to expose themselves to the draft.                   Much attention lately

h=   been focused on the trend toward recruiting                    younger and less experienced          players in

recent National Basketball             Association   drafts. This year the NBA draft set a record in that

the first 7 picks and 17 song               29 fist-round      selections    were not college seniors.     Relative

to previous years, it is mtonishing            that the 13th-ranked,          l?-year    old Kobe Bryat     skipped

college altogether.        In spite of the posturing           by NBA executives         urging players to stay in

school ad      finish their education,        this year’s outcome           is likely to signal a long term trend

toward earlier entrance into the NBA.

     Difficulties      in controlling     the timing of recruiting new entrants of highly trtined pro-

fessionals    have been pointed          out in a set of interesting          papers by Roth      [1984,1991],    and

Mongell      and Roth [1991].          Roth and Xing [1994] observe that these difficulties               appem in

many other markets,           including      the medied         weekly markets          for ordinmy   commodi~ies.

medical interns md residents, and postseason                    college football    bowl games.

     Two related aspects of timing of market transactions                       must be distinguished.        In one,

labeled     “jumping      the gtm” by Roth and Xing, participants                  compete    for a limited supply

of the best-qualified       candidates      or best positions      in timing their bids ~d       accept mces.     For

inst mce,    tis       sometimes     make exploding         offers which expire within a very short time,

and job candidates         often try to delay making a choice from atilable                   offers in the hope of

receiving better ones. The second aspect of timing is uraveling                          of the appointment      date.

In entry-level       professional      labor markets,     employment         begins only after graduation         and

attainment         of professional     qurdificacions,    but the appointment            date sometimes    unravels

to a few years before          that.     Umaveling       of the appointment         date may take the form of

signing employment           contracts     long before employment             is to begin,    N in the placement

of medical     interns and residents          before     1947, or it may be in the form of summer job

progrruns of law students           prior to offers of longer term positions             upon graduation         w is

happening        in law fires    today.    Since in many situations          there are natural dates when the

potential   of candidates        cm be ~sessed       and appointments          can be made, unraveling of the

appointment        date is not so much about competing                through the timing of proposing            ~d

accepting offers, u about the inefficiencies of early contracts due to incomplete                      information

of d    participants     concerning       the productive     characteristics     of the candidates.

       These two aspects of maket             timing problems       me clearly related.     Sometimes jumping

the gun can be the principal resson for unraveling of the appointment                       date. Still, isolating

the unraveling =pect          from the jumping-the-gun            =pect   helps us understand        what features

of the market imperfections               are responsible    for the timing problems.           It also enables       a

more accurate       msessment       of the social cost and benefit of early contracting,              m well u the

welfme effects on different groups of participants.

       We analyze the determinmts             of market unraveling in what follows.           The model is built

upon incomplete        information        about agents’ futwe      productive     characteristics.     This creates

both individual       uncertainty     about one’s trtits as well as aggregate            uncertainty     about    the

maket     value of those trtits.      Aggregate     uncertainty      tises     in these mwket    because of indi-

visible (pair-wise)     assignments.        If all appointments      are made after individual         uncertainty

is resolved,     efficiency   of assignments      is guaranteed.      but all agents are exposed          to payoff

risks that they can be on the long or short side of the market.                       Complete       .Arrow-Debreu

securities m~kets       would eliminate payoff risks to agents. -                we~ as guaratee       efficient job

usignments.        However, in the absence of such markets, unraveling or early contracting                      can

bring about limited insurance              gains at the expense of inefficient assignments.             Unraveling

is a mtifestation       of risk aversion under incomplete            insurance markets which relieve some

of the anxiety about the availability            of job positions     and qualified applications,

       We analyze markets where individurd uncertainty                    applies only to job applicants,        noc

to 6rms, and consider           two contractual     situations,     one where 6rrns are bound           by ex post

unsuccessful      early cent racts, and snot her where buyouts by firms are allowed.

       Without     buyouts,     unraveling need not occur.         It is more likely the smaller the propor-

tion of more promising cadidates              in the applicant pool ad          the smaller the total applicant

pool relative to the number of positions.              The absence of individual          uncertainty     for firms


                                                       -2-
implies that payoff risks to &                  are the main source of insurance              gains from early con-

tracts.    These gains are large when the applicant pool or proportion                      of promising applicants

are small, because firms are less likely to fll their positions                      in the spot market.      The de-

gree of heterogeneity         in the applicant     pool cm have ambiguous                effects on the likelihood of

unraveling,      because it tiects      both the average quality of the applicmt                 pool = well M the

size of insurance gains. A ‘{compensated”                 increase in the degree of heterogeneity            increwes

the likelihood      of unraveling for the more promising                applicants.       In this model, unra~-cling

always reduces the probability              that productive        applicants     will   be short and firms will be

long in the spot market.            Therefore    a ban on early contracts            always decre~es      the ex ante

welfue      of fires.     The welfare effects on applicants            depends on how the gains from early

contracting      are shared.       Since less promising         applicants    never receive my rents from early

contracts,     the ban un=biguously             improves        their welfare.    Whether      the ban increases or

decre-s       the welfare of more promising              applicants     depends on the size of che gains they

receive,

        When buyouts of ex post           unsuccessful     early contracts       are allowed, unraveling of firms

and more promising           applicants     always occurs.          Some less promising        applicants    also sign

early contracts         if the number of more promising             applicants     is smaller than the number of

positiom.      Buyouts     are Pareto optimal       for all market participants            m a whole because they

eliminate inefficient assignments             and incre=e        total gains from trade.       Buyouts      unambigu-

ously increase the welfare of less promising               candidates.       In many situations      they benefit all

parties, but ex~ples          ca     be constructed      where buyouts benefit applicants            at the expense

of h.        Sometimes       prohibitions     on buyouts may be in the interests of firms.

signment model ad            use a simple example to define individual and aggregate uncertainties

that are central to analysis of ursraveling. We also identify the market imperfections                            that

cause unraveling.         Section 3 malyzes       how unraveling occurs             as a competitive     equilibrium

without buyouts,          and section 4 considers comparative                statics issues reg~dlng     the relative

discussion     on how to extend         the model to more general setups.                 Proofs of pure technical

                             2. The Assignment                    Market:     Background



There me two models of mukets                    where matching          considerations       are crucial:     the s.ssign-

ment market of Koopmans             and Beckmm                [1953] md Shapley and Shubik [1972], and the

marriage mmket of Gale and Shapley [1962]. These two markets differ from most others

in that the objects       of trade rue indivisible.               Each participant    h=     ody   one unit to buy or

sell. L The difference between             the two mmkets is that in the assignment                     msrket     money

is transferable     mong     all participants,           while in the m=iage           market only rank orderings

of preferences     matter.    2 Since we emphasize                   the role of mmket        and mmket         prices, we

choose the assignment         mmket        =    the hamework.            In this section      we review the setup of

the assignment      market, illustrate         the role of uncertainty,          and present a simple example of

how unraveling ca          occur when markets are incomplete.



                 2.1.   Competitive            equilibrium           in the assignment          market


Formally,      the assignment      market       can be described            as follows.     There are two groups of

agents, ,W and W.          There is a production             function       for each pair of agents such that the

joint output of m assignment of an A4 agent and a W agent is non-negative,                                   and the joint

output of assigning either two M agents or two W agents to each other is zero. The output

of an unassigned        agent is normalized            to zero, The largest total output of any number of

agents is the maximal         su    of outputs           that can be produced         by pair-wise     msignments       of

these agents.

      A pair-wise assignment        is feasible if each agent is matched to at most one other agent.

Associated     with a femible =signment                is a feasible outcome,     a vector of non-negative         payoffs

to the agents such that the sum of the payoffs for each matched pair is no greater than the

joint output     of the pair and the payoff for each unmatched                       agent is zero.    An assignment

is efficient if song       all feasible assignments               it yields the Imgest sum of joint outputs,            or

equitiently,      the Imgest sum of payoffs.                A feasible outcome            is stable if the sum of the

    ‘ More generally, the matching    or ~ignment            can be one-to-many,     in which c=     buyers have a fixed.
integer-valued demand.

  2   For a discu=ion    of the modeling       issue    in the two markets, see Crawford [1991]



                                                            -4-
payoffs to each pair of agents is greater than or equal to the joint output they can produce.

Thus,      in a stable outcome,         the sum of payoffs equals the joint output              for each matched

pair.    For each unmatched          ptir, the sum of payoffs for the two agents is greater than the

joint output      they cm produce,          so that the pair does not form a “blocking”             coalition      cha~

improves      the payoffs for both of them.

        The main resdt         in the theory of wsignment           m~kets      is that if a feasible outcome         is

stable then the msociated            =signcnent       is efficient, and if a fe=ible       assigment        is efficient

then there exists a feasible outcome            associated       with it that is stable.    This is analogous         to

the fist    and second welfae        theorem in a decentralized         economy.     Koopmans      and Beckmm

[1953] formulate the efficient assignment m a solution to a linear programming                         problem and

give a competitive           market equilibrium       interpretation    to the associated      outcome.       Shapley

and Shubik [1972] formulate             stable outcomes        as equilibria of a cooperative      game and show

that side-payments.           do not occu     in equilibrium.        In this paper,    we refer to each stable

outcome      ss a competitive       equilibrium.



                                               2.2.    Payoff risks


The custom~            level of abstraction    of the =signment         theory conceals its connections           with

more familiar         market malysis.       The parallels are best revealed by analyzing                a situation

where there are two distinct types of identical agents in each group. Let JM1md .Yfz denote

the two types of .M agents of sizes ml and mz.                     Similarly, WI and W2 are the two types

of W agents of sizes WI ad               W2. .4ssume that Ivfl agents ue more productive                     than IM2

agents, md similarly for the two types in W.                   To simplify further, =sume        that msignment

of an JM, agent to a WI agent produces                  unit output      and all other kinds of assignments

produce     notbng.      3

        It is useti     to think of one group of agents u               residual income       recipients,     say W,

to put the msignment             market in a competitive           framework.      In this example      W2 agents

are not productive           and c=ot       bid positive       prices for either type of M         agents.       They

any type of W agents and receive zero payoff.                     Only .bf, and WI agents potentially          have

positive payoffs. Their actual payoffs in a competitive                     market depend on ml and WI. For

exmple,        if ml = UJl, it is possible        to match each .Yll agent \vith a W, agent,              The unit

output    produced     by such a match must be divided between the two agents.                       Any division

that gives productive       agents in each group the same non-negative                   payoff is a competitive

equilibrium      when ml     = WI. Suppose,            however,     that ml     > WI.    Now the supply of ~Wl

agents exceeds       demmd        md    their payoff is driven down to zero.              W, agents get all the

return because they me the scace             factor.     If ml < WI then JMI agents rue the scarce factor

and receive 1 in the competitive           equilibrium.

      The discontinuities        in equilibrium    prices or payoffs with respect to supply and demand

are inherent in the indivisibility         of sssigmnents         (paimise     here) and in the discreteness     in

the types. Indivisibility        implies that payoffs are sensitive only to the sign of excess demand

or supply, not to its magnitude.            Whether       ml     exceeds W1 by a few or by many does not

change the equilibrium       payoffs of zero for :Ml agents and 1 for W1 agents. The discontinuity

does not disappear       = the size of the market gets large.

     The discontinuity       is more sensitive to the discreteness of types. For example,                  suppose

the joint output      between      less and more productive            agents of each group is v E (O, 1/2),

instead of O. Then the consequences               of being on the long or short side of the market rue

less severe.     If ml > WI but ml         < W1 + UJZ so that d             .}11 agents me matched       to the two

types of W       agents, their equilibrium         payoff is u instead of zero because           they add tiue

u to ~signments        with W2 agents.        W,     agents receive 1 – v instead of 1. In the limit of

a continuum       of types, the discontinuity          disappears.     In our simple model of two types of

each group, the uncertainty            about the relative size of the two productive            types translates

into payoff risks before they enter the m~ket.                   Avoiding    this kind of payoff risks is a main

motintion       for individual    agents to contract           early and “mavel”        the mmket.   4


    4 Roth and Xing [1994] identify two other ca~      of unraveling in a tw~period model of the ~signment
market. One is instability: [f the assignment in the -end    period is unstable, then there may be incentives
for agents to resch agreemenh early. However, this cannot happen in a competitive         -ignment    market,
They identify market competition M another cawe of unravelingand give an example where desplce the

                                      2.3.    An example          of unraveling


The essential =pects         of mruket unraveling are illustrated            by a two period model in which

there is both      individual      uncertainty     and aggregate        uncertainty.     Individual    uncertainty

is incomplete     information       in the fist    period by all agents of how productive              a particulw

agent will be in the wcond period.              Individual mcertainty       creates rmdornness        in supplies of

different types of agents, and resdts             in aggregate uncertainty         in the form of discontinuous

equilibrium     payoffs.     Both types of uncertainty              are necessary    to capt~e      the essence of

unraveling.     L-ruaveling (fist       period contracting)         eliminates    aggregate     mcertainty     but at

the costs of inefficient assignments when there is individual                    uncertainty.    Contracting     after

individual uncertainty        is resolved ensures efficient assignments,            but exposes agents to payoff

risks due to aggregate mcertainty.

     These points can be illustrated by extending                   the above example.        In the second period

there are productive        and unproductive         agents in JW and W u above.                In the first period

the productivities       of the agents within each group .M and W are unknown.                        Instead, each

agent has probability        A of becoming        productive       in the second period.      We use superscripts

for period and subscripts          for t~e.      For example,       JW: denotes the productive        -M agents in

the second period,         with size rn~. All agents are risk-averse with utility function                     u. For

simplicity,    we assume that there are equal numbers of :M and W agents.

     The second period            competitive     equilibrium       gives productive    agents a payoff of 1 or

O depending      on excess dem=d             or supply.    It is indetetinate       if there ue equal numbers

of productive     agents.     We assume that when my = w;, the equilibria                        payoff to all JM;

agents is O or 1 tith probability            1/2. This assumption       is non-consequential      for what follows,

When n is sficiently          l~ge,    the probability          that mz~ —
                                                                         – ~~ in the second period becomes

arbitrarily    small.    Since we are interested           in ~signment      markets with lage         numbers of

psuticipmts,     the event m; = w; is irrelevat.

     The uncertainty        of second period payoffs may motiwte                  agents to contract     with each

other in the bst        period,   before their productivity          is known.    Imagine the following grune.

In the first period, there are random pair-wise meetings between M’                      agents and W1 agents,

Each pair of agents chooses whether to sign a contract in which the ~W’ agent receives payoff

r and the W1 agent receives 1 –r in the second period if both turn out to be productive,                          and


                                                          -7-
O otherwise.      The second period market is said to unravel if there exists some r 6 [0, 1] such

that some pairs of agents choose to sign the first period contract                       rather than to Ivait. From

the social point of view, the contracts             create assignment inefficiencies             because information

necessary to achieve efficient ~signments                  is atilable       only in the second period.         From the

individud       point of view, signing the fist            period contract        eliminates     payoff risks that the

two agents may be on the long or short side of the market,                              should   they be produc~ive,

but it also incre~es      payoff risks due to individual uncertainty,                   because the payoff horn the

contract    depends on the joint probability               that both ae productive,

     When A is sticiently            large the insurmce            gains from contracting          early and eliminat-

ing aggregate      uncertainty      outweigh       the additional        individual     mcertainty       it creates,    The

mmket      unravels.    The argument            runs as follows.            In the second      period,    the payoffs     to

productive      agents are 1 or O depending            on excess demand.              The expected        utility to each

agent from waiting is A[u(l)/2           + u(0)/2]     + (1 — J)u(0).          If two agents sign the” fist        period

contract    the expected        utility to the Ml      agent is Azu(r) + (1 – A2)u(0)                and the expected

utility to the WI agent is A2U(1 – r) + (1 – ~2)u(0).                         Let rm be the minimum            payoff re-

quired for !Ml agents to sign the contract                 and rw be the maximum               payoff that IV1 agents

~e   willing    to pay JM1 agents to sign the contract.                      Equating    the expressions        abo~~e we

have that the ask price rm and the bid price r“                        are implicitly     defied     by the condition

u(rm)   = u(1 — rw) = u(0) + [u(l)               — up]/.               If A is lmge enough         then the ~k         price

rm falls below the bid price rw and unraveling occurs.                          There is not enough structure             in

this example to determine          the mmket equilibrium              price r uniquely, but it must be between

the bid and ~k.        When      A is sficiently      small, r“        < rm and the mmket            does not unravel:

The value of insurace            born   a tit      period        contract    is small because       the probability       of

exposure to aggregate uncertainty               in the second period is smd.             The additional        individual

mcertainty       dominates      the insurance gains.



                         2.4.     Unraveling        and market              incompleteness


Complete       snalysis of richer ~signment          problems is presented the following sections,                 Before

we go on, it is important         to understand       that the existence and inefficiency of uraveling                    is


                                                           -8-
caused by market incompleteness.             In the above example,         the optimal     insurance     arrange-

ment is for all agents to sign a fist        period contract in which they all receive the same share

of maximum     total joint output        after waiting till the second period to achieve efficient as-

signments.   An Arrow- Debreu securities market together with a second period spot market

is the decentrtized       mechmism       that achieves this.

     Imagine that in the 6.rst period each agent sells 100 perfectly                   divisible    shaes    of the

claim to the agent’s       payoff from the second           period spot market.        For example,         holding

50 shares of one claim entitles           the buyer to 1/2 of the seller’s equilibria                payoff from

the spot mmket.         A competitive       equilibrium      in the securities   market is the set of share

prices that equates       the supply and demand             for shines of all claims.     Given these prices,

each agent purchases the numbers of shares that m=imize                    expected     utility subject      to the

budget   constraint,     and the market clems for shares of each claim.                   Since all agents are

indistinguishable      in the fist    period the competitive       equilibrium    has equal share prices for

all claims and each agent holds an equal number of shares of each claim, including                              the

agent’s O-    claim.      This equi~bri~        is optim~       ex POSC!beca~e      the second period          spot
market produces        the efficient ~signment       with mtimal       total output.      It is also optimal     ex

ante, because each agent spreads risks as much w possible.

     If markets were complete           and agents codd        legally sell claims to their future payoffs,

the empirical phenomena         ~sociated     with unraveling would not exist. Unraveling and emly,

inefficient contracting     is a manifestation       of market failure. Unraveling is never said to be

observed in mmkets where futures contracts             rue common, such as agricultural            commodities.

Rather, it is restricted     to those labor markets where indivisible assignments                  are importmt

and where complete         markets      of the kind described        above are legally      prohibited       as too

restrictive on permns for other reasons.         In what follows we take it for granted that complete

markets do not exist, so that unraveling may occur.



                                     3. Unraveling     without      Reentry



In this section,    we consider        a richer version      of the example      above.     There     agents are

indistinguishable      in the first period and unraveling          affects all market participants           in the


                                                      -9-
sme    way.      Here we allow for two kinds of heterogeneity               among participants.           First, the

two groups of participants         in the ~signment         market are not symmetric            in terms of their

individual uncertainty.        In labor market for entry-level professionals,           individual uncertainty

about future productivity         is a substantial     issue only for the potential           candidates.     Firms

have operated in the m~ket          for a long time and have established          reputations.      Second, there

is heterogeneity     within each group of agents.           Some are more likely to become productive

later than others      in the same group.          Unraveling        in this situation      can affect different

types of agents in one group differently.           The simplest model that captures                these kinds of

heterogeneity      in ~sigment       markets is described        next, ud       the competitive       equilibrium

in the fust period      mmket      is characterized.        Ln this section     we msurne that agents who

sign fist     period contracts    do not enter the spot market in the second period.                  The case of

unraveling with buyouts          and reentry is considered       in the next section.



                                            3.1.     The     model


.ks before, in the second period there ae two types of agents in each group, productive                         and

unproductive,      denoted     ss .W? and JM; , and W;         and Wf.      The joint product        is 1 between

JM: md      W;    agents and O othenvise.        Now, there are two different types of agents in each

group in the first period,       type 1 and type 2, who face different individual               uncertainty.    For

each i = 1, 2. .M} agents, of size mi,1 have probability                  J i of becoming      productive    in the

second period,      md probability     1 – J, of becoming        unproductive.        We assume that Al > A2

so that JM; agents ue the more promising job cadidates.                      To capture       the idea that fires

face little uncertainty       about their own types, we assume that W/                 agents, of size w!, have

probability      1 of becoming     productive,     and that type 2 W           agents have probability         1 of

becoming      unproductive.      Both types of JM agents have the same concave utility function u

over payoffs, and both types of W agents have the sme                      utility function    v.

      We look for an equilibrium         where both the terms of fist              period     contracts     and the

number of each type of agents who sign them rue endogenous.                        For agents who choose to

wait, the equilibrium        in the second period spot mmket is described                = before:     Productive

agents receive a payoff of 1 if they are on the short side of the market and all other agents

receive zero.      Since there is no reentry, the fist           period    contract    between      an kf,~ agent


                                                     -1o-
(i = 1,2) and a type 1 W agent takes the following form:                     .Any .Jf} agent who turns out

to be productive         receives r, and the W;        agent receives 1 – ri; otherwise both receive zero,

We refer to ri s-s the price of the first period contract              with :M~ agents.

         Since type 2 W agents are known to be unproductive,                 first period contracts      are only

between the two types of ,M agents ad                  type 1 W agents. Again, we proceed by defining

bid and ask prices for the M agents.                 There are two complications:         Different    types may

have different bid and =k prices, and these prices depend on the number yi of .W; agents

who sign fist      period contracts.      Ask and bid prices depend on yl and Y2 because aggregate

uncertainty,      the discontinuous       payoffs in the second period         spot muket         condition     on

excess demand         and supply,     depends       on yl and yz.      For any yl and yz, let T(YI, yl ) be

the probability       of the event ml      s w;.      That is, r(yl,    V2) is the probability      that ex post

productive      M agents receive 1 in the second period spot market.                 5

         It represents   the aggregate     uncertainty.       To shorten notation,       \ve w-rite m instead of

T(YI, YZ) whenever the meaning is clear.


                                          3.2.     Bid and ask prices


For each m E [0. 1], in order for M;              agents to be indifferent between signing a first period

contract      at price ri and waiting until the second period spot market, we must have


                  (1 - Ai)U(0)+     AIU(rl) = (1 -       At)U(0) + A1[~U(l) +(1 - T) U(O)].

This simplifies to

                                         TU(l) + (1 – T)U(O) = U(rl),


Therefore,      the ask price of M:      agents is the sme        as the ask price of .M; agents,      Let rm(r)

denote the common           uk price as a function        of ~.

         Ln order for W}    agents to be in~erent             between signing a fist     period    contract   with

M;       agents at price rl and wtiting          for the second period spot mmket,         we must have


                           (1 - ~)V(l)    +iTU(0) = (1 - Ai)U(0) +Aiv(l          -ri).

     5    For simplicity, indeterminacy of the spot market equilibrium is resolved by our ~umption            that
when m? = w;, tbe equilibrium       is the same M when ml < w;.

JI > Jz, r~(~) 2 r;(z)                for all m, and the equality holds if and ody                      if r = 1.

        Taking derivatives            with respect to r,

                             _drm(r)     = u(1) – .(0)             dr~(r)      _      v(l)    – u(o)
                                 dn           u’(rm(rr))      ‘       d~             A,u’(1–ry(m))”

Thus,     the wk price TM(T) is incre~ing                    and convex,           and the bid prices r:(z)            and r;(r)

are increasing       md concave.           It is straightforward            to check that r“’(0)          = O, r~(l    – A,) = O,

and rm(l)        = r:(l)     =    1 for i = 1,2,
        In Figure     1, r m intersects         r:    at iTl c       (O, 1) and it intersects             r;   at %2 G (r, , I),

rm(n)     > r~(ir)         > r;(m)      for ~ c [O,TI), r~(n)               > rm(rr) > r~(~)            for r E (ml, rz),      and

rf(~)     > r;(~)      > rm(~)         for ~ G (T21 1).       Therefore,           above Z2 insmance           gains exist from
fist    period    contracts       with W;      agents for both         type 1 and type 2 IV agents,                   Between rl

and ~z insurance gains exist for type 1 <M agents but not for type 2 JM agents.                                           Below Z,

the ~k      price exceeds both bid prices so there is no gain from insurance.                                    That insurance

gains exist ordy when r is high is due to the absence of individual                                       uncertainty      for W}

agents, When r is very low, the ssk price of both types of .M agents is close to zero, buc

because     of theindividual            uncertainty        of the M agents, the bidpnce                   for each type of :M

agent is negative:           W;       agents prefer wtiting          for the spot market               to signing first period

contracts     with either type of JM agents at my price.                             An interpretation         of this result is

that payoff risks to firms are the main source of insurance gains in our model,

        Twoother      cofigurations         of bidand~k            functions arepossible.              Itcan   happen that the

price for ,M~ agents for all r <1.                Then JM; agents never participate                      in unraveling.     It can

also happen that the three curves intersect orslyat                           r=l.      Here the~kpnce              function   lies

above both bid price functions                for any ~ < 1 md there is no possible gain from insurance,

function    for .}f~ agents to shift up, and insurance gains ue more likely to exist.                          In what

follows, we incorporate         all cases by considering           the c~e     shown in Figure        1, with Yz and

rl set to 1 if they do not exist,



                   3.3.    Ordering          property     and      monotonicity         property


To define the mruket equilibrium,               it is useful to think of the first period              market as an

assignment     market.     If sn A4,1 agent si~            a first period contract         with a W/     agent. they

are said to be resigned to each other.              If m agent chooses to wait until the second period

mmket,     the agent is said to be rm~signed.                   In a “pure”     msigmnent      problem     the payoff

from not being unassigned             is exogenous.        Here it depends         on yl =d         yz because    these

numbers affect the aggregate uncertainty                 in the wcond period spot market.              But these are

endogenous     variables, determined           by the fist      period market equilibrium.

     Unraveling is identified with signing a tirst period contract.                      Different kinds of unrav-

eling ue possible because there can be many comer so[utions in this problem.                              LTnraveling

of ~M,l agents occurs       if the bid price exceeds            the ask price at some y, > 0. The mmket

equilibrium    price rl lies between the bid and ask. Unraveling of .M~ agents is complete                             if

all :M: agents sign a first period contract,               so that ~i = m:,            Unraveling    is incomplete     if

y, < m;.    In this cme all M; agents must be indifferent between signing and waiting for the

second period spot mmket.            For unraveling of W;           agents to occur, the bid price for at least

one type of .M agents must exceed the mk price at the corresponding                           VI and yz such that

VI + Y2 > IJ. ~g~nt       the   eq~fibri~        price   ri must    fall in between.      If Y1 + YZ = w;,     there   is

complete    unraveling for W/         agents. In this case, if both y, and yz are positive,               W}     agents

must be indifferent       between      signing 6rst period contracts             with .M{ agents and with ~M~

agents.    H yl + yz < w; there is incomplete               unraveling for W;          agents, and vi > 0 implies

that W/     agents are indifferent          between signing fit           period contracts    with iM# agents and

waiting for the second period spot market.

     Two properties       of the model greatly simplify              the chmacterization        of market equil.ib-

riurn. First, unraveling is ordered:            Unraveling       of Jf/     agents precedes    that of ;lf~ agents.

This ordering     property      limits      the number of comer            solutions    that must be considered,


                                                         -13-
Second, the probability          ~(gl, YZ) is monotonically             decreasing in its arguments.       This mono-

tonicity     property    simplifies   the calcdation            of equilibrium,       given the initial conditions   of

the problem,

        The greater probability        of becoming           productive         for type 1 .Vf agents than for type 2

M agents implies that the bid price for ,Ml agents is greater than the bid price for .Lf~

agents for sny iT < 1. Since the ask price for the two types is the same, any unraveling of

i~j   agents implies complete         unraveling of JM/ agents. This result can be proven as follows,

Assuming unraveling for M; agents, we have rm (r) < rz. If there is incomplete                             unraveling

for .M/ agents, we have rm(r)              = rl.     It follows that rl s rz. Since Al > AZ,


                        (1 -   A,)v(0) +    AIU(l     -r,    ) > (1 - A,)u(0)        +A~u(l–r,).

Thus, W;       agents strictly prefer a first period contract with M;                     agents at price rl to a fist

period contract         with JM~ agents at price rz, which is a contradiction                    because   W} agents

must be indifferent between contracting                     with i~f    and .Vl; agents if yl, yz > 0.

      We now establish          the monotorsicity           property    of r(yl, YZ). By definition,       Z(YI, YZ) is

given by




             “Y-”i[ici:-yl~f(’
                , =0     j=O
                              [Scz-y,’:(’
                         -’1)’-’]
                                k=O
                                   -’z]’-’-’]                             k=O
                                                                                                            1



where C: = j !/(i!(j       – i)!) is the binomial coefficient.             Since yZ > 0 implies yl = m; we only

need to know how rr(yl, O) changes with yl for yl s m: and how iT(m~, yZ) changes with

Y2. The absence of individual              uncertainty         for W;     agents implies     that Z(Y1, 0) decreases

with yl for S.Uyl ~ m; ~d              r(m~, yz) decremes              with yz. In other words, the probability

of excess demand for productive               JM agents in the second period spot market decreases as

more agents sign &t            period contracts.

      The reason cm be understood                   m follows.      If an additional     pair of M:   and W;    agents

signs a first period contract,        the number of Wf              agents remaining in the second period spot

market falls by one. Individual uncertainty for .W} agents means that the expected number

of M:      agents participating       in the second period mmket falls by less than one. Therefore

the probability        that productive      .M agents will be short in the second period spot market


                                                             -14-
decreases       with yl.     More precisely,     consider     ~(yl – 1, O) and n(y] , O) for anY        YI    <   ml.

A similar mgument            shows that r(m~, yZ) decreases with yZ.



                                            3.4. Market equilibria

Different kinds of equilibria         me possible,     depending        on the relative number of each type.

.Issume for now that m; < w; < m; ‘+ m;.                 r(m~, O) is the probability         that productive       .M

agents will be on the short side of the second period spot market given that all ,M/ agents

sign first period contracts          and no M;      agents sign them.         The ordering     property      implies

that the relation        between    this probability    and ml and 72 in Figure 1 is critical,               because

there is no unraveling for M;             agents unless uraveling         for M}    is complete.   Depending       on

the location       of n(m{, O) relative to T1 and mz, there ue three possible               kinds of unraveling

equilibria.

(i) Complete        unraveling     of the more promising        type.     Suppose    mz > n(m~, O) > nl.          See

Figure 1. By the ordering            property,   unraveling of JV1~agents only occurs              after complete

unraveling for JVf~agents, at r(m~, O). But there is no gain from insur~ce                         for M:     agents

at or below        that point    because    z(m~, O) < 72, ad            by the monotonicity       property,      any

maveling         of ~M~ agents causes m to decrease further. Thus there is no unraveling for .Vf;

agents.       Since T(O, O) > T(m; , O) > TI, unraveling for .Vf{ agents continues                   until all .V’j


                                                       -15-
     agents sign first period contracts             with W}     agents,      The equilibrium        T is iT(m~, O) > rl.

     There is incomplete         unraveling       for W;     agents, who are indifferent          between signing first

     period     contracts    with M:      agents and waiting for the second                period    spot market,     The

     equilibrium     price of the fist      period contract         is rl = r~(r(m],      O)), on the bid function     for

     JM~ agents.     They receive a.Uthe rent born fist               period contracts.

     (ii) Incomplete        or no unraveling of the promising             type.   Suppose      n(m~, O) < ~1. Again,

     since irl < mz, the ordering          property     md     the monotonicity        property     imply that there is

     no uravehg         for JM~ agents.         If n(O, O) < Tl there is no unraveling for ,ti/           agents either.

     All agents wait for the second period spot market because there is no gtin from insurance

     at or below r(O. O) and unraveling              always reduces r.         If T(O, O) > T1 there is incomplete

     unraveling for type 1 iv agents. Unraveling continues until the equilibrium                       m is driven down

     to ?r,     6 There is also incomplete           unraveling for W/         agents.     Both W}      md    M:    agents

     are indifferent    between signing first period contracts               with each other md waiting for the

     second period spot mmket.             The price of first period contracts             is rl = rm(~l ) = r~(nl )

     and all insur=ce        gains are exhausted.

     (iii) Unraveling       of both    types.     Suppose    T(m; , O) > irz. Here there ~e             insurance    gains

     for iM~ agents after complete          unraveling of JM~ agents. There is incomplete                 unraveling of

     M;   agents.    The equilibrium        m occurs       at 7r2, where all insurance gains for JM) agents are

     exhausted.     JM~ agents are indifferent          between si~ng          first period contracts        and waiting

     for the second period market, and the equilibrium                   price for fist    period contracts     with JV;

     agents is r2 = rm(r2 ) = r~(rz).              The equilibrium       price of first period contracts        with M;

     agent5 is T1 = ry(rr2) > rm (rr2). iu~ agents extract all the rents from 6rst period contracts

     with WI agents, and they strictly              prefer signing first period contracts            to waiting for the

     second period spot market.           Again there is incomplete           umaveling     for W;     agents, and they

     m    indifferent   between fist      period contracts       with ;}f/    and JM~ agents md waiting for the

     second period spot market.

          For completeness,           we d]scuss what happens            when m;       > w;.   Then r(m~,      O) is not

     defined.    Lf r(O, O) < r~ unraveling           does not OCCU. ~ T(O, O) > ~1, there is incomplete

        6 We ignore the integer problem and mume lhat yI can take real values, More rigorously we can
     assume agents use mixed strategim in the sense that the pro babdity of signing a fi~t period contract can
     be any number btwen    O and 1.

unraveling of type 1 !M agents.               The equilibrium        price of fist   period contracts      with type

 1 JW agents is on the ask price function.                Unraveling continues          mtil either the insurance

gains of first period contracts           between ,M{ agents and W; agents are exhausted                    at rl, or

until all W}       agents sign fist      period contracts.         The second c=e       cannot occur if the total

number of .M agents is sticiently             large, because any single W} agent could almost cercainly

obtain    the maximum          utility u(1) by waiting for the second period spot mmkec when all

other W;      agents sign fist         period    contracts.        The equilibrium      therefore has incomplete

umaveling      of both       type 1 M agents and type 1 W agents, and the equilibrium                        price is

r,   = rm(m, ) = rW(rl).              The less interesting         case of ml    + ml     < w;     can be similarly

addressed,

The chmacterization           of equilibria     in the last section allows us to address how changes in

relative numbers of different kinds of agents ad                    in the degree of heterogeneity        in the fist

period mmket tiect           the likelihood     of different forms of unraveling, equilibrium             prices and

welfare in terms of fist        period expected         utility.

      It follows from the ordering property               and the monotonicity          property     that ~he neces-

sary ~d     sficient     condition      for uraveling     of JMJ agents is n(O, O) > T,, and the necessmy

and su.fticient condition        for unraveling f .M~ agents is ~(m~, O) > iT2. .4s mentioned                    pre-

viously, the fit       period market is not a pure ~signment                 market because        the payoffs from

being unassigned        are endogenous.          In a pue      msigment         market, eqdlbrium        payoffs are

determined        by relative numbers of different types of market participants                  up to a boundary

condition    that the un~signed           receive an exogenous         payoff. Here, the “effective”        numbers

of market participants,          T(O, O) and z(m~, O) (relative           to ml and rz ) replace        the relative

nmbers      m;,    m; md w; as the determinants                of equilibrium.



                               4.1.    Relative     numbers          and unraveling


r,   and rz do not depend             on relative numbers           of market participants,        but T(O, O) and

~(m~, O) decre=e         =    the number of either M:              or ;Jf) agents increues       or as the number

                                                        -ii’   -
of W}      agents decreases.      Therefore,     unraveling of .Y1~ and i~~ agents becomes                    less likely

as the relative       supply    of the two type of JM agents incremes.                  Furthermore.          given the

total number of ,M/ and .M; agents, unraveling                     for both types is less likely the greater

the proportion        of JM} agents, because        a greater proportion         of JM} agents decre=es             both

T(O, O) and r(m~,        O).    An interpretation         of these results is that early contracting              is less

likely in assignment        markets where firms expect             to fill their positions     in the spot market

and therefore face smaU payoff risks.

      Whether        the numbers of market participants              tiects    the equilibrium         prices depends

on the kind of equilibrium           that occurs.      Relative     nubem       do not tiect       the bid and ask

functions    in Figure 1, so if the equilibrium            involves incomplete      unraveling of either ~M/ or

JMJ agents, changes in the numbers of different types of market participmts                             on the margin

have no effect on prices and hence no effects on the expected                     utility of any type of agents.

      However,       if there is complete       unraveling       of JV; agents, changes        in the numbers          of

different types of market participants            tiect     the equilibrium     price rl through r(m~, 0). An

incre~e     in m;, m increase in m;, or a decrease in w! all have the sme                         effect of reducing

rl because     they reduce r(m~, O). Also, given the total number of iv{                          ad     .M; agents, a

greater proportion       of JMI agents decre~es           the equilibrium      price rl of fist    period con~racts

for M:     agents. Ln either case, the welfare of type 1 .lf agents decreases, and the welfare of

W;   agents increases.         The welfare of type 2 M agents falls because                rm, the shadow price

of fist    period contracts      for type 2 M agents, decreases as the equilibrium                     ~ falls.



                                  4.2. Heterogeneity             and unraveling


Consider     anincreasein        Az that reduces heterogeneity          among M agents. The bid fmction

r;   shifts up, and the function          r:    remains mchanged.             See Figure 2.       Z2 decreases       and

insurance gtins increase for M:           agents. This tends to increase the likelihood                  of unraveling

for M;     agents.    But a greater AZ also decreases r(O, O) and ~(m~, O) because                         it increases

the average quality of JM agents.              This tends to decrease the likelihood              of unraveling for

both types of agents.          Putting   all these together, unraveling for type 1 M agents becomes

less likely, but we cannot          say whether       the likelihood    of unraveling        for type 2 .Yf agents

incre~es     or decre~es       without   additional       structure on preferences and other parameters.


                                                          -18-
      If there is incomplete       unraveling or no unraveling of type 1 :Yf agents, the equilibrium

price r~ is unflected,      and the expected utilities of dl market participmts            me untiected     by

a decrease in AZ. If there is complete         unaveling       of type 1 M agents, the equilibrium        price

rl falls, either due to a smrdler r(m~, O) f there is no unraveling for type ~ .~f agents, Or

due to a smaller 7T2if incomplete         unraveling of type 2 M agents occurs.          In either case, the

welfare of type 1 M agents decreases,              and the welfme of W;      agents increases.       The effect

on the shadow price r “’ if there is no unraveling               of .Vlj agents, and on the equilibrium

price rz if there is unraveling        of Mi   agents, is ambiguous        because    AZ has increased      but

equilibrium     T has decre~ed.        The effect on the welfare of type 2 ~M agents is therefore

ambiguous.

      Less heterogeneity       caused by a decrease in Al has different effects.          The bid function

r:   shifts down, ~L increases,       and iTZremains unchanged.          See Figure 3. T(0, O) incremes,

but r(m~, O) does not change because it does not depend on Al. There is no effect on the

likelihood    of maveling        for type 2 M agents, and the effects for type 1 are ambiguous,

      If there is incomplete      unraveling of type 1 M agents, the equilibrium          price rl incre~es,

but the effect on their welfare is ambiguous              because Al has decremed.       The shadow price

rm of type 2 JM agents i.ncresses, ms.king them better off.                 W;     agents are worse off,       If

there is complete     umaveling       of type 1 M agents,        the equilibrium     price r~ decre~es     due

to a downward      shift of the bid price function           r ~ ( ~), whether or not there is unraveling

of type 2 M agents.         M;     agents are worse off because both rl and Al are lower.                There

is no change in either the shadow price r m if there is no unraveling of ~M~ agents, or the

equilibrium    price rz if there is umaveling          of M;     agents, and their welfare remains          the

same. The welfare of W:            agents does not &age          either because the better terms of first

period contracts     with type 1 M        agents     is offset by their decreased      probability    of being

productive.

      Changes in Al and AZ considered          above tiect       the average quality of JVIagents differ-

ently, and &age       both the initial conditions           T(O, O) and ~(m~, O), md     the critical values

ml snd 7r2. A “-compensated”            decreme     in the heterogeneity    of M     agents is a change in

both ~, and A2 that isolates the two effects.               Consider decre~ing     Al and increasing Jz so

that the initial condition       x(O, O) remains unchanged,        Since rl is increased by a smaller Al,

unraveling for .}1/ agents becomes         less likely.

                                    4.3. Prohibitions         on early contracts


We conclude       this section by discussing the welfare effects of banning first period contract-

ing. Clearly, a ban h= no effects if T(O, O) ~ ml. If the ban is effective, we use the shadow

price of each type of agents evaluated at 7(O, O) m a                       index of welfare with the ban and

compme      it to the price or shadow price in the relevat                 competitive    equilibrium   without the

ban. Since in any unraveling equilibrium                  type 2 M agents are indifferent         between signing

a first-period     contract      md waiting for the second period spot market, and since unraveling

reduces the equilibrium            m and hence rm, a ban on first period contracting               unambiguously

benefits them. Similarly, since in any equilibrium                   W;    agents are indifferent between sign-

ing a first-period       contract     with type 1 M agents and waiting for the second period spot

msrket,     and since mraveling             reduces the equilibrium         r and hence the equilibrium            price

rl, a ba     on tirst period contracting             unambiguously        hurts them.

     The welfare effects on type 1 M agents depend on what kind of equilibrium                                 wodd

otherwise     obtain    without       the bsn.       If z(O, O) > rrl > r(m~, 0), the equilibrium            due      of

r is rrl s rr(O, O), md unraveling               is incomplete     for type 1 M agents.        In this csse, a ban

incre=es    the shadow price of M;              agents and makes them better off. If m(m~, O) > rl,                  the

market equilibrium         involves complete           unraveling for type 1 M agents.          The welfare effect

of banning 6rst period contracts               on M;    agents depends on the initial condition           iT(O,0), If

this is large enough,           the shadow price r“(T(O,           O)) for .Vff agents with the ban is greater

than the competitive             equilibrium     price r~(r(rrs~, O)) without        the ban.    But if T(O, O) is

small so that rm(r(O,           O)) < r~(r(m~,        O)), the ban makes them worse off.



                                        5. Unraveling            with Reentry



First and second period             inefficiencies     are msociated       with the contracts     analyzed    above.

Psirwise    first period        contracts   cuot       replicate   the fu~ risk shuing       implied    by complete

cent ingent contracts.          Ln addition,    second period inefficiencies ae caused by the rest net ion

on reentry for those ex post           productive      agents whose fit      period contracts    prove unsuccess-

ful because      their partners       turn out to be unproductive.            In this section we allow these ex

post productive        agents     to enter the second period spot market.               This amounts     to allowing


                                                          -20-
        W;     agents to “buy out” of their first period contracts             ex post,     should the contracts         prove

        msuccessful.       7 First period inefficiencies        remain, but all second period inefficiencies               are

        eliminated      because all ex post unsuccessful         first period ~signments          ae    dissolved.



                                                  5.1.    Buyout      provisions


        Buyouts       require   analyzing     the terms on which they are negotiated.                   If the JM~ agent

        (i=    1,2) in a fist    period contract      with a W;       agent turns out to be productive,           the terms

        set by the initial contract         cannot be advmtageously         renegotiated.      For imtance,      if the spot

        market tmns out to be short on productive                     W agents and they receive a spot payoff 1,

        the W:     agent must pay the first period price of ri to the .M~ agent in order to enter the

        spot market,      which leaves them with exactly               the same net payoffs from not buying out.

        Similarly,     there me no gains for the W;            agent to buy out of an unsuccessful              fist   period

        cent ract if the spot price for productive             M agents is 1. Therefore,              buyout    occurs    only

        when the contract        is unsuccessful     and the spot price of productive            :M agents is O.

.. ..          Because    agents participating       in a first period      contract      -ticipate     the possibility     of

        buyout,      renegotiation    amounts      to an up front contingency          clause in the contract            which

        specifies the terms and the m~ket                circumstances    of a buyout:      The W agent pays the ex

        post   unproductive      JM~ agent r’ to buy out of the contract            when there is excess supply of

        productive      M agents in the spot maket.             Since the joint gain from buyout               is 1, the two

        agents in the first period contract           are in the same position         m they would have been had

        the M;    agent been productive.         It then follows that an optimal fist period contract                  shodd
                                                          8
        share risks in the ssme wy:            r’ = rl.

           7 The rewn     why W; agents buy out unsuccessful contracts here k that they have no individual
        uncertainty: ex pt productive M agents who sign a first period contract are always efficiently mignd
        to productive W agents. The buyout would be tw~sided if there w- indivldurd uncertainty for W: agents
        = well ss for M agents.

            E When the cmt of reentry is a number k E (O, 1), insled        of O In this -tion   and 1 in the previous
        -tion,    equilibrium first period cent-ts    spec~   the division of the output 1 when the M} agent turns
        out to be productive and of the output 1 - u when he is not productive but m; > w; in the spat market.
        The payoff risks in the      two contingence=   must be optimally shared between the two agents in a first
        period contrnct, Lemma A.3 in the appendx characterizes the form of timt period contracts, with 1 – k
        replacing m. The analysis of unraveling in this c-      of cmtly r=ntry is very similar to that in this section.
        The only change is that insurance gaim may not exist when r is small because reentry is more likely and
        the cc.st of reentry reducer the value of the first period insurance contract.



                                                               -21-
                                               5.2. Market equilibria

The analysis of equilibrium               unraveling with reentry proceeds as in the previous section,                 In

fact, the analysis is easier here because with buyout all ex post inefficient ~signmencs                              are

eliminated     and the key probability y of the event ml2 <
                                                          _ rut is independent                      of the numbers of

JMJ and ,M; agents who sign 6rst period contracts                     with W;         agents.    Thus r is no longer

endogenous        and this greatly simplifies the chmacterization                 of equilibrium        unraveling.    To

simplify   notation,     let    TO    =    T(O, O) be the probability      of the event tha~ m;             ~ ~~ with

reentry.

       As in the previous section, we lirst &macterize                 the bid and ~k functions             rrn and r‘.

For any fixed n 6 [0, I] and i = 1,2, let r~(r)                  be the solution      to the equation


                   (1 - A,) flU(0) +[1 - (1 - ~l)~]~(r)            = A, TU(l)     +   (1-   AjT)U(0),



md let r:(r)       be the solution          to the equation


                   (1 - ~,)ZV(0)          + [1 ‘(1    - AI)7]U(1 - ,) = i?V(0)+(l           - ~)?J(l)


Thus with reentry there =e two ask price functions                    u well w two bid price functions,               one

for ed     type of agents. The properties               of these functions      are established      in the appendix

(Lemma     Al).     The key =pects            rue: For either type of JVI agents, (i) the ask and bid price

functiom      are increasing         in rr, (ii) aak and bid prices equal zero at T = O and equal 1 at

z = 1, (iii) bid price is strictly greater than ask price for all m between O and 1. Therefore,

tike     the previous     section,        insurance    gains exist for all dues         of r for both types of .Vf

agents. Figure 4 depicts the ask and bid price functions for type i M agents (i = 1, 2).

       RecW    that without          reentry, =k      prices me the same for both types of ,W agents snd

the bid price is higher for type 1 M agents, so the ~due of insurace                             is always greater for

type 1, and unraveling of M agents is ordered by type.                          Here, one can e~ily         check that

because Al > AZ, both the bid and ask prices are larger for type 1 JW agents than for type

2 at each value of T. It is proven in the appendix                   (Lemma       .4,2) that although        type 2 ,}f

agents are willing to accept a lower price for first period contracts,                          the fact that Al > Jz

still implies that W;          agents prefer to sign fist         period contracts       with type 1 ~bf agents at


                                                          -22-
 their ~k price r~(n)             rather than with type 2 at r~(z)            at any r. lVith this result, we can

 show that any unraveling of type 2 M agents implies complete                              unraveling    of type 1, so

 that the order is preserved when buyout and reentry are permitted.

        The argument            is a-s follows.   Unraveling     of iWj     agents implies     that there is a price

TZ 2 r: [no) such that W:                 agents prefer a first period contract           with a type z J}f agent at

r2 to waiting for the second               period spot market.       But since W;         agen~s prefer to sign fist

period contracts        with type 1 IM agents at r~(~o ) rather than with type 2 at r~                        (TO),    there

exists a price rl > r~ (mo) such              that W{    agents prefer a first period contract          with a type 1

M agent rather than with a type 2 JM agent at rz. But type 1 M agents dso prefer a fist

period contract        at such rl to waiting for the second period spot mmket.                     Thus, there must

be maveling         of type 1 M agents if there is umaveling                  of type 2 M agents. Moreover,              the

unraveling       of type 1 JM agents must be complete,                     because incomplete      unraveling         would

imply     that r] = r~(ro ) and W}                agents ue      indifferent between        signing with type 1 .Lf

agents at rl ~d          slgnmg with type 2 M agents at some rz z r~ (To), which we know is

impossible.

        Since r is no longer endogenous,            the fist period contract equilibrium           can be thought of

u a pure =signment               problem.    The following chmacterization             of equilibrium     with reentry

follows    immediately.           There    are two possible       cases.     g If w;    < m{ so that W}               agents

are in short supply in the 6rst period,                  the unique competitive           equilibrium   h=        complete

unraveling for W:         agents and incomplete           on.raveling for type 1 M agents at their ask price

rlm(~o). There is no unraveling for type 2 JM agents. If mj < w; < ml + m: so that                                     type

1 JM agents rue short in the tirst period, the unique competitive                         equilibrium   has complete

unraveling       for type 1 M agents and for W:                  agents, and incomplete         unraveling         for type

2 M agents.         The equilibrium          price for type 2 M agents is their ask price               rf(To).         The

equilibrium      price rl for type 1 .M agents is given by the following indifference                             condi tion

by W;     agents:

                                       5.3.    Welfare      comparisons


Unraveling without buyouts and reentry is both ex ante and ex post                       inefficient.    Unraveling

with buyouts       and reentry provide hmited insurance in the tirst period                    without      affecting

the efficiency    of assignments.      Therefore     compared      to a situation       where first period con-

tracting    is prohibited,    unraveling      with free reentry generally improves            welfare of market

participants.     Ln particular,    if W!     agents are short in the first period market (w;                < m;),

banning first period contracts decreaaes their welfme without changing the welfare of either

type of JM agents. Lf type 1 ,M agents me short (ml                 < w;), banning first period contracts

decreases their welfare s-s well m the welfsre of W}              agents wit bout affecting the welfare of

type 2 IW agents.

      It is dso of interest to compme           welfare with and without         reentry. In general reentry

must improve       welfme,     but there is a question         of the distributions        of the gains mong

various types of agents.        It is possible     that some agents become              worse off with reent~.

Reentry causes both bid price functiom              to shift up (because       W:   agents me willing to pay

more for tirst period contracts        tith    either type of .M agents at any r), and the ask price

function    to shift down (because       .M agents of either type me willing to accept less to sign

first period contracts       at my r) and become two ask fmctions.

      It is straightfowsrd         to show that reentry         generally    benefits    M;    agents,     With    or

without    reentry, in an unraveling          equilibrium     .M~ agents me indifferent         between signing

and not signing first period contracts            tith   W{    agents.    In either cue       the welfare of JM;

agents is negatively     related     to the equilibrium       m. Since without          reentry the equilibrium

r is smaller thm      T(O, O), and since with reentry the equilibrium               iT always equals 7(O, O),

M;    are better off with reent~.       Of course, if in the equilibrium         without      reentry there is no

unraveling of any type, reentry does not change their welfme.

      Welfare    compmisons        for ~M/ and W;        agents are more complicated.              If there is no

unraveling      of rmy type without         reentry, then doting         reentry makes W/           agents better

off ad     leaves JM/ either indifferent         or better off.    With     reentry, the equilibrium           either

involves    incomplete   unraveling     of lMI agents when W/               are in short supply         in the first

period,    or complete   unraveling of JM; agents when they are in short supply,                         In the tirst

c~e   (w; < m; ), reentry does not change the welfare of type 1 M agents, because it does

not &ange        the equilibrium          ~ md    type 1 IW agents are indifferent       between signing fist

period contracts          with W} agents and waiting, with and without            reentry. The equilibrium

price with reentry r~(~o ) is lower thm                the shadow price rm (m(O, O)) without        reentry, and

reentry allows W;           agents to reap all the efficiency gains of better insurance,             because In

the second case (m;             < w;) reentry makes both .M~ agents ud            W/     agents better off     In

the equilibrium          with reentry M}        agents prefer a first period contract    at the equilibrium    rl

rY(~(O, O)) without            reentry.

     If there is incomplete           unraveling of type 1 .M agents without reentry, allowing reentry

improves      the welfme of lM} agents.             This is because in the equilibrium        without    reentry

type 1   iU   agents are indifferent between signing a first period contract              and waiting for the

spot mruket at fil, but in the equilibrium               with reentry they weakly prefer the equilibrium

contract      with W;      agents at To > TI. But the welf~e            effect on W;     agents is ambiguom

in this c=e:        W}    cm     be either worse off or better       off with reentry.    H irl is sufficiently

small relative to To, W;            agents are able to sign 6rst period contracts        with JM} agents at a

very low price rm (rrl ) in the unraveling equilibrium               without reentry, and allowing reentry

makes them worse off. This can happen when the risk- aversion of JM~ agents is great for

low values of z so that the ~k price function without reentry is ve~                     convex.    In this case,

irl c=     be very small because           M:    agents are willing to accept very unfavorable          terms in

first period contracts          with W;     agents when T is low.



                                                    6. Extension


In concluding        this paper,      we briefly describe       how the model    can be extended        to more

general assignment          markets.      Let us consider the caae of a general symmetric          2 x 2 matrix

of joint outputs.         Suppose      that in the second period an asignment            of two unproductive

agents of opposite          groups produces        VI and an assignment     of a productive        agent and an

unproductive        agent of the opposite           group produces    Vz. The output       of two productive

agents of opposite         groups is still 1. We resume that VI s Uz and V2 ~ 1 so that one type of


                                                         -25-
either group (JVf~ and W;                 agents) is more productive               that type 2 of the same .~oup (J}f;

and W:         agents),    and that 2V2 < 1 + VI so that productive                         agents of opposite        groups ~e

optimally        assigned to each other whenever possible.                        .issume       that reentry is not allowed,

and the individual             uncertainty        for each type of agents is the same as before.

         Now    the equilibrium         payoffs    of ptiicipants       in the second period market are not simply

characterized        ~    1 or O depending            on relative numbers of the ex post                    productive     agents,

Recall that the payoff from being un=signed                           in the second period is sssomed              to be O. This

boundary         payoff is not sufficient to pin down the equilibria                              payoffs if the two groups

have exactly        the sme           size because it is possible            to sssign all agents to each other and

rents can be distributed               differently,    10 ~ order to solve the problem                  of indeterminacy,        ‘e

distinguish       two cases:          over-supply     of W agents (m; + m;                 < w; + UJ~), ~cl          over-supply

of M agents (m;                + m;     > w{ + w;).          We consider          the first c~e       only, the second          case

cm     be dealt with similarly.              If m; + m;         < W; + W;,          then regmdless          of the nubers         of

different types of agents who sign fist                      period      contracts,      W agents       are over-supplied         in

the second period              spot maket,         so that the reproductive              W agents (W;            agents)   obttin

an equilibrium           payoff of zero.          Since some of M;               agents are matched           with W;      agents,

they receive VI regardless of the market supply                            and demand            condition.      The payoffs to

productive        .M and W agents depend their relative numbers:                                If the productive      W agents

are over-supplied          in the spot mmket (m!              < w;),     their    equilibrium      payoff     is V2 – U1, and    the

equilibrium       payoffs for productive            JW agents are 1 + U1- wz; if the               productive ~ agents are
under-supplied           (m;    < ru~), their equilibrium             payoff is 1 – V2, and the equilibrium                payoffs

for ,W; agents =e uz.

         As in previous sections,           type 2 W agents are not involved in first period contracting.

The expected             utility from waiting is greater th~                     the maximum        utility from signing a fist

period contract               with a type z w agent.

       The general specification                   of the joint output matrix brings in some new considerations

to the ualysis.               Any first period contract            between an ,Vf,] agent and a W;                     agent specifies

the division of the joint output                     in two contingencies,            when the      iM}     agent [urns out to be

productive         and when he is unproductive.                     Since risk-sharing            between the .M? agent and

the W; agent must be optimal in the m~kec                                equilibrium,      the terms of the contract               in the

two contingencies                  are not independent.          Suppose         the tirst period         contract     specifies r and

s as the payoffs to the M,l agent in the fist                             period contract         when he is productive              and

when he is unproductive                     respectively.       Payoffs to the W~ agent in the two contingencies

are 1 – r and Uz – s respectively.                      Since payoffs to che W;                  agent must be non-negative,

r s 1 and s s v, In the appendix                         (Lemma          A.3) we establish         that s can be written m a

(weakly)         incre~ing,          piecewise differential function of r.

       The ask and bid price fmctions                       can be dehed             u before:    For any fied           iT 6 [0,1] and

i = 1, 2, rlrn(~) is the solution                  to the equation


        AIU(r)       +   (1    –    Aj)U(S(r))     = A;[r?U(l    + VI – U2) + (1 – ‘) U(V2)]               +(1     –   ‘i)”(vl),

and r:(r)         is the solution          to the equation




Note   that s(r) represents the payoff to the JM} agent when he is unproductit-e                                         w a function

of his payoff when he turns out to be productive.

       A comparison                of the two uk price functions reveals that the ~k price function of type

1 M agents may be either below or above that of type 2. For a given irl a greater J tends CO

incresse the ask price because                     the agent h= a higher probability                  of being productive            and

hence a higher expected                   utility from wtiting),              but at the same time it tends to decrease

the ask price because                  the agent hm greater probability                  of obtaiting            the better   terms r,

rather than s(r, ). One can show that if VI is close to V2, the second tendency                                             dominates

md     the ask price function                    of type 1 M agent            lies   below the type 2 ask price function.

Since the bid price function                     for type 1 M agent Ii= above the bid price function for type ?

                                                                  -2i’    -
(because     A1>   ~z ), the order of unraveling is presemed lvhen VI is close to vz: There must

be complete    unraveling of type 1 M agents before any unraveling of type 2 JM agents, The

monotonicity       property   of T(yl, yz ) established   in section   3 clearly remains valid in this

more general assignment        m~ket.    With these two properties,      different types of unraveling

equilibria   can be established     in a similar way ss in section 3.

Therefore,

Since u and u are concave, (u(l) - u(0)) /u’(0) <1 and (u(1) – u(0)) /u’(1) >1, (u(1) – .(0)) /.’(0) <1

Lemma A.2.         For all r E (O, 1),

                                                                     -29-
Proof.    Given any T E (O, 1), let
                                   V(Ai)    =     (1 -A,    )Tu(0)+[l         -(1    – A,)n]u(l         –r:(n))
be the expected utility fOr W} agents frOm first period cOntr acts with :~} agents at price r,m(~).                                       Given
m, we can think of V(A) u a function of A given by
                                    V(A) = (1 - A)7ru(0) + [1 – (1 – A)fi]u(l - r“’(~)),
where rm (A) k a function          of A delined by
                                      (1 - fi+~fi)u(rm(~))               =(1        - T)u(0) + }nu(l).
The statement       of tbe lemma rollows if we can show that V(A) is incre=ing                               in A. By the detinit,on   of V(A),
                    dV(A)/dA   = m[u(l - r“’(~)) - u(O)] – (1 – m + Jx)u’(1                             - r“’(A))dr”’(A)/dA.
By the defiition       of rm(~),
                                                                      [“(1)- U(o)]n(l-m)
                                            drm(A)/dA          =
                                                                    u’(rm(~))(l           - r+    An)2
Combining        the above expr-ions,           we iind that dV(A)/dA                >0     if and only if
                               U(I – rm(A)) –              u(o) >     U(l – r~(A))         -     u(o)     l–m
                                    u’(1 - rm(~))                             u’(rm(~))                 l–m+Ar”
By the debition        of rm(A),    we     have

                                   ~ _lm-:Am
                                           [“(1             - ,“’(A))     -    “(o)]=       .(1) - u(rm(A)).

Thus, dV(A)/dA        >0   if and only if
                                            u(1 – rm(A)) - u(O) > u(l) – u(r’’’(l))
                                                  U((1 – r~(A))                       u~(rm(~))
Since u and u are concave, the Ieft-hnnd side of the above inequality is greater than 1-                                       rm(~)   while the
right-hand side is 1= than 1 - rm (A). This complet= the proof of the lemma.

Proof.    Let c be the solution       to the equation

Since the left-hand-side  of the above equation is greater than tbe right-hand-side    when r = O and the
o,p~alte M tme when r = 1 - ~, and since the Ieft-hmd-side         is decre=ing   in r and the rlght-hand-
slde & incre=ing    in r, the above equatiOn defin= a unique c G (0, 1 - m).        simil~ly,  the equatlOn

       Suppose r E [0, ~. If J >0,           we would have

                                                                        —                   —

This impli-    that     the two agents in the contrmt can he made better off if r is incre~ed slightly and s
d-red      slightly,    a contradiction.  Thus, s = O if r 6 [0, ~. By a symmetric reasoning, s = q if r E [F, 1].
If r c (~ ~, the       fi~t-order condition that m optimal risk-sharing arrangement must satisfy leads the
relatlon stated in     the lemma.
