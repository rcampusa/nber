                                           ABSTRACT

International differences in teacher quality are commonly hypothesized to be a key determinant of
the large international student performance gaps, but lack of consistent quality measures has
precluded testing this. We construct country-level measures of teacher cognitive skills using
unique assessment data for 31 countries. We find substantial differences in teacher cognitive
skills across countries that are strongly related to student performance. Results are supported by
fixed-effects estimation exploiting within-country between-subject variation in teacher skills. A
series of robustness and placebo tests indicate a systematic influence of teacher skills as distinct
from overall differences among countries in the level of cognitive skills. Moreover, observed
country variations in teacher cognitive skills are significantly related to differences in women’s
access to high-skill occupations outside teaching and to salary premiums for teachers.

1.    Overview

     Numerous international assessments have shown that student achievement differs widely across

developed countries, but the source of these differences is not well-understood. While prior analysis

has identified the impact of overall institutional structures (Hanushek and Woessmann (2011)), the

research has been much less successful at identifying systematic features of schools and teachers

that enter into explaining these achievement differences – leaving many policy discussions open to

anecdotal and ad hoc explanations. This paper investigates whether differences in cognitive skills of

teachers – which arise both from overall country skill differences and from policy decisions – can

help explain international differences in student performance across developed countries.

     Policy discussions, building largely on within-country analyses of the importance of teachers,

have emphasized the role of teacher skills in improving student achievement. For example, a

widely-cited McKinsey report on international achievement concludes that “the quality of an

educational system cannot exceed the quality of its teachers” and then goes on to assert that “the

top-performing systems we studied recruit their teachers from the top third of each cohort graduate

from their school system.” (Barber and Mourshed (2007), p. 16) In a follow-on report, Auguste,

Kihn, and Miller (2010) note that the school systems in Singapore, Finland, and Korea “recruit

100% of their teacher corps from the top third of the academic cohort,” which stands in stark

contrast to the U.S. where “23% of new teachers come from the top third.” (p. 5) They then

recommend a “top third+ strategy” for the U.S. educational system. We investigate the implications

for student achievement of focusing policy attention on the cognitive skills of potential teachers.

     Our analysis exploits unique data from the Programme for the International Assessment of

Adult Competencies (PIAAC) that for the first time allow quantifying differences in teacher skills

in numeracy and literacy across countries. These differences in teacher cognitive skills reflect, as

we discuss below, both the overall level of cognitive skills of each country’s population and where

teachers are drawn from in each country’s skill distribution.

     Teacher cognitive skills differ widely internationally. For example, average numeracy and


                                                     1
literacy skills of teachers in countries with the lowest measured skills in our sample (Chile and

Turkey) are well below the skills of employed adults with just vocational education in Canada. 1 In

contrast, the skills of teachers in countries with the highest measured skills (Japan and Finland)

exceed the skills of adults with a master’s or PhD degree in Canada.

     Employing a variety of estimation approaches, we consider how teacher cognitive skills are

related to student achievement. While identification of causal effects is clearly difficult in this

international context, the consistency of estimated impacts across alternative approaches supports

the underlying importance of teacher cognitive skills. Following this basic impact estimation,

complementary analyses of why teacher skills differ across countries and of the international reward

structure for teacher skills provide new evidence on the sources of country differences.

     We use country-level measures of subject-specific teacher skills along with rich student-level

micro data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) to estimate the

association of teacher cognitive skills with student performance in math and reading across 31

developed economies. The results from combining this information on teacher quality with student

achievement indicate that differences in teacher cognitive skills can explain significant portions of

the international differences in student performance.

     Because of the obvious difficulty of reliably separating the independent impact of teacher

cognitive skills from other factors potentially influencing student achievement, we pursue three

different strategies to investigate the sensitivity of the estimated impacts to potential confounding

factors. First, we estimate OLS models with extensive sets of control variables, including student

and family background, general and subject-specific school inputs, institutional features of the

school systems, and cross-country differences in educational inputs. Subject-specific parental

cognitive skills, approximated with the PIAAC data, help in separating teacher impacts from the

persistence of skills across generations and from smart parents.




     1
       We use Canada as a benchmark for the international skill comparison because the Canadian sample is by far the
largest among all countries surveyed in PIAAC, allowing for a fine disaggregation of individuals by educational degree.

                                                             2
    Second, we exploit differences in the performance of students and teachers across math and

reading. This student fixed-effects analysis allows us to identify the effect of teacher cognitive skills

using only variation between subjects, thereby directly controlling for unobserved student-specific

characteristics that similarly affect math and reading performance (e.g., innate ability or family

background). At the same time, this within-student between-subject model also controls for all

differences across countries that are not subject-specific, such as general education preferences, the

nature of teacher labor markets, and culture.

    Third, a set of alternative placebo tests strongly supports our basic estimation. First, we

estimate student achievement models based on the cognitive-skill levels in other broad occupations

(e.g., managers, scientists and engineers, health professionals, business professionals), but no

alternative occupational grouping is systematically related to student outcomes, and estimated

impacts are consistently below those of actual teachers. Second, we create pseudo-teacher samples

by randomly selecting adults who match teachers on background characteristics. Estimating the

student achievement models, the results again fail to rival our actual teacher estimates in terms of

magnitude or significance of impact.

    All empirical strategies consistently indicate a robust positive relationship between teacher

cognitive skills and student performance. In the OLS estimation with the full set of controls, we find

that a one standard deviation (SD) increase in teacher cognitive skills is associated with 0.10-0.15

SD higher student performance. To put these estimates into perspective, they imply that roughly one

quarter of gaps in mean student performance across our 31 countries would be closed if each of

these countries were to raise the median cognitive skills of teachers to the level of Finnish teachers

(the most skilled teachers by the PIAAC measures).

    Our results are robust to adding coarse measures of teachers’ pedagogical approaches,

suggesting that instructional style neither explains nor mediates the impact of teacher cognitive

skills. Moreover, accounting for cross-country differences in economic development and in

educational institutions such as central exit exams and controlling for continental fixed effects to


                                                      3
address issues of divergent national cultures do not change the teacher-skill coefficients.

    We also provide novel evidence about the determinants of differences in teacher cognitive

skills across countries. Existing studies have shown a strong decline in teacher cognitive skills in

the United States resulting from improved alternative employment opportunities for women in the

labor market during the past decades (e.g., Bacolod (2007)). Using the PIAAC data, we generalize

the U.S. evidence to a broader set of countries, exploiting within-country changes across birth

cohorts in the proportion of females working in high-skill occupations. By observing multiple

countries, we can more readily assess how female labor-market opportunities interact with teacher

quality.

    Greater shares of women working in high-skill occupations outside of teaching are significantly

related to lower cognitive-skill levels of teachers. This suggests that international differences in

women’s opportunities to enter (other) high-skill occupations provide part of the explanation for the

observed variation in teacher cognitive skills across countries.

    The PIAAC micro data permit looking explicitly at whether teachers in each country are paid

above or below what would be expected (given their gender, work experience, and cognitive skills).

We find considerable variation in the premiums paid to teachers, with Ireland paying considerably

above market and the United States and Sweden paying considerably below market. These reduced-

form country-specific premiums are directly related to observed teacher cognitive skills across

countries and, importantly, to student achievement differences.

    Section 2 considers relevant prior research. Section 3 introduces the datasets and describes our

computation of teacher cognitive skills. Section 4 presents our empirical strategies. Section 5

reports results on the association of teacher cognitive skills with student performance in math and

reading and provides robustness checks and placebo tests. Section 6 analyzes possible determinants

of the cross-country differences in teacher cognitive skills, focusing on women’s access to

alternative high-skill occupations and on teacher salaries. Section 7 concludes.

2.       Related Literature

     Large numbers of studies investigate the determinants of student achievement within individual

countries. 2 This literature consistently finds that achievement reflects a combination of family

background factors, school inputs, and institutional factors. However, these studies are better suited

for within-country analysis and are not structured to explain differences in achievement across

countries. A parallel literature on international differences in achievement builds on the

comparative outcome data in existing international student assessments. One of the clearest

explanatory factors from these international studies has been the importance of family. In contrast,

specific conclusions about the impact of school resources have been much more limited.

     The most convincing within-country studies of the role of schools focus on differences in

learning gains among teachers and classrooms. These studies of teacher value-added to student

reading and math performance consistently find huge variations in teacher value-added that far

exceed the impact of any measured school inputs (Hanushek and Rivkin (2012), Jackson, Rockoff,

and Staiger (2014)). 3 But these results have not been very useful in addressing international

achievement differences. First, the studies focus almost exclusively on the experience in the United

States. Second, they have not reliably described underlying determinants of teacher value-added –

and in particular any determinants that can be consistently measured across countries.

     Importantly, a wide range of international within- and across-country studies have generally

shown that the most common measures of teacher differences – education, experience levels, and

sources and nature of teacher preparation – are not consistently related to student achievement,

raising questions about the reliance on these as indicators of teacher quality in international




     2
       See, for example, the reviews in Hanushek (2002) and Glewwe et al. (2013).
     3
       For a sample of the research into teacher effectiveness, see Rockoff (2004), Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2005),
Kane, Rockoff, and Staiger (2008), Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff (2014), and the summaries in Hanushek and Rivkin
(2010). As an indication of the magnitudes involved, Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2005) estimate that the effect of a
costly ten student reduction in class size is smaller than the benefit of moving up the teacher quality distribution by one
standard deviation.

                                                                5
studies. 4

         However, two interesting contrasts coming from studies of teacher cognitive skills and of

teacher salaries motivate our subsequent analysis of student achievement. Prior studies of measured

teacher cognitive skills, largely from within the United States, 5 provide some suggestive results of

positive impacts on student achievement. 6 However, studies incorporating measures of teacher

cognitive skills have generally relied on small and idiosyncratic data sets, and the results have not

been entirely consistent. 7 Nonetheless, compared to the various alternative measures of teacher

quality commonly investigated, teacher test scores have been most consistently related to student

outcomes. Moreover, recent work that links teacher test performance to the overall value-added of

teachers also shows a positive relationship (Jackson and Bruegmann (2009), Clotfelter, Ladd, and

Vigdor (2010), Jackson (2012b)). 8

     The relevant evidence on teacher salaries is different. While within-country studies tend to find

that salaries are not a good measure of differences in teacher effectiveness, 9 the limited cross-

country studies that are available have found salary levels to be often positively related to country




     4
        For reviews of the evidence on the impact of teacher characteristics from within-country studies, see Hanushek
(1995, (2003), Glewwe et al. (2013), and Woessmann (2003). For cross-country evidence, see Hanushek and
Woessmann (2011). The one exception to the general conclusions is that additional years of experience at the beginning
of a career quite consistently have positive and significant impacts of student achievement.
      5
        For developing countries, Harbison and Hanushek (1992), Metzler and Woessmann (2012), and Bietenbeck,
Piopiunik, and Wiederhold (Forthcoming) show the relevance of teacher subject knowledge using individual-level
teacher data. Using a general, non-subject-specific, measure on cognitive abilities (based on a standard IQ test),
Grönqvist and Vlachos (2016) find only a negligible impact of teacher cognitive skills on student achievement in
Sweden.
     6
         Measures of teacher cognitive skills were first introduced in the Coleman Report (Coleman et al. (1966)).
Studies in the U.S. finding a positive impact of teacher tests on student outcomes include early studies in Hanushek
(1971, (1972, (1992) and Ferguson and Ladd (1996) and, more recently, in Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor (2006) and
Goldhaber (2007).
      7
        See Eide, Goldhaber, and Brewer (2004); Hanushek and Rivkin (2006), and the summaries in Hanushek (1997,
(2003). Among the early estimates, 37 percent are positive and statistically significant and 27 percent are positive and
statistically insignificant versus 10 percent negative and statistically significant and 15 percent negative and statistically
insignificant. (12 percent do not provide the sign of statistically insignificant results).
      8
        In related analysis, teacher test scores help in selecting effective teachers (Rockoff et al. (2011) and in identifying
good teacher matches (Jackson (2012a)).
      9
        Hanushek and Rivkin (2006)) provide an overview of the within-country evidence indicating that teacher salaries
are a weak measure of teacher quality. However, challenging this general conclusion, Britton and Propper (2016) find
positive effects of relative teacher pay on school productivity, exploiting regional variation in teachers’ relative wages.
Loeb and Page (2000) similarly relate regional variation in relative teacher wages to rates of educational attainment but
also lack direct measures of teacher quality.

                                                                 6
differences in student outcomes. 10 These divergent results suggest that the salary levels of a country

may be part of a country’s institutional structure with important ramifications for the quality of the

overall pool of potential teachers, even if the distribution of salaries within a country is not a good

index of differential teacher effectiveness. Relatedly, cross-country analysis suggest that pay

incentives are related to student performance even if within-country variations in pay structure are

less informative. 11 The overall suggestion of the importance of salary differences across countries

leads us to explore country-level teacher wage premiums and teacher cognitive skills in Section 6.

     Changes in the cognitive skills of teachers have been previously studied in the U.S., where

there is general agreement of a decline over time in measured achievement and in other quality

indicators (Murnane et al. (1991), Corcoran, Evans, and Schwab (2004a, (2004b), Bacolod

(2007)). 12 Bacolod (2007) documents a clear decline in the quality of young women entering the

teaching profession between 1960 and 1990 that she relates to falling relative teacher wages, and

Corcoran, Evans, and Schwab (2004a, (2004b) show that the decline in measured teacher skills over

the period was concentrated in the upper portion of the achievement distribution. 13 Both suggest

that women’s opportunities to enter high-skill occupations outside teaching are a determinant of the




     10
         In their country-level analysis, Lee and Barro (2001) find a positive association between teacher salary levels
and student achievement. Similarly, Woessmann (2005) reports a significant positive coefficient on a country-level
measure of teacher salary when added to an international student-level regression. Dolton and Marcenaro-Gutierrez
(2010) pool country-level data from international tests between 1995 and 2006 to show that teacher salaries – both
when measured in absolute terms and relative to wages in each country – are positively associated with student
achievement, even after controlling for country fixed effects. However, since salary differentials are difficult to
compare internationally, the cross-country models might be biased.
      11
         For a review on teacher performance pay, see Leigh (2013). See also the international investigation of
performance pay in Woessmann (2011).
      12
         There is a longer investigation of the teaching profession, largely from a sociological perspective, that focuses
on the well-being of teachers in terms of their relative status and earnings, as opposed to any aspect of teacher quality or
teacher effectiveness. See, for example, Bergmann (1974), Reskin (1984), and Tienda, Smith, and Ortiz (1987). Such
analyses have also had an international comparative component as in Charles (1992), Blackburn, Jarman, and Brooks
(2000), and Kelleher (2011), but again lacking any attention to the impact on students.
      13
         A related line of research has focused on entry and exit from teaching, investigates the importance of alternative
job opportunities for teacher quality. Early estimation of outside opportunities on teacher transitions is found in Dolton
and van der Klaauw (1999), although the key issues were suggested long before in Kershaw and McKean (1962).
Nagler, Piopiunik, and West (2015) exploit business cycle conditions at career start as a source of exogenous variation
in the outside options of potential teachers, finding that teachers entering the profession during recessions are
significantly more effective in raising student test scores than teachers who entered the profession during non-
recessionary periods. None of these, however, considers teacher cognitive skills, the focus of our study. An early
investigation of how preparation for and entry into teaching are related to cognitive skills is found in Hanushek and
Pace (1995).

                                                                7
skill level of teachers in a country, a hypothesis to which we return below. 14 Importantly, the

analysis of varying skill levels of teachers in these studies has not been linked directly to student

performance – something that we can do for an international sample.

     Throughout we focus on cognitive skills for both teachers and students. While there is

increased attention to noncognitive skills both in the labor market (e.g., Heckman and Kautz

(2012)) and to the role of schools and teachers in producing noncognitive outcomes (e.g., West et

al. (2016) and Jackson (forthcoming)), we have no way of directly incorporating noncognitive skills

in our international analysis even if they might partially be reflected in our test scores.

3.    International Comparative Data

     This section first describes the construction of the new international measures of teacher

cognitive skills and how these skills are distributed across countries (Section 3.1). We then explain

how measures of parent cognitive skills are constructed (Section 3.2) and introduce the data on

student performance and further control variables (Section 3.3). Electronic Appendix A provides

additional information on the datasets and the construction of variables.

3.1 Teacher Cognitive Skills

     Measured cognitive skills of teachers are derived from the Programme for the International

Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) survey. Developed by the Organisation for Economic

Co-operation and Development (OECD) and collected in 2011/2012 (Round 1) and in 2014/15

(Round 2), PIAAC tested various cognitive skill domains of more than 215,000 adults aged 16-65

years in 33 developed economies. 15

     We define teachers as all PIAAC respondents who report a current four-digit occupation code

of “primary school teacher”, “secondary school teacher”, or “other teacher” (which includes, for

example, special education teachers and language teachers). 16 We exclude university professors and


     14
        As Bacolod (2007) points out, the opening of alternative high-wage jobs does not necessarily imply declining
teacher quality; in a Roy model, it would depend on comparative advantage in different occupations and the correlation
of a worker’s skills in different occupations.
     15
        None of the countries participated in both rounds of PIAAC.
     16
        This includes school principals who teach, but excludes other workers at school with non-teaching occupations.

                                                             8
vocational school teachers since the vast majority of PISA students (15-year-olds) are still in

secondary school and have therefore not been taught by these types of teachers. We also exclude

pre-kindergarten teachers as it is unclear whether they contribute to teaching students reading and

math and because the role of this teacher group depends directly on the institutional structures of

individual countries. Results are, however, very similar if we include pre-kindergarten teachers in

the sample.

     PIAAC does not allow us to identify the subject that a teacher is teaching, so we rely on

measures of numeracy and literacy skills covering all teachers tested in PIAAC in each country. 17

We focus on the country-level median of the teacher cognitive skills because the median is more

robust to outliers than the mean, 18 something that is potentially relevant in smaller samples. 19 We

weight individual-level observations with inverse sampling probabilities when computing country-

specific teacher cognitive skills.

     Table 1 reports summary statistics of the teacher cognitive skills in the 31 countries and in the

pooled sample. 20 The number of teachers in the national PIAAC samples ranges from 106 teachers

in Chile to 834 teachers in Canada, with 207 teachers per country on average. (The sample size for

Canada is substantially larger than for any other country surveyed in PIAAC because Canada

oversampled in order to obtain regionally representative adult skills). Teachers in Finland and Japan

perform best in both numeracy and literacy, while teachers in Chile and Turkey perform worst in

both domains.

     The mean scores in the full PIAAC sample are 259 points in numeracy and 268 points in




      17
         The domain-specific skills of teachers provided in PIAAC differ from subject-matter knowledge in math and
reading. However, the PIAAC measures are good proxies for subject-specific knowledge as indicated by the fixed
effects results, the cross-subjects results, and the placebo tests using teachers’ information and communication
technology (ICT) skills; see Section 5.
      18
         The country-level correlation between teacher median skills and mean skills is 0.98 for both numeracy and
literacy. Moreover, all results are robust to using mean teacher skills instead of median teacher skills.
      19
         Due to the limited size of our teacher samples, we focus on the effect of median teacher skills and not other
moments of the distribution in the main analysis. Considering within-country distributions, however, has no qualitative
impact on the results; see footnotes 34 and 36.
      20
         From the 33 countries participating in PIAAC, we exclude Cyprus (which did not participate in PISA) and
Indonesia (where the PIAAC survey was administered only to the population in Jakarta).

                                                             9
literacy. (PIAAC measures each of the skill domains on a 500-point scale.) The range of median

teacher numeracy skills across countries is 55 points, which amounts to one international

individual-level standard deviation (55 points) in the full PIAAC sample; in literacy, the range of

median teacher skills of 60 points even exceeds one individual-level standard deviation (50 points).

Teachers in the United States (284 points) perform worse than the sample-wide average teacher in

numeracy (292 points) but are slightly above the international mean in literacy (301 points vs. 295

points). Interestingly, the country ranking and the cross-country variation in teacher cognitive skills

are similar to those of all prime-aged workers with full-time employment (see Table 1 in Hanushek

et al. (2015)). Also note that teacher numeracy skills are higher than teacher literacy skills in some

countries, while the reverse is true in other countries. We will exploit this variation in domain-

specific teacher skills in the fixed-effects model that uses only variation within countries and

between subjects (see Section 5.2). Furthermore, both numeracy and literacy skills of teachers are

completely unrelated to the number of teachers in the national PIAAC samples. For the econometric

analysis, we standardize the teacher cognitive skills, separately for each domain, across the 31

countries to have mean zero and standard deviation one.

    Figure 1 illustrates the international variation in teacher cognitive skills. The figure arrays the

median teacher numeracy and literacy skills across countries against the skills of adults in different

educational groups within Canada, the country with the largest sample. The literacy skills of the

lowest-performing teachers (in Turkey and Chile) are well below the literacy skills of employed

Canadian adults with only a vocational degree (278 points). Teachers in Italy, Russia, and Israel

perform at the level of vocationally-educated Canadians. Teachers in the Netherlands and Sweden

have skill levels similar to Canadian adults with a bachelor degree (306 points). The literacy skills

of the best-performing teachers (in Japan and Finland) are higher than those of Canadian adults with

a master or doctoral degree (314 points). These comparisons, which look similar for numeracy

skills, underscore the vast differences in teacher cognitive skills across developed countries.

    Variations in teacher cognitive skills reflect both where teachers are drawn from the country’s


                                                     10
skill distribution and where a country’s overall cognitive-skill level falls in the world distribution.

As most teachers have obtained a college degree (89 percent across all PIAAC countries), we

expect teacher cognitive skills to fall above the country’s median. Across all 31 countries, median

teacher skills fall at the 68th (71st) percentile of the numeracy (literacy) skill distribution of all

adults, ranging from the 53rd to the 81st percentile (see Table 1).

    Figure 2 compares teacher cognitive skills with the skills of just college graduates in a country.

While median teacher cognitive skills fall near the middle of the 25th–75th percentile skill range of

cognitive skills of college graduates in most countries, teachers come from the upper part of the

college skill distribution in some countries (e.g., Finland, Singapore, Ireland, and Chile) and from

the lower part in others (e.g., Austria, Denmark, the Slovak Republic, and Poland).

    From Table 1, teachers in Chile, France, Spain, and Turkey are drawn highest up in the country

distributions of adult skills in numeracy and literacy. Although Finnish teachers are drawn from a

somewhat lower part of the country’s overall skill distribution, they have substantially greater skills

than in Chile, France, Spain, and Turkey, reflecting the higher overall cognitive skill level in

Finland. Or, harkening back to the argument that 100% of teachers in Korea and Singapore come

from the top third of the academic cohort, the median Korean (Singaporean) teacher falls at the

72nd (72nd) percentile of the overall country distribution and at the 52nd (55th) percentile of the

college graduate distribution in numeracy (see also Figure 2). 21

    Because the PIAAC tests are new and have not been fully validated, we have compared the

PIAAC-based teacher cognitive skills with the numeracy and literacy skills of teachers in larger

national datasets for the United States and Germany. These comparisons, described in Electronic

Appendix B, support the overall validity of the estimates of teacher cognitive skills that are derived

from PIAAC.

3.2 Parent Cognitive Skills

    Because the parents of the PISA students (henceforth “PISA parents”) are not tested, we use the


    21
         This point about teacher skills was first made by Schleicher (2013).

                                                               11
PIAAC data to impute the numeracy and literacy skills of the PISA parents. We first construct a

sample of adult PIAAC participants that could in principle be PISA parents. We then develop a

prediction model for adult numeracy and literacy skills in this “PISA-parents sample” based on

common observable characteristics that appear in both PIAAC and PISA. Specifically, separately

by country, we regress the numeracy/literacy skills of PIAAC adults aged 35–59 with children (i.e.,

17–44 years old when PISA students were born) on three characteristics: gender, education (3

categories), and number of books at home (6 categories). 22 The estimated coefficients from this are

combined with the same three characteristics for the PISA parents in order to predict

numeracy/literacy skills of each PISA parent at the individual family level. In the student-level

analysis, we use the maximum skills of mother and father as a proxy for parent cognitive skills,

although results are very similar if the average skill of mother and father is used instead.

     Although the PIAAC-based parent skills are only coarse proxies for the true skills of PISA

parents, controlling for the estimated cognitive-skill level of parents allows us to tackle several

issues. First, since originally studied in the Coleman Report (Coleman et al. (1966)), it has been

clear that family background and education in the home are important. Using parental cognitive

skills adds a qualitative dimension to family influences over and above commonly employed

measures of the student’s family background. More generally, student performance likely persists

across generations, for example, because the quality of the education system or the valuation of

education changes only slowly over time. Second, adding information about parent cognitive skills

provides one way of separating teacher cognitive skills from the skills of the country’s overall

population.

     Table EA-1 in the Electronic Appendix presents summary statistics of parent skills in numeracy

and literacy by country. Similar to teacher cognitive skills, parent cognitive skills differ greatly

across countries, ranging (in numeracy) from 223 points in Chile to 308 points in Japan. Also,



     22
        We compute skills separately for mothers and fathers because numeracy/literacy skills might differ across
gender. By predicting gender-specific skills, PISA students with single mothers, for example, are assigned only the skill
level of women and not the average skill level of men and women.

                                                             12
parent skills differ substantially within countries. On average, the difference between the minimum

and maximum numeracy skill in a country is 115 points, or more than twice the international

individual-level standard deviation.



3.3 Student Performance and Further Control Variables

     International data on student performance come from the Programme for International Student

Assessment (PISA), conducted by the OECD. 23 PISA is a triennial survey that tests math and

reading competencies of nationally representative samples of 15-year-old students, an age at which

students in most countries are approaching the end of compulsory schooling. We use the two PISA

cycles of 2009 and 2012 because the students have largely been taught by the teacher cohorts tested

between 2011 and 2015 in PIAAC. 24

     Student performance in math and reading differs widely across countries. Given that the

learning progress in one school year is about 40 PISA points, the difference between the USA and

Singapore is about two school years in math. The math performance gap is about three school years

between Singapore and Turkey and almost four years between Singapore and Chile. International

student performance differences in reading are less pronounced but still substantial.

     Summary statistics for student performance and student characteristics are reported in Table

EA-2; summary statistics for parent characteristics (e.g., number of books at home and highest

educational degree) in Table EA-3; summary statistics for school characteristics (e.g., weekly

instructional time for language classes and math classes) in Table EA-4; and summary statistics for



     23
        We rely on the PISA assessments instead of the alternative international test of Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study, or TIMSS (see Hanushek and Woessmann (2011)). PISA covers more PIAAC
countries, and students participating in PISA were tested in both math and reading, while TIMSS only assessed math
(and science) performance. Note, however, that math scores from TIMSS are strongly correlated with math scores from
PISA at the country level. For a description of the PISA assessments, see OECD (2010b).
     24
         There is some disconnect in the timing of the measurement of teacher cognitive skills and when the teachers
who are responsible for the performance of the 15-year-old PISA students actually taught them. The disconnect likely
adds measurement error in teacher cognitive skills, which leads to a downward bias in the estimated teacher effects.
While the matching of PIAAC teachers to PISA students is certainly not perfect, we assume some stability in teacher
skills across adjacent age cohorts. Furthermore, there is still a large overlap of teachers in PIAAC and those who taught
the PISA students since only a small fraction of teachers retires during a 10-year period and gets replaced by new,
young teachers.

                                                              13
country characteristics (e.g., cumulative educational expenditure per student) in Table EA-5.

      For the econometric analysis, we standardize student test scores at the student level separately

for each subject across the 31 countries and the two PISA assessments to have mean zero and

standard deviation one. As we are interested in differences across countries, each country receives

the same total weight in each PISA cycle.

4.         Estimation Strategy

      If we observed the skills of the individual teachers who teach the students tested in PISA, we

would estimate the following education production function:

(1)             𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜆𝜆𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑭𝑭𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷1 + 𝑺𝑺𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝜷𝜷2 + 𝑪𝑪𝑐𝑐 𝜷𝜷3 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑰𝑰𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 𝜸𝜸2 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

                where:                     𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 + 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 + 𝜋𝜋𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 + 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

Aiksc denotes the test score of student i in subject k (math or reading) in school s in country c. 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

represents the cognitive skills of student i’s teacher in subject k; the parameter λ is the focus of our

attention. Fisc is a vector of student-level variables measuring student and family background, 𝑺𝑺𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is

a vector of school-level characteristics, and 𝑪𝑪𝑐𝑐 is a vector of country-level control variables. Piksc

contains student-level estimates of parents’ numeracy and literacy skills, respectively, and

𝑰𝑰𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 contains school-level variables measuring the shortage of qualified teachers and weekly

instructional time in math and language classes. 25 Finally, the error term, ε iksc , is comprised of the

following (unobserved) components: a school-subject-specific selection term due both to student

selection into schools and classrooms and to administrative assignment to schools and classrooms,

𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 ; general unmeasured differences between countries not captured by the included country-level

control variables, 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 ; unmeasured country differences that are subject-specific, 𝜋𝜋𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 ; and an

idiosyncratic error term, 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

            The consistency of the estimates of λ depends on the usual condition that:



      25
        See Tables EA1–EA5 for country-specific descriptive statistics of student, parent, school, and country variables
included in our regression model. Note that the shortage of teachers is not meant to capture differences in teacher skills
but rather to reflect that classes may have to be skipped because there are simply not enough teachers in the school.

                                                                             14
                                                         (
                                                      E ε T , F , S , C , P, I ) = 0 .

 This might fail due to omitted variables correlated with both student performance and teacher

 skills. For instance, 𝜆𝜆 would be biased upward if highly educated parents select schools or

 classrooms with higher-skilled teachers and also foster their children’s learning in other ways.

 Similarly, student sorting across or within schools would lead to upward biased estimates if students

 with high (unobserved) academic ability are more likely to attend schools or classrooms with

 highly skilled teachers.

      However, we measure teacher cognitive skills only at the country level, leading to the

following baseline OLS model:

(2)          𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜆𝜆𝑇𝑇�𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 + 𝑭𝑭𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷1 + 𝑺𝑺𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝜷𝜷2 + 𝑪𝑪𝑐𝑐 𝜷𝜷3 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑰𝑰𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 𝜸𝜸2 + 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

         where:             𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 + 𝜋𝜋𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 + 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

Here, the cognitive skills of student i’s teacher (𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) from Equation 1 are replaced by the median

(subject-specific) teacher skills in country c (𝑇𝑇�𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 ). In contrast to micro-level analyses using skills of

individual teachers, sorting of students and teachers across and within schools is not an issue in our

setting since teacher cognitive skills are aggregated to the country level. Therefore, using

aggregated teacher skills eliminates the unobserved student sorting component, 𝜇𝜇𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 , from the error

term. However, the estimated coefficient on teacher skills might still be biased because of omitted

country-level variables correlated with both teacher skills and student performance, such as the

educational attitude in a country: Societies that emphasize the importance of good education may

have both teachers with high cognitive skills and parents who support their children’s education.

      To avoid bias due to omitted variables that do not vary across subjects, we exploit the fact that

both students and teachers were tested in two subjects and ask whether differences in teacher

cognitive skills between numeracy and literacy are systematically related to differences in student

performance between math and reading. Thus, we identify the effect of teacher cognitive skills




                                                                         15
based only on variation between teacher numeracy and literacy skills within the same student. 26 The

within-student model is derived by subtracting the OLS model for reading (Equation 3) from the

OLS model for math (Equation 4):



(3)            𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜆𝜆𝑇𝑇�𝑐𝑐,𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 + 𝑭𝑭𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷1 + 𝑺𝑺𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝜷𝜷2 + 𝑪𝑪𝑐𝑐 𝜷𝜷3 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙

               +𝑰𝑰𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝜸𝜸2 + 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟

(4)            𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚ℎ = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜆𝜆𝑇𝑇�𝑐𝑐,𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 + 𝑭𝑭𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷1 + 𝑺𝑺𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝜷𝜷2 + 𝑪𝑪𝑐𝑐 𝜷𝜷3 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛

               +𝑰𝑰𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚ℎ 𝜸𝜸2 + 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚ℎ .

      This yields the following within-student across-subject model that eliminates any non-subject-

specific differences across students (𝑭𝑭𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ), schools (𝑺𝑺𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ), and countries (observed factors, 𝑪𝑪𝒄𝒄 , and

unobserved factors, 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 ):

(5)       𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚ℎ − 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = 𝜆𝜆�𝑇𝑇�𝑐𝑐,𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 − 𝑇𝑇�𝑐𝑐,𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 �

               +𝛾𝛾1 �𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 − 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑐𝑐𝑦𝑦 � + �𝑰𝑰𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚ℎ − 𝑰𝑰𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 �𝛾𝛾2 + �𝜐𝜐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚ℎ − 𝜐𝜐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 �,

      where:                     𝜐𝜐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑘𝑘 = 𝜋𝜋𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 + 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

      This model – which is equivalent to pooling math and reading and including student fixed

effects – is based on several assumptions. Most importantly, it assumes that the effect of teacher

numeracy skills on student math performance is the same as the effect of teacher literacy skills on

student reading performance. Our data provide support for this assumption as the OLS estimate on

teacher numeracy skills is not significantly different from the OLS estimate on teacher literacy

skills (p-value = 0.11; see Columns 3 and 6 in Table 2). Another assumption of the within-student

model is that any covariate that does not differ across subjects has the same relationship with

student reading performance as with math performance. This assumption also does not appear to be

critical, because the coefficient on teacher cognitive skills does not change in the student fixed-

effects model when we allow for subject-specific impacts of all covariates (results available upon


     26
        Within-student across-subject variation has frequently been used in previous research (e.g., Dee (2005, (2007),
Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor (2010), Lavy (2015), and Bietenbeck, Piopiunik, and Wiederhold (2017)).

                                                                                    16
request). 27

     We assume that, conditional on the measured individual, school, and country factors, the

differences between math and reading at the country level are random. 28 These differences

presumably relate to historical country factors such as the pattern of language development or the

historical development of industries and the economy. While difficult to validate, we pursue a

variety of approaches designed to uncover significant violations of the key underlying assumption

that achievement differences are not simply driven by country patterns in adult competencies.

     While the student fixed-effects model accounts for all factors that do not differ between

subjects, unobserved differences across countries that are subject-specific (𝜋𝜋𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 in the error term)

remain a potential confounding factor. For example, if societies have both teachers with high

numeracy skills and a strong preference for advancing children in math (with parents supporting

their children accordingly), the student fixed-effects estimates of teacher cognitive skills will still be

biased. In Section 5.4, we provide a series of placebo tests and falsification checks, all of which

suggest that our teacher-skill estimates do not simply reflect omitted subject-specific factors and

that they are not driven by overall population differences in skills. We also address the key issue of

separating the impact of teacher skills from the impact of general skills of parents and adults in the

country (that might reflect institutions, culture, or other factors). 29

5.        Teacher Cognitive Skills and Student Performance

     It is easiest to motivate the analysis with simple visual evidence showing that teacher cognitive

skills are positively associated with student performance aggregated to the country level. The two



     27
         In contrast to the OLS estimates, the estimated effect of teacher cognitive skills in the student fixed-effects
model is “net” of teacher skill spillovers across subjects (for example, if teacher literacy skills affect student math
performance). Spillover effects are completely eliminated when cross-subject spillovers are identical in math and
reading.
      28
         Supporting this assumption, we find only very low correlations (all magnitudes smaller than 0.1) between the
teacher numeracy-literacy skill difference and the following country-level factors: teacher wage premium (see Section
6.2), teacher wage level, share of female teachers, and GDP per capita.
      29
         If aggregate school systems differ in systematic ways that increase both teacher cognitive skills and student
performance (e.g., a more demanding curriculum), both the OLS estimates and, in case of subject-specific differences,
the fixed-effects estimates might be biased. While we cannot directly address this issue, it is reassuring that the pattern
of results is robust in various country subsamples with more homogenous quality of educational institutions (see
Section 5.3 for details).

                                                               17
upper graphs in Figure 3 show the unconditional cross-country relationship between teacher

numeracy skills and student math performance (left panel) and between teacher literacy skills and

student reading performance (right panel). Both numeracy and literacy skills of teachers are clearly

positively associated with aggregate student performance. The two middle graphs control for the

country-specific skills of all adults aged 25–65 to net out the skill persistence across generations. 30

The coefficient on teacher numeracy skills is reduced only modestly, while the coefficient on

teacher literacy skills even increases. In the two bottom graphs, we control for all covariates of the

baseline OLS specifications (see Table 2 below). While this reduces the teacher-skill estimates, they

are still strongly positively associated with student performance.

     As expected, the skill level of all adults (aged 25–65) is also strongly positively related to

student performance (Figure A-1 in the Appendix). However, when controlling for teacher

cognitive skills, the estimates for adult skills substantially decrease in size and lose statistical

significance. Below, we show that this aggregate pattern is found in the micro estimates, i.e., the

relationship between teacher skills and student performance is not just driven by the overall

achievement levels in the country.

5.1 Ordinary Least Squares Results

     Table 2 presents our estimates of the relationship between teacher cognitive skills and student

performance using student-level test-score data. 31 The unconditional relationship between teacher

numeracy skills and individual-level student math performance (Column 1) is identical to the

country-level estimate in the upper panel in Figure 3. The coefficient on teacher numeracy skills


     30
          The country-level correlations between teacher skills and adult skills are 0.77 for numeracy and 0.86 for
literacy. Skills of teachers and adults are substantially correlated since both have been educated in the same education
system at about the same time.
       31
          Throughout, we cluster standard errors at the country level because teacher skills do not vary within countries.
Recent research has shown that clustered standard errors can be biased downward in samples with a small number of
clusters (e.g., Donald and Lang (2007), Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008), Angrist and Pischke (2009), and Imbens
and Kolesar (2012)). Although there is no widely accepted threshold when the number of clusters is “small,” the work
of Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008), Angrist and Pischke (2009), and Harden (2011) suggests a cutoff of around 40
clusters. To check whether clustering in our cross-country sample with just 31 clusters produces misleading inferences,
we use the wild cluster bootstrap procedure suggested by Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008) for improved inference
with few clusters (using Stata’s cgmwildboot command for implementation). Results remain robust when employing the
wild bootstrap procedure as an alternative to clustering. We do not make any separate correction for the fact that parent
skill is a generated regressor and that this prior estimation might affect the estimated standard errors (Pagan (1984)).

                                                              18
remains significant when adding a large set of background factors at the individual, family, school,

and country level (Column 2) and when including the numeracy skills of parents of PISA students

(Column 3). 32 The estimate in Column 3 implies that a one SD increase in teacher numeracy skills

increases student math performance by almost 0.15 SD. Parent numeracy skills are also

significantly related to student performance. The coefficient is rather modest in size compared to

teacher cognitive skills, but prior research does not provide any way of making direct comparisons.

Importantly, this does not imply that parents have limited impacts. First, the models include a larger

set of measures of family background. Second, parent skills might suffer from more measurement

error than teacher skills because parent skills are based on information from student reporting of

family background.

     Columns 4–6 report results for reading. Teacher literacy skills are highly statistically

significant across specifications, although the point estimate is somewhat smaller than the

coefficient on teacher numeracy skills in the specification with all controls (0.09; see Column 6).

Notably, when accounting for student characteristics and family influences (Columns 2 and 5), the

point estimates of teacher skills decreases considerably more in reading than in math, suggesting

that parents are more important for improving their children’s reading abilities than their math

performance. 33 Nonetheless, the difference in the math and reading coefficients for teacher skills is

not statistically significant.

     We find some evidence for heterogeneity of the teacher-skill effect across student subgroups

(Table EA-7). The impact of teacher skills is somewhat larger for girls than for boys, for low-SES

students compared to high-SES students (particularly in reading), and for natives relative to

migrants (particularly in math). 34 Parent cognitive skills are considerably more important for high-


     32
        Coefficients on the other control variables are reported in Table EA-6. All coefficients have the expected signs.
Regarding the country-level characteristics, we observe a zero coefficient on educational expenditure per student, while
school starting age is positively related to student performance.
     33
        Allowing the impact of student characteristics to differ across countries (by interacting the student
characteristics with country dummies) does not significantly change the coefficient on teacher skills.
     34
        Socioeconomic status (SES) is measured by the PISA index of economic, social, and cultural status (ESCS).
Because first-generation migrants might have migrated to the PISA test country just shortly before the PISA test, we
cannot ascribe their math and reading performance to the skill level of teachers in the test country. Therefore, we use

                                                              19
SES students, but there are no differences by student gender or migration status. 35

     To gauge the magnitude of our estimates, we use the OLS coefficients to simulate the improved

student performance if each country brought its teachers up to the cognitive-skill level of Finnish

teachers, the highest skilled in our sample (Table 3). (This simulation exercise assumes that we

have identified a causal effect of teacher cognitive skills.) For Japan, this is not a huge change, yet

even Japanese students would improve somewhat (0.06 SD in math and 0.02 SD in reading). But

for others, the improvements in student performance would be substantial. U.S. students would be

expected to improve by roughly 0.33 SD in math; students in Turkey and Chile, being at the bottom

of the international league table, would be expected to improve by about 0.54 SD and 0.57 SD,

respectively, in math.

     How much would the international differences in student achievement be reduced by improving

teacher cognitive skills to the Finnish level? For our 31 countries, the country-level SD of mean

PISA scores is 29.3 for math and 21.9 for reading. The simulations in Table 3 imply that bringing

teachers in each country to the Finnish level would reduce the country dispersion to 22.1 in math

and 15.9 in reading – roughly a reduction by one quarter in each domain.

     Of course, moving to the level of Finland is likely to be unrealistic in the short run for many

countries. For example, Turkey would have to draw its median teacher from the 97th percentile of

the college numeracy distribution instead of the 53rd percentile that it now does (see Table A-1 in

the Appendix). For numeracy, nine of the 31 countries would have to increase the place from which

the median teacher is drawn by more than 30 percentiles of the distribution of college graduates; for

literacy, ten countries would need to move up that far. 36 The U.S. would need to get its median



only second-generation migrants when estimating teacher-skill effects for migrants, since these students were born in
the PISA test country and have spent their school career in the education system of that country.
      35
         We also considered possible heterogeneous impacts of teachers at different parts of the distribution, modeled
crudely by including the variance in teacher skills within each country. The variance of teacher skills is statistically
insignificant in the student achievement model, and the (median) teacher skills estimates are unaffected. However,
because of the small teacher samples, we are concerned that we do not have a good description of the distribution of
teacher skills in each country. Interpretation is also clouded by the possibility that a larger variance of teacher skills
implies greater measurement error at the individual student level.
      36
         In numeracy, greater than a 30 percentile change to meet Finland teachers is required in Chile, Estonia, Israel,
Italy, Korea, Poland, Russian Federation, Spain, and Turkey. In literacy, greater than a 30 percentile change to meet

                                                               20
math (reading) teacher from the 74th (71st) percentile instead of the current 47th (51st) percentile.

     To understand the magnitude of the estimated impact of teacher skills, it is important to note

that the teacher-skill estimates do not capture the effect of just one school year but rather reflect the

cumulative effect of teacher cognitive skills on student performance over the first ten school years.

Thus, these projections are long-run impacts that presume that the quality of students’ teachers

across the first ten grades would improve to the level of Finland.

5.2 Student Fixed-Effects Results

     While the previous section has shown that teacher cognitive skills are significantly related to

student performance in both math and reading, the possibility of country-specific omitted variables

remains. Therefore, we now exploit only within-country variation to identify the effect of teacher

cognitive skills on student performance, eliminating any non-subject-specific bias.

     Again, the overall story is easy to see in a simple diagram. Aggregating student performance to

the country level, Figure 4 shows that differences in teacher cognitive skills between numeracy and

literacy are systematically related to differences in student performance between the same two

subjects.

     Table 4 presents the results of the student fixed-effects specifications using student-level test

score data. Here, all control variables that differ across subjects are included in first differences,

while all factors common to the two subjects drop out. Across specifications, the student fixed-

effects estimates for teacher cognitive skills of 0.11 remain sizeable 37 and close to the OLS

coefficients on teacher numeracy and literacy skills. 38 While neither parent cognitive skills nor

teacher shortages (which differ by subject) are significantly related to student performance in the




Finland teachers is required in Austria, Chile, Denmark, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Russian Federation, Slovak Republic,
Slovenia, and Turkey.
      37
         Replacing median teacher cognitive skills with alternative measures at other parts of the skill distribution, such
as the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile, or with the fraction of teachers whose numeracy skills exceed their
literacy skills, also yields a positive relationship with student performance.
      38
         Using the Stata command suest, we find that the coefficient on teacher cognitive skills from the student fixed-
effects model is not statistically significantly different from the OLS coefficients (p-value = 0.40 in math and p-value =
0.78 in reading). The comparisons refer to the full-control specifications (i.e., Column 3 of Table 4 and Columns 3 and
6 of Table 2).

                                                               21
student fixed-effects models, the effect of instructional time on student performance is significant

and similar to the effect size in Lavy (2015). 39

     These results, which are not subject to the same potential biases as the previous OLS estimates,

strongly support the role of teacher skills. Moreover, the consistency across estimation approaches

in magnitude and significance is notable.

5.3 Robustness Checks

     In this section, we show that our results are robust to controlling for country-level skill

differences in various ways, to including additional country-level controls, and to using different

country subsamples.

     Overall Country-Level Skill Differences

     One concern in the previous models is that the estimated impacts of teacher cognitive skills

may reflect subject-specific country differences. In Table 5, we therefore additionally control for

the country’s cognitive-skill level of parents and of all adults to account for countries’ potential

subject preference or other subject-related differences (for comparison, Columns 1 and 4 present the

baseline models). 40 Adding these cognitive-skill levels does not substantially weaken the impact of

teachers’ cognitive skills on student performance (see Columns 2 and 3 for math and Columns 5

and 6 reading)..

     Teacher cognitive skills reflect both a country’s overall cognitive-skill level and where teachers

are drawn from the country’s skill distribution. In alternative estimation, holding constant the skill

level of adults, students perform better in countries where teachers are drawn from further up the

cognitive skill distribution (Table EA-8). This provides additional evidence that the estimates on

teacher cognitive skills are not driven merely by international differences in overall cognitive skills.

It matters from where in the pool of potential teachers countries draw their teachers.




     39
        Lavy (2015) exploits within-student between-subject variation using PISA data from 2006.
     40
        The country-specific adult skills are measured by the median skill level of all adults aged 25–65. The country-
level parent cognitive skills are measured by the median skills of all PIAAC respondents aged 35–59 with children (i.e.,
the same PIAAC respondents used to construct the individual-level parent skills).

                                                             22
     Controlling for Additional Country-Level Factors

     Teachers’ subject-specific cognitive skills might be correlated with their subject-specific

pedagogical skills, implying that the estimated coefficient on teacher skills might partially pick up

the impact of pedagogical skills. Using information from the PISA students about their teachers’

activities in language and math classes, we construct indicators of subject-specific instructional

activities as proxies for teachers’ pedagogical skills (see Electronic Appendix A). Controlling for

the instructional practices in math and language classes does not affect the teacher-skill estimates,

which supports the independent impact of teacher cognitive skills on student performance. 41

     Moreover, the estimates on teacher cognitive skills remain significant when controlling for

GDP per capita (as a measure of a country’s state of development) and central exit exams

(reflecting a student performance-enhancing institution).

     Country Subsamples

     The teacher-skill effect holds across different subsamples (Table EA-10). To address divergent

cultures (especially differing educational attitudes), we include continental fixed effects (and

alternatively restrict the analysis to just European countries). Furthermore, we exclude ex-

communist countries (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, the Slovak Republic,

and Slovenia) and Turkey, where occupational choices were less driven historically by market

incentives and often depended on political attitudes. Finally, we use only countries with larger

teacher PIAAC samples, where measurement error in country-level teacher cognitive skills is likely

smaller. 42 The teacher-skill coefficient is similar in all these alternative specifications, lying within

the 95% confidence interval of the baseline estimate.

     Moreover, using the baseline OLS specification with all control variables, excluding each




     41
         See Table EA-9 for the results when controlling for instructional practices and for the other country factors
described below.
      42
         Measurement error generally has a more severe impact in fixed effects models. When applying the same sample
restriction in the student fixed-effects model, the coefficient on teacher cognitive skills increases somewhat, suggesting
that using only countries with larger teacher PIAAC samples likely reduces measurement error in the subject
differences of teacher cognitive skills.

                                                              23
country individually from the sample yields teacher-skill estimates that are always very close to the

baseline coefficients, indicating that results are not driven by any individual country (results not

shown).

5.4 Placebo Tests and Falsification Checks

    Placebo Tests

    While the teacher-skill estimates remain statistically significant and vary little across

specifications and estimation methods, it is clearly difficult to guard against all possible omitted

country-level factors that could bias the results. We specifically remain concerned that student

performance is positively related to adult skills simply because countries with high adult skills also

have teachers with high skills.

    Therefore, we perform various placebo tests, all of which indicate that our estimates reflect the

impact of teacher cognitive skills and not just those of the society in general.

    In the first placebo test, we replace teacher cognitive skills with the cognitive-skill level of

workers in occupations other than teaching. For this analysis, we use all occupations with at least

100 observations on average across PIAAC countries, resulting in 14 occupations that cover the full

range of a country’s occupational distribution (e.g., managers, scientists and engineers, health

professionals, business professionals, clerks, sales workers, service workers). To address the

concern that skills of workers in these other occupations simply capture the overall skill level of a

country, we control for the cognitive-skill level of adults. (Note that we do not control for adult

skills in the student fixed-effects model because general skill differences across countries – as well

as all other subject-invariant differences – are already accounted for.)

    Figure 5 depicts the estimated coefficients on the cognitive skill-levels of workers in each of

the other occupations. For comparison, the vertical dashed lines indicate the estimated impacts of

teacher cognitive skills. The left and middle graphs show the OLS results. Student performance in

math (reading) is significantly positively related to the skills of workers in only one occupation (two

occupations). Moreover, out of the 28 OLS coefficients on numeracy and literacy skills, only one


                                                     24
coefficient is larger than the respective estimate on teacher skills.

     The right graph of Figure 5 presents the student fixed-effects estimates on the cognitive-skill

level in other occupations. While three coefficients are statistically significant, the skill level in only

one occupation – health workers – is more strongly related to student performance than are teacher

cognitive skills. Importantly, from the OLS models in the other two panels, the cognitive skills of

health workers are actually negatively related to student math and student reading performance.

Overall, there is no occupation other than teaching whose skill level is systematically related to

student performance across the OLS and student fixed-effects models. 43

     In a second placebo test, we replace teacher skills by the skill level of a randomly chosen

sample of adults matched by age, gender, and educational distribution to the teacher sample in each

country and having the same sample size as the country-specific teacher sample. In each country,

we draw 100 samples of matched “teacher twins”, thus comparing 100 coefficients with the

estimate for teacher cognitive skills. Figure 6 shows histograms of estimated student impacts (with

the dashed line again showing the estimated coefficient for the actual sample of teachers). Only 9%

of the numeracy-skill estimates, 1% of the literacy-skill estimates, and 2% of the student fixed-

effects estimates exceed the respective estimate on teacher cognitive skills. Importantly, none of the

100 samples of teacher twins produces consistently larger skill coefficients than teachers in all three

models. Thus, both placebo tests provide strong evidence that the estimates on teacher cognitive

skills are not systematically biased by unobserved country-level skill differences.

     Falsification Checks

     We also investigate cross-subject effects, i.e., the effect of teachers’ numeracy skills on student

reading performance and the effect of teacher literacy skills on student math performance. If it is

subject-matter skills that are important, as we have assumed, teacher skills in one subject would be




     43
         Additionally, we estimate specifications that include teacher cognitive skills and simultaneously the cognitive
skill levels in all 14 other occupations. In these horse-race-type models, teaching is the only occupation that is
significantly positively related to student performance in both OLS and student fixed effects (results available on
request).

                                                              25
only weakly related – if at all – to student performance in the other subject. (A positive relationship

may arise due to cross-subject spillover effects, that is, higher literacy skills make teachers also

better at teaching math and vice versa.)

     This estimation supports the importance of subject-specific skills (Table A-2). Teacher

numeracy skills have a substantially larger association with student math performance than with

student reading performance. Similarly, teacher literacy skills are more important for student

reading performance than for student math performance once we account for general country-level

differences in adult skills. The most convincing evidence comes from simultaneously including

teacher numeracy and literacy skills. Here, teacher skills in either subject only affect student

performance in the same subject; teacher skills in the other subject are always close to zero and

statistically insignificant.

     In a final falsification check, we use the measure of teachers’ ICT skills, the third skill domain

tested in PIAAC, instead of teacher skills in numeracy or literacy (Table A-3). Conditioning on the

overall skill level in the country, we find that teacher ICT skills are not significantly related to

student performance in either math or reading. (However, note that standard errors are larger for

teacher ICT skills than for teacher numeracy or literacy skills; see Table 2.) Thus, it is the subject-

specific skills of teachers that affect student performance (in the same subject), and not simply

general differences in teacher quality across countries.

6.    Determinants of Teacher Cognitive Skills

     International differences in teacher cognitive skills reflect both where teachers are drawn from

each country’s skill distribution and the overall skill level of each country’s population – and

policies to improve the skills of teachers could conceptually focus on either of these dimensions.

Increasing the overall skill level of a country’s population would of course be both desirable and

self-reinforcing through improving the pool of potential teachers. Nonetheless, potential overall

population improvement policies, while widely discussed elsewhere, are beyond the scope of this

analysis.


                                                      26
     We instead focus on the determinants of where teachers are drawn from the overall skill

distribution of the population, which has received relatively little and narrow attention. Our

international data permit a much broader investigation of how external forces and policy choices

affect the skills of the teaching force and ultimately student outcomes.

6.1 Alternative Professional Opportunities for Women

     We first investigate whether teacher skills are affected by competition from other occupations

that demand high skills. To do so, we explore changes in alternative job opportunities for women

over time. 44 In the spirit of Bacolod (2007), we relate within-country changes in labor-market

choices of females to changes in teacher cognitive skills across birth cohorts. The underlying idea is

that historically women have been segregated into a constrained set of occupations, one of which is

teaching. While the causes of segregation are not well-tested, the empirical reality is that women

previously were much more concentrated in teaching than they generally are today (see Bergmann

(1974), Temin (2002), Lakdawalla (2006)).

     Our analysis, however, differs from Bacolod (2007) in two key ways. First, we explicitly

consider the human capital intensity of alternative occupations, rather than relying on relative

average wages in teaching and elsewhere. Second, we observe multiple countries, which

dramatically expands the range of observations and permits accounting for any general (i.e., non-

country-specific) time trends that affect both female labor-market participation and teacher skills.

For example, the teaching profession might have become less attractive relative to other high-skill

occupations over time, explaining both an increasing share of females in other high-skill

occupations and a decline in average teacher skills.

     To measure women’s access to high-skill occupations, we compute the proportion of female

teachers relative to the number of females in all high-skill occupations. Using the PIAAC micro




     44
        We focus on labor market opportunities for women because they constitute the majority in the teacher
workforce. Across the 23 countries used in the analysis below, more than two-thirds (69 percent) of teachers are female,
ranging from 59 percent in Japan to 79 percent in Austria. Note that the gender composition of the teacher sample does
not affect the numeracy-literacy skill gap (r = -0.06 in the 23 country sample and r = -0.1 in the full sample).

                                                             27
data, we determine “high-skill” occupations empirically in each country. First, we calculate the

average years of schooling of employees working in each two-digit occupation at the time of the

PIAAC assessment. 45 Second, ranking occupations in each country by average schooling level in

descending order, we define all occupations as “high-skill” until the top-ranked occupations

comprise 25 percent of all working males in the country. 46 To obtain groupings with sufficient

numbers of teachers, we combine 15 adjacent age cohorts. Since the PIAAC data cover 45 birth

years (excluding very young adults who mainly have not completed college education), this yields

three aggregated age cohorts in each of the 23 countries used in this analysis. 47

      To test whether a higher concentration of females in teaching is associated with higher

cognitive skills of teachers, we estimate the following model: 48

(6)           𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜇𝜇𝑎𝑎 + 𝜇𝜇𝑐𝑐 + 𝛾𝛾𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 + 𝜖𝜖𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 ,

where 𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 denotes median teacher skills in subject k in country c in age cohort a and 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is

the share of female teachers relative to all women working in high-skill occupations in country c in

aggregate age cohort a. We always include cohort fixed effects (𝜇𝜇𝑎𝑎 ) to control for general time

trends in women’s labor-market opportunities and for skill depreciation over the lifecycle.

Moreover, country fixed effects (𝜇𝜇𝑐𝑐 ) account for cross-country differences in women’s labor-market

participation and in average skill levels that are constant across birth cohorts. In some

specifications, we additionally control for the cognitive skills of nonteacher college graduates in the




      45
         There are no internationally comparable data that would allow computing these country-by-cohort-specific
shares on the basis of historical labor-market records.
      46
         Note that teaching is a high-skill occupation in every country in our sample. Applying an alternative
categorization that classifies all occupations contained in the one-digit ISCO codes 1 (Managers) and 2 (Professionals)
as high skill leads to qualitatively similar results. The 25-percent rule ensures that a similar share of workers is
employed in high-skill occupations in each country; other variants of defining high-skill occupations led to more
uneven shares of males working in high-skill occupations across countries.
      47
         Since our analysis uses only pseudo cohorts based on the cross-sectional PIAAC data, the validity of our results
depends on the assumption that women do not change the type of their occupation (high-skill vs. low-skilled; teacher
vs. nonteacher) in a systematic way over their careers. Furthermore, our approach assumes that the country-specific
pattern of skill depreciation across cohorts is similar for teachers and university graduates.
      48
         We exclude all ex-communist countries and Turkey since occupational choices in these countries were less
driven by market incentives but rather depended on political attitudes.

                                                                       28
respective country-cohort cell to account for country-specific skill depreciation (𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 ). 49

     For both numeracy and literacy, we find that more females working in teaching relative to other

high-skill occupations is significantly related to higher teacher cognitive skills (Table 6). 50 The

estimates are also economically meaningful. While somewhat smaller for literacy, an increase by 10

percentage points in the share of female teachers over all females working in high-skill occupations

is associated with a 0.36 SD increase in the numeracy skills of teachers. The average share of

female teachers over all females working in high-skill occupations across all three cohorts varies

between 17 percent in Chile (18 percent in the U.S.) and 38 percent in Singapore. Thus, if females

in the U.S. had similar employment choices and opportunities as in Singapore, average teacher

numeracy skills in the U.S. would be about 0.72 SD higher, bringing U.S. teachers to just above the

international average in teacher numeracy skills. Across all 23 countries in the sample, the share of

female teachers over all females working in high-skill occupations decreases from 29 percent in the

oldest age cohort (born in years 1946–1960) to 22 percent in the youngest cohort (born 1976–1990),

reflecting an international improvement of alternative job opportunities for women over time. This

is associated with an international decline in teacher numeracy skills by 0.25 SD.

6.2 Teacher Pay

     An obvious consideration in looking at the pattern of teacher skills is the pay of teachers. The

argument that teacher pay is significantly related to teacher quality has been in the heart of much of

the debate about educational policy for many years (see, e.g., Dolton and Marcenaro-Gutierrez

(2011)). The idea is that countries that pay teachers relatively better are able to recruit teachers from

higher up in the skill distribution and also are able to retain teachers in their profession. 51 If this link




     49
        Several studies suggest that losses of skills occur over the lifecycle (e.g., Cascio, Clark, and Gordon (2008);
Edin and Gustavsson (2008)), underlining the importance of controlling for skill depreciation.
     50
        Results are qualitatively similar when we use the skill level of female teachers as dependent variable.
     51
        Raising pay might also provide already-recruited teachers with more incentives to exert higher effort to improve
the educational outcomes of the children they teach. The evidence on effort effects is, however, not very strong; see
Springer et al. (2010). While much of the policy discussion of performance pay does not distinguish between the effort
margin and the selection-retention margin, it is the latter that seems more important. The international studies
effectively look at selection and retention, while within-country analyses almost always look just at effort; see
Woessmann (2011). For developing countries, the evidence on effort is stronger (see Muralidharan and Sundararaman

                                                             29
is present, there would be leverage for policymakers to raise the skills of teachers in the country by

paying them higher wages, with commensurate positive effects on student performance. 52

      To investigate the salary-skills relationship across countries, we first estimate whether ceteris

paribus teachers are paid a premium in the labor market. Using the individual-level PIAAC data, we

estimate a Mincer-type earnings equation with log earnings (ln y) regressed on gender (G), potential

work experience (E), achievement in numeracy and literacy (A), and a binary teacher indicator

(T): 53

(7)           ln 𝑦𝑦 = 𝑎𝑎0 + 𝑎𝑎1 𝐺𝐺 + 𝑎𝑎2 𝐸𝐸 + 𝑎𝑎3 𝐸𝐸 2 + 𝑨𝑨𝒂𝒂4 + 𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿 + 𝜀𝜀.

      The coefficient δ is the earnings premium (in percentage terms) for teachers given their

characteristics. We estimate a separate premium for each country, and we find a wide dispersion.

Figure 7 shows the estimated teacher premiums across countries, ranging from +45 percent in

Ireland to -22 percent in the United States and Sweden. 54 (Table EA-11 presents the detailed

regression output for each country). While there have been many discussions of the relative pay of

teachers in the United States (see Hanushek (2016)), most have ignored the possibility that teachers

are systematically different from college graduates working in other occupations (e.g., in terms of

cognitive skills and gender composition). Our estimates indicate that teachers are paid some 20

percent less than comparable college graduates elsewhere in the U.S. economy, that is, after

adjusting for observable characteristics.

      We now put teacher pay and teacher skills together by regressing cognitive skills of teachers (in




(2011)), but this might not generalize to the developed countries we analyze. Among other things, the very high rates of
teacher absenteeism in many developing countries indicates more room for improvement on the effort margin.
      52
         Another channel through which a positive association between teacher pay and teacher skills may materialize (at
least in the long run) is that higher salaries for teachers may improve the status of the teaching profession. As a result,
more children might want to become teachers in the future, facilitating the recruitment of more able individuals.
      53
         This approach follows Hanushek et al. (2015, (2017) in estimating an earnings function without years of
schooling, which is one of several inputs into cognitive skills. We use the sample of all university graduates surveyed in
PIAAC in each country, which are the relevant comparison group for teachers (88 percent of teachers have obtained a
college degree). However, results are qualitatively similar when we add years of schooling as an additional control or
estimate the Mincer earnings function on the whole population.
      54
         It is remarkable that teacher wage premiums are similarly low in the United States and Sweden, since both
countries are at opposite extremes of wage inequality (see Table 1 in Hanushek et al. (2015)). In the United States, the
90/10 wage ratio is 4.5 compared to 2 in Sweden.

                                                              30
subject k in country c) on the country-specific teacher wage premium (𝛿𝛿̂𝑐𝑐 ):

(8)           𝑇𝑇�𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝛿𝛿̂𝑐𝑐 + 𝛾𝛾𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 + 𝜖𝜖𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 .

Estimates are conditioned on the cognitive skills of nonteacher college graduates to account for

overall country skill levels and to allow us to assess how pay relates to the position of teachers in

the distribution of the country’s skills. 55

      The results, shown in Table 7 (and graphically in Figure 8) indicate that higher relative teacher

pay is systematically related to higher teacher skills. The clear conclusion is that countries that pay

teachers more for their skills also tend to draw their teachers from higher parts of the college skill

distribution. In terms of magnitude, a 10 percentage points higher teacher wage premium is

associated with an increase in teacher skills of about 0.10 SD. 56 The coefficient on college

graduates’ skills is close to 1, again suggesting the powerful influence of a country’s overall skill

level.

      It is also possible to estimate a “reduced-form” effect of teacher wage premium on student

performance. The lower panel of Figure 8 shows that the pay choices of countries carry through to

student achievement.

      The interpretation of these results is, however, important for policy. These estimates are

reduced-form estimates that reflect the labor market equilibrium. As such, they do not indicate what

the supply function for higher quality teachers looks like. In other words, they are not causal

estimates of how the quality of teachers would change if teacher salaries were raised. 57 Moreover,




      55
         An alternative approach is to run country-level regressions of teacher skills on relative teacher wages, measured
as the percentile rank of country-specific mean teacher wages in the wage distribution of all nonteacher college
graduates. This approach yields similar salary-teacher skill results, but it does not allow for any differences in the
distribution of other earnings characteristics between teachers and nonteachers. Hoxby and Leigh (2004) suggest that
compression in salaries, as caused by unionization, also might contribute to differences in teacher cognitive skills, but
we have no way to incorporate such differences into our estimation.
      56
         These estimates are likely downward biased because the teacher wage premiums are estimated coefficients and
therefore contain error. Assuming that the errors are heteroscedastic (as they come from separate regressions), the true
coefficients are slightly larger by 5 percent.
      57
         These issues have been part of the policy discussion in the U.S., where questions have arisen about how to
attract more effective teachers as measured by teacher value-added. Higher teacher salaries would undoubtedly expand
the pool of potential teachers and would also help to cut down on teacher turnover. This evidence does not, however,
indicate that more effective teachers will be hired out of the enlarged pool; nor does it indicate that the teachers who are

                                                                         31
the estimated relationship relates to the long run after many cohorts of teachers have been recruited.

Thus, while making it clear that a more skilled teaching force is generally found in countries with

higher relative salaries, the evidence says nothing about either how salaries should be structured or

the responsiveness of teachers to higher salary offers.

7.     Conclusions

     In this paper, we investigate the role of teacher skills in explaining international differences in

student achievement. Within-country evidence has highlighted the importance of teacher quality for

student achievement with the most convincing evidence coming from value-added analysis. Such

analysis provides information about the relative learning gains across a set of teachers, but it does

not indicate what might be possible if there were a different pool of potential teachers from which

the teacher corps could be drawn. Moreover, it has previously not been possible to describe reliably

any aspects of teachers that could be used to index quality differences across countries.

     Based on suggestive prior evidence on the role of cognitive skills of teachers, we systematically

address how cross-country differences in teacher skills enter into educational production. We use

newly available data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies

(PIAAC) to provide the first description of the skills of teachers in numeracy and literacy. For our

sample of 31 developed economies, teacher cognitive skills differ substantially across countries,

reflecting both country-wide differences in cognitive skills and policy choices about where teachers

are drawn from the country’s skill distribution. We then combine the country-level measures of

teacher cognitive skills with micro data on student performance from PISA to estimate international

education production functions. These estimates account for a rich set of controls for student,

school, and country background factors, including coarse measures of the cognitive skills of the

parents of PISA students and a variety of institutional features of the schools in each country. In

addition to OLS models, we estimate the impact of teacher cognitive skills using student fixed-




induced to stay in teaching are the more effective teachers. The same holds for changing the cognitive skills of the
teaching force. See Hanushek and Rivkin (2004).

                                                              32
effects models, which exploit between-subject variation and account for constant individual factors

(e.g., ability and parental influences) along with non-subject-specific country-level factors.

    With both approaches, we consistently find that differences in teacher cognitive skills across

countries are strongly associated with international differences in student performance. In terms of

magnitude, a one SD increase in teacher cognitive skills is associated with an increase in student

performance of 0.10-0.15 SD. Since PISA scores represent the cumulative learning of 15-year-olds,

this suggests an average learning gain of about 0.01-0.015 SD per year.

    Alternative specifications that control for the cognitive skills of all adults in a country indicate

that the teacher-skill effects are not simply reflecting overall differences in skills among countries

but instead are directly related to where teachers are drawn from in the country’s skill distribution.

Several placebo tests and falsification checks support a conclusion that the estimates of the

relationship of student outcomes and teacher cognitive skills are unlikely to be driven by overall

population differences in skills or by omitted country variables.

    The magnitude of the estimated relationship is important. Our results suggest that the

dispersion in average PISA scores across our 31 country sample would be reduced by roughly one-

quarter if each country brought its average teacher skills up to the average in Finland, the country

with the highest measured skills of teachers. Of course, reaching Finland has very different labor

market implications across countries because of underlying differences in the skills found across

countries in the pool of college graduate. For example, Chile and Turkey would need to draw their

median teacher at the 97th percentile of the distribution of numeracy scores for college graduates in

order to reach the level of Finnish teachers.

    We also investigate possible determinants of teacher cognitive skills. We find that cross-

country differences in women’s access to high-skill occupations and in wage premiums paid to

teachers (given their gender, work experience, and cognitive skills) are directly related to teacher

cognitive skills in a country. The estimated wage differentials for teachers are directly correlated

with student outcomes across our sample countries.

Note : The gure shows histograms of the coecients on cognitive skills for 100 random samples of adults
with the same sample size and age, gender, and education distribution as the teacher sample in the country.
Dependent variable is student PISA test score in math (top graph), in reading (middle graph), and dierence
in standardized student test scores between math and reading (bottom graph). Skills refer to numeracy in top
gure, to literacy in middle gure, and to the dierence between numeracy and literacy in the bottom gure.
Skills are z-standardized across countries. In the top graph, control variables are the same as in Column 3 of
Table 5; in the middle graph, control variables are the same as in Column 6 of Table 5; in the bottom graph,
control variables are the same as in Column 3 of Table 4. The vertical dashed lines indicate the estimate on
teacher cognitive skills.     Data sources : PIAAC 2011/12 and 2014/15, PISA 2009 and 2012.

Notes: Bars indicate the percentage dierence in gross hourly earnings of teachers with a college degree relative
to all nonteacher college graduates in a country.    Estimates condition on gender, a quadratic polynomial in
potential work experience (age   −   years of schooling   −   6), and numeracy and literacy skills. Post-communist
countries and Turkey are excluded (explanations see text).       Data sources: PIAAC 2011/12 and 2014/15.

Note : Dependent variable is standardized teacher cognitive skills (upper panel) and standardized student PISA test scores (lower panel),
respectively. Upper panel shows added-variable plots that control for country-specic numeracy skills (left graph) and literacy skills (right
graph) of all college graduates (without teachers); lower panel additionally controls for all variables included in the baseline specication in
Table 2 (left graph: Column 3 of Table 2; right graph: Column 6 of Table 2). Teacher wage premiums are the percentage dierence in gross
hourly earnings of teachers with a college degree relative to all nonteacher college graduates in a country, conditional on gender, quadratic
polynomial in potential work experience, and numeracy and literacy skills; divided by 10 (see also Figure 7 and Table EA-11). Post-communist

Notes: Teacher cognitive skills are country-specic median cognitive skills of primary school teachers, secondary school teachers, and other teachers (including, e.g.,
special education teachers and language teachers).     Because occupation in Australia and Finland is reported only at the two-digit level, teachers in these countries
include all "teaching professionals" (ISCO-08 code 23), i.e., additionally include pre-kindergarten teachers and university professors. All skill measures are rounded to
the nearest integer. Percentile refers to the position of median cognitive skills of teachers in the cognitive skill distribution of all adults aged 2565 excluding teachers.
Individuals are weighted with PIAAC nal sample weights. Observations refer to the number of teachers used to construct country-specic teacher skills.         Data sources:
PIAAC 2011/12 and 2014/15.

Notes: Least squares regressions weighted by students' inverse sampling probability, giving each country the
same weight. Dependent variable: student PISA test score in math (Columns 13) and in reading (Columns
46), respectively. Student test scores are z-standardized at the individual level across countries. Country-level
teacher cognitive skills refer to numeracy in Columns 13 and to literacy in Columns 46.           Teacher skills
are z-standardized across countries.     Parent cognitive skills are computed as the maximum of mother's and
father's skills in numeracy (Columns 13) or literacy (Columns 46). Parent cognitive skills are standardized
using teacher cognitive skills as numeraire scale.     Student characteristics are age, gender, migrant status
(rst-generation or second-generation), and language spoken at home. Parent characteristics include parents'
educational degree, number of books at home, and occupation. School characteristics include school location,
number of students per school, three autonomy measures, as well as shortage of qualied teachers and weekly
instructional time in math classes (Columns 13) or language classes (Columns 46). Country characteristics
are expenditures per student and school starting age (Table EA-6 reports results for all control variables). All
regressions include controls for respective imputation dummies and a dummy indicating the PISA wave. Robust

Notes: Dependent variable: teacher skills in numeracy (Columns 12) and literacy (Columns 34). Teacher
cognitive skills are standardized using the standard deviation from the full sample (31 countries) as numeraire
scale, such that magnitudes are comparable to the main analysis; cognitive skills of college graduates are
standardized similarly.   Share: female teachers/females in high-skilled occ. is the share of female teachers in a
country-cohort cell over all females working in high-skilled occupations. Each cohort covers 15 adjacent birth
years.   Occupations are classied as high-skilled applying the following procedure in PIAAC: First, for each
two-digit occupation in each country, we calculate average years of schooling of persons currently working in
these occupations. Second, ranking occupations by average schooling level and starting from the occupation
with the highest level, we dene occupations as high-skilled until males working in these occupations comprise
25 percent of all males currently working in that country. Robust standard errors, adjusted for clustering at the

Electronic Appendix A.                 Data Appendix

       This electronic appendix provides additional information on the datasets and the

construction of variables used in the empirical analysis. As in Section 3, we begin with a discussion

of teacher cognitive skills, followed by a description of parent cognitive skills, student performance

data, and further control variables.

Teacher Cognitive Skills

    The target population of the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult

Competencies (PIAAC) was the non-institutionalized population aged 16-65 years, and samples

included at least 5,000 participants in each country.

       We use 31 out of the 33 countries that participated in PIAAC in our analysis: Australia,

Austria, Belgium (Flanders), Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,

Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Russian Federation,

the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom (England and Northern Ireland), and the

United States (Round 1, conducted between August 2011 and March 2012) as well as Chile,

Greece, Indonesia, Israel, Lithuania, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia, and Turkey (Round 2,

conducted between April 2014 and March 2015). Cyprus, while participating in PIAAC, did not

participate in PISA. In Indonesia, the PIAAC survey was administered only to the population in

Jakarta. According to OECD (2013), data for the Russian Federation are preliminary, may still be

subject to change, and are not representative of the entire Russian population because they do not

include the population of the Moscow municipal area. Our results are not sensitive to dropping the

Russian Federation from the sample.

    The survey provides rich information about demographic, educational, and occupational

characteristics for each respondent. It was administered by trained interviewers either in the

respondent’s home or in a location agreed upon between the respondent and interviewer. The

standard survey mode was to answer questions on a computer, but respondents without computer
experience could opt for a pencil-and-paper interview. On average across countries, 70 percent of

the participants took the computer-based assessment and 30 percent took the paper-based

assessment. A field test suggests no impact of assessment mode (OECD 2013).

     After providing the background information, respondents took a battery of cognitive

assessments. PIAAC assessments are designed to be valid cross-culturally and cross-nationally and

to provide internationally comparable measures of adult skills. The assessments measure key

cognitive and workplace skills needed to advance in the job and to participate in society in three

domains: numeracy, literacy, and problem solving in technology-rich environments (or ICT skills).

The test questions are often framed as real-world problems, such as maintaining a driver’s logbook

(numeracy domain) or selecting key information from a bibliographic search (literacy domain).

PIAAC measures each of the skill domains on a 500-point scale. 58

     Literacy is defined as the “ability to understand, evaluate, use and engage with written texts to

participate in society, to achieve one’s goals, and to develop one’s knowledge and potential,” and

numeracy is the “ability to access, use, interpret, and communicate mathematical information and

ideas in order to engage in and manage the mathematical demands of a range of situations in adult

life” (see OECD (2013) for more details). Because of our focus on students’ reading and math

performance, we do not use the PIAAC skills in the domain “problem solving in technology-rich

environments” in the main analysis. 59

     In the PIAAC Public Use File, information on occupation is available only at the two-digit code

in some countries (Germany, Ireland, Singapore, Sweden, and the United States), while a few other

countries (Austria, Canada, Estonia, and Finland) do not publicly report any occupational code. For

this study, however, we gained access through the OECD to the four-digit ISCO-08 (International




     58
        PIAAC tests were conducted in the official language of the country of residence. In some countries, the
assessment was also conducted in widely spoken minority or regional languages. Respondents could take as much time
as needed to complete the assessment.
     59
        Five countries surveyed in PIAAC (Cyprus, France, Indonesia, Italy, and Spain) did not administer tests in this
optional skill domain.
Standard Classification of Occupations) codes for all but two countries, which allows us to identify

teachers in fine categories. For Australia and Finland, we only have two-digit occupational codes

and are therefore unable to exclude pre-kindergarten teachers and university professors/vocational

school teachers from our teacher sample. However, analysis of the countries where teachers are

defined using the four-digit code indicates that teacher skills based on the four-digit code are very

similar to those defined using the two-digit code: The correlation of both skill measures is 0.97 for

numeracy and 0.95 for literacy. On average, numeracy (literacy) skills based on the two-digit code

are only marginally higher (by 0.5 (0.1) PIAAC points) than the respective skills based on the four-

digit codes. The average absolute value of these differences is only 2.1 points in numeracy and 1.9

points in literacy. Moreover, simultaneously excluding Australia and Finland from the analysis does

not qualitatively change our results.

    Because PIAAC is not a teacher survey, we benchmark the PIAAC teacher samples against

large administrative datasets in which detailed occupational information allows identifying teachers.

Using the 2011 U.S. American Community Survey (ACS) which includes 55,000 teachers and the

2011 German Micro Census which includes about 6,400 teachers, we find similar demographic

characteristics compared to the respective national PIAAC teacher samples. In the U.S. teacher

samples, mean age is 41.1 years in PIAAC (44.3 years in the ACS), 67.5% (75.5%) of teachers are

female, and 89.9% (88.6%) of teachers have a college degree. In the German teacher samples, mean

age is 47.2 years in PIAAC (45.6 years in the Micro Census), 65.8% (74.4%) of teachers are

female, and 85.2% (82.2%) of teachers have a college degree.

Parent Cognitive Skills

       When estimating the numeracy and literacy skills of the PISA parents from the PIAAC

micro data, we collapsed the original 8 categories of the PIAAC education variable into 3 categories

so that the education categories in PIAAC and PISA would exactly match. The 6 categories of the

number of books at home variable are identical in PIAAC and PISA, so this variable was not

modified. We use number of books at home in addition to educational degree, since this variable
has been shown to be the single strongest predictor of student test scores (Woessmann (2003)).

Sample sizes range from 1,074 adults in the Russian Federation to 11,933 adults in Canada with an

average sample size of 2,693 adults per country (see Table EA-1).


Student Performance and Further Control Variables

    The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) contains both multiple-choice

and open-answer questions and provides internationally comparable test scores. The tests emphasize

understanding as well as flexible and context-specific application of knowledge, and hence they do

not test curriculum-specific knowledge.

       We use the two PISA cycles of 2009 and 2012 because the students have largely been taught

by the teacher cohorts tested between 2011 and 2015 in PIAAC. Student cohorts of earlier PISA

cycles (2000, 2003, and 2006) have partially been taught by some PIAAC teachers, but teacher

turnover would introduce additional error in the teacher skill measures for students in these earlier

cycles. Another reason for combining PISA 2009 and 2012 is that students provide information

about the instructional practices of their teachers only for the focus subject in each round of PISA

testing: reading in 2009 and math in 2012. From the survey information, we can compute country-

specific indicators of instructional practice for reading (based on PISA 2009) and for math (based

on PISA 2012). These instructional-practice indicators capture subject-specific pedagogical skills of

teachers, a potentially important confounding factor for teacher cognitive skills. Alternatively, the

subject-specific pedagogical skills might also mediate the impact of teacher cognitive skills if

teachers with high skills also use better instructional practices in class (see Section 5.3).

    Student characteristics (e.g., gender and migration status) and information about parents (e.g.,

education, occupation, and number of books at home) come from student background

questionnaires. We use estimated parent cognitive skills, number of books at home, parents’ highest

educational degree, and parental occupation to control for family background (see Table A-2 for

summary statistics of student performance and student characteristics and Table A-3 for family
background controls).

    Based on student information, we can construct measures of weekly instructional time for both

language and math classes. Following Lavy (2015), we aggregate this information across students

to the school level. Following Hanushek, Link, and Woessmann (2013), we also control for various

school-level determinants of student performance. For example, school principals provide

information on whether the school is public or private, city size, total number of students in the

school, the lack of qualified math teachers and language teachers, and different types of autonomy

(see Table A-4).

       Country characteristics include variables that are direct educational measures, namely,

cumulative educational expenditure per student between age 6 and 15 and school starting age. We

also check the robustness of our results to including further country controls, for instance, GDP per

capita to capture international differences in the state of development (see Table A-5).

       To construct indicators of subject-specific instructional activities, we use information from

the PISA students about their teachers’ activities in language and math classes. We follow the

OECD (2010a) approach of measuring specific instructional practices through survey responses of

students, while we aggregate these instructional practices to the school level. For reading, we use

the following items (each measured on a 4-point scale ranging from “never or hardly ever” to “in all

lessons”): asking students to explain the meaning of a text; asking questions that challenge students

to get a better understanding of a text; giving students enough time to think about their answers;

recommending books or author to read; encouraging students to express their opinion about a text;

helping students relate the stories they read to their lives; and showing students how the information

in texts builds on what they already know. For math, we use the following items (each measured on

a very similar 4-point scale ranging from “never or rarely” to “almost or almost always”): asking

questions that make students reflect on the problem; giving problems that require students to think

for an extended time; presenting problems in different contexts so that students know whether they

have understood the concepts; helping students to learn from mistakes they have made; asking
students to explain how they have solved a problem; and presenting problems that require students

to apply what they have learnt to new contexts. Since instructional practices are asked only for the

subject that was the focus in the respective PISA cycle (reading in 2009 and math in 2012), we

impute the subject-specific instructional-practice indicator for the PISA cycle when a subject was

not the focus. We impute the instructional-practice indicator by using the country-level measure

from the other PISA survey, assuming that the instructional practices in a subject have not

noticeably changed within a country over the three-year period between 2009 and 2012.
Electronic Appendix B.                      Validation of PIAAC Cognitive Skills Data with

     External Sources

          The PIAAC data on teacher cognitive skills raise two potential concerns. First, the teacher

skill measures are derived from relatively small samples.Second, they rely on a new battery of

achievement tests. In order to validate these measures, we compare them with estimates from larger

national surveys in the United States and Germany.

     We first look at the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79 and NLSY97). The

NLSY79 is a nationally representative sample of 6,111 young men and women who were born

between 1957 and 1964. The NLSY97 is a nationally representative sample of 6,748 individuals

born between 1980 and 1984. (Note that these age cohorts partly overlap with the age cohorts of the

PIAAC participants.) We measure NLSY79 respondents’ occupation (using four-digit Census

codes) in 2010 (last available year) and NLSY97 respondents’ occupation in 2011 to make this

sample as comparable as possible to the PIAAC survey in 2011. 60

     We take the mathematics and language skills tested in the four AFQT subtests which are part of

the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). The ASVAB was administered to 94

percent of NLSY79 respondents in 1980 and to 81 percent of NLYS97 respondents in 1997. We

combine the scores from the mathematical knowledge and arithmetic reasoning tests into a

numeracy skills measure and the scores from the word knowledge and paragraph comprehension

tests into a literacy skills measure. 61 Based on these measures, teacher skills fall at the 67th (64th)

percentile in the adult skill distribution in numeracy (literacy). This is quite close to the position of

teacher skills in the PIAAC data for the USA (see Table 1): 70th (71st) percentile in numeracy



     60
        Teachers are defined as in PIAAC (i.e., excluding pre-kindergarten teachers and university professors/vocational
education teachers). We weight individual-level observations with the cross-sectional weights taken from the year in
which the occupation is measured, giving each NLSY survey the same total weight.
     61
        As respondents were born in different years, we take out age effects by regressing test scores on year of birth
dummies first (separately for NLSY79 and NYS97). We control for age effects in the NLSY data because participants
were still children or adolescents at the time of testing. In contrast, we do not take out age effects in the PIAAC data
because most PIAAC participants have already completed their education when tested.
(literacy).

     We also compare teacher cognitive skills from PIAAC with those from Germany’s adult cohort

of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS). 62 This dataset is a nationally representative

dataset of 9,352 adults born between 1944 and 1986. NEPS has several advantages for our purpose.

First, similar to PIAAC, the competency tests in NEPS aim at measuring numeracy and literacy

skills in real-life situations which are relevant for labor market success and participation in society.

Second, NEPS tested skills at about the same time (in 2010/2011) as PIAAC did. Third, almost the

same age cohorts were tested in NEPS and PIAAC. Similar to PIAAC, we keep all adults aged 25–

65 and identify teachers based on the four-digit ISCO-88 occupation codes, where occupation is

measured in 2010/2011. Teacher skills in NEPS fall at the 68th (76th) percentile among the adult

skill distribution in numeracy (literacy). Again, this is similar to the respective positions of teachers

in the PIAAC sample for Germany: 72th (74th) percentile in numeracy (literacy).

     The similarity of teacher cognitive skills in the adult skill distribution found in PIAAC and in

these nationally representative datasets with larger sample sizes supports using the PIAAC scores as

measures of the teacher cognitive skills in each country.

Notes: Country means reported. Student-level information on instructional time (hours per week) is aggregated to the school level for both math and reading (see also
Lavy (2015)). Shortage math/language teachers is based on the following school principal question: "Is your school's capacity to provide instruction hindered by any of
the following issues? A lack of qualied mathematics/test language teachers" Possible answer categories are: not at all (1), very little (2), to some extent (3), a lot (4).

Notes: Expenditure per student and GDP per capita are expressed in 1,000 PPP-US-$. The instruction practice indicators are based on student information provided in
PISA; in 2009 for language teachers and in 2012 for math teachers. See text for details on the construction of the instruction practice indicators. Teacher performance
pay is a binary variable, taking the value 1 if salary adjustments are awarded to teachers with outstanding performance in teaching in a country; not available for
Lithuania and Singapore. Central exit exams equals 1 if central exam examinations exist on the upper secondary level (ISCED 3) in a country, 0 otherwise; data are
taken from Leschnig, Schwerdt, and Zigova (2016). Information on central exit exams is not available for the Russian Federation and Singapore. The remaining country
characteristics come from OECD statistics.   Data sources: Leschnig, Schwerdt, and Zigova (2016), OECD, PISA 2009 and 2012.

Notes: Dependent variable: standardized student PISA test score in math (Panel A) and reading (Panel B), respectively. Parental background is measured by the PISA
index of economic, social and cultural status (ESCS). This index captures a range of aspects of a student's family and home background that combines information
on parents' education, occupations, and home possessions. Migrants refer to second-generation migrants. To account for the unequal distribution of migrants across
countries, we re-weight regressions based on the sample of natives and migrants, respectively, giving equal weight to each country within each subsample. Korea has
no second-generation migrants in the PISA sample and is therefore excluded. All cognitive skill measures in Panel A (Panel B) refer to numeracy (literacy). Student,
parent, school, and country characteristics are the same as in the least squares models (see Table 2). All regressions include controls for respective imputation dummies
and a dummy indicating the PISA wave. Specications give equal weight to each country. Robust standard errors, adjusted for clustering at the country level, in

Notes: Least squares regressions weighted by students' inverse sampling probability, giving each country the
same weight. Dependent variable: student PISA test score in math (Columns 13) and in reading (Columns
46), respectively. Student test scores are z-standardized at the individual level across countries. Position of
teacher skills is the country-specic percentile rank of teacher cognitive skills in the cognitive skill distribution all
adults aged 2565 years. Position of teacher skills, parent skills, and country-level adult skills refer to numeracy

Notes: Dependent variable: standardized student PISA test score in math (Panel A) and reading (Panel B).
All skill measures in Panel A (Panel B) refer to numeracy (literacy). Column 1 replicates the baseline least
squares models from Columns 3 and 6 in Table 2. In Column 2, we add continental xed eects and in Column
3, the sample is restricted to only European countries. In Column 4, we exclude countries with a communist
heritage and Turkey, while we keep only countries with at least 150 teacher observations in PIAAC in Column
5. Student, parent, school, and country characteristics are the same as in the baseline least squares models (see
Table 2). All regressions include controls for imputation dummies and the PISA wave. Specications give equal
weight to each country. Robust standard errors, adjusted for clustering at the country level, in parentheses.
