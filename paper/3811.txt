   THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE, EXPORTS, AND MANUFACTURING PROFITS:
       A THEORETICAL FRANEWORK WITH SOME EMPIRICAL SUPPORT

                               ABSTRACT

    This   paper   investigates the relationship between
manufacturing profits, exports, and the real exchange rate.
Using Harston's (1990) model of pricing-to-market, we derive a

co-integrated log-linear profits equation that restricts the
long-run relationship among real U.S. manufacturing profits,
domestic sales, the real exchange rate, real unit costs, the U.S.
relative price of output, and foreign sales. We show that the
elasticity of real profits with respect to the real exchange rate
is bounded below by the product of (i) 1 minus the long-run
pass-through coefficient and (ii) the ratio of export revenues to

total profits. Our empirical findings suggest that, even after
taking into account output, costs, and relative prices, real
exchange rate fluctuations have a sizable and statistically
significant influence on real U.S. manufacturing profits. The
framework developed in this paper appears to be of some value in
directing attention towards a heretofore underappreciated channel

through which real exchange rate changes can potentially
influence national savings.

1.   Introduction

         In this paper, we investigate the relationship between manufacturing

profits, exports, and the real exchange rate. Traditionally, empirical studies

of aggregate profits (Clark (1986)) focus on the relationship between profits

and product prices, sales, and the cost of production. In fact, it might be

expected that, once such traditional variables are taken into account, there is

little left for the real exchange     rate   to explain, notwithstanding the fact that

real exchange rate fluctuations may be correlated with or contribute to
fluctuations in product prices, sales, and the cost of production. This
conjecture turns out to be wrong, at least in aggregate US manufacturing data
during the floating rate period. In fact,         interpreting   the profits equation to
be derived and estimated below as a co-integrating relationship, we estimate

that,    holding   constant the volume of domestic sales, unit costs, and  relative
domestic prices, a permanent      10 percent real depreciation results in a greater
than    6 percent rise in the real profits of US manufacturers. We demonstrate that

the elasticity of real profits with respect to the real exchange rate is bounded

below by the product of (i) 1 minus the pass-through coefficient and (ii) the

ratio of the dollar value of foreign sales to the dollar value of total profits.

 We note that even if dollar revenues from foreign sales are small relative to

total sales, they are likely to be large relative to total profits.

                                             I
         If all of a given real depreciation is passed through to foreign currency

prices, dollar profits per unit sold abroad are unchanged, but the volume of

exports rises in response to the decline in the relative foreign currency price

of the US export.          If none of a given real depreciation is passed through to

foreign currency prices, exports rise only at the rate of foreign income growth

multiplied by the foreign income elasticity of demand, but dollar profits per

unit sold abroad rise dollar for dollar with the jump in dollar price of foreign

exchange. Thus, a real depreciation of the dollar should boost the profits of

US manufacturera regardless          of whether pass-through        is complete,   partial, or non-
existent.


2.    A Modal

         We begin with a profits equation for a representative manufacturing firm

that    must     choose, each period, how much to produce, how much to sell

domestically, and how much to sell abroad.



(I)                 —          +         - VC   -




where       is   the dollar value of profits, ht            is   the dollar price of output -

in    quantity -   sold domestically, Q is              the foreign currency price of output -

     in quantity   -    sold   abroad, St is the dollar price of foreign currency, VC is

total variable costs in dollars, and                is total fixed cost in dollars. We shall

assume that total variable cost may be expressed as:



(2)              VC, —   Wj1     +



                                                    2
where W is the dollar wage, ç                    is   a stationary shock to costs, and Z is a

permanent shock to productivity. We shall use (2) along with data on unit labor

costs, U,, to infer the behavior of variable manufacturing costs. In particular,

we assume that,           subject   to a stationary measurement error            we observe:



(3)               LJ — (VC/(I +


Since    we do not have quarterly data on fixed cost, we shall assume that total
fixed cost esay be expressed as:
(4)                   —
                          KP,(R +
where        is   a stationary shock to fixed - overhead            -   costs.
        At   an optimum, the dollar price charged in each market is a markup over
marginal cost. Following Marston (1990):

                                                                -
(Sa)              'bt —    (e/(ç      -
                                          1))(AW(If + F)
                                                                -

                                          l))(AWUl +

where   ehL is the elasticity of demand in the home market, e1 is                  the elasticity

of demand     in     the export market, and           the   expression in brackets is equal to

marginal     cost:           -.

of    the form    Dh(PhJP;Yh) and                              we see that in equilibrium, the
production of output          sold domestically and the production of output sold abroad

solve the following two product market clearing conditions:

      Marston (1990) uses this framework to investigate the phenomena of exchange

rate pass-through and pricing-to-market. For example, he demonstrates that if

marginal cost and the demand elasticities are constant, a depreciation of the

exchange rate must result in a complete pass-through to the foreign currency

price, 3logQ/31ogS — -1, leaving the dollar price of exports,                          and the

price of domestic sales, bt' unchanged.        If marginal cost is increasing, pass-

through is incomplete, foreign sales rise, and domestic sales fall, as                     and

      rise in proportion to the increase in marginal cost.                        If demand

elasticities are not constant, and markups decline with a rise in product prices,

pass-through is less than complete even with constant marginal cost, and the

dollar price of output sold abroad must rise relative to the domestic price, bt

      Our interest is not in pricing behavior, per Se, but rather, in the

relationship between profits and the real exchange rate. As we argued in the

introduction, we would expect a real depreciation to boost the dollar profits

of US manufacturers regardless of whether or not said depreciation is passed-

though fully, partially, or not at all. We now derive an equation that can be

used to illustrate this reasoning and that can be investigated empirically.

      Totally differentiating (1), using (3), and dividing by r,                 we obtain:




(9)         dlog(vjP) — (8-n*-&)d1ogE          + (9   -

Note   that from (1), the restriction:



(11)              •    + -r -     - 4 — 1;


must hold period by period.

       There are          several noteworthy implications embedded in equation (9). First,

profits are homogeneous           of degree   1 in domestic nominal variables and the   nominal
exchange rate.            Second, profits are hømogenous of degree 0 in foreign nominal
variables   and   nominal exchange rate. Third the elasticity of reel profits
                      the

with respect to a depreciation that is not passed-through is equal to y. the
ratio of the dollar value of foreign revenues to total profits.:

(12)         d1og(rJP) — ,d1og(SJP).



       As shown in Marston (1990) and Feenstra (1967), if marginal cost is

constant and the markup declines with a rise in product prices -              as   will. be the

case for any demand curve that is less convex than the log linear demand curve -




                                                   S
the domestic price ht   is   unchanged in response to a nominal depreciation, and

the pass-through to the foreign currency price Q goes to zero as the elasticity

of the foreign markup, N —     ef/(eZ     -
                                                  1), with respect to Qft goes to -.            In
this case, pricing-to-market is complete. Export volume remains unchanged, but

dollar profits from foreign sales, which represent 'y times total profits, rise

in proportion to the rate of depreciation.

       Fourth, the elasticity of real profits with respect to a depreciation that

is fully passed-through is given by:



(13)         d1og(w/P) —     Sf(j - n(l-)         -
                                                          .K1-',b))d1og(sJP).


when marginal cost is constant. As summarized above, Marston (1990) shows that

pass-through is complete, and the domestic price remains unchanged, in response

to a nominal depreciation when marginal cost and the elasticity of foreign demand

are constant. It follows that, for this case in which no pricing-to-market takes

place, the channel through which real depreciation boosts profits is through

greater export volumes,       With complete exchange rate pass-through and an

equiproportional decline in the foreign currency price of exports, the percent

rise in exports is given by efdlog(S(/P). From (9) we see that this translates

into a rise in profits of ef(-y -     n(l-*)          -
                                                          #(l-#))dlog'$/P)       percent.

       Fifth, the elasticity of real profits with respect to a depreciation that

is only partially passed-through is easily obtained from (9) and (13). Letting

p equal minus the pass-through elasticity, p —                 -dlogQ/dlogS,       we have:



(14)        dlog(w/P) — (-y(1    -   p) + pe('y            - ,,(1-*)   -
                                                                           #(l-*))Jdlog(S/P).


                                              6
When pass-through is incomplete, a real, exchange rate depreciation boosts profits

through two channels. The rise in the dollar price of exports boosts profits

by i(l - M)dlog(St/Pht) percent, while the rise in export volumes boosts profits

by pe1(1 -      v(l-) - #(l-))dlog(S/P)            percent.

            As demonstrated in Marsion (1990), the pass-through coefficient i'           is
related to the elasticity of the markup with respect to the foreign currency

price Qft'      -(aN/aQ1)(Q/N) — r.        In fact, with constant marginal cost:



(15)                — 1/(1 + r).


In general, at a profit maximizing optimum. it must be the case that:



(16)                   — KCN(QLVQ) -



where we have imposed the assumption that             the   foreign demand curve is weakly-

separable in foreign income. Taking logs, totally differentiating (16), and

substituting into (9) for dlogQf, we obtain the following profits equation:



(17)             d1og(r/P) — (9    -
                                           - )d1ogIç     + -y(1-p)d1og(SQ/P)
                                   -
                                       (n-p'Od1ogGJ/P) + (9       -
                                                                      #)dlog(P/P)
                                   +   (i - n(l-) - (l-#fld1ogP
                                   + (tz.p-y)dlogu - (vy-p-j')dlogC - q$d1oge;



It    is easily verified that (12), (13), and (14) follow from (17) when p — 0,

p —    1,    and 0 C p < 1 respectively.




                                               7
         Given the money wage W and constant marginal coat, the optimal response

of a price setting exporter to a depreciation of the dollar is to let the foreign

price alone absorb the impact of the depreciation.            Of course, the same factors

-   such as monetary policy -       that    contribute to the dollar depreciation may

ultimately result in a rise in money wages. If this rise occurs, and there is

no subsequent "correctionTM in the value of the dollar, both domestic and foreign

currency prices of exportables will rise in tandem with the increase in domestic

wages.     Indeed, if wages rise ultimately by the initial tall in the dollar's

value the initial decline in foreign currency prices is completely reversed, and

it is easy to show that the long run elasticity of real profits with respect to

a real depreciation is unity. Of course, if the domestic price level rises in

proportion to the nominal depreciation, the long run real depreciation is zero

as is the ultimate change in real profits.

         This being said, a depreciation of the dollar that does not ultimately

result in an equal jump in wages will in general boost the real profits of US

exporters. We now turn to an investigation of the empirical relationship between

the real exchange rate and the real profits of US manufacturers in the floating

rate period.

         Letting lower case letters denote logs, an empirically tractable

specification that is consistent with (17) is given by:

                        + (?7-p7)u -        (n-wv) -

                                                 8
      Our empirical strategy is as follows. Suspecting that many, if not all

of the variables under study are non-stationary in levels, we first perform

Dickey-Fuller (1981) tests of the null hypothesis that each variable included

in (15) is in fact 1(1). Under the identifying assumption that            and      the
unobservable shocks to variable and fixed costs, and       the error in measuring

variable cost, are stationary, a finding that alL of the variables under study

are in fact 1(1) would imply that the profits equation (18) represents a co-

integrating equation, an equation that defines the "long run" equilibrium

relationship among profits, sales, exports, product prices, and the real exchange

rate, The null hypothesis that (18) does not represent a co-integrating equation

is tested using the approach suggested by Cranger and Engle (1987). If this null

hypothesis of no-cointegration is rejected, OLS can be used to provide a

consistent estimate of the co-integrating vector, while Phillips-Loretan Non-

Linear Least Squares (1991) can be used to provide an unbiased estimate with

asymptotically correct standard errors,

      Given an estimate of the co-integrating vector, the product of the

parameters y and (I - p) is identified.      However, the co-integrating vector

corresponding to the profits equation (18) does not identify the pass-through

coefficient p.   Note that when pass-through is complete, p — 1, the theory

predicts that the coefficient on the log real exchange rate s +   q   -     is   zero.

In this case, a real depreciation can only boost profits by increasing exports,

since the dollar price of exports remains unchanged. Thus, although p is in

general not identified from the profits equation, it is possible to test the

null hypothesis that pass-through is complete.

4. Empirical Results

       We suspect that many, if not all, of the variables included in the profits

equation implied by the theory are non-stationary in levels. We investigate this

possibility with the augmented Dickey-Fuller (1981) t-test.                      Under the null

hypothesis that a variable x1 is difference -                but not level - stationary,    the

regression:



(19)                 —     + a1t +          + pAx +

is   run, and a t-test of the significance of fi             is   performed. Under the null,

p — 0 and the t-ratio has a skewed distribution that has been investigated and
tabulated by Dickey and Fuller (1981). The results of this test are reported

in Table 1.      There is no decisive evidence against the null hypothesis that each

variable under study is non-stationary in levels, although in the case of real

profits, production sold domestically, and the relative domestic price the t-

ratios   are sufficiently large so as to indicate at least some evidence against

the null. We proceed under the assumption that all of the variables are 1(1).

        We next test for co-integration using the approach suggested by Granger

and Engle (1981).          To test the null hypothesis that x, Y. and               are not co-

integrated, we first run the regression:


(20)            ,ca+a1t         +fl1y+fl3z+e.

Under the null, e1 is non-stationary. We perform an augmented Dickey-Fuller
test on the estimated residuals in (20) by regressing the change in the estimated

residual, Ae1 on one lagged level of the residual and lagged changes:

(21)                  —   6ct-i +   p1   te,1   + ... +      p4   Ae4    +


                                                   10
The test is   just a   t-test on the coefficient 6; the appropriate critical values

are those reported in Phillips and Ouliaris (1989). The results for equation

(18), the specification that imposes the first-order condition (16), are

presented in Table 2.

      As can be seen in the Table, the null hypothesis of no co-integration among

real profits, domestic sales, the real exchange rate, real unit costs, the

relative price of output, and exports can be rejected at the 5.0 percent level.

This finding is important, because it means that it is possible to recover the

"long nm relationship among these variables without the necessity of specifying

correctly -    or   at all -   the   short-run dynamics. Note that according to our

specification, these dynamics arise from stationary shocks to costs. Mother

interpretation that is consistent with the finding of co-integration is that

the profit dynamics arise from sluggish adjustment of prices to real exchange

rate changes, domestic demand, or costs. According to this error correction"

interpretation,      a finding of      co-integration implies that sluggish price

adjustment    induces a dynamic adjustment of real profits that is stationary about
a long run equilibrium described by equation (18).
      The finding of co-integration also implies that an OLS regression of real

manufacturing profits on domestic sales, the real exchange rate, real unit costs,

the relative price., of output, and manufacturing exports is not a spurious

regression in the sense of Granger and Newbold (1974). Tn fact, Stock proves

that OLS is consistent, so that p101.       represents   a consistent estimate of

(8-'p#-#), fl201     is   a consistent estimate of -y(l-l'), fl301    is   a consistent

estimate   of -(vp-sty), 4cL. is      a consistent estimate of (9 -     $), and
represents a consistent estimate of (i-v(1-)-(l-#)).




                                             11
            While OLS is consistent, it is not unbiased, and OLS standard errors cannot

in general be        used   for statistical inference   (Campbell and Perron (1991), p. 48).
To estimate the parameters of the co-integrating vector, and to perform

hypotheses       tests, we employ the non-linear least squares approach of Phillips

and Loretan (1991),

            Phillips and Loretan (1991) propose a parametric procedure for estimating

the co-integrating vector in an equation in which the variables are in fact known

to be co-integrated. The Phillips and Loretan approach tackles the simultaneity

problem by including lagged and lead values of the change in the regressors.

The approach deals with the autocorrelation in the residuals by including lagged

values of the stationary deviation from the co-integrating relationship.

Phillips and Loretan prove that the estimates of the co-integrating vector

obtained from this approach are asymptotically FIML. They also show that the

Wald test can be used to test hypotheses about the parameters of the co-

integrating      vector.
       Let y denote the vector (he, (s-s.q-p), (u-pj,                     - ).
                                                                  1)' and let
ft denote the vector [fl1 fl2, ft, fi,, fl5]. The Phillips-Loretan equation is
given by:


                                                            .1—5   j—r
(22)                     —
                                 + P('-1P.1    -          +Z       S             +
                                                            1—1    j—-r



The    ft   vector   is estimated by non-linear least squares. The implied estimates

of ft       along with standard errors and the results of Wald tests for the
significance of each coefficient          are reported in Table 3.


                                                   12
       As can be seen from the Table, the estimated value of           —   -y(1-s)   is 0.57

which is statistically significant from 0 at the 5 percent level. This implies

that the long run elasticity of real profits with respect to a real depreciation

of the dollar is bounded below by 0.57. This estimate represents a lower bound

because it ignores the pass-through of the real depreciation to foreign currency

prices and the resulting rise in export volumes. According to the theoretical

model, it is possible to test the hypothesis that, in the long run, pass-through

is complete. p —   I.   This is just a test that fi2 — 0.    As noted above, this null

hypothesis can be rejected at the 5 percent level.

       The estimated value of ft1. the elasticity of real profits with respect to

domestic sales is 2.21, significant at the 5 percent level, while the estimated

value of ft5, the elasticity of real profits with respect to export volumes, is

0.52 and not statistically significant. According the theory, ft —

the   share of total profits that is earned from domestic sales. Thus, a long run

elasticity of real profits with respect to domestic sales in excess of 1 seems

large. A point estimate of fl5 —        ('y-t(l-)-Ø(l-)),   the share of total profits

earned from export sales, equal to 0.52 also appears large, although as mentioned

above this parameter is not estimated precisely.

        The estimated value of $3   —      - MY). the elasticity of real profits with

respect to real unit costs, is -2.86, significantly less than zero at the I

percent level. The estimated value of ft, the elasticity of real profits with

respect to the relative domestic price of output is 15.51, significant at the

1 percent level. According to the theory, $ — (0        -
                                                            ),   the difference between

domestic revenues and fixed costs divided by total profits, so that an estimate

of $. — 15.51 does appear to be a bit large.




                                            13
         The theory places two testable restrictions on the estimated coefficients.

From (11) we know that 8        + 'y -    -        —1.      It follows from (17)       that the
elasticities      of real profits with respect to domestic output and exports sum to
unity, and that the elasticities of real profits with respect to the real
exchange rate, real unit costs, and       the     relative price of output sum to unity.
Thus,    a test   of underlying model used to motivate the co-integrating regression:


(23)              '-P — $1h + $2(s+gL-p)      +    fi3(u-p)   +    P4(-) +         +



is   just the test that $ +        — 1 and that ft2      + ft3 +    — 1.   Using a Wald test,

the former restriction cannot be rejected at the 15 percent level, but the latter

restriction can be rejected at the 1 percent level, even though each of 2.                  3•
and $4    is   significant and of the expected sign.




5. Assessments and Conclusions

         What are we to make of these results? Our findings                suggest that,   even

after    taking   into account output, costs, and relative prices, real exchange rate

fluctuations have a sizable and statistically significant influence on US

manufacturing profits, a finding that is consistent with the version of Marston's

(1990) model of pricing to market derived in this paper. Theoretically, the

eLasticity of real profits with respect to the real exchange rate is bounded

below by the product of Ci) 1 minus the pass-through coefficient and (ii) the

ratio of export revenues to total profits. By contrast, we find that, after

taking into account domestically sold output, costs, relative prices, and the

real exchange rate, fluctuations in export volumes have a statistically


                                              14
insignificant influence on US manufacturing profits.       Taken together, these

finding are not inconsistent with our version of Karston's model of pricing to

market if pass-through is incomplete.

        Empirically, real manufacturing profits, domestic sales, unit costs, the

real exchange rate, the US relative price of manufacturing output, and exports

are found to be integrated variables. This fact, along with the profits equation

derived in Section 2, is shown to imply that these variables are co-integrated.

We rejected the hypothesis of no co-integration, and used this result to justify

our estimation and testing of the model with the non-linear least squares

approach suggested by Phillips and Loretan.       The model places two testable

restrictions across the coefficients of the profits equation. We were unable

to reject at the 15 percent level the restriction that the elasticities of real

profits with respect to domestic output and exports sum to unity. We were able

to reject at the 1 percent level the restriction that the elasticities of real

profits with respect to the real exchange rate, real unit costs, and the relative

price of output sum to unity.

        Thus, while the framework developed in this paper has been useful in

obtaining an intuitive, co-integrated profits equation that reveals the

significant long-run influence of real exchange rate fluctuations on real US

manufacturing profits, the model underlying the profits equation is sufficiently

well specified so as to be rejected by the data. The source of the rejection

is not the sign or significance of the coefficients, hut rather that three

significant coefficients of the predicted sign fail to sum to unity. From this,

it   would not be unjustified to conclude that this framework is of some value in
directing attention towards a heretofore     neglected channel through which real

exchange   rate changes can potentially influence national savings.
