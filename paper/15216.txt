Do Expenditures Other Than Instructional Expenditures Affect Graduation and Persistence
Rates in American Higher Education

                                              ABSTRACT

During the last two decades, median instructional spending per full-time equivalent (FTE) student
at American 4-year colleges and universities has grown at a slower rate than median spending per
FTE student in a number of other expenditure categories including academic support, student services
and research. Our paper uses institutional level panel data and a variety of econometric approaches,
including unconditional quantile regression methods, to analyze whether these non instructional expenditure
categories influence graduation and first-year persistence rates of undergraduate students.

Our most important finding is that student service expenditures influence graduation and persistence
rates and their marginal effects are higher for students at institutions with lower entrance test scores
and higher Pell Grant expenditures per student. Put another way, their effects are largest at institutions
that have lower current graduation and first year persistence rates. Simulations suggest that reallocating
some funding from instruction to student services may enhance persistence and graduation rates at
those institutions whose rates are currently below the medians in the sample.

       I.      Introduction

            Rates of tuition increases in both private and public higher education that

continually exceed inflation, coupled with the fact that the United States no longer leads

the world in terms of the fraction of our young adults who have college degrees, have

focused attention on why costs keep increasing in higher education and what categories

of higher education expenditures have been growing the most rapidly. In a series of

publications, the Delta Cost Project has shown that during the last two decades median

instructional spending per full-time equivalent (FTE) student in both public and private 4-

year colleges and universities in the United States grew at a slower rate than median

expenditures per FTE student in many other categories of expenditures (research, public

service, academic support, student services, and scholarships and fellowships).1 Similarly,

the Center for College Affordability and Productivity reports that during the same time

period, managerial and support/service staff at colleges and universities grew relative to

faculty.2

            Do such changes reflect increased inefficiency and waste or do some non

instructional categories of employees and expenditures contribute directly to the

educational mission of American colleges and universities? In this paper, we use

institutional level panel data and an educational production function approach to estimate

whether various non instructional categories of expenditures directly influence graduation

and persistence rates of undergraduate students in American colleges and universities.

We find, not surprisingly, that the answer is several of these expenditure categories do

influence students’ educational outcome, but that the extent that they matter varies with

the socioeconomic backgrounds and the average test scores of the students attending the

institutions.

    II.      Educational Production Functions

    The educational production function literature has its roots in the study of the impact

of school resources on educational outcomes in elementary and secondary education and

goes back to the 1960s Coleman Report.3 An extraordinarily large number of studies have

used non experimental and experimental (most notably from the Tennessee STAR

experiment) data to test whether expenditures per student or class size influence students

test score gains and graduation rates.4

    A parallel literature has developed in higher education and has used institutional level

data to study the impact of higher education expenditures on persistence and graduation

rates. 5 With few exceptions, expenditures per student have not been disaggregated into

different functional categories of expenditures in this research. The few studies that have

separated out expenditures into functional categories, such as instruction, student services,

academic support, and research, have not reached a consensus on whether expenditure

categories other than instruction influence persistence and graduation rates.6 The lack of

consistency or their results has been attributed to methodological differences in the

studies, including their use of different relatively small samples of institutions.7

persistence rates were positively related to academic support services, but negatively related to student
service expenditures.

          We contribute to this literature in a number of ways. First, we use panel data for a

national sample of 1160 4-year colleges and universities. While most of the data we use

were originally collected as part of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System

(IPEDS), these data have been carefully compiled, edited for consistency, and then made

available to researchers by the Delta Cost Project (www.deltacostproject.com ). Second,

we stratify the data by type of institution (baccalaureate, masters, doctoral), and, most

importantly, by the test scores of entering first-year students and the average Pell Grant

dollars received by FTE undergraduate students at the institution to see how the impact of

different expenditure categories on outcomes varies across types of students and

institutions. Third, we build on the work of Gary Blose, John Porter and Edward

Kokklenberg (2007), who have shown that estimation of higher educational production

functions that do not control for the distribution of degrees granted at an institution across

fields yield misleading estimates of the impact of measured instructional expenditures per

students on graduation rates, because the cost of educating students varies widely across

majors. Finally, we employ a variety of econometric methods, including unconditional

quantile regression, and simulate how the reallocation of resources from instructional to

other uses would influence graduation and persistence rates.



   III.      Descriptive Statistics and the Definitions of Expenditure Categories

   Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the institutions in our sample during the

2002-03 to 2005-06 academic years on the six-year graduation rate of entering full-time

first year students, the persistence rate of full-time first year students, the median SAT

scores of entering first-year students, the average Pell Grant dollars received per FTE




                                               3
undergraduate student, and four categories of expenditures per FTE student. The data are

reported for the entire sample of 1160 institutions, for subsamples of lower and higher

median SAT scores and lower and higher levels of Pell Grants per FTE, and by

institutional type. The expenditure variables for each year have been adjusted to reflect

the price level in 2006.

    The average six-year graduation rate for the institutions in our sample was 55 percent.

Graduation rates are higher at high SAT institutions than they are at low SAT institutions,

and higher at institutions with lower levels of Pell Grant dollars per FTE student than

they are at institutions with higher levels of Pell Grant dollars per FTE student. They also

vary by institutional type and form of control and are higher at private institutions than

they are at public institutions. The average persistence rate of full-time first-year students

at the institutions in our sample was 77 percent and the pattern of persistence rates across

the institutions mirrors the pattern of graduation rates.

    The four expenditure categories that we focus on in this paper are instructional

expenditures, academic support expenditures, student service expenditures, and research

expenditures. Detailed definitions of the content of each of these categories are found in

the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System online glossary

(http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/glossary ); we summarize them only briefly here. Instructional

expenditures include expenses of activities directly related to instruction including the

proportion of faculty salaries going to departmental research. Researchers and

policymakers look at instructional expenditures often are not aware that departmental

research, research that is not externally funded or separately budgeted by academic

institutions, is included in this category; a point that we will return to shortly.




                                               4
   Average instructional expenditures per FTE student were $9689 for the institutions in

our sample (column 1). The wide standard deviation of instructional expenditures per

student ($31,352) is due to very high expenditure levels at a small number of wealthy

private institutions. Mean instructional expenditures per FTE student are twice as high at

the higher SAT score institutions in our sample ($12,966) than they are at the lower SAT

score institutions ($6087) and similarly are almost twice as high at institutions with lower

levels of Pell Grant expenditures per FTE student ($12,592) than they are at institutions

with higher levels of Pell Grant expenditures per student ($6701). Put simply, higher test

score students from higher income families attend institutions with higher instructional

expenditures per student than other students do. Average instructional expenditures per

student also are higher at bachelors and doctoral institutions than they are at masters

institutions and higher at private institutions than they are at public institutions. However,

the variability of instructional expenditures within categories is often very large.

   Academic support expenditures are expenses that support the instruction, research

and public service missions of the university. They include libraries, museums, academic

computing (if it is not separately budgeted), media services and curriculum development.

The mean level of these expenditures per FTE student was $2456 for the institutions in

our sample (column 1), but again the standard deviation of this variables is very large.

Academic support expenditures per student are over twice as large at both the higher SAT

institutions than they are at the lower SAT institutions and at the lower Pell Grant

expenditure per student institutions than they are at the higher Pell Grant expenditure per

student institutions in our sample.




                                              5
   Student service expenditures include expenses for the admissions and registrars

activities, for activities that contribute to students’ emotional and physical well-being and

to their intellectual, cultural and social development outside of the institution’s formal

instructional program. Examples here include student organizations, intramurals, student

health services (including psychological counseling) and supplemental instruction (such

as tutoring programs). These expenditures averaged $2779 per FTE student in our sample,

but were higher at higher SAT institutions ($3514) than they were at lower SAT

institutions($1980) and higher at institutions with lower levels of Pell Grant expenditures

per FTE ($3348) than they were at institutions with higher levels of Pell Grant

expenditures per FTE ($2193).

   Finally research expenditures are expenses for activities that are specifically

organized to produce research outcomes. Typically these include externally sponsored

research and separately budgeted research centers and institutes financed out of

institutional funds. Research expenditures per FTE students averaged $2682 in our

sample, but there were again wide variations in this category of expenditures across

institutions and institutional categories. In particular, average research expenditures per

FTE student were much higher at higher SAT institutions ($4045) than they were at

lower SAT institution ($704) and similar much higher at institutions with lower Pell

Grant expenditure per student ($3738) than they were at institutions with higher Pell

Grant expenditures per student ($1299).

   Our goal is to estimate the extent to which these four different categories of

expenditures influence undergraduate students’ graduation rates and how these influences

vary across different types of institutions. Our expectations are that instructional




                                              6
expenditures per student will be important for all categories of institutions, but that the

importance of student services and academic support expenditures may vary across

institutions. In particular, students with lower entrance test scores and those coming from

families with lower economic resources may have greater need for the services that

academic support and student service expenditures provide and thus that these

expenditure categories should influence graduation rates more for students at lower SAT

and higher Pell Grant expenditure per student institutions.

    Why should research expenditures per student influence graduation rates once one

control for the levels of the other expenditure categories? Here our intuition is that the

institutions with high levels of funded research expenditures per student are also the

institutions that have a greater share of their reported instructional expenditures in the

form of departmental research. To the extent that we are correct and faculty time spent on

departmental research reduces the time available for instruction, this suggests that higher

levels of funded research expenditures per student may appear to have a negative effect

on graduation rates, when instructional expenditures per student are held constant,

because of their correlation with the unobserved (to the researcher) departmental research

expenditures.8

    IV.      Econometric Analyses

    Our initial econometric approach involves estimating equation (1) using a panel of

four years (2002-2003 to 2005-2006) data for 1160 institutions for which we have



8
  We are grateful to Professor Emeritus Charles Schwartz of the Department of Physics at the University of
California at Berkeley for raising with one of us the issue of whether the inclusion of departmental research
in instructional costs leads researchers and administrators to overestimate the extent to which institutional
resources are being devoted to undergraduate instruction; this stimulated us to provide the explanation
above as to why increases in budgeted research expenditures might have a negative effect on graduation
rates, when instructional expenditures were held constant.


                                                     7
complete data on expenditures, student and institutional characteristics and graduation

rates.

(1) ln(git/(1-git)) = a0 + a1STUit + a2INSit + a3 ACAit + a4RESit + bXit + cYi + dZt + uit

         Here git is the 6-year graduation rate of school i as of year t for students who

entered the institution as full-time first-year students 6 years earlier. STUit, INSit, ACAit,

and RESit are the averages, respectively, of the previous 6 years natural logarithm of the

institution’s expenditures per full-time equivalent (FTE) student on student services,

instruction, academic support services and research (all values have been expressed in

2006 dollars).9 The Xit are a vector institutional level control variables that vary over time,

while the Yi and Zt are a vector of institutional level control variables that do not vary

over time and a series of year dichotomous variables, respectively. The uit is a random

error term and the a, b, c, and d are coefficients to be estimated.

         The dependent variable is the log odds ratio of the graduation rate to constrain the

predicted value to lie between 0 and 1. The logarithmic transformation of the expenditure

variables is used to deal with the skewed nature of their distributions and to allow for

nonlinear impacts of each variable on the graduation rate.

         The institutional level control variables include characteristics of the institution

and its students that might be expected to influence graduation rates. These include both

the average of the 25th and 75th percentile of the SAT scores for the institution’s entering

first-year class and the average (over the previous six years) Pell Grant dollars per FTE




9
  In preliminary analyses we also experimented with including in the model various additional categories of
expenditures per student, as well as a composite of all other expenditures per student variable. However,
these variables were not consistently statistically significant from zero, nor did their inclusion impact upon
the coefficients of the expenditure categories that are of primary interest to us.


                                                      8
received by the institution’s undergraduate students.10 Similarly, they include the

percentages of the institution’s undergraduate students that were male, African American,

Hispanic American, Asian American, and American Indian, as well as whether the

institution was a Historically Black College or University.11

        Also included among the institutional control variables are the number and the

square of the number of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at the institution

(to allow for economic of scale and to control for differing costs of undergraduate and

graduate education) and the share of undergraduate degrees awarded by the institution in

the year in each of 15 different fields.12 These shares are included to control both for

differences in the difficulty of getting a degree in different fields and differences in the

institutional costs of educating students in each of the fields. Finally, dichotomous

variables for the type of institution (bachelors, masters or doctoral) are included, as are

year dichotomous variables (to control for macro variables such as the state of the labor

market that may influence students’ decisions to remain in or leave college.

        Because there is very little variability within an institution in the expenditure

share variables during the four years for which we have graduation rate data panel data

method, such institutional fixed effects, could not be employed. Instead we initially pool

our data across all years and all types of institutions and weight each observation by its

undergraduate enrollment level (because larger institutions should have less random

                                                    9
variation in their graduation rates).13 Our estimation method also takes account of the fact

that the error terms for the same institution may be correlated across years.

         Table 2 presents estimates of variants of equation (1) for our entire sample. The

estimates presented in column (1) are for a model in which only the expenditure

categories and the average level of Pell Grant expenditures per student are included.

Higher Pell Grant expenditures per student are associated with lower graduation rates and

higher levels of each of the expenditure categories are associated with higher graduation

rates.

         Columns (2) and (3) present estimates of more complete models. Other factors

held constant, increases in average SAT scores and the share of students that are Asian

American are associated with higher graduation rates, while increases in the share of

students that are male, African American or American Indian are associated with lower

graduation rates. As the prior literature has found, other factors held constant,

Historically Black Colleges and Universities have higher graduation rates. Most

important, in the more complete models the only expenditure categories that have

statistically significant positive impacts on graduation rates are those for instruction and

student services. Moreover, as we postulated, increases in budgeted research expenditures

per student adversely impact upon graduation rates.

         Because the model we have estimated is nonlinear, calculation of the marginal

effects of increasing expenditure levels in any expenditure category on the graduation

rate depends upon the coefficients of all of the variables in the model and the values of all

of the explanatory variables for the institution. To simulate what the impact of an

The results both with and without a linear and quadratic undergraduate enrollment term were the same.

increase in expenditures in any category of $500 per student would be on the graduation

rate, we perform the following calculation.

       1.         Given the values of the explanatory variables for an institution/year

                  observation and the estimated coefficients of the model, we obtain a

                  predicted value of the graduation rate for the institution/year

                  observation.

       2.         We add $500 per student to the institution/year observation for the

                  particular expenditure category (e.g. student services) and redo the

                  calculation

       3.         We take the difference between the predicted graduation rate in step 2

                  and that in step 1 and then average that over all institution/year

                  observations in our sample

       The first column of table 3 presents the coefficient estimates for the different

expenditure categories and the standard errors of these coefficient estimate that we

obtained from the most general specification found in table 3. Then the bottom panel for

each expenditure category, row titled marginal effects, presents the results of the

calculation described above. In the remaining columns of table 3, we present the

coefficients, standard errors of the coefficients and the marginal effects that we obtained

when we re estimated models for seven different subsamples of observations –lower and

higher SAT institutions, lower and higher Pell Grant recipient institutions, bachelors,

masters and doctoral institutions, and public and private institutions.

       Focusing first on the overall sample results. Ceteris paribus, an increase in student

services expenditures of $500 per student, on average, would increase an institution’s six-




                                              11
year graduation rate by 0.7 percentage points. Similar increases in instructional

expenditures and academic support services expenditures would, on average, increase the

graduation rate by about 0.3 percentage points, while an increase in budgeted research

expenditures of the same amount would decrease the graduation rate by 0.7 percentage

points; recall that we hypothesize that this latter result reflects a greater share of

instructional expenditure being devoted to departmental research when budgeted research

expenditures are higher.

        Given the fiscal condition that our nation’s academic institutions are facing, it is

probably not realistic to expect that institutions will easily be able to increase

expenditures per student in any category by $500. So in the bottom row of the table that it

titled “Reallocate” we perform a different simulation. Here we ask if one were to reduce

an institution’s institutional expenditures per student by $500 and simultaneously

increase its student services expenditure per student by the same amount, what would the

impact be on the institution’s graduation rate? The simulation methodology is very

similar to that described above. On average, our simulation suggests that this type of

change would increase an institution’s graduation rate by 0.3 percentage points.

        This finding is one that neither faculty around the country worried about declining

funding for faculty positions nor critics of higher education who point to the wasteful

growth of expenditures on non instructional uses are likely to be happy about. But our

key words are “on average”. What is true on average is not necessarily true for all

categories of institutions so in the remaining columns of the table we pursue our analyses

further for various subsamples of the data.




                                               12
        Turning first to a comparison of lower and higher SAT institutions, the marginal

effect on graduation rates of increasing student service expenditures by $500 per student

is much larger at institutions whose students have lower SAT scores (1.7 percentage

points) than it is at institutions whose students have higher SAT scores (0.3 percentage

points) (columns 2 and 3). The marginal impact of increasing instructional expenditures

per student by $500 is roughly the same at the two types of institutions; 0.4 and 0.3

percentage points, respectively. Not surprising then, when we simulate the impact of

simultaneously increasing student service expenditures by $500 per student and reducing

instructional expenditures by the same amount, graduation rates are estimated to increase

by 1.3 percentage points at the low SAT schools, but to remain essentially unchanged at

the higher SAT schools. Put simply, our analyses suggest that at the margin the activities

that student service expenditures fund influence graduation rates much more for students

with lower entrance test scores.14

        Turning next to a comparison of school which receive lower levels and higher

levels of Pell Grant expenditures per student (columns 4 and 5), the increase in the six-

year graduation rate of increasing student service expenditures by $500 per student is

only 0.2 percentage points at the former institutions, but 1.1 percentage points at the latter

institutions. The marginal impact of an increase in instructional expenditures per student

on the graduation rate is slightly smaller at the former institutions (0.2 percentage points)

than it is at the latter institutions (0.5 percentage points. And, in the simulations that

reallocate $500 per student from the instructional to student service expenditures, we find

14
  Another way of making the same point is to say that we estimate that the proportion of our observations
for which the marginal effect of student services expenditures was statistically significantly greater than
zero was 0.77 for the low SAT schools and 0 for the high SAT schools. For this test, marginal effects were
calculated analytically, and standard errors were obtained using the Delta Method (George Casella and
Roger Berger (2001), p. 240)


                                                    13
that the graduation rates at the higher Pell Grant institutions would increase by about 0.5

percentage points but those at the lower Pell Grant institutions would fall by a very small

amount (0.03 percentage points).15 These results suggest that at the margin the activities

that student service expenditures fund influence persistence rates much more for students

coming from lower-income families.

         The next three columns present analyses separately for bachelors, masters, and

doctoral institutions. The marginal impact of an increase in student service expenditures

of $500 per student is larger at the bachelors’ institutions (1.1 percentage points) than it is

at the masters’ institutions (0.9 percentage points), which in turn is larger than it is at the

doctoral institutions (0.7 percentage points). This may reflect that the students in the most

need of a supportive student service expenditure environment voluntarily select to attend

smaller academic institutions. Given this finding, it is not surprising that in our

reallocations simulations, on average the greatest positive effect of the reallocation occurs

at the bachelors’ institutions.

         Briefly noting two other results in this table, academic support service

expenditures have a statistically significant positive impact on graduation rates only in

the higher SAT, the PhD, and the private institution subsamples; in these cases the

marginal effect of an increase in academic support service expenditures of $500 is about

(0.5 to 1.0 percentage points). In contrast, increases in budgeted research expenditures

per student have statistically significant negative effects on graduation rates primarily at

the higher SAT level, the higher level of Pell Grant recipient, the PhD, and the public

institutions in our sample.

15
  Similarly to above, we estimate that the proportion of our observations for which the marginal effect of
student service expenditures was statistically significantly greater than zero was 0.56 for the high Pell
Grant dollars per student schools, but 0 for the low Pell Grant dollar schools.


                                                    14
       V.     Empirical Extensions

       Two empirical extensions of our analysis warrant being briefly reported. First,

another way to analyze the data is to allow the impact of the explanatory variables to vary

with the current level of an institution’s six-year graduation rate. We use an econometric

method called unconditional quantile regression to do this.16 This method allows us to

illustrate how the impact of the marginal effects of changing instructional and student

service expenditures per student vary at different points in the current institutional

graduation rate distribution.

       Estimates of the coefficients of the student services and instructional expenditure

variables that we obtained when we used this method, as well as the marginal effect of

increasing expenditures in each category by $500 per student, holding all other variables

constant, and the marginal effect of increasing student service expenditures and

decreasing instructional expenditures simultaneously by $500 per student appear in table

4.17

       Quite strikingly, these estimates suggest that the marginal effect of increasing student

service expenditures by $500 per student on graduation rates is larger at low current

graduation rate schools than it is at higher current graduation rate schools. The effect is

an increase of greater than 2.0 percentage points in the graduation rate for institutions at

which the graduation rate is initially 50 percent or less. It declines monotonically with the

initial graduation rate after then and is less than 0.5 percentage points once the 70th

percentile in the graduation rate distribution is reached. In contrast, the marginal effect of

method that they propose
17
   The other variables included in the models are the same as those found in column 3 of table 2, including
academic support expenditures and budgeted research expenditures per student.


                                                    15
increasing instructional expenditures by $500 per student on the graduation rate is greater

than 0.9 percentage points for institutions between the 15th and 80th percentile in the

graduation rate distribution, but the effect is much smaller for lower and higher initial

graduation rate institutions. As a results of these two patterns of estimated effects, if one

reallocated $500 per student from instructional expenditures to student service

expenditures, we estimate that this would increase an institution’s graduation rate by

more than 1 percentage point if the institution was in the lowest 60 percent of institutions

in terms of its graduation rate initially,, but for higher initial graduation rates, the effect of

the reallocation would quickly approach zero or become negative.

     Our second extension is to re estimate equation (1) using an institutions persistence

rate, the fraction of its first-year full-time students who enroll at the institution for their

second year as the dependent variables. Information on institutional persistence rates

comes from the College Board’s Annual Survey of Colleges: Standard Research Tape.

Estimates of the coefficients of the student service and instructional expenditure variables

derived from estimating this equation, as well as the marginal effects of simulating the

impacts of $500 increases in expenditure per student for the two categories, for various

subsamples of the data, appear in Table 5.18 The sample size analyzed in this table are

somewhat smaller than those reported in table 3; the drop off in sample size is higher for

low SAT institutions than it is for high SAT institutions and higher for high Pell Grant

dollars per student institutions than it is for lower Pell Grant dollars per student

institutions.




18
  When we estimate the persistence equations only a single year’s lagged value of the expenditure category
and Pell Grant expenditure variables are used.


                                                   16
     Similar to the graduation rate equations, the marginal effects of increasing student

service expenditures by $500 per student on an institution’s persistence rate is higher for

lower SAT schools higher Pell Grant dollars per student schools. But the magnitudes of

these effects are much smaller than they are on the six-year graduation rates. Other

factors held constant, an increase in student service expenditures of $500 per student

would increase the persistence rate at the lower SAT schools by 0.7 percentage points

and at the higher Pell Grant dollar schools by only 0.1 percentage points. While student

service expenditures matter, they do not seem to matter much for enhancing first year

persistence rates as they do for enhancing six-year graduation rates.

     Table 6 reports the results when we use unconditional quantile regression methods to

analyze the persistence rate data. Similar to the graduation rate analyses reported in table

4, the marginal impact on persistence rates of an increase in student service expenditures

of $500 per student is largest for the institutions whose initial persistence rates are in the

lower half of the institutions in our sample and our reallocation simulations suggest that

improvements in graduation rates would occur primarily for institutions whose initial

persistence rates were below the median in the sample.19

     VI.     Concluding Remarks

     Student service expenditures influence graduation and first-year persistence rates.

They matter more for students at schools with lower entrance test scores than they do at

schools with higher entrance test scores and the matter more at schools that have a larger

number of Pell Grant dollars per undergraduate student than they do at schools that have


19
  One extension that we did not pursue was the estimation of graduation rate equations using “stochastic
frontier methods”. Kokkelenberg, Sinha, Porter and Blose (2008) have shown that while the estimation of
four-year and five-year graduation rate equations are sensitive to the use of such methods, the estimation of
six-year graduation rate equations are not.


                                                     17
a smaller number of Pell Grant dollars per student. And, perhaps another way of saying

the same thing, they matter more for schools that have lower graduation and persistence

rates than they do for schools that have higher graduation and persistence rates.

   Our simulations suggest that reallocating some funds from instructional expenditures

to student service expenditures would enhance graduation and persistence rates at the

former types of schools. Institutions with higher entrance test scores and lower levels of

Pell Grant dollars per student would not see their graduation rates increase very much if

they performed similar reallocations; put simply these institutions, which tend to be the

higher persistence and graduation rate institutions probably have already achieved the

correct balance of expenditures between instructional and student service expenditures.

   Our finding that enhancing student service expenditures, even at the expense of

reducing instructional expenditures, may enhance graduation rates at some institutions is

not a call by us for institutions to do this. Student service expenditures cover a wide range

of categories and the IPEDs data that we have used in this paper do not permit us to

analyze which of these subcategories of expenditures are the ones that matter. But our

findings do suggest that these institutions should be sensitive to the issue and that

research is needed to determine which categories of student service expenditures are the

ones that matter.

   Perhaps our most disturbing finding is that all other things, including instructional

expenditures per student constant, higher levels of budgeted research expenditures per

student appear to be associated with lower graduation rates. We have speculated, but the

IPEDs data do not permit us to verify this speculation, that this relationship arises

because institutions with higher levels of budgeted research are also institutions in which




                                             18
a greater share of instructional expenditures are devoted to departmental research. Given

the social concerns associated with the increasing costs of higher education, we would

suggest that it is in the social interest for academic institutions to address what the

appropriate share of departmental research should be in their instructional expenditure

budgets.

Notes: The SAT and expenditure variables are defined as in Table 1. UNDERSTUDENT, UNDERSTUDENT2,
GRADSTUDENT, and GRADSTUDENT2 represent linear and quadratic terms for the full-time equivalent number of
undergraduate and graduate students. Note that the small estimated coefficient of the undergraduate variables is due to
the data having been weighted by undergraduate enrollment. HBCU is an indicator for whether an institution is a
Historically Black College or University. HISPANIC ASIAN AMINDIAN BLACK and MALE represent the
proportion of each demographic group in each institution. Degree controls is a collection of variables indicating the
proportion of degrees obtained in each of 15 fields (Agriculture, Architecture, Biological Sciences, Business,
Communications, Education, Engineering, Health, Humanities, Legal, Math, Military, Performing Arts, Physical
Sciences, Social Sciences). PELL is expressed in thousands of dollars, the enrollment variables are expressed in
thousands of students, and MEDIANSAT is expressed in hundreds of points. Carnegie Controls is a collection of
variables controlling for the Carnegie Classification of the institution. (Source: Delta Cost/IPEDS database and
College Board) Standard errors are clustered at the institution level. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10
percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent levels respectively.
