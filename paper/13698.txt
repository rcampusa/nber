found in the data and argue that firm and market specific demand shocks help explain a number of
these anomalies. These parsimoniously capture factors, like business contacts or networks, or even
fashion shocks, that make buyers more attracted to one firm rather than another in a particular market.

Hiau Looi Kee and Kala Krishna∗

        This paper looks at the predictions of a standard heterogeneous firm model regarding the

exports of firms across markets in response to a particular trade policy “experiment” and

compares these predictions to the data. A unique feature of our data is that it has information

on the exports of the same firm to diﬀerent markets which allows us to look for a new set

of predictions of such models. We argue that while certain predictions seem consistent with

the data, others are not. We then describe the patterns found in the data and argue that

firm and market specific demand shocks help explain a number of these anomalies. These

parsimoniously capture factors, like business contacts or networks, or even fashion shocks,

that make buyers more attracted to one firm rather than another in a particular market.



I        A Natural Policy Experiment

The apparel sector in Bangladesh has two sub-sectors: garments made from woven cloth, and

those made from non-woven material, namely, sweaters and knitwear. These diﬀer in terms

of the “eﬀective” trade policy put on them by the US and EU which are Bangladesh’s main

markets. The EU had an MFN tariﬀ rate of 12-15% on the various categories of apparel

with GSP preferences of 20%. But under the “Everything-But-Arms” (EBA) initiative

implemented in 2001, Bangladesh had access to the EU, duty and quota free, provided

that the rules of origin (ROOs) were satisfied. However, these ROOs were restrictive: for

origin to be granted, the product had to start its local manufacturing process from yarn so

that the use of imported cloth was precluded.1 The US, on the other hand, had tariﬀs of

about 20%, as well as quota restrictions in place on Bangladesh, but origin was granted as

long as the product was assembled in Bangladesh. Thus, imported cloth could be used when

exporting to the US.

       These ROOs have very diﬀerent implications for the non-woven and woven garments.

Due to current production techniques, non-woven (NW) firms are able to easily manufacture

garments from yarn and domestic yarn is abundant. But woven (W) firms need to use

domestic cloth, which commands a premium price, to obtain origin and meeting ROOs

raises costs by about as much as the tariﬀ. In a nutshell therefore, EU eﬀective trade policy

is slightly less restrictive than that of the US in wovens, but is much less restrictive in

nonwovens. This is our natural experiment.



II        Implications of a Heterogeneous Firm Model

Firms make varieties of a good which enter utility in a symmetric manner. However, they

have diﬀerent productivities, and hence, diﬀerent constant marginal costs of production. In

such models, more restrictive trade policy makes the market tougher for a firm exporting to

it for two reasons. First, there is the direct eﬀect of more protection which reduces a firm’s

profits. Second, there is an indirect eﬀect via the equilibrium aggregate price index in the

market. Marc Melitz and Gianmarco I.P. Ottaviano (2005) show that in such models, as long

as the fixed cost of exporting is large so that only the more productive firms export, a fact

borne out in a number of studies, a more protectionist stance increases the market potential

of a country and results in more firms locating there, more varieties competing with each

other, and hence, a lower price index. But a lower price index means more competition and

lower profits. Thus, more restrictive trade policy in a market results in lower profits to a

firms exporting to it via both channels.2

       Assuming that the US and EU are otherwise similar, this yields the result that profits to

Bangladeshi firms from exporting to the US should be lower than those from exporting to

   2
     Some evidence that this occurs in the data can be found in Imbs et. al. (2006) who show that for
EU countries, trade openness seems to exert a competitive eﬀect in the short run, with prices and markups
falling. However, these eﬀects diminish, and may even be reversed, in the longer run as more protected
economies attract entry.

the EU (as the EU trade policy is more lax). As a result, the minimum productivity required

to survive in the US should be higher than that for the EU, especially in nonwovens where

their trade policy stand diﬀers by more. Productivity, thus, provides a natural hierarchy of

firms, with more productive firms being able to export to increasingly tougher markets.


A     The Data and the Predictions

Next we look at the data we have, the predictions the standard model delivers for our natural

experiment, and how the predictions fit with our data. We conduct our analysis based on a

complete customs data set of Bangladeshi garment exporters. This data set consists on all

firms exporting in 2004, with information on their total value and volume of export by the

major markets, namely, the EU and the US. There are a total of 2387 firms, of which 2211

export to the EU, the US or both. By matching these firms to the garment firm directory

in 2004, we were able to identify the industry origins of 1997 firms.

    The model sketched above makes the following predictions:

    1. As the EU is an easier market, especially in nonwovens, the fraction of firms in

Bangladesh that export only to the EU (OEU firms) in nonwovens should exceed that in

wovens while the reverse should be the case for firms that also export to the US (AUS firms).

This prediction is consistent with our data. From Figure 1 it is clear that the fraction of

OEU firms in nonwovens (≈ 75%) exceeds that in wovens (≈ 53%). The fraction of AUS

firms in nonwovens (≈ 22%) is smaller than in wovens (≈ 28%).

       2. OEU firms should have smaller average market shares in the EU than AUS firms,

especially in nonwovens, since OEU firms should be less productive than AUS ones, especially

in nonwovens, and as market shares are higher for more productive firms. Figure 2 shows

that, as predicted, the average market share of OEU firms is smaller than the average market

share (in both the US and EU) of AUS firms, and this is more pronounced in nonwovens.

       3. If a firm sells to the US it must also sell to the EU as the US is the tougher market.

There can be no firms selling only to the US (OUS firms).3 Here the data is clearly at odds

with the theory. In both industries together a small fraction of firms export only to the US.4

This might be classified as error, except for the fact that these firms are very diﬀerent from

the remainder. The average market share of firms that only export to the US in Figure 2

is an order of magnitude higher than that of the others, which would be a sign that they

are very productive in the standard model, and which makes their not exporting to the EU

even more of a puzzle! It is worth pointing out that the fraction OUS firms is far smaller

and their share is much larger in nonwovens than in wovens.

       4. As market share is increasing in productivity, which is firm specific, firms that sell

to both markets should have market shares in the two markets that are strongly positively

correlated. Consider the group of 548 firms that export to both the EU and the US in both

industries. Let sE                                                                U
                 ij be the market share of firm i in the EU in industry j, while sij is the


   3
     This result is similar to Mark J. Melitz (2003), where all exporters must also sell in the domestic market,
given that the cutoﬀ productivity for exporting is higher.
   4
     Jonathan Eaton, Samuel Kortum and Francis Kramarz (2004) have a similar finding: while more pro-
ductive firms tend to export to more markets, a strict heirarchy does not emerge.

market share of the same firm in the US. This market share is relative to Bangladeshi exports

to the country in question. The model predicts that the log of the market shares of firm i

in both markets are positively correlated.5 Let

                                        ij = Dj + β ln sij , j = {NW, W } .




The data clearly rejects this prediction. Not only is β not close to one, it is not even

statistically diﬀerent from zero. The estimated elasticity is 0.02 with a robust standard error

of 0.04. Similar results are obtained when we run the regression separately by industries.

      5. Since higher cost (lower productivity) firms can remain exporters to the EU, and as

higher costs translate into higher prices, the price of OEU exporters should also be higher

than that of AUS ones. This is not borne out in the data. Figure 3 plots the mean unit

value of OEU firms, OUS firms, and AUS firms (here the unit value for US exports is given

separately from the unit value of EU exports) in both wovens and nonwovens. The unit

value of firms that export to the EU is slightly less than the unit value of EU exports of

those firms that also export to the US, and this is less than the unit value of firms that

export only to the US, which in turn is less than the unit value of US exports of those

firms that also export to the EU. This pattern is the same for both wovens and nonwovens,

though these diﬀerences are not statistically significant. An alternative explanation for more

productive firms charging a higher price, namely they produce a higher quality good, is worth

  5
      In the standard Marc J. Melitz (2003) framework it predicts that the coeﬃcient β below should be unity.
considering. Firm quality, like its productivity, is likely to be common across all the market

served by a firm (as noted by Richard Baldwin and James Harrigan, 2007). If this were an

important reason for unit values to vary, then we would expect that for AUS firms, their

price in the EU market would be positively correlated with their prices in the US market.

We regress the log of unit value in the EU market on the log of unit value in the US market

for these firms, controlling for industry-year specific eﬀects. The partial correlation between

the two prices is not statistically significant, with a point estimate of 0.069 and a robust

standard error of 0.044.

   What could explain these facts? Below, we argue that firm and market specific shocks

can provide such an explanation.



III     Demand Shocks

In what follows, we will look at the implications of the EU being an easier market than the

US for Bangladeshi firms, assuming that everything else is the same in the two countries,

and focusing on the price charged, p, productivity, φ, and demand shock, μ. The demand for

a firm with shock μ is q(p, μ), with qμ (p, μ) > 0. Both additive demand shocks q(p) + μ, or

multiplicative ones, q(p)μ, are consistent with this specification. The profits of a firms with

demand shock μ and productivity φ are given by



                              π(p, φ, μ) = [p − c(φ)] q(p, μ) − f.

The profit maximizing price, p(φ, μ), is given by the p that solves π p (p, φ, μ) = 0. Let


                     π(p(φ, μ), φ, μ) = [p(φ, μ) − c(φ)] [q(p(φ, μ), μ)] − f


be the maximized value of profits of the firm with (firm and market specific) demand shock

μ, where p(φ, μ) is the profit maximizing price for such a firm.

   Note that π pp (p, φ, μ) < 0 by the second order conditions for a maximum, and π pμ (p, φ, μ) is

positive if demand shocks are additive but zero if they are multiplicative. Some simple com-

parative statics results follow from these observations. First, firms with positive demand

shocks charge higher prices if demand shocks are additive (since such shocks make demand

less elastic) but the same prices if demand shocks are multiplicative (as such a shock re-

sults in a monotonic transformation of profits) while firms with a higher productivity always

charge lower prices.

   Second, assuming demand is positive, a positive demand shock raises sales, and hence,

market share of the firm if demand shocks are multiplicative. If demand shocks are additive,

then sales and market share may fall in this event. This follows from


                  dq (p(φ, μ), μ)                   dp(φ, μ)
                                  = qp (p(φ, μ), μ)          + qμ (p(φ, μ), μ) .
                        dμ                            dμ


The first term above is zero if shocks are multiplicative, and as the second term is always

positive, the result follows. If shocks are additive, the first term is negative from Result 1

and works against the second term.

   Third, a positive demand shock or a higher productivity raises the maximized value of

profits. This follows from the envelope theorem. As firms with profits high enough to cover

fixed costs of exporting choose to export, the export productivity cutoﬀ falls as the demand

shock rises.   This is depicted in Figure 4 where the demand shocks in the US and EU are

both depicted on the horizontal axis and productivity is on the vertical one. The cutoﬀs for
exporting to the US are depicted by a downward sloping locus. Even less productive firms

can aﬀord to export to the tougher US market if they have a good enough demand shock.

This locus is drawn to be linear but need not be.6 The cutoﬀ locus for exporting to the EU

lies inside that for exporting to the US as the EU is the easier market.

    It follows that for the same demand shock in both markets, firms that export to the

US, which is the tougher market (whether as AUS or OUS firms), have higher productivity

than those that export to the EU, and so have lower prices. For a given productivity, and

assuming that the demand shocks for the US and EU are drawn from the same distribution,

firms that export to the US (whether as AUS or OUS firms) have higher US demand shocks

than the EU demand shocks of those firms that export to the EU (whether as OEU or AUS

firms). This follows from the cutoﬀ locus for the EU being inside that for the US as depicted

in Figure 4 since the US is the tougher market. Of course, the distance between the loci is

smaller for wovens than nonwovens since the trade policy stance of the EU is much more

liberal than that of the US in non wovens.



IV       The Evidence Revisited

What does the augmented model with demand shocks predict, and are these predictions

consistent with the evidence?

    Predictions 1 and 2: Though the evidence is consistent with Predictions 1 and 2, these

predictions need not hold due to the trade oﬀ between productivity and demand shocks in

determining the export destinations of firms. For example, it is possible, without controlling

for demand shocks, for the productivity of OEU exporters to exceed that of AUS firms

if the US demand shocks of the AUS firms are large enough to compensate for their low

productivity. For the same reason, the average market share of OEU firms could exceed that

of AUS firms.

   6
     For example, if demand shocks are multiplicative and preferences are CES, then this locus cannot
intersect the axes. This follows from the observation that no matter what the productivity, and hence, cost,
there will be some demand for each good when preferences take a CES form. However, if demand shocks are
additive, this need not be the case.
       Suppose, for example, that there are only high productivity firms and low productivity

ones, with the former tending to receive low demand shocks, while the latter tending to

receive high demand shocks.7 In Figure 4, let the demand shocks in the US and EU for high

productivity firms be clustered in the region around A while those for low productivity firms

be clustered near B. Then both high and low productivity firms will export to the EU, but

only low productivity firms will tend to have demand shocks high enough to export to the

US. Note that the productivity of OEU exporters could easily exceed that of AUS firms if

we do not control for demand shocks. Also, the average market shares of OEU firms need

not be less than that of AUS ones since the greater productivity of the former raises their

share, but their lower demand shock reduces it, so that the net eﬀect is ambiguous.8

       Prediction 3: With two dimensions of heterogeneity, it is possible for a firm to export

to the US and not to the EU. In Figure 4, take a firm with productivity U and draw a

horizontal line at this level. This line intersects the EU cutoﬀ locus at F and the US one at

G. If this firm gets a demand shock in the US above (below) G, then it will (will not) export

to the US. Similarly, if this firm gets a demand shock in the EU above (below) F, then it

will (will not) export to the EU. Thus, if it gets a bad demand shock (one that is below F)

in the EU and a good demand shock (one that is above G) in the US, it will export to the

US but not to the EU.

       Does the augmented model oﬀer anything else to look for in the data? For a firm to

export only to the US it needs to have a demand shock in the US that is large enough and

a demand shock in the EU that is small enough. The less restrictive trade policy is in the

EU, or the more restrictive trade policy is in the US, the less likely this is to happen. Thus,

this outcome will be more likely in wovens than in nonwovens. Consistent with this, in the

data, the fraction of firms in nonwovens that export only to the US is much smaller (2.1%)

than the fraction of firms in wovens that do so (19%).

   7
     This could happen, for example, in a transition country. Low productivity firms in transition countries
are old firms. However, they have access to a good network of buyers, and so tend to have better demand
shocks than new entrants who have higher productivity.
   8
     Loosely speaking, predictions 1 and 2 will tend to hold if productivities and demand shocks are positively
correlated, or if most of the variation is in productivities, rather than demand shocks.
      Moreover, as higher demand shocks result in larger market shares, the market share of

OUS exporters should be higher than that of others, especially in nonwovens, where OEU

firms need to have far more positive demand shocks in the US than in the EU. Consistent

with this, the distribution of market shares in nonwovens of OUS firms is far to the right of

that for OEU firms with a mean of 1.3% versus 0.01%.9 The distribution of market shares

in wovens is much closer together. The mean market share for firms that only export to the

EU is 0.1%, while that of firms only exporting to the US is 0.2%, or about double.

      Prediction 4: With demand shocks, it is no longer necessary for larger market shares

to reflect higher productivity or for the market shares of firms that export to both EU

and US to be strongly positively correlated, as market shares could be higher because of

better demand shocks. By omitting the relative US demand shock in (1) , which is positively

correlated with the US market share and negatively correlated with the EU market share, the

least square estimate is biased toward zero which could explain our findings in this regard.

      In the absence of capacity constraints, market shares in one market should be independent

of demand shocks in the other, but with capacity constraints, market shares across markets

would be negatively correlated and larger capacity associated with serving more markets.10

Suppose capacity constraints make marginal costs vertical when they become binding. A

firm would then look at the horizontal sum of its demands in the two markets and equate

the marginal revenue associated with this total demand curve to marginal costs. Given

productivity, a firm with a larger capacity would be more likely to sell to both markets

and a better relative demand shock in one market would raise a firm’s market share in that

market while reducing it in the other one. This would provide another source of downward

bias in β.

      Prediction 5: OEU firms have lower demand shocks as well as productivities. The

former predicts higher prices for them, but the latter predicts lower prices if demand shocks

are additive. The unit values of OEU firms being lower than the unit value of EU exports of

AUS firms is consistent with the latter eﬀect dominating and the unit values of OUS firms

  9
      All the mean values are calculated after removing outliers at the tail ends of the distributions.
 10
      This might provide a new test for the existence of capacity constraints in such models.
exceeding those of other firms is consistent with their having more positive demand shocks.



V      Conclusions

Firm heterogeneity is likely to be multifaceted, with firm and market specific demand shocks

playing a prominent role. We provide supporting evidence for the importance of demand

shocks looking at unit values and the market shares of all exporters using a complete custom

data of these exporters. We cannot estimate TFP for these firms, but by looking at the data

on market shares and unit values, we paint a picture that is inconsistent with heterogeneity

in productivity alone and much more in line with both demand shocks and productivity

being important.

    Recognizing the importance of firm demand shocks has several important implications

for work in this area. First, it implies that the standard approach taken of estimating

firm productivity ignoring demand shocks is likely to produce biased estimates and any

subsequent analysis based on such estimates may not be meaningful. In the revised version

of Demidova, Kee and Krishna (2006), we address these estimation issues in detail and are

also able to back out estimates of these market specific demand shocks. Second, one can

interpret demand shocks in a static model in terms of access to a network of buyers in a

market. This would make such shocks persistent but market specific (compared to firm

specific productivity shocks which are common across markets). Small young firms would

tend to have lower access to such a network and so have less persistent shocks. This could

help explain why exporter status changes so often for such firms, while it is more permanent

for older firms as documented by Jonathan Eaton et. al. (2008). Third, trade liberalization

will move resources from the less productive firms to more productive ones and from firms

with unfavorable demand shocks to those that have favorable ones. If these two are positively

correlated, then gains from trade may be larger than in the absence of demand shocks, while

if they are negatively correlated, as may well be the case in transition countries or countries

with an old, ineﬃcient, but well connected public sector, they could be smaller.
