      Even though stock returns are not highly autocorrelated, there is a spurious regression bias in
predictive regressions for stock returns related to the classic studies of Yule (1926) and Granger and
Newbold (1974). Data mining for predictor variables interacts with spurious regression bias. The two
effects reinforce each other, because more highly persistent series are more likely to be found significant
in the search for predictor variables. Our simulations suggest that many of the regressions in the
literature, based on individual predictor variables, may be spurious

PREDICTIVE MODELS for common stock returns have long been a staple of financial

economics. Early studies, reviewed by Fama (1970), used such models to examine

market efficiency.    Stock returns are assumed to be predictable, based on lagged

instrumental variables, in the current conditional asset pricing literature. Standard

lagged variables include the levels of short-term interest rates, payout-to-price ratios for

stock market indexes, and yield spreads between low-grade and high-grade bonds or

between long- and short-term bonds. Many of these variables behave as persistent, or

highly autocorrelated, time series. Table I surveys major studies that propose predictor

variables.

       This paper studies the finite sample properties of stock return regressions with

persistent lagged regressors. We focus on two issues. The first is spurious regression,

analogous to Yule (1926) and Granger and Newbold (1974). These studies warned that

spurious relations may be found between the levels of trending time series that are

actually independent. For example, given two independent random walks, it is likely

that a regression of one on the other will produce a "significant" slope coefficient,

evaluated by the usual t-statistics.

       In this paper the dependent variables are asset rates of return, which are not

highly persistent. Thus, one may think that spurious regression problems are unlikely.

However, the returns may be considered to be the sum of an unobserved expected

return, plus unpredictable noise. If the underlying expected returns are persistent time

series there is still a risk of spurious regression.    Because the unpredictable noise

represents a substantial portion of the variance of stock returns, the spurious regression

results will differ from those in the classical setting.

       The second issue is "data mining," as studied for stock returns by Lo and

MacKinlay (1990), Foster, Smith and Whaley (1997) and others.           If the standard

instruments employed in the literature arise as the result of a collective search through

the data, they may have no predictive power in the future. Stylized "facts" about the

dynamic behavior of stock returns, using these instruments (e.g., Cochrane, 2001) could

be artifacts of the sample. Such concerns are natural, given the widespread interest in

predicting stock returns.

       We focus on spurious regression and the interaction between data mining and

spurious regression bias. If the underlying expected return is not predictable over time,

there is no spurious regression bias, even if the chosen regressor is highly

autocorrelated. In this case, our analysis reduces to pure data mining as studied by

Foster, Smith and Whaley (1997).

       When expected returns are persistent, spurious regression bias calls some of the

evidence of previous studies into question. We examine univariate regressions for the

Standard and Poors 500 (SP500) excess return using 13 popular lagged instruments,

over the sample periods of the original studies. We find that seven of 26 t-ratios or

regression R-squares, significant by the usual 5% criteria, are consistent with the null

hypothesis of a spurious regression.

       The spurious regression and data mining affects reinforce each other.           If

researchers have mined the data for regressors that produce high "R-squares" in

predictive regressions, the mining is more likely to uncover the spurious, persistent
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                             3


regressors. The standard regressors in the literature tend to be highly autocorrelated, as

expected if the regressors result from a spurious mining process.         For reasonable

parameter values, all of the regressions that we review from the literature are consistent

with a spurious mining process, even when only a small number of instruments are

considered in the mining.

       This paper contributes to a substantial literature which studies the sampling

properties of predictive regressions for stock returns. Stambaugh (1999), Nelson and

Kim (1993), Goetzmann and Jorion (1993) and Bekaert, Hodrick and Marshall (1997)

study biases due to dependent stochastic regressors. Kim, Nelson and Startz (1991)

study structural change induced misspecification. Campbell and Shiller (1988) consider

dependent regressors with unit roots. Kandel and Stambaugh (1990), Fama and French

(1988a) and Hodrick (1992) focus on autocorrelation for long-horizon stock returns.

Lanne (2001) develops a general test of predictability in the presence of near unit roots.

Pesaran and Timmermann (1995), Bossaerts and Hillion (1999), Goyal and Welch (1999)

and Simin (2002) examine model selection and out-of-sample validity. Boudoukh and

Richardson (1994) provide an overview.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section I describes the data.

Section II presents the models used in the simulation experiments. Section III presents

the results. First, we study the spurious regression issue in isolation. Then we consider

the interaction between spurious regression and data mining biases. Section IV offers

concluding remarks.

                                     I. The Data
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                              4


       Table I surveys nine of the major studies that propose instruments for predicting

stock returns. The table reports summary statistics for monthly data, covering various

subperiods of 1926 through 1998. The sample size and period depends on the study

and the variable, and the table provides the details. We attempt to replicate the data

series that were used in the original studies as closely as possible. The summary

statistics are from our data. Note that the first order autocorrelations frequently suggest

a high degree of persistence. For example, the short term Treasury bill yields, monthly

book-to-market ratios, the dividend yield of the SP500 and some of the yield spreads

have sample first order autocorrelations of 0.97 or higher.

       Table I also summarizes regressions for the monthly return of the SP500 stock

index, measured in excess of the one-month Treasury bill return from Ibbotson

Associates, on the lagged instruments. These are OLS regressions using one instrument

at a time. We report the slope coefficients, their t-ratios and the adjusted R-squares.

The R-squares range from less than 1% to more than 7%, and eight of the 13 t-ratios are

larger than 2.0. The t-ratios are based on the OLS slopes and Newey-West (1987)

standard errors, where the number of lags is chosen based on the number of statistically

significant residual autocorrelations.1

       The small R-squares in Table I suggest that predictability represents a tiny



  1 Specifically, we compute twelve sample autocorrelations and compare the values with
a cutoff at two approximate standard errors: 2/√T, where T is the sample size. The
number of lags chosen is the minimum lag length at which no higher order
autocorrelation is larger than two standard errors. The number of lags chosen is indicated
in the far right column.
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                            5


fraction of the variance in stock returns. However, even a small R-squared can signal

economically significant predictability. For example, Kandel and Stambaugh (1996) and

Fleming, Kirby and Ostdiek (2001) find that optimal portfolios respond by a substantial

amount to small R-squares in standard models. Studies combining several instruments

in multiple regressions report higher R-squares. For example, Harvey (1989), using five

instruments, reports adjusted R-squares as high as 17.9% for size portfolios. Ferson and

Harvey (1991) report R-squares of 5.8% to 13.7% for monthly size and industry portfolio

returns. These values suggest that the "true" R-squared, if we could regress the stock

return on its time-varying conditional mean, might be substantially higher than we see

in Table I.   To accommodate this possibility, we allow the true R-squares in our

simulations to vary over the range from zero to 15%. For exposition we focus on an

intermediate value of 10%.



A. Potential Instruments

       To incorporate data mining, we compile a randomly-selected sample of 500

potential instruments, through which our simulated analyst sifts to mine the data for

predictor variables. We select the 500 series randomly from a much larger sample of

10,866 potential variables. The specifics are described in the Appendix. Essentially, the

procedure is to generate uniformly distributed random numbers, order the series from 1

to 10,866 and randomly extract 500 series. The 500 series are randomly ordered, and

permanently assigned numbers between 1 and 500.            When a data miner in our

simulations searches through, say 50 series, we use the sampling properties of the 50
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                               6


series to calibrate the parameters in the simulations.

       We also use our sample of potential instruments to calibrate the parameters that

govern the amount of persistence in the "true" expected returns in the model. On the

one hand, if the instruments we see in the literature, summarized in Table I, arise from a

spurious mining process, they are likely to be more highly autocorrelated than the

underlying "true" expected stock return. On the other hand, if the instruments in the

literature are a realistic representation of expected stock returns, the autocorrelations in

Table I may be a good proxy for the persistence of the true expected returns.2 The mean

autocorrelation of our 500 series is 15% and the median is 2%. Eleven of the 13 sample

autocorrelations in Table I are higher than 15%, and the median value is 95%. We

consider a range of values for the true autocorrelation based on these figures, as

described below.



                                    II. The Models

       Consider a situation in which an analyst runs a time-series regression for the

future stock return, rt+1, on a lagged predictor variable:




  2  There are good reasons to think that expected stock returns may be persistent. Asset
pricing models like the consumption model of Lucas (1978) describe expected stock
returns as functions of expected economic growth rates. Merton (1973) and Cox, Ingersoll
and Ross (1985) propose real interest rates as candidate state variables, driving expected
returns in intertemporal models. Such variables are likely to be highly persistent.
Empirical models for stock return dynamics frequently involve persistent, autoregressive
expected returns (e.g. Lo and MacKinlay (1988), Conrad and Kaul (1988), Fama and
French (1988b) or Huberman and Kandel, 1990).
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                                       7


                             rt+1 =     +   Zt + vt+1.                                      (1)



The data are actually generated by an unobserved latent variable, Zt*, as:



                             rt+1 =     + Zt* + ut+1,                                       (2)



where ut+1 is white noise with variance,         u2.    We interpret the latent variable, Zt* as the

deviations of the conditional mean return from the unconditional mean, , where the

expectations are conditioned on an unobserved "market" information set at time t. The

predictor variables follow an autoregressive process:


                                   ρ * 0 
                     (Zt*,Zt)’ =          (Zt-1*,Zt-1)’ + (    t*, t)’.                   (3)
                                    0 ρ


       The assumption that the true expected return is autoregressive follows previous

studies such as Lo and MacKinlay (1988), Conrad and Kaul (1988), Fama and French

(1988b), and Huberman and Kandel (1990).

       To generate the artificial data, the errors (        t*, t)   are drawn randomly as a normal

vector with mean zero and covariance matrix, . We build up the time-series of the Z

and Z* through the vector autoregression equation (3), where the initial values are

drawn from a normal with mean zero and variances, Var(Z) and Var(Z*). The other

parameters that calibrate the simulations are { ,          u2,   ,    *,   and }.

       We have a situation in which the "true" returns may be predictable, if Zt* could be
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                                        8


observed. This is captured by the true R-squared, Var(Z*)/[Var(Z*)+            u2].   We set Var(Z*)

to equal the sample variance of the SP500 return, in excess of a one-month Treasury bill

return, multiplied by 0.10. When the true R-squared of the simulation is 10%, the

unconditional variance of the rt+1 that we generate is equal to the sample variance of the

SP500 return, and the first order autocorrelation is similar to that of the actual data.

When we choose other values for the true R-squared, these determine the values for the

parameter   u2.   We set     to equal the sample mean excess return of the SP500 over the

1926-98 period, or 0.71 percent per month.

       The extent of the spurious regression bias depends on the parameters,                 and   *,


which control the persistence of the measured and the true regressor. These values are

determined by reference to Table I and from our sample of 500 potential instruments.

The specifics differ across the special cases, as described below.

       While the stock return could be predicted if Zt* could be observed, the analyst

uses the measured instrument Zt. If the covariance matrix            is diagonal, Zt and Zt* are

independent, and the true value of       in the regression (1) is zero.



A. Pure Spurious Regression

       To focus on spurious regression in isolation, we specialize equation (3) as

                                      is a 2 x 2 diagonal matrix with variances ( σ * , σ ). For
                                                                                         2   2
follows. The covariance matrix

                        the value of σ * is determined as σ * =(1-
                                       2                    2
a given value of    *                                                *2)Var(Z*).      The measured

regressor has Var(Z)=Var(Z*). The autocorrelation parameters,             *=   are allowed to vary

over a range of values. (We also allow        and   *   to differ from one another, as described
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                                  9


below.)

       Following Granger and Newbold (1974), we interpret a spurious regression as

one in which the "t-ratios" in the regression (1) are likely to indicate a significant relation

when the variables are really independent. The problem may come from the numerator

or the denominator of the t-ratio: the coefficient or its standard error may be biased. As

in Granger and Newbold, the problem lies with the standard errors.3 The reason is

simple to understand. When the null hypothesis that the regression slope =0 is true,

the error term ut+1 of the regression Equation (1) inherits autocorrelation from the

dependent variable.     Assuming stationarity, the slope coefficient is consistent, but

standard errors that do not account for the serial dependence correctly, are biased.

       Because the spurious regression problem is driven by biased estimates of the

standard error, the choice of standard error estimator is crucial. In our simulation

exercises, it is possible to find an efficient unbiased estimator, since we know the "true"

model that describes the regression error. Of course, this will not be known in practice.

To mimic the practical reality, the analyst in our simulations uses the popular

autocorrelation-heteroskedasticity-consistent (HAC) standard errors from Newey and

West (1987), with an automatic lag selection procedure. The number of lags is chosen

by computing the autocorrelations of the estimated residuals, and truncating the lag


  3 While Granger and Newbold (1974) do not study the slopes and standard errors to
identify the separate effects, our simulations designed to mimic their setting (not reported
in the tables) confirm that their slopes are well behaved, while the standard errors are
biased. Granger and Newbold use OLS standard errors, while we focus on the
heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation-consistent standard errors that are more common
in recent studies.
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                                   10


length when the sample autocorrelations become "insignificant" at longer lags. (The

exact procedure is described in Footnote 1, and modifications to this procedure are

discussed below.)

       This setting is related to Phillips (1986) and Stambaugh (1999). Phillips derives

asymptotic distributions for the OLS estimators of the regression (1), in the case where

 =1, ut+1≡0 and {   t*, t}   are general independent mean zero processes. We allow a

nonzero variance of ut+1 to accommodate the large noise component of stock returns.

We assume <1 to focus on stationary, but possibly highly autocorrelated, regressors.

       Stambaugh (1999) studies a case where the errors {      t*, t}   are perfectly correlated,

or equivalently, the analyst observes and uses the correct lagged stochastic regressor. A

bias arises when the correlation between ut+1 and     *t+1   is not zero, related to the well-

known small sample bias of the autocorrelation coefficient [e.g. Kendall (1954)]. In the

pure spurious regression case studied here, the observed regressor Zt is independent of

the true regressor Zt*, and ut+1 is independent of   *t+1.   The Stambaugh bias is zero in

this case. The point is that there remains a problem in predictive regressions, in the

absence of the bias studied by Stambaugh, because of spurious regression.



B. Spurious Regression and Data Mining

       We consider the interaction between spurious regression and data mining, where

the instruments to be mined are independent as in Foster, Smith and Whaley (1997).

There are L measured instruments over which the analyst searches for the "best"

predictor, based on the R-squares of univariate regressions. In Equation (3) Zt becomes
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                                                 11


a vector of length L, where L is the number of instruments through which the analyst

sifts. The error terms (     t*,        t)   become an L+1 vector with a diagonal covariance matrix;

thus,   t*   is independent of      t.


        The persistence parameters in the Equation (3) become an (L+1)-square, diagonal

matrix, with the autocorrelation of the true predictor equal to                     *.   The value of   *   is

either the average from our sample of 500 potential instruments, 15%, or the median

value from Table I, 95%. The remaining autocorrelations, denoted by the L-vector, ,

are set equal to the autocorrelations of the first L instruments in our sample of 500

potential instruments, when                  *=15%.4   When    *=95%,   we rescale the autocorrelations to

center the distribution at 0.95 while preserving the range in the original data.5 The

simulations match the unconditional variances of the instruments, Var(Z), to the data.

                                                              is equal to σ * . For a typical i-th diagonal

The first element of the covariance matrix

element of , denoted by            i,   the elements of (Zi) and Var(Zi) are given by the data, and


  4  We calibrate the true autocorrelations in the simulations to the sample
autocorrelations, adjusted for first order finite sample bias as: ρˆ + (1 + 3ρˆ ) /T, where is the
OLS estimate of the autocorrelation and T is the sample size.
  5 The transformation is as follows. In the 500 instruments, the minimum bias-adjusted
autocorrelation is -0.571, the maximum is 0.999 and the median is 0.02. We center the
transformed distribution about the median in Table I, which is 0.95. If the original
autocorrelation is less than the median, we transform it to:

                 .95 + ( -.02){(.95+.571 )/(.02+.571)}.

If the value is above the median, we transform it to:

                 .95 + ( -.02){(.999-.95)/(.999-.02)}.

we set    i2   = [1- (Zi)2]Var(Zi).



                                      III. Simulation Results

         We first consider spurious regression in isolation.      Then we study spurious

regression with data mining.



A. Pure Spurious Regression

         Table II summarizes the results for the case of pure spurious regression. We

record the estimated slope coefficient in regression (1), its Newey-West t-ratio and the

coefficient of determination at each trial and summarize their empirical distributions.

The experiments are run for two sample sizes, based on the extremes in Table I. These

are T=66 and T=824 in panels A and B, respectively. In panel C we match the sample

sizes to the studies in Table I. In each case 10,000 trials of the simulation are run; 50,000

trials produces similar results.

         The rows of Table II refer to different values for the true R-squares. The smallest

value is 0.1%, where the stock return is essentially unpredictable, and the largest value

is 15%. The columns of Table II correspond to different values of      *,   the autocorrelation

of the true expected return, which runs from 0.0 to 0.99. In these experiments we set

 = *. The subpanels labeled Critical t-statistic, and Critical estimated R2 report empirical

critical values from the 10,000 simulated trials, so that 2.5% of the t-statistics or 5% of

the R-squares, lie above these values.

         The subpanels labeled Mean           report the average slope coefficients over the
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                                    13


10,000 trials. The mean estimated values are always small, and very close to the true

value of zero at the larger sample size.             This confirms that the slope coefficient

estimators are well behaved, so that bias due to spurious regression comes from the

standard errors.

         When       *=0,   and there is no persistence in the true expected return, the spurious

regression phenomenon is not a concern.               This is true even when the measured

regressor is highly persistent.6 The logic is that when the slope in Equation (1) is zero

and     *=0,   the regression error has no persistence, so the standard errors are well

behaved. This implies that spurious regression is not a problem from the perspective of

testing the null hypothesis that expected stock returns are unpredictable, even if a

highly autocorrelated regressor is used.

         Table II shows that spurious regression bias does not arise to any serious degree,

provided       *   is 0.90 or less, and the true R2 is 1% or less. For these parameters the

empirical critical values for the t-ratios are 2.48 (T=66, panel A), and 2.07 (T=824, panel

B). The empirical critical R-squares are close to their theoretical values. For example,

for a 5% test with T=(66, 824) the F distribution implies critical R-squared values of

(5.9%, 0.5%). The values in Table II when          *=.90   and true R2=1%, are (6.2%, 0.5%); thus,

the empirical distributions do not depart far from the standard rules of thumb.

         Variables like short-term interest rates and dividend yields typically have first

order sample autocorrelations in excess of 0.95, as we saw in Table I.                   We find


  6   We confirm this with additional simulations, not reported in the tables, where we set
 *=0   and vary .
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                                14


substantial biases when the regressors are highly persistent. Consider the plausible

scenario with a sample of T=824 observations where =.98 and true R2=10%. In view of

the spurious regression phenomenon, an analyst who was not sure that the correct

instrument is being used and who wanted to conduct a 5%, two-tailed t-test for the

significance of the measured instrument, would have to use a t-ratio of 3.6.              The

coefficient of determination would have to exceed 2.2% to be significant at the 5% level.

These cutoffs are substantially more stringent than the usual rules of thumb.

       Panel C of Table II revisits the evidence from the literature in Table I. The critical

values for the t-ratios and R-squares are reported, along with the theoretical critical

values for the R-squares, implied by the F distribution. We set the true R-squared value

equal to 10% and    *=   in each case. We find that seven of the 17 statistics in Table I that

would be considered significant using the traditional standards, are no longer

significant in view of the spurious regression bias.

       While panels A and B of Table II show that spurious regression can be a problem

in stock return regressions, Panel C finds that accounting for spurious regression

changes the inferences about specific regressors that were found to be significant in

previous studies. In particular, we question the significance of the term spread in Fama

and French (1989), on the basis of either the t-ratio or the R-squared of the regression.

Similarly, the book-to-market ratio of the Dow Jones index, studied by Pontiff and

Schall (1998) fails to be significant with either statistic. Several other variables are

marginal, failing on the basis of one but not both statistics. These include the short-term

interest rate (Breen, Glosten and Jagannathan, 1989), the dividend yield (Fama and
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                              15


French, 1988a), and the quality-related yield spread (Keim and Stambaugh, 1986). All of

these regressors would be considered significant using the standard cutoffs.

       It is interesting to note that the biases documented in Table II do not always

diminish with larger sample sizes; in fact, the critical t-ratios are larger in the lower

right corner of the panels when T=824 than when T=66. The mean values of the slope

coefficients are closer to zero at the larger sample size, so the larger critical values are

driven by the standard errors. A sample as large as T=824 is not by itself a cure for the

spurious regression bias. This is typical of spurious regression with a unit root, as

discussed by Phillips (1986) for infinite sample sizes and nonstationary data.7 It is

interesting to observe similar patterns, even with stationary data and finite samples.

       Phillips (1986) shows that the sample autocorrelation in the regression studied by

Granger and Newbold (1974) converges in limit to 1.0. However, we find only mildly

inflated residual autocorrelations (not reported in the tables) for stock return samples as

large as T=2000, even when we assume values of the true R2 as large as 40%. Even in

these extreme cases, none of the empirical critical values for the residual

autocorrelations are larger than 0.5. Since ut+1=0 in the cases studied by Phillips, we

expect to see explosive autocorrelations only when the true R2 is very large. When R2 is

small the white noise component of the returns serves to dampen the residual


  7 Phillips derives asymptotic distributions for the OLS estimators of equation (1), in the
case where =1, ut+1≡0. He shows that the t-ratio for diverges for large T, while t( )/√T,
   and the coefficient of determination converge to well-defined random variables.
Marmol (1998) extends these results to multiple regression with partially integrated
processes, and provides references to more recent theoretical literature. Phillips (1998)
reviews analytical tools for asymptotic analysis when nonstationary series are involved.
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                                16


autocorrelation. Thus, we are not likely to see large residual autocorrelations in asset

pricing models, even where spurious regression is a problem. The residuals-based

diagnostics for spurious regression, such as the Durbin-Watson tests suggested by

Granger and Newbold, are not likely to be very powerful in asset pricing regressions.

For the same reason, naive application of the Newey-West procedure, where the

number of lags is selected by examining the residual autocorrelations, is not likely to

resolve the spurious regression problem.

       Newey and West (1987) show that their procedure is consistent when the number

of lags used grows without bound as the sample size T increases, provided that the

number of lags grows no faster than T1/4. The lag selection procedure in Table II

examines 12 lags. Even though no more than nine lags are selected for the actual data

in Table I, more lags would sometimes be selected in the simulations, and an

inconsistency results from truncating the lag length.8 However, in finite samples an

increase in the number of lags can make things worse. When "too many" lags are used

the standard error estimates become excessively noisy, which thickens the tails of the

sampling distribution of the t-ratios. This occurs for the experiments in Table II. For

example, letting the procedure examine 36 autocorrelations to determine the lag length

(the largest number we find mentioned in published studies) the critical t-ratio in Panel

A, for true R2=10% and     *=0.98,   increases from 2.9 to 4.8. Nine of the 17 statistics from


  8 At very large sample sizes, a huge number of lags can control the bias. We verify this
by examining samples as large as T=5000, letting the number of lags grow to 240. With
240 lags the critical t-ratio for true R2=10% and =0.98 falls from 3.6 in Panel B of Table II,
to a reasonably well-behaved value of 2.23.
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                                  17


Table I that are significant by the usual rules of thumb now become insignificant. The

results calling these studies into question are even stronger than before. Thus, simply

increasing the number of lags in the Newey-West procedure does not resolve the finite

sample, spurious regression bias.9

       We draw several conclusions about spurious regression in stock return

regressions. Given persistent expected returns, spurious regression can be a serious

concern well outside the classic setting of Yule (1926) and Granger and Newbold (1974).

 Stock returns, as the dependent variable, are much less persistent than the levels of

most economic time series. Yet, when the expected returns are persistent, there is a risk

of spurious regression bias. The regression residuals may not be highly autocorrelated,

even when spurious regression bias is severe.          Given inconsistent standard errors,

spurious regression bias is not avoided with large samples. Accounting for spurious

regression bias, we find that seven of the 17 t-statistics and regression R-squares from

previous studies that would be significant by standard criteria, are no longer significant.




B. Spurious Regression and Data Mining

       We now consider the interaction between spurious regression and data mining.



  9 We conduct several experiments letting the number of lags examined be 24, 36 or 48,
when T=66 and T=824. When T=66 the critical t-ratios are always larger than the values
in Table II. When T=824 the effects are small and of mixed sign. The most extreme
reduction in a critical t-ratio, relative to Table II, is with 48 lags, true R2=15%, and *=0.99,
where the critical value falls from 4.92 to 4.23.
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                                 18


Table III summarizes the results. The columns of panels A-D correspond to different

numbers of potential instruments, through which the analyst sifts to find the regression

that delivers the highest sample R-squared. The rows refer to the different values of the

true R-squared.

       The cases with true R2=0 refer to data mining only, which corresponds to the

experiments in Foster, Smith and Whaley (1997). The columns where L=1 correspond to

pure spurious regression bias, with no data mining. We hold fixed the persistence

parameter for the true expected return,       *,   while allowing   to vary depending on the

measured instrument. When L=1, the value of =15%. We consider two values for                 *,


15% or 95%.

       Panels A and B of Table III show that when L=1 and             *=15%,   there is no data

mining, and consistent with Table II there is no spurious regression problem. The

empirical critical values for the t-ratios and R-squared statistics are close to their

theoretical values under normality. For larger values of L and           *=15%    there is data

mining, and the critical values are close to the values reported by Foster, Smith and

Whaley (1997) for similar sample sizes.10 There is little difference in the results for the

various true R-squares.     Thus, there is no spurious regression problem, and no

interaction with data mining.

       Panels C and D of Table III tell a different story. When the underlying expected



  10 Our sample sizes, T, are not the same as in Foster, Smith and Whaley (1997). When
we run the experiments for their sample sizes, we closely approximate the critical values
that they report.
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                               19


return is persistent ( *=0.95) there is a spurious regression bias. When L=1 we have

spurious regression only. The critical t-ratio in Panel C increases from 2.3 to 2.8 as the

true R-squared goes from zero to 15%. The bias is less pronounced here than in Table II,

with      = *=0.95, which illustrates that for a given value of   *,   spurious regression is

worse for larger values of .

          Spurious regression bias interacts with data mining.         Consider the extreme

corners of Panel C. Whereas, with L=1 the critical t-ratio increases from 2.3 to 2.8 as the

true R-squared goes from zero to 15%, with L=250, the critical t-ratio increases from 5.2

to 6.3 as the true R-squared is increased. Thus, data mining magnifies the effects of the

spurious regression bias. When more instruments are examined, the more persistent

ones are likely to be chosen, and the spurious regression problem is amplified. The

slope coefficients are centered near zero, so the bias does not increase the average slopes

of the selected regressors. Again, spurious regression works through the standard

errors.

          We can also say that spurious regression makes the data mining problem worse.

For a given value of L the critical t-ratios and R2 values increase moving down the rows

of Table III. For example, with L=250 and true R2=0, we can account for pure data

mining with a critical t-ratio of 5.2. But when the true R-squared is 15%, the critical t-

ratio rises to 6.3. The differences moving down the rows are even greater when T=824,

in Panel D. Thus, in the situations where the spurious regression bias is more severe, its

impact on the data mining problem is amplified.

          Finally, Panel E of Table III revisits the studies from the literature in view of
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                                 20


spurious regression and data mining. We report critical values for L, the number of

instruments mined, sufficient to render the regression t-ratios and R-squares

insignificant at the 5% level. We use two assumptions about persistence in the true

expected returns:   *   is set equal to the sample values from the studies, as in Table I, or

 *=95%.   With only one exception, the critical values of L are ten or smaller. The

exception is where the instrument is the lagged excess return on a two-month Treasury

bill, following Campbell (1987). This is an interesting example because the instrument

is not very autocorrelated, at 0.08, and when we set            *=8%   there is no spurious

regression effect. The critical value of L exceeds 500. However, when we set        *=95%   in

this example, the critical value of L falls to ten, illustrating the strong interaction

between the data mining and spurious regression effects.



                                     IV. Conclusions

       We study regression models in which lagged variables predict stock returns,

focussing on the issues of data mining and spurious regression.               The spurious

regression problem is related to the classic studies of Yule (1926) and Granger and

Newbold (1974). Unlike the regressions in those papers, asset-pricing regressions use

asset rates of return, which are not highly persistent, as the dependent variables.

However, asset returns are the expected returns plus unpredictable noise. If the expected

returns are persistent, there is a risk of finding a spurious regression relation between

the return and an independent, highly autocorrelated lagged variable.

       When there is no persistence in the true expected return, the spurious regression
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                            21


phenomenon is not a concern. This is true even when the measured regressor is highly

persistent. This implies that spurious regression is not a problem from the perspective

of testing the null hypothesis that expected stock returns are unpredictable, even if a

highly autocorrelated regressor is used. The evidence that expected stock returns vary

over time is therefore not overturned by spurious regression bias.

       Given persistent expected returns, we find that spurious regression can be a

serious concern. The problem for stock returns gets worse as the autocorrelation in the

expected return increases, and as the fraction of the stock return variance attributed to

the conditional mean increases. Assuming that expected returns are as persistent as the

median instrument in the samples of nine classic studies, we find that seven of the 17

statistics that would be considered significant using traditional standards, are no longer

significant in view of the spurious regression bias. We call into question the validity of

specific instruments identified in the literature, such as the term spread, book-to-market

ratio and dividend yield.

       Data mining, in the form of a collective search through the data for high-R2

predictors, results in regressions whose apparent explanatory power occurs by chance.

Consistent with Foster, Smith and Whaley (1997), if between 10 and 500 instruments are

examined, depending on the study, all of the univariate regression results summarized

in Table I, become insignificant. In the presence of spurious regression, persistent

variables are likely to be mined, and the two effects reinforce each other. As a result,

the critical values for significant t-statistics and regression R-squares increase. If the

expected return accounts for 10% of the stock return variance, we only have to consider
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                            22


mining among 5 to 10 instruments to obtain critical values as high as those obtained

with 50 to 100 instruments and no spurious regression. Even with a modest amount of

data mining, the combined effects have a powerful impact. Assuming we sift through

only ten instruments, all of the regressions from the previous studies in Table I appear

consistent with a spurious mining process.

       Our results have distinct implications tests of predictability and model selection.

In tests of predictability, the researcher chooses a lagged instrument and regresses

future returns on the instrument. The null hypothesis is that the slope coefficient is

zero. Spurious regression presents no problem from this perspective, because under the

null hypothesis the expected return is not persistent. In model selection, the researcher

chooses a lagged instrument to model time variation in expected returns, for purposes

such as implementing or testing an asset pricing model. Here is where the spurious

regression problem is the most pernicious.

       The pattern of evidence for the instruments in the literature is similar to what is

expected under a spurious mining process with an underlying persistent expected

return. In this case we would expect instruments to arise, then fail to work out of

sample. With fresh data, new instruments would arise, then fail. The dividend yield

rose to prominence in the 1980s, but fails to work in post 1990 data (e.g. Goyal and

Welch, 1999). The book-to-market ratio seems to have weakened in recent data. With

fresh data, new instruments appear to work (e.g. Lettau and Ludvigson (2001), Lee,

Myers and Swaminathan, 1999).        There are two implications.    First, we should be

concerned that these new instruments are likely to fail out of sample. Second, any
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                            23


stylized facts based on empirically motivated instruments and asset pricing tests based

on such instruments, should be viewed with skepticism.



                   Appendix: The Sample of 500 Instruments

       All the data come from the web site Economagic.com: Economic Time Series

Page, maintained by Ted Bos. The sample consists of all monthly series listed on the

main homepage of the site, except under the headings of LIBOR, Australia, Bank of

Japan, and Central Bank of Europe. From the Census Bureau we exclude Building

Permits by Region, State, and Metro Areas (more than 4,000 series). From the Bureau of

Labor Statistics we exclude all non-civilian Labor force data and State, City, and

International Employment (more than 51,000 series). We use the CPI measures from the

city average listings, but include no finer subcategories. The PPI measures include the

aggregates and the 2-digit subcategories. From the Department of Energy we exclude

data in Section 10, the International Energy series.

       We first randomly select (using a uniform distribution) 600 out of the 10,866

series that were left after the above exclusions. From these 600 we eliminated series that

mixed quarterly and monthly data and extremely sparse series, and took the first 500

from what remained.

       Because many of the data are reported in levels, we tested for unit roots using an

augmented Dickey-Fuller test (with a zero order time polynomial). We could not reject

the hypothesis of a unit root for 361 of the 500 series and we replaced these series with

their first differences.
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics                                                24


       We estimate a sample correlation matrix of the 500 instruments as follows. We

take each pair of instruments and compute the sample correlation between the two

series, using all of the periods in which our data for the two series overlap. For some

pairs, there is no overlapping data. For these cases we substitute the average of all the

sample correlations that we can compute.

                                  Common Instrumental Variables: Sources, Summary Statistics and OLS Regression Results
This table summarizes variables used in the literature to predict stock returns. The first column indicates the published study. The second column denotes the
lagged instrument. The next two columns give the sample (Period) and the number of observations (Obs) on the stock returns. Columns five and six report the
autocorrelation (ρΖ) and the standard deviation of the instrument (σΖ), respectively. The next three columns report regression results for Standard & Poors 500
                                                                                                                                 2
excess return on a lagged instrument. The slope coefficient is β, the t-statistic is t, and the coefficient of determination is R . The last column (HAC) reports the
method used in computing the standard errors of the slopes. The method of Newey-West (1987) is used with the number of lags given in parentheses. The
abbreviations in the table are as follows. TB1y is the yield on the one-month Treasury bill. Two-one, Six-one, and Lag(two)-one are computed as the spreads on
the returns of the two and one-month bills, six and one-month bills, and the lagged value of the two-month and current one-month bill. AAAy is the yield on the
AAA rated corporate bonds. UBAAy is the yield on corporate bonds with a below BAA rating. “Cay” is the linear function of consumption, asset wealth, and
labor income. DJBM and SPBM are the book-to-market ratios for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P500 respectively. ALLy denotes the yield on
all corporate bonds.

                The Monte Carlo Simulation Results of Regressions with Spurious Regression
                             and Data Mining, with Independent Regressors

The table reports the 97.5 percentile of the Monte Carlo distribution of 10000 Newey-West t-statistics, the 95
percentile for the estimated coefficients of determination, and the average estimated slopes from the regression
                                                rt +1 = α + δZ t + v t +1 ,

determination from the regression of excess returns rt +1 on the unobserved, true instrument Z t , which has the
autocorrelation ρ*. The parameter L is the number of instruments mined, where the one with the highest
             2
estimated R is chosen. Panels A and B depict the results for T=66 and T=824, respectively when the
autocorrelation of the true predictor, ρ* = 0.15. Panels C and D depict the results for T=66 and T=824,
respectively when the autocorrelation of the true predictor, ρ* = 0.95, the median autocorrelation in Table 1.
                        2
In Panel E, the true R is set to 0.1 and the original distribution of instruments is transformed so that their
median autocorrelation is set at 0.95. The left-hand-side of Panel E gives the critical L for the given number of
                                                                                                 2
observations and autocorrelation that is sufficient to generate critical t-statistics or R ’s in excess of the
corresponding statistics in Table I. The right-hand-side of Panel E gives the critical L that is sufficient to
                                  2
generate critical t-statistics or R ’s in excess of the corresponding statistics in Table I when ρ* = 0.95.
