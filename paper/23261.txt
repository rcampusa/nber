                                         ABSTRACT

We develop a new set of country-sector level indicators of Global Value Chains (GVCs)
characteristics in terms of average production length, and relative “upstreamness” on a production
network, which we argue are better than the existing ones in the literature. We distinguish
production activities into four types: those whose value added is both generated and absorbed
within the country, those whose value-added crosses borders only once for consumption, those
whose value added crosses borders only once for production, and those whose value added
crosses borders more than once. Based on such an accounting framework, we further decompose
total production length into different segments. Using these measures, we characterize cross-
country production sharing patterns and their evolution for 56 sectors and 44 countries over
2000-2014. While the production chain has become longer for the world as a whole, there are
interesting variations across countries and sectors.

1. Introduction


    With falling trade barriers and communication costs, production has become more

modularized or “longer,” and has often involved different stages in different countries. The

changing patterns of international trade and production correspondingly demand new statistical

indicators to capture the new features. This paper proposes measures of production length and

“upstreamness” associated with a country-sector. We argue these measures have more desirable

properties than the existing ones in the literature.

    A “value chain” represents value added at various stages of production, which runs from the

initial phase such as R&D and design to the delivery of the final product to consumers. A value

chain can be national if all stages of production occur within a country, or regional or global if

different stages take place in different countries. In practice, most products or services are

produced by a regional or global value chain. We will label all production processes that involve

international trade in intermediate inputs as global value chains (GVCs).

     Production length, as a basic measure of GVCs, is defined as the number of stages in a

value chain, reflecting the complexity of the production process. Such measures are necessary to

assess specialization patterns of countries in relatively upstream versus downstream stages of

global production processes (Antras et al., 2012). Based on the production length, the

upstreamness and downstreamness indexes are proposed in the recent literature (see Antras et al.,

2012; and Miller and Temurshoev, 2015) to measure a sector/country’s position in a global

production process.

     The recent work in the production length measures for GVCs started with Fally (2012),

who proposed two measures, “distance to final demand,” or “upstreamness,” i.e., the average

number of stages between production and final consumption, and “the average number of

production stages embodied in each product” or “downstreamness” to quantify the length of

production chains and a sector’s position in the chain simultaneously. These two measures are

further explored in Antras et al. (2012) and Antras and Chor (2013), respectively. Curiously,
                                                   2
sector rankings by “upstreamness” and “downstreamness” measures do not coincide with each

other. This implies certain inconsistency in the way that these measures are defined. As we will

argue, a key source of the problem is that the existing measures start from a sector’s gross output

and have been defined as absolute measures.

       As argued by Erik (2005, 2007), a production chain starts from the sector’s primary inputs

(or value added) such as labor and capital, not its gross output.1 By defining production length

as the number of stages between primary inputs in one country/sector to final products in another

country/sector, our new measure provides better internal consistency and easier economic

interpretations. For example, in our framework, the average production length of a value chain is

the average number of times that the value-added created by the production factors in a

country-sector has been counted as gross output in the sequential production process; it equals

the ratio of the accumulated gross outputs to the corresponding value-added that induces the

output.

       Following the production activity accounting framework proposed by Wang et al. (2017a),

we further split the total production length into a pure domestic segment, a segment related to

“traditional” trade, and a segment related to GVCs that involve production sharing activities

crossing national borders.

       While “production length” counts the number of production stages, the “production

position” of a country-sector on a value chain is a relative concept. The relative “upstreamness”

or “downstreamness” in a global production network for a particular country-sector can only be

determined by comparing production length measured by forward and backward inter-industry

linkages.      We propose a new production position measure as the relative distance of a particular

production stage (country-sector) to the both ends of a value chain. Using our definitions, the

    It is important to bear in mind that gross outputs are endogenous variables, while primary inputs and final demand
are exogenous variables in the standard Leontief model. Converting gross output (gross exports are part of it) into
final demand is the key technical step to establishing their gross trade accounting framework in both Koopman,
Wang, and Wei (2014) and Wang, Wei, and Zhu (2013).
                                                           3
sector ranking by upstreamness and downstreamness would be exactly inversely related. This

removes one inconsistency with the existing measures in the literature.

     The inconsistence of the existing measures has been recognized in the literature. For

example, Antras et al. (2016) has defined an “upstreamness” index between any pair of sectors

based on the “average propagation length" (APL) proposed by Dietzenbacher et al. (2005,2008).

This is also invariant to whether one adopts a forward or backward industrial linkage perspective

when computing the average number of stages between a pair of industries at the most detailed

bilateral sector level.   Escaith and Inomata (2016) have proposed similar ideas that use the ratio

of forward and backward linkage based aggregate APL measure to identify the relative position

of economies within regional and global supply chains, and applied such measures to study the

changes in relative positions of East Asian economies between 1985 and 2005.

     However, our measure of production length is different from the APL measure in two

important ways. First, the economic interpretation is different. Production length measures the

average number of times that value-added associated with certain primary factors in a country

sector is counted as gross output along a production chain, until it is embodied in final products.

It is the footprint of value-added created from a particular country/sector pair in the whole

economy. APL is defined as the average number of stages that an exogenous shock starting in

one industry has to go through before it has impacts on another industry, measuring the average

distance of inter-industrial linkages between two industries. It focuses on propagation

transmission of gross output across sectors, and has no relation with the magnitude of

value-added in the economy.

     Second, the computation is different. Production length is the ratio of gross output to related

value-added or final products. Its denominator is value-added or final products generated from a

value chain, its nominator is cumulative gross output of the value chain. APL can be computed

by the Ghosh or Leontief inverse alone without involving sector value-added. The diagonal

elements of the Ghosh/Leontief inverse are subtracted for APL to take out initial cost

                                                  4
shock/demand injection, because such exogenous changes do not depend on the economy’s

industrial linkage and hence are not relevant to how far the “distance” is between two industries.

The diagonal elements of Ghosh /Leontief inverse need to be kept for average production length,

because the direct value-added created by primary factor inputs in the first stage of production

matters for average production length. Without taking it into account, we cannot tell where the

production line starts. Both measures are useful for some research questions. However, as we

will show, the numerical results of production length are relatively robust. For example, the total

production length will not change as the number of sector classification increase as long as the

total gross output and GDP keep constant, while the numerical estimates of APL will change as

the number of sector classifications changes. 2 More details on the differences and their

aggregation properties are provided in Appendix A.

       We apply these new measures to the recently updated Inter-Country Input Output database

(2016 version of WIOD, Timmer et al., 2016) and obtain some interesting results. We show that

Fally’s (2012) result that the production length has become shorter in the United States (based on

the US IO table) is not globally representative. Consequently, his main hypothesis that

value-added has gradually shifted towards the downstream stage, closer to the final consumers,

may only apply to some          high income countries such as Japan and the United States.

       Our empirical results differ from the existing literature in a number of ways. First, we show

that emerging economies such as China experience a lengthening of the overall production

chains over time. Because the lengthening by these countries dominates shortening of production

by others, for the world as a whole, the production line has become longer over time. Second, we

decompose changes in total production length into changes in the pure domestic segment,

changes in the segment related to traditional trade, and changes in the segment related to global

value chains. With such decomposition, we show that the international production length has

progressively become a rising part of the overall production length, although this trend is stalled

2
    Appendix A also provides a numerical example to show the differences.
                                                         5
after 2011. Finally, we analyze the role GVCs have played in transmitting economic shocks in

the recent global financial crisis and find that a country/sector’s GVC participation intensity has

significant effects. The deeper and more intense a country-sector’s participation in GVCs, the

stronger the impact of the global economic shock. In addition, the effect of a global crisis

increases with the relative length of the international portion of the relevant global value chains.

    This paper builds on but also goes beyond the production activity accounting framework

developed by Wang et al.(2017). The two papers collectively form a set of GVC indicators, which

could facilitate future empirical work on GVC-related topics. The rest of the paper is organized as

follows: Section 2 formally defines total production length measure and how it can be decomposed

into domestic and GVC production length based on the production activity account framework

proposed by Wang et al. (2017); Section 3 discusses the relation between production length and

production line position measure and formally define the GVC position index; Section 4 reports

major empirical results based on the 2016 version of WIOD; and Section 5 concludes.


2. The length of production


    We define the length of production as the average number of production stages between the

primary inputs in a country-sector to final products in another country/sector: it is the average

number of times that value-added created by the prime factors employed in the country/sector

pair has been counted as gross output in the production process until it is embodied in         final

products.

Without loss generality, let’s consider an Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) model for G

countries and N sectors. Its structure can be described by Table 1:

vector of direct value added in country s. In this ICIO model, the input coefficient matrix can be

defined as             , where            denotes a diagonal matrix with the output vector X in its

diagonal. The value added coefficient vector can be defined as                               . Gross outputs X can

be split into intermediate and final products,                            . Rearranging terms, we can reach the

classical Leontief (1936) equation,                   , where                          is the well-known (global)

Leontief inverse matrix.

2.1 Length of total production

    Based on Leontief (1936), value added and final products in the global ICIO model specified

in Table 1 are linked by the following equation:                                       . It is obvious that primary

inputs (value added) of sector i only can be directly embodied in final products of sector j if

sector i and sector j are the same. Therefore, in the first stage of any production process, the

value added of sector i of country s embodied in final products of sector j of country r can be
quantified as              , where            is a dummy variable. If sector i and sector j, country s and


                                                          7
country r are the same,          equals 1, otherwise it equals 0. At this stage, the length of the

production chain is 1, and the output in this production chain is            .

     In the second stage, the value added of sector i of country s directly embodied in its gross

output that is used as intermediates to produce final products of sector j of country r can be
measured as            , which is the value added of sector i of country s indirectly (first round)

embodied in final products of sector j of country r. Up to this stage, the length of the production
chain is 2, and the output induced by this production chain is                   , which accounts for

value-added             as output twice, once for sector i of country s, once for sector j of country

r.

     In the third stage, indirect value added from sector i of country s can be embodied in

intermediate goods from any sector and countries, which are used as intermediates to produce

final products in sector j of country r. Domestic value added from sector i of country s in this

stage can be measured as                      . This is the second round indirect value-added from

sector i of country s embodied in intermediate goods used by any sector k of country t and

absorbed by final goods in sector j of country r. At this stage, the length of the production chain

is 3, and the output induced by this production chain is 3                                . The same

value-added originally produced from sector i of country s is counted as output three times, once

in sector i of country s, once in sector k of country t, and once in sector j of country r.

     The same goes on for the succeeding stages.

     Generalizing the above process to include all rounds of value-added in sector i of country s

directly and indirectly embodied in final goods of sector j in country r, we obtain the following:

                                                    ⋯

                                                                                              (1a)

     Expressing (1a) in matrix notation

                             ⋯                         ⋯
                                                   8
                                                                                               (1b)

     Each element in the          matrix represents the value added from a source country/sector

directly or indirectly used in the production of final goods and services in a particular
country/sector. The element of row (s, i) and column (r, j) in the matrix,            , is the total

value added (direct and indirect) of sector i in country s embodied in the final products produced

by sector j of country r.

     Using the length of each stage as weights and summing across all production stages, we

obtain the following equation that gives the total output in (induced by) a particular production

chain (sector i in source country s to sector j in final production country r):

                                                       ⋯                                (2a)

     It captures the footprint of sector value added in each production stage. Expressing in

matrix notation

                                ⋯                          ⋯

                              ⋯                                                                (2b)

     The element of row (s,i) and column (r,j) in the matrix at the right side of equation (2b),

                   , is the total output induced by the production chain from sector i’s value

added in country s and finally absorbed by sector j’s final products of country r. Dividing by
         , the total value-added of sector i of country s embodied in the final product of sector j

of country r, the average production length of value added from sector i of country s to final

products of sector j in country r can be computed as:


                                                                                               (3a)


     Expressing in matrix notation


                                                                                               (3b)



                                                   9
       The denominator is the total value added from sector i of country s contributing to the final

product in sector j of country r, and the numerator is the total output accumulated along the

production chain induced by the value added. When value added is used as input in a production

stage, either as primary input or embodied in intermediate inputs, it will be counted as output

where it is used. Therefore, the length of a production chain is the number of times of value

added counted as output in the production chain, from the first time it is used as the primary

input until it absorbed by a final product.

       Aggregating equation (3) over all products j of country r, we obtain the total average

production length of value added generated in sector i of country s, i.e., the average production

length measure of sector value-added in country s based on forward industrial linkage:

                                                                                                        (4a)

where                             and                          . Expressing in matrix notation gives:


                                                                                                        (4b)

where        is a 1×GN unit vector with all its elements equal to 1, and                 is the Ghosh inverse

matrix3.

       It is the sum along the rows of the Ghosh inverse matrix, which equals the total value of

gross outputs that are related to one unit of value added created by primary inputs from a

particular sector. Therefore, equation (4) measures total gross outputs induced by one unit of

value added at the sector level, which are the footprints of each sector’s value added in the

economy as a whole. The longer the production chain, the greater the number of downstream

production stages a sector’s value added is counted as gross output in the economy.                     , the

nominator in (4b) equals average production length multiplied by sector value added, which is

total gross output induced by sector value added. It can be seen as follows:

    The definition of Ghosh model and the linkage with Leontief model can be expressed in Appendix B.

                                                                               ⋯                (5)

The first term on the right side of equation (5) is the value added directly embodied in its own

sector’s output, and we may name it as the first footprint of the sector value added in its own

sector gross output; the second term is the value added embodied in its own sector’s gross output

used by all sectors as intermediates to produce outputs, and we may name it as the second

footprint of the sector value added directly and indirectly embodied in total gross outputs of this

second stage production process. Summing up all terms on the right hand side of (5), we obtain

all footprints of sector value added in the whole economy, which equals the total value of gross

outputs that relates to the sector value added created by primary inputs from a particular sector.

Therefore, the average production length of a particular sector based on forward industrial

linkages equals the ratio of total gross output induced by the value added in the sector and the

sector value-added.

       Using the shares of sectoral value added in GDP as weights to aggregate equation (5) over

all sectors, we obtain:

                                                                                                (6)

where                    ,             and     . Equation (6) indicates that the average length of the

production chain in the world economy equals the ratio of total gross outputs to GDP,4 which

can be regarded as an index of complexity of the production process in the global economy, i.e.,

the higher this ratio, the more complex the production process in the global economy.

       Aggregating equation (3) over value-added from all sectors i of country s that have

contributed to the final goods and services produced by sector j of country r, we obtain the

production length measure based on backward industrial linkages as:

                                                                                                (7a)

    This is also recognized by Fally (2012).
                                                  11
where                                      . Expressing in matrix notation

                                                                                           (7b)

It is the sum along the column of the Leontief inverse matrix, which equals the total value of

inputs induced by a unit of final product produced in a particular sector. Therefore, equation (15)

measures total intermediate inputs induced by a unit value of a particular final product

throughout all upstream sectors in the economy, which is called the footprint of final goods and

services in the literature. The longer the production chain, the greater the number of upstream

production stages a particular final product has in the economy. Using the sectoral ratio of final

goods to GDP as a weight to aggregate equation (15) over all sectors, we obtain:

                                                                                             (8)

which gives the same gross output to GDP ratio as equation (6) and therefore has the same

economic interpretation.

       It is worth noting that the average length of a production chain based on forward industrial

linkages as expressed in equation (4) is mathematically equivalent to the upstreamness index

defined by Fally (2012a, 2012b, 2013) and Antras et al. (2012, 2013).5 On the other hand, the

average length of a production chain based on backward industrial linkages expressed in

equation (7) is mathematically equivalent to the downstreamness index defined by Antras and

Chor (2013). However, there are two notable differences. First, similar to Miller and

Temurshoev (2013), our indexes are obtained by the sum of the rows/columns of the

Ghosh/Leontief inverse matrices respectively, which are simpler in mathematics and are part of

the classic input-output literature; Second, we measure a production chain length from primary

inputs in sector i of country s to final products of sector j in country r, starting from primary

inputs (value added), not gross outputs (as Fally and Antras did), and provide clear economic

interpretations for both the numerator and denominator in the production length indexes

discussed above. Most important, such concepts of production length allow us to decompose the

total production length in the world economy into different segments.

    According to the value-added and final goods production decomposition framework

proposed by Wang et al. (2017), production activities can be divided into four parts based on

whether there are cross border activities for production as follows:

                                                                                            (9)

     Parts 1 and 2 involve no cross-country production sharing activities, and satisfy domestic

and foreign demand respectively. Value-added in Part 2 crosses boarders once, but only for

consumption activities; all value-added embodied in its intermediate inputs comes from domestic

sources, so it can be considered as “traditional trade” in value-added. Value added in Parts 3 and

4 are embodied in trade of intermediate products: part 3 is value-added embedded in intermediate

products absorbed by direct importers; part 4 is value-added crossing boarders at least twice to

satisfy domestic and/or foreign final demand. These two parts measure GVC production

activities. In the same logic, total production length also can be decomposed into 4 segments: the

first and second segments measure length of pure domestic production and traditional trade; the

third and fourth segments measure production length of simple and complex GVC activities.

2.2 Length of pure domestic production

     Let us first consider the segment of domestic value added that is generated by production

activities entirely within a country at each stage of production.

     As pointed out by Wang et al. (2017), in an infinite sequence of production process,

domestic value added of the source country embodied in its final products for domestic final

demand equals          . Following a similar logic as equation (1), using the length of each

production stage as weights and summing up all production stages, we obtain an equation that

gives the gross output induced by          as follows:

                                                 ⋯


                                                 13
                                                                                                         (10)6

where                           ⋯

       Because production activities that generate this part of domestic value-added have no

relation with cross border trade, we define its production length as that of pure domestic

production. It equals the portion of gross output of a particular country generated by the

production of the country’s GDP without any cross-border production and trade activities (how

many times               has been counted as gross output in the economy). Therefore, the average

pure domestic production length of a particular country equals the ratio of this portion of gross

output to the corresponding domestic value added, and can be expressed as7

                                                                                                  (11)

       Similarly, production of “traditional trade” (               ) also takes place entirely domestically.

The gross output it induced can be expressed as

                                                          ⋯

                                                                                                         (12)

         And its production length equals the average times                     has been counted as gross

output in the economy:

                                                                                                         (13)


2.3. Length of Global Value Chain production

       The production process of GVC trade is more complicated than the previous two segments.

To better understand such a process, let us start from considering the segment of domestic value

added that is generated by production activities related to a country’s bilateral intermediate

exports at each stage of production.




6
    A detailed mathematical proof of equations (9) is provided in Appendix D.
7
    A division symbol below denotes elements-wide divisions.
                                                         14
     Obviously, intermediate exports only occur in a cross country production process that has at

least two stages. In such a two-stage production process, domestic value added generated from

the source country will be first embodied in its gross output that is used as intermediate exports

to other countries and used by these countries to produce final products consumed there or

exported. It can be measured as         .   Both its domestic and international production length

equal 1. The output induced by this production chain is            , which account value-added

       as output twice, once in the source country, once in the importing country.

     In a three-stage production process, the domestic value added generated from a particular

country will be embodied in the final products produced from the third stage and consumed in all

possible destination counties. It can be measured as                                 and can be

decomposed into two parts:            , and          . Their domestic production lengths equal 2,

and 1, respectively, and their international production lengths equal 1, and 2, respectively. The

output induced by such a production chain is                           and                          ,

respectively. The same value-added originally produced from the source country is counted as

output three times, either twice in the source country, once in the importing country, or once in

the source country, once in importing country, and once in the other country.

     The same goes on for an n-stage production process.

     Summing over the production stages in an infinite stage production process, we have

                                                                                         ⋯

                                            ⋯                                                (14)

    It measures the amount of domestic value added generated from the production of gross

intermediate exports and can be further decomposed into two parts according to equation (3) in

Wang et al. (2017a) as follows:
                                                                                             (15)

They are the source country’s DVA in bilateral intermediate exports directly absorbed in the

importing country (VY_GVC_S), and used by the importing country to produce the final or
                                                15
intermediate exports (indirect absorbed by direct importing country or re-exported to other

countries, VY_GVC_C), respectively. All of them are involved in production sharing activities

with foreign countries, so we label them together as GVC production activities.

     Following the same logic to derive equations (1), i.e., using the domestic or international

production length of each stage of intermediate exports production discussed above as weights

and summing across all production stages, we can obtain the domestic gross output generated by

GVC production activities as:


                   ⋯                                                                      (16)

     Term 1 is the source country’s domestic gross outputs generated by the production of

simple GVC exports, in which the source country’s domestic value added in intermediate exports

is directly consumed by its trading partners. We label it as             . Term 2 is the source

country’s domestic gross outputs induced by production of complex GVC exports, in which the

source country’s value added is used by its partner country to produce exports. We label it as

            . All of those gross outputs are associated with domestic value-added in source

country’s intermediate exports before it leaves the country through forward domestic

inter-industrial linkage.

     Therefore, the average domestic length of GVC production can be computed as

                                                                                          (17)

The average domestic production length of the two components are labeled as                 and

              respectively.

     Similarly, the total international gross outputs induced by domestic value-added of source

country embodied in its intermediate exports can be expressed as:


                                                                                          (18)


                                               16
      Term 1 represents international gross outputs generated in the process between domestic

value-added of the source country embodied in its intermediate exports arriving at the importing

country, and the value-added absorbed by final products consumed in the importing country

without further border crossing. We label it as           . Term 2 represents international gross

outputs generated in the process, starting from the domestic value-added of the source country

embodied in its intermediate exports and arriving at importing country until it is used in final

goods production for the source country or third countries. We label it as                . All of

those gross outputs are associated with the production of intermediate exports of the source

country after it leaves the country through forward inter-industrial inter-country linkages.

Therefore, the average international length of the source country’s GVC production can be

computed as:

                                                                                               (19)

The average international production length of the two components are labeled as

and                respectively.

      Summing equations (16) and (18), we obtain the total average production length of domestic

value-added of the source country embodied in its bilateral intermediate exports as follows:

                                                                                               (20)

      Obviously,           measures total gross outputs generated by GVC production activities in

the world economy. Intermediate exports used by direct importers in their production of

domestically consumed final products are involved in the production process only within the

direct importing country, therefore, the international production length of the source countries’

domestic value-added embodied in such intermediate exports equals their production length in

the direct importing country. The international production length of the remaining part of gross

intermediate exports can be different from their domestic production length.           Since this

embodied domestic value-added crosses national borders at least twice, it represents relatively

complex cross-country production sharing arrangements.
                                                  17
     There is a nice symmetry among the terms in equations (16)–(19): all of them are based on

the measurement and decomposition of both domestic value-added in intermediate exports and

their induced gross outputs. It is consistent with the gross trade accounting framework proposed

in KWW (2014). Using corresponding components of domestic value-added embodied in

intermediate trade in equation (15) as the denominators to divide equations (16) and (18) (i.e.,

the corresponding part of value-added induced gross outputs as numerators), we can obtain the

average length of production of each segment and their weighted average in a particular global

value chain (equations 17 and 19). It measures the amount of global gross output that can be

generated by one unit of domestic value-added in intermediate exports from source country and

its total subsequent utilization in the global production network.

    Summing the numerator of equations (11), (13),                       and            defined in

equations (16) and (18) respectively, we obtain



                                                                                              (21)

    Equation (21) shows clearly that the sum of gross output induced by traditional and GVC

exports (equals global total output induced by domestic value-added in gross exports of source

country to the world) plus the gross output induced by pure domestic production defined in

equation (12) equals                  , the total gross output induced by production of sector value
added used in final goods in the whole world economy as defined in equation (2b).

2.4 GVC production length and number of border crossing

    International length of GVC production specified above can be further decomposed into

number of border crossings of intermediate trade flows (border crossing for production) and

domestic production length in all countries involved in the global value chain after intermediate

exports leaving the source country.

     It can be shown that           in equation (25) can also be decomposed into the following 3

terms:
                                                  18
                                                                                              (22)

     The first term accounts for intermediate exports crossing borders for the first time, equals to

domestic value-added of source Country (s) embodied in its intermediate exports to partner

Country (r) to produce final products for domestic consumption or exports；the second term

accounts for domestic value-added in intermediate exports from the home country that is

embodied in the importer’s intermediate products that are exported to the world；the last term

accounts for domestic value-added in intermediate exports from Country (s) that is embodied in

intermediate inputs used by all countries’ domestic production. Therefore, the sum of the first

and second terms equals the total amount of domestic value-added from the source country that

has been accounted for its intermediate exports.        It can be expressed as

                                                                                              (23a)

     The last term in the right hand of equation (22a) is total intermediate exports induced by

domestic value added in intermediate exports of the source country.

             can be further decomposed into gross exports induced by simple and complex GVC

production activities in the source country as follows:



                                                                                              (23b)

     Similarly, the last term in equation (21) is the total amount of intermediate inputs that has

been accounted for after it crosses national borders and is used in domestic production within all

countries involved in the global value chain:

                                                                                              (24a)

               can also be further decomposed into gross outputs induced by VY_GVC_S and

VY_GVC_C .



                                                                                              (24b)



                                                   19
     Dividing equations (23a) and (24a) by             , we decompose international production

length of global value chain into two segments: (1) the average number of border crossings for

production activities; (2) the average domestic production length of GVC activities within all

countries involved in the GVCs after intermediate exports leave the source country. Adding the

average domestic production length               defined in equation (17), we decompose the total

average production length of GVC activities into three segments:



                                                                                           (25)

    The structure and internal linkage of our production length and border crossing index system

can be represented as a tree diagram, as shown in Figure 1.

     Muradov (2016) has proposed a measure of the average number of border crossings.

Different from the measure for the number of border crossings defined in this paper, his measure

includes not only border crossings for production, but also border crossings for consumption (it

also accounts for border crossings of the final goods trade). Both measures are useful and can be

used in different settings. A detailed derivation of equations (21) to (23) and the relationship

2.5 Production length based on forward and backward inter-industry cross country linkage

  Based on the decomposition of value added and its induced gross output in sections 2.2 to 2.4,

following the same logic of equations (4) to sum each component of those GN by GN

decomposition matrixes along the row across columns (horizontally), we can obtain decomposition

of domestic value-added for each country/sector pair (GDP by industry) and their induced gross

output (Xv). The corresponding domestic and international gross outputs induced by different parts

of value added production can by computed as:

                                                                                                          (26a)



                                                                                                           (26b)

    The ratio of these gross output components to those corresponding components of value

added production decomposition in the source country, is the average domestic or international

production length based on forward inter-industry and cross-country linkage.

  Based on the decomposition of value added and its induced gross output in section 2.2 to 2.4,

following the same logic of equations (7) to sum each component of those GN by GN

decomposition matrixes along the column across rows (vertically), we can obtain decomposition of

final goods and services production for each country/sector pair and their induced gross output

(Xy). The corresponding domestic and international gross outputs induced by different parts of

final goods and services production can by computed as:

                                                                                          (28a)




(28b)

    Therefore, the ratio of these gross output components to those corresponding components of

final products produced in their completion location, is the average domestic and international

production length based on backward inter-industry and cross-country linkage.

                                                                                          (29a)

    Detailed derivations can be found in Appendix F.

    Because global final demand always sums to global value-added, the forward and backward

linkage based production lengths and each of their segments is equal to each other at the global
                                               22
level. However, they are not equal to each other at the country or country/sector level due to

international trade and cross border production activities. This naturally raises the questions:

What is the relation between production length measure and production line position? Can we

use production length measure directly to infer upstreamness or downstreamness of a country or

a country/sector pair? Current literature is not clear on such important questions and often uses

production length measures to infer production line position directly. This is the topic we will

address in the next section.


3. From production length to production line positions


     As we have defined GVC related production and trade activities earlier, it is easy to see that

a GVC production line has not only a starting and an ending stage, but also potentially many

middle stages – since value-added in global production chains needs to have production activities

cross national borders. Therefore, GVC position index is a relative measure. If a country/sector

pair participates in the GVC at a particular production stage, the fewer production stages

occurring before, the relatively more upstream the country-sector’s position is in the particular

GVC. On the other hand, the fewer the number of production stages following the country-sector

in question, the more downstream the country-sector is in the GVC. This suggests that a

meaningful production line position index needs to take into account the length stage to both

ends of the global value chain.

     Let us consider a particular country-sector. “The length to the end” measures the average

production length of domestic value-added embodied in intermediate products s from its first use

as a primary input until its final absorption in final goods and services.

     Based on equation (26), the average production length forward (to the end of the chain) is

the ratio of GVC related domestic value-added and its induced gross output:

                                                                                             (30)


                                                  23
     Based on equation (28), we can obtain the average production length backward (to the

starting point of the chain) as the ratio of GVC related foreign value-added and its induced gross

output：

                                                                                              (31)

     It measures the average production length of foreign value-added embodied in intermediate

imports from their first use as primary inputs until their final absorption into a certain country’s

production of final products (for its domestic use or exports).

     As a node in the global production network, the longer is a particular country-sector’s

forward linkage, the more upstream is the country-sector. Conversely, the longer is a particular

country-sector’s backward linkage, the more downstream is the country/sector.

      The average production line position in a global value chain can be defined as the ratio of

the two production lengths:

                                                                                              (32)

The greater the value of the index, the more upstream is the country-sector. Equation (32)

indicates that the production line position index is closely related to the measure of production

length, but the production length measure may not directly imply production line position. Only

through aggregation, considering both forward and backward linkage based production length

measures of a particular country/sector pair, by first determining its “distance” to both the

starting and ending stages of all related production lines, the relative “upstreamness” or

“downstreamness” in global production for a particular country/sector pair can be correctly

determined.

    Most importantly, under definition of (32), if country-sector A is more upstream than

country-sector B, then country-sector B must be more downstream than country-sector A. In

other words, the relative rankings of the country-sectors by these two measures are consistent

with each other. This solves the consistency problem of the production position indexes used in

the current literature, such as the N* and D* indexes proposed by Fally (2012) and the Down
                                                 24
measure proposed by Antras and Chor (2013). In addition, such a GVC position index has a nice

numerical property: because at the global aggregation level, the forward and backward linkage

based GVC production lengths are the same and this index equals to one.
4. Numerical Results
       We now apply these new measures to the recently updated WIOD data for 44 countries and

56 industries over 2000–2014.

       Since all the indexes can be computed at both the most aggregated “world” and the more

disaggregated “bilateral-sector” levels, we obtain a large amount of numerical results. To

illustrate the computation outcomes in a manageable manner, we first report a series of examples

at various disaggregated levels to highlight the stylized facts based on our new GVC index

system and demonstrate their advantages compared to the existing indexes in the literature; we

then conduct econometric analysis on the role of GVCs in the economic shocks brought by the

recent global financial crisis as a more comprehensive application of these newly developed

GVC measures.

4.1 Production length index

4.1.1 Emperical results

       We take the “Computer, Electronic and Optical Products” sector as an example. Figure 2

reports the basic results for China and the US, at the “Country-Sector” level in 2014. The results

are:

       (1) The values of production length index are always higher for China than those for the US,

which means the value added created by China (forward linkage) has to go through more steps

before reaching its final uses, or final products produced by China (backward linkage) has more

stages in its upstream production process.

       (2) Compared with the pure domestic and the traditional final goods trade, value added

created along the GVCs has the longest production length (PL_GVC). This result appears

intuitive and reasonable as more participants and production steps are involved in the GVC

production process. When further dividing up GVC production into simple and complex cross
                                                 25
country production sharing activities, the latter (PL_GVC_C) is longer. In such a case, value

added flowing back to the global production network from the direct importing country may go

through several more production stages, possibly in other countries or back to the source country,

before being finally embodied in final products.

                                       Backward Linkage




    (3) Comparing the three portions of length between simple and complex GVCs, there is only

one time border crossing for production in simple GVC activities by definition, but also less than

twice in complex GVC activities for both US and China. This indicates that a large amount of
                                                26
intermediate imports used by the importing country is absorbed by exports of final products

produced from the importing country. When these final products cross national border again to

third countries, it is no longer a border crossing for production, thus reducing the size of the

average number of border crossings for production. Comparing the three portions of GVC length

between the US and China, China seems have a longer domestic portion than that of the US,

indicating that China engages in more domestic production stages while the US tends to offshore

its production activities in the global production sharing network.

    Table 2a and 2b report forward/backward linkage based production length in four aggregate

industries: agriculture, mining, manufacture and services for the 5 largest economies in terms of

the highest GDP/final products output by industries.

    Comparing industries, agriculture, and especially mining, tend to have greater

forward-linkage-based length, but shorter backward-linkage-based length. Manufacturing sectors,

on the other hand, can have greater length based on both forward and backward linkages.

    Comparing across countries, China has the longest production length across most industries

in both forward and backward linkage based measures. As the world factory and second largest

world economy, more production stages of GVCs are take place within China, as measured by

the domestic portion of both simple and complex GVC production activities listed in table 2a and

2b. Generally speaking, emerging economies have a longer length in both total and GVC

production than that of advanced economies due to the longer domestic portion of their

production chain.

   Comparing different portions of the production length, we see a similar pattern to that shown

in Figure 2: GVC production is significantly longer than pure domestic and traditional trade

production in all countries and industries, and complex GVC production activities is significantly

longer than simple GVC production activities.

4.1.2 Has the length of Global Value Chains become longer or shorter over time?

      One important question addressed in the recent GVC measurement literature is:
Has the global production chain become less or more fragmented?
       Most studies conclude that global production has become more fragmented today
than decades ago. As shown in Feenstra and Hanson (1996), imported intermediate
inputs in the US have increased from 5.3% to 11.6% between 1972 and 1990.
Similarly, Hummels et al. (2001) find that the world VS (Vertical specialization)
share of exports has grown almost 30% between 1970 and 1990, which accounts for
more than 30% of overall export growth.8
       Our numerical results also clearly show that the Global Value Chain is getting
longer, which reflects the increasing fragmentation of GVC production and trade
activities. Moreover, the distinction between different types of production and trade
activities enable us to further investigate the major drivers behind the lengthening of
GVCs.
       As shown in Figure 2, the world average “Total Production Length” has a clearly
upward trend, especially after year 2002 (this trend was temporarily interrupted by the
global financial crisis during 2008 to 2009). Furthermore, the average production
length of GVCs has increased by 0.42 from 2000 to 2014, which is much faster than
traditional exports (PL_RT) and pure domestic production length (PL_D). The
lengthening of GVC is reflected in both simple and complex GVC production
activities, but lengthening of complex GVC is more dramatic; for example, from 2000
to 2014, the length of complex GVC has increased 0.55, almost doubling the growth
of the length of simple GVCs.




8
    Fally (2011) indicates that the production chain (or the distance to final demand) in the US appears to
have shortened over time and concludes that such a trend is also a global phenomenon. Consistent with
Fally, our calculation also shows that the production length of the US is getting shorter. But this finding
is reversed at the global level. In Appendix G, we show that the strong assumption “The same
industries have the same production length across countries” is the main factor that leads to the
puzzling finding by Fally.

       Figure 3 The Upward Trend of Production Length, World Average




     In Figure 3, we focus on GVC production activities to investigate the changes of
its domestic and international portions. We find that the increasing length of GVCs is
primarily driven by two factors: 1).The increasing number of border crossings for
production；2). The lengthening of GVC production after its first border crossing.
Because the number of border crossings for production is constant in simple GVC
activities, the lengthening of complex GVC activities is the major driven force.

Figure 4 Changes of GVC Production Length: Border Crossing for Production, before
            and after first border crossing, World Average, 2000 to 2014




        To ensure robustness of results, we further investigate the changes of production
  length at the country and industry level. In Figure 5, we select the four largest
  countries ranked by GDP -- the US, China, Japan and Germany -- to compare the
  changes of major portions of both forward and backward linkage based production
  length.
        For China, the total average production length, as well as all of its segments, is
  longer in 2014 than in 2000. This holds for both forward and backward linkage based
  measures. For Germany, Japan, and the US, the production length for pure domestic
  (D) and traditional exports (RT) has decreased during the sample period. But the
  average GVC production length, especially the complex GVC segment, has increased
  considerably for all countries over this period, even when the total average production
  length became shorter for Japan and the US in the forward linkage based measures.9




  9
      This may reflect the phenomenon of “offshoring” production activities abroad in these developed
  economies. When more production activities go abroad, the international portion of GVCs gets longer
  while its domestic portion becomes shorter.
                                                   32

           Economies, Forward-Linkage based, 2000-2014

               Economies, Backward-Linkage based, 2000-2014




     Although GVC production, especially the complex GVC activities, have become
longer during 2000 to 2014, the driving forces are different for the four selected large
economies. For China, the lengthening of the domestic portion is a dominant feature,
reflecting China’s deeper and finer divisions of labor through developing more
production stages at home. For the three advanced industrial economies, the situation
is opposite: the lengthening of their GVC production line is driven by the increase of
the number of border crossings and production stages within other countries, while
the domestic production length even become shorter. This is consistent with the fact



                                           34
that advanced countries rely heavily on offshoring to organize their global production
network.
    In Figure 6, we report the changes of production length of the four aggregate
sectors during 2000 to 2014.

     Although GVC production length in all of the four aggregate sectors has become
longer during this period, the underlying driving forces are different. In agriculture,
manufacturing and service sectors, the length of the complex GVC segment increases
much faster than that of the simple GVC segment, but the major driving factor in
agriculture is the lengthening of the domestic segment of the production chain from
finer divisions of labor, while the dominate force in manufacture and service sectors is
the increase of the number of border crossings and production stages in foreign
countries. On the contrary, in mining sector, the length of simple GVC segment
increases faster than its complex GVC segment.
    In conclusion, using the production length indexes newly defined in this paper,
we have observed an increasing trend of fragmentation in production, especially in
GVC production activities.

4.1.3 A more robust measure of production length than APL

    APL has been used to measure length in production (Dietzenbacher, and Romero,
2007). A potential shortcoming is it changes as the aggregation level of industrial
classification changes. As we discussed in Section 2, production length defined in this
paper equals the number of times of value-added is counted as gross output from it is
first used as primary factors to its embodiment in final products. This ratio is invariant
to the disaggregation level of the sector classification. This is an advantage of the
production length defined in this paper over APL.
    To show this, we compute both the production length and APL based on original
WIOD data, aggregate the original table from 56 sectors into 10 and 3 sectors
respectively, and report our computation results of the average global production
length in Figure 7. The results show clearly that the size of the APL index increases as
the aggregation level increases, while our production length measure keeps constant
across the 3 different sector aggregations.
    At the country and sector levels, the new production length measure is also more
robust than APL under different sector aggregations. Using the 2014 WIOD table at
10 and 56 sector as example, Figures 8 show that there is a systemic upward bias for
the APL measure as sector classification become more disaggregated, while the
changes of our production length measure due to aggregation are much smaller and
nearly zero. Similar situation can be find at the country and country/sector level.

4.2 Position Index


    In section 2.5, we have discussed why the ratio of forward and backward
industrial linkage based production length can been used as measure of the production
line position in global value chains. Now we report numerical results of such GVC
position indexes in this subsection.

4.2.1 Country level

    We compute the ratios of both forward and backward linkage based total and
GVC production length in 2014, obtaining two types of production line position
indexes, and report them in Table 3. Both types of indexes indicate that China, India
and Mexico were located relatively closer to the downstream side among the 20
economies reported. However, the two types of position indexes give very different
rankings for upstream countries. For instance, Canada is ranked on the upstream side
according to the total production length based position index, while its ranking moves
down to the bottom by the GVC production length based position index. In the
meanwhile, the ranking of some other countries, such as Japan, French and Belgium,
has moved up.
    Such differences may come from the structure difference between an economy’s
total production and GVC production activities. The position index based on total
production length measures a country’s production activities as a whole, including its
pure domestic production and production of tradition trade that is unrelated to cross
country production activities (this part is often dominant in many economies), while
the position index based on GVC production length only focuses on the position of a
country in cross country production sharing activities, so we define it as the “GVC
Position Index”.
    It is worth to point out that our numerical results of countries’ production line
position seems contradictory to Miller et al. (2015). Their results show that, compared
with other countries, China is the most upstream country in the world, far away from
the final consumption end; but in fact, our results are not actually contradictory with

                                          39
Miller’s findings if carefully looked at through the numerical results. The reasons for
the inconsistency are as follows:
    When the “Upstreamness” (OU) and “Downstreamness” (ID) indexes of a
country/sector pair computed by Miller et al. are high, it means that the distance
between the country/sector pair to the factor input/final consumption end is longer.
However, as we pointed out earlier, using backward or forward linkage based
production lengths alone cannot tell the country/sector pair’s relative position in a
production line because the country/sector pair as a middle stage of production
process, its forward and backward length to each end of the production line could be
relatively shorter or longer. Just as Table 3 shows, both the forward and backward
total and GVC production of China are significantly longer than that of other
countries.   This means that China would have been placed in the upstream if we use
the conventional Upstreamness or Downstreamness measure as Miller et al (2015).

4.2.2 Sector level results

    Table 4 reports average production line position for global industries in 2014.
Similar to Table 3，we compute the ratios of both forward and backward linkage
based total and GVC production length to obtain the two types of production line
position indexes.
    There are differences in ranking global industries by the two types of position
indexes. As we discussed, the position index based on total production length
measures a country’s production as a whole, where pure domestic production
activities are dominant, while the GVC position index only concerns cross country
production sharing activities in the global production network.        As we showed
earlier, the two type production activities are quite different even within the same
industry.
     Taking the construction sector as an example, when considering pure domestic
production and cross country production as a whole, construction is often located at
the bottom of the industrial production chain because it uses large amounts of
intermediate inputs from other sectors and its products after completion will enter the
consumer market immediately; therefore it has a very short distance to final demand.
However, when only cross border production activities are considered, products from
the construction sector may be difficult to export directly. Its factor content is often
embodied in other sectors’ exports involving international production sharing
indirectly. As a consequence, its position in the GVC production network will move
relatively upstream. Similar phenomena exist in many services sectors such as
transportation and public services.
    In summary, by excluding pure domestic production/consumption activities, our
GVC position index ranks traditional non-tradeable sector such as utility and services
as upstream stages in the value chains, and most manufacturing sectors such as textile,
leather and apparel, electronics and machinery as downstream stages in the value
chains. These seem sensible and intuitive.

4.2.3 Country-sector level

    Our numerical results also show that the GVC position for a sector may vary
considerably across countries, which reflects the differences in location by each
country along a particular production network. Three typical sectors in 20 largest
Economies in terms of GDP are shown in Table 5.

    In the “Computer, Electronic and Optical Products” sector, countries that
specialize in assembling and processing activities, such as China, Indonesia and
Mexico, and developed countries such as Germany, French and United States, are
located on the most downstream end, as they are placed at the final stage of the
production chain. In contrast, two natural-resources-abundant countries, Australia and
Russia, are positioned in the most upstream end to provide energy and mining needs
for the whole value chain.
                                           44
     In the “Textiles and Leather” sector, India, Indonesia and Taiwan, China are
located in the final product end of the value chain, while Russia is still positioned on
the top of the value chain by providing natural resource based intermediate inputs.
Japan’s position is also more upstream by providing more manufactured intermediate
inputs into the production chain. In the “Telecommunications” sector, India is located
at the end of the value chain by providing direct services such as calling centers and
clinic record keeping. Countries located upstream are those countries where business
services are an important intermediate input for their manufacturing industry, such as
Mexico and Germany, and natural resource providing countries such as Australia and
Russia.

4.2.4 Time Trend: selected industries

    Analyzing changes of GVC position index over time may allow us quantify the
evolution path of each country’s role and position along a particular production chain.
Here we use typical GVC industries - Computer, Electronic and Optical Products
(WIOD sector 17) as examples. Figure 9 plots out the time trend of the GVC position
index for the United States, Mexico, Korea and Taiwan during 2000 to 2014.

    As a member of NAFTA since 1994, Mexico gradually become a processing and
assembling center of electronic and optical equipment in the western hemisphere due
to its low cost of production (such as labor cost), proximity and duty free access to the
world largest consumer electronic market. As our GVC position index indicates, its
forward production linkage based GVC production length become shorter and shorter,
its backward industrial linkage based production length become longer and longer,
and its production line position on the value chain has been moved from relatively
upstream in 2000, to the most downstream in 2014.

    Similar to Mexico, the U.S. position in this global production chain also moved
relatively downstream. However, the driven force of such a move is different from
Mexico. Both forward and backward linkage based U.S production length has become
longer since U.S. has offshored a large part of its middle production stages and also

                                           45
imports a large amount of parts and components from other countries in its final
goods production. The relatively faster lengthening of backward linkage based
production length than that of forward linkage based production length lowers the US
GVC position index.

    In 2000, Korea and Taiwan were located relatively downstream, but in the rapidly
developing electronic supply chain cluster in East Asia, particular in China’s south
coast area, Korea and Taiwan have become major suppliers of electronic parts and
components in the world. Their position in the computer, electronic and optical
products production chain increased quickly. Similar to the US, both forward and
backward linkage based production lengths have become longer for Korea and
Taiwan, but their forward linkage based production length grew much faster, so their
production line position moved upstream.

4.3 Index application: participation intensity, production line positions, GVC

length, and the economic shocks of the recent global financial crisis


     In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, as shown in Figure 10, world
trade grew by 6.2% in 2011, 2.8% in 2012, and 3.0% in 2013. This growth in trade
volumes is substantially lower than the pre-crisis average of 7.1% (1987–2007), and is
slightly below the growth rate of world GDP in real terms.

      Figure 10 The Growth of World Trade before and after the Financial Crisis




     Following the production activity accounting framework proposed by Wang et al.
(2017), value-added creation activities by a country can be decomposed into four
parts: pure domestic production, production of traditional trade, simple, and complex
cross country production sharing activities. Then, in financial crises, are there
differences in the degree of effects on the four types of value added?

     Figure 11 shows the result at the global level. During the financial crisis in 2009,
pure domestic production activities were least affected (in comparison with 2008, the
fall was only 2.27%), the impact on production of traditional trade rank next, while
the cross country GVC production activities were most affected, as the fall reached
16.05% in its simple portion and 25.14% in its complex portion. However, it is also
observed that the two portions of GVC production activities had the fastest
after-crisis-recovery.
     Divided among different countries and sectors, the above phenomenon also holds.
Table 6 shows that pure domestic production is least affected by the financial crisis
(China even continued a positive growth). For most sectors, GVC production and
trade activities were most affected. The second issue is this: Are the GVC
participation intensity, GVC length and production line positions related to the degree
of effects of the financial crisis? To test this, we estimate the following regression
model:

    Δln(Vaic) = β0 +β1×Positionic + β2×PLv_GVC_Internationalic +β3×PLv_GVC_Domesticic
                           +β4×GVCPtic + β5×Wic + β6× Zc + γi + uic


                                             48
where
     Δln(Vaic) equals to the change of sectoral GDP, ln(Vaic) in year 2009 minus
ln(Vaic) in year 2008, which quantifies the degree of effects on this industry/country
pair during the financial crisis;
     Positionic is the production line position Index, calculated as TPLv/TPLy. When
the value is high, it means that this sector is relatively further from the final
consumption end;
     PLv_GVC_Internationalic and PLv_GVC_domesticic is the International portion
(f + c) and domestic portion (d) of the forward linkage production length;
     GVCPtic is the forward (or backward) GVC participation ratio. It can be divided
into simple and complex portions (Simple GVCP and Complex GVCP);
     Wic represents the country-sector level control variables, including the labor
productivity defined as value added per worker, and hours worked by high-skilled
workers (share in total hours);
     Zc represents the country level control variable. In the regressions, we use a
dummy variable to indicate whether this is a mature economy (=1).
     We also control for sector fixed effects by including a sector dummy γi in the
model.

     The regression results are shown in Table 8. In all regressions we find that
production line position has significant impact on the degree of effect of the global
financial crisis. The further is the position from the final consumption end, the less
affected the node would be by the financial crisis. In the meanwhile, as shown in
regressions (6)-(9), the influence of financial crises tend to be more severe for
countries with a longer international portion and shorter domestic portion of forward
linkage based GVC production length.
     Besides that, regressions (1), (2), (4), (6) and (8) indicate that the forward
linkage based GVC participation intensity (GVCPr) also has significant impact on the
degree of effect of the global financial crisis. The higher the ratio, the greater the
degree of negative impact. And as show in regression (2), the impact of backward
linkage based GVC participation ratio is not very significant.
     In regression (3), (5), (7), (9), we further differentiate the GVC participation into
two categories to represent the simple and complex production sharing activities,
                                             51
respectively. Regression results clearly show that the impact of GVC participation on
sectoral GDP during the financial crisis mainly comes from its complex portion, while
the coefficients of its simple portion are not significant.
     Furthermore, as shown in Regression (4), (5), (8) and (9), sectors in mature
economies are less affected, while the negative shocks on sectors with a higher ratio
of high-skill labor are more severe and the impact of sectoral level labor productivity
is not significant.


5. Conclusions
     In this paper, we have developed a GVC index system that includes three types
of indexes based on both forward and backward inter-industry and cross-country
linkages: a participation index for the intensity of a country-sector’s engagement in
global value chains; a production length index for the average number of production
stages and complexity of the global value chain; and a position index for the location
of a country sector on a global value chain, or the relative distance of a particular
production stage to both ends of a global value chain. While the existing literature has
proposed similar measures, our indices contain improvements that we argue are
desirable and sensible from the viewpoint of economic intuition.
     We thus can provide a comprehensive picture of each country/sector pair’s GVC
activities from multiple dimensions. All these indexes are built at the decomposition
of statistics of production activities (such as GDP by industry) and can be further
divided into different components with clear economic interpretations. By estimating
these indexes according to the real world data, we produce a large set of indicators.
These indexes could be     used in advancing understanding of global supply chains.

Appendix A Difference between production length and APL in mathematical terms
     Production length has some similarities to the Average Propagation Length (APL)
proposed by Erik et al. (2005), but the two are different in both economic interpretation and
mathematical expression. The APL is used to measure the distance between two sectors,
which is defined as the average number of steps that it takes an exogenous change in one
sector to affect the value of production in another sector. Based on equation 11 of the Erik et
al, paper, the APL can be defined as

                                                                                        (A1)

     And the APL from sector i to sector j can be expressed as

                           𝑔 𝑔    𝑔                                                     (A2)

     The average production length we defined in the main text,

                                                                                        (A3)

                                                                                        (A4)

     If sector i ≠ sector j,      , therefore

                                                                                        (A5)

     If sector i = sector j,      , therefore

                                                                                        (A6)

     From the definition of Leontief Inverse,              . From the definition of production
length,                                .
     Therefore, in the off-diagonals, APL are smaller than production length, but in diagonal
elements, APL are larger than production length.
     We defined the average production length as total output value induced by an unit of
particular value added or final products, which equals total gross output to GDP ratio.
Therefore, if a closed economy’s total output and GDP are stable, it’s average production
length is also robust. However, the APL is the average number of production stages that it
takes an exogenous change in one sector to affect the value of production in another sector.
                                                57
APL will change as the      number of sector classifications changes.
    Let’s use a simple example to illustrate the relationship between APL and PL

Appendix B: the Ghosh input-output model and its linkage with the Leontief model
    We define the output coefficient matrix as                , and the final products coefficient
vector as              as in Ghosh (1958). From the input side, gross inputs can be split into
intermediate inputs and value added,                      . Rearranging terms, we can reach the
classical Ghosh inverse equation,               , where                      is the Ghosh inverse
matrix. The linkage between value added and final products can also be expressed as:
                  .

                                                59
     It is easy to derive the linkage between the input and output coefficient matrices as:
                . Similarly, the linkage between the Leontief inverse and the Ghosh inverse
matrices are:




                                                                                     (B1)



Appendix C Derivation of Upstreamness
     As defined in Fally (2012a, 2012b, 2013) and Antras et al (2012, 2013), the
Upstreamness of an industry’s output in the value chain can be measured as
                                                ⋯
                              ⋯                                                      (C1)

     The numerator of equation C1 can be expressed in matrix notation as
                          ⋯                         ⋯
                            ⋯                            ⋯       ⋯
                                ⋯
     Therefore, Upstreamness of an industry’s output can be measured as

                                                                                     (C2)

     The right side of equation C2 is the same as equation (12b) of the main text.
     As defined in Antras and Chor (2013), the Downstreamness of an industry’s output in
the value chain can be measured as

                                    ⋯                        ⋯                       (C3)

     Therefore, Downstreamness of an industry’s output can be measured as
                                                                                     (C4)
     The right side of equation C4 is the same as equation (15b) of the main text.


Appendix D: Proof of Equations (9) and (11)
     Multiplying domestic value-added generated from each production stage of section 2.3.2
with production length of that stage and summing all production stages in an infinite stage
production process, we can obtain the pure domestic value-added induced gross output as
                                              60
                                                        ⋯
                             ⋯                              ⋯     ⋯
                                 ⋯                                                     (D1)
     Where                       ⋯
     Similarly, where production of value-added in “traditional trade” is also entirely taking
place domestically, the gross output it induced can be expressed as

                                                        ⋯
                                 ⋯                                                     (D2)


Appendix E Derivation of Equations (21) to (23)
     Using the domestic or international production length of each stage of intermediate
exports production discussed earlier as weights and summing across all production stages, we
can obtain the global gross output generated by GVC related trade as well as its 3
components in any particular bilateral route.

     Similarly, the total international (foreign) gross outputs induced by value-added of
source country embodied in its GVC related intermediate exports can be expressed as:


                                     ⋯

     Adding equation (E1) and (E2), the total outputs induced by value-added of source
country embodied in its GVC related intermediate exports can be expressed as:

     Summing the numerator of equations (9), (11),                       and            defined in
equations (15) and (17) of the main text, we obtain


                                                                                             (E4)
     As we discussed in section 2 of the main text,             measures domestic value-added
embodied in intermediate exports. Based on equation (20) in the main text, it is easy to see
that the part of           which crosses border for production only once can be measured as
        , where        is the import input using coefficient matrix (with zero block matrix in
the diagonal block in the GN by GN input using coefficient matrix A). The part of
which crosses the border twice for production can be quantified as                    , and the part
of           which crosses the border three times for production can be quantified as
                   . The same goes for successive border crossing.
     Summing up all the above production stages, we obtain the total intermediate exports
induced by            as follow
                                                                 ⋯

     And
     Inserting these two equation into the equation (E5),
                                                                                             (E6)
     Where                            , and          .
     The total domestic output of foreign countries induced by GVC production is the rest of
output which equals that of the total international (foreign) gross outputs induced by GVC
Production minus the total intermediate exports induced by GVC Production. It can be
measured as


                                                                                             (E7)

     Summing up the total domestic output of foreign countries induced by GVC production
and the total domestic output of source countries induced by GVC production, we obtain the
total domestic output induced by GVC production.




                                                                                        (E8)
     Summing up the equation (D7) and (D9), we obtain the total output induced by              .


                                                                                        (E9)
     Muradov (2016) has proposed a measure of the average number of border crossings:

                                                                                        (E10)

    He names the denominator as accumulated exports or                 , and where
      . From the definition of the Leontief Inverse, we have                   Rearranging:
                                                                                        (E11)
     Inserting (G12) into the numerator and the denominator of C respectively, we obtain:




                                                                                        (E12)


                                                                                        (E13)
     It is easy to see that the 1st terms in both the nominator (E12) and the denominator (E13)
are final exports, the 2nd terms are intermediate exports induced by various final products.
Therefore, the definition of C can be can be rearranging as

                                                                                        (E14)

     Multiplying     , the diagonal local value added multiplier (VL) matrix to both the
nominator and denominator, we have

                                                                                   (E15)

     Aggregating both nominator and denominator across the column and along the row, of
                                              63
this GN by G matrix, we obtain a GN by 1 vector of gross exports at country/sector level.
                                                                                       (E16)

                                                                                       (E17)

    The average number of border crossing of country s can be measured as

                                                                                       (E18)

    The average number of border crossing based on forward industrial linkage in our
method

                                                                                       (E19)

                                                                                       (E20)

    Comparing equations (E18) and (E20), the two methods seem different. The denominator
of Muradov (2016) is a country-sector’s total gross exports to the world, and the nominator is
the total gross exports plus the sum of the intermediate exports used to produce exports
(repeated counting). While the denominator in our method is domestic value-added embodied
in gross exports，and the nominator is the part of value-added induced gross exports by all
countries, they are not equal each other at the country-sector level. Once we aggregate them
to either the country or the global level, these two methods become the same.

                                                                                       (E21)

                                                                                       (E22)

                                                                                       (E23)

                                                                                       (E24)



Appendix F: Derivation of equations (27) and (28)
    Similarly, as we discussed in section 2 of the main text,         measure both domestic
and foreign value-added in intermediate imports. It can be seen that the part of
which crosses border for production only once can be measured by                . The part of
         which crosses border 2 times for production can be quantified as               , and
the part of           which cross border 3 times for production can be quantified as
                                              64
                  . The same goes on for successive border crossing for production.
     Summing up all the above stages, we obtain the total intermediate exports induced by
          as follow
                                                                    ⋯

     Aggregating equation (F1) over all countries and sectors, we obtain total global
intermediate imports.
     The total domestic output of foreign countries induced by            can be measured as


                                                                                        (F2)
     Dividing equations (F1) and (F2) by            , we can obtain (1) the average number of
border crossings of intermediate imports used in the source country final product production
activities; (2) the average domestic production length of         within countries involved in
the GVCs after entering the importing country as



                                                                                        (F3)

     The total domestic output induced by            can be measured as
                                                                                        (F4)
     Summing up the equation (F1) and (F4), we obtain the total output induced by              .




                                                                                        (F5)


     Adding final product exports, we obtain the total cross country exports induced by gross
exports
                                                                                        (F6)
     And dividing          by the import value of total final goods and services production, we
can obtain the average number of border crossings of intermediate imports used in a
particular country/sector final product production activities

Appendix G：Has US production become longer or shorter?
    Fally (2012) showed a somewhat puzzling finding that the production chain (or the
distance to the final demand) appears to have shortened over time in the United States, and he
conjectures this to be a global phenomenon.
    Fally’s definition of “production length” (or “Upstreamness”) is the average number of
production stages from a sector’s gross output to the final users. His results rely on the US IO
tables, which covers 85 industries from 1947 to 2002, or 540 product categories from 1967 to
1992. To estimate the global production length, Fally made an assumption that “same
industries have the same production length across countries”. In this part, we argue that this
assumption may be responsible for the puzzling finding.
    First, for the United States, we also find that the production has become shorter. This is
consistent with Fally. Table G1 reports the overall production length for US sectors. The
production length has decreased for 26 out of 35 sectors from 1995 to 2011.

    At the country level, the average production length for US decreased during 1995-2003,
but has increased during 2003-2008, before resuming a decline again.

    However, this pattern does not hold for the world as a whole. As shown in Figure J2, the
production length for a given industry varies considerably across countries. In particular,
production has become longer for China and for the world as a whole.

    As a counterfactual thought experiment, let us assume that the production length
found in the United States is applicable to all other countries in the world. We
re-estimate the weighted average global production length and find that the upward trend of
the global production length in Figure G2 has disappeared. Instead, we see a downward trend
in Figure G3.
