            Negotiated Trade Restrictions with Private Political Pressure



                                       ABSTRACT



        In this paper we consider a home government with political pressure to

restrict trade, at the expense of foreigners. The foreign country is

compensated with an income transfer, which can be thought of as a portion of
the tariff revenues or quota rents. In this setting the two countries should
negotiate over the level of tariff and transfer of rents, depending on the
level of political pressure at home. However, if this pressure cannot be
directly                                                     incentive to claim
            observed abroad, then the home country may have an

arbitarily high political need and seek corresponding high trade barriers. We
resolve this problem by determining    incentive compatible trade policies, in
which   the home government has no incentive   to overstate   (or understate) the
political   pressure for protection.

 1.    Introduction


       Recent literature in international trade has emphasized that trade

 barriers often result from political objectives. These include the desire of

 politicians to satisfy a majority of voters (Mayer, 1984). or respond to

 special interest lobbying groups.' The empirical basis for these models is

 well established (see Baldwin, 1986). It is surprising, however, that this

 literature has focused on a small country setting trade barriers without

 any foreign repercussions. Thus, while the interests of domestic groups are

 of critical importance, those of foreigners have only recently been considered.

 For example, Das (1986), Husted (1986) and Hillman and Ursprung (1987) examine

how foreign lobbying affects domestic trade policy.

      In this paper we shall consider a home government with political pressure

to restrict trade, at the expense of foreigners. The foreign country is

compensated with an income transfer, which can be thought of as a portion of

the tariff revenues or quota rents. In this setting the two countries should

negotiate over the level of tariff and transfer of rents, depending on the

level of political pressure at home. However, if this pressure cannot be

directly observed abroad, then the home country may have an incentive to claim

arbitarily high political need and seek corresponding high trade barriers. We

shall resolve this problem by determining incentive compatible trade policies,

in which the home government has no incentive to overstate (or understate) the

political pressure for protection.2

      While our analysis is theoretical, it has direct policy implications.

Studies in the U.S. have recently called for the auctioning of trade quotas

with the proceeds going to the U.S. Treasury, or used to buy off domestic

groups lobbying for protection.3 Our analysis suggests that the receipt of
                                                                                2.



these revenues could increase the lobbying for or level of protection, as
                                               the political cost of Imports.
domestic groups or the government exaggerate

In order to maintain incentive compatibility (no overstatement of political

costs), it is necessary to leave a portion of the tariff revenues or quota

rents with foreigners.

      In section 2 we outline a simple political model of protection. We adopt

Mayer's (1984) median voter model, in which the government seeks to restrict
                                   labor. In section 3 we introduce the foreign
imports and shift income towards

country and discuss the incentives of some conventional trade policies. If

the home country receives all the tariff revenue, it will generally have an
                                                   In section 4 we solve for the
incentive to overstate the political pressure.
                                                   take the form of "tariff—rate
incentive compatible trade policies. These can

quotas," or "tariff-quotas," in which the tariff is applied to imports

exceeding some limit. Varying this limit permits the revenue/rents to be

 allocated across countries, and therefore affects the incentives for

 protection at home. In section 5 we briefly consider the case where political

 pressure exists in both countries, and section 6 concludes. More technical

 proofs are gathered in the Appendix.


 2.   Median Voter Model

                                                   with constant returns to
      We consider a two good, two factor economy

 scale, where the import competing good
                                          is labor intensive. Let p denote the

                                                     as numeraire. Then factor
 domestic price of this good, with the export good

                  w(p) and r = p(p), where w' > 0
                                                  and p' < 0 due to our factor
 prices are w =

 intensity assumption. Protecting the import good will raise p and shift

 income towards labor.
                                                                                             3.


       As in Mayer (1984), we shall Suppose that consumers are endowed with both

  labor and capital. Individuals have equal amounts of labor and we normalize

  the total population to unity. Let a denote the capital/labor endowment of

  individuals, which is distributed with mean of         and median a0. We assume
  that a0 <   z,   which applies when the distribution of capital is skewed to the

  right,4 In this model consumers differ only in their factor income. Under

 majority voting, the government will respond to the interests of the consumer

 with capital endowment     c — the median voter. In this section we shall
                                                                           derive
 a reduced form expression for the utility of the median voter, which will

 serve as the government's objective function. While the median voter model of

 government policy choice is not universally descriptive, it does provide us

 with a simple and concrete basis for generating political costs associated

 with imports (see Mayer (1984) and some of the references cited therein for a

 discussion of the limitations of the median vote model). Of course there are

 other explanations for the presence of political costs of importing, which the

reader is free to adopt in considering our model.

     Denoting consumption of the importable by ci and of the exportable as c2,

let the utility of an individual be (c1) +
                                                   c2, with ' > 0,   •"   < 0.   The

additively seperable form simplifies our analysis, and means that all

individuals choose the same ci, regardless of their type, assuming they have

sufficient income. Recalling that the population is normalized at unity, in

the aggregate we will have c1 =      yl(p)   + z where yi(p) is domestic supply

supply (yj     0) and z are imports. The equilibrium domestic price can be

determined from the consumers' first—order condition:


                         = p    >
                                    p =   w(z),                                        (1)
                                                                                                     4.




where        ii'    = "/(1—"y1)            <   0.

        Consumption C2 will be total income minus pci.                        Income consists of factor

earnings w +        ar   (per unit of labor) plus redistributed tariff revenue.

Denoting exports by x, the terms of

[p—(x/z)]z = pz —           x,   which is also the trade balance evaluated at domestic

prices. We assume the revenue is distributed as a poll subsidy, equally

across individuals. Thus, individual consumption of good 2 is:


                          + (pz.-x) - pc1
             C2 = (w+czr)

                    =

 The third equality in (2) follows since

         We can now collect our results and derive an expression for utility.

 Define:


               u(z)             yi((z))+zJ +
                                                                                                     (3a)
               r(z)         p((Z)),


 where5


                   u' = p   >    0, and r' =             p'i > 0.                                    (3b)
                                                                                                 5.



 The last result occurs because an Increase in imports lowers the domestic

 price p and thus raises the return to capital. Using (3), we can write

 utility •(c1) +   c as follows:
 Proposition 1. The utility of an individual with capital/labor endowment                        is


           U(z,x,a) =       u(z)   —   x   -   (-cx)r(z).                                       (4)


      To interpret this result, note that the consumer with average capital

endowment of    receives utility u(z) -                 x.   The median voter will receive lower

utility by the amount (-)r(z), where this reduction is an increasing

function of imports z. Thus, imports impose a component of welfare loss on

the median voter, by lowering p and shifting income from labor to capital.

The government will have an incentive to shift income in the opposite

direction using trade restrictions or other instruments.6

     Before examining trade policy, we note a special case of Proposition 1.

If the production functions in the economy are Leontief (fixed coefficients on

labor and capital) and ,(ci) is quadratic, the u(z) will be quadratic and r(z)

linear in (4). We shall refer to this as the quadratic case, and use it

occasionally. This case guarantees that                       <   0 in (4). However, we will

make the stronger assumption that                   <   0 in general, which will ensure that

certain second order conditions are satisfied.



3.   Negotiated Trade and Incentive Compatible Policies


     Let the foreign country's utility function be,


         V(z,x) =   x   -
                            v(z),                                                              (5)
                                                                               6.



where v represents the cost of supplying z, with v' > 0, v"    0. A treatment

of political pressure abroad is deferred to section 5. In a slight change of

notation, let a denote the capital/labor endowment of the median voter at

home. The identity of this voter will depend on population dynamics and other

socio-econOmiC patterns, which we summarize by giving a a probability density

f(a) with strictly positive support over [a,a].7 This density is common

knowledge but only the home government observes the realization of a.

     We shall assume that the foreign and domestic country are initially

governed by a trade agreement which specifies the level of imports z0 and

exports x0 to be exchanged. While we treat <z°, x0> as arbitrarily specified,

in practice they would be determined by economic and political conditions as
                                                       countries. Given this
well as the relative bargaining positions of the two

original agreement, the home country may wish to change the level and terms of

trade occasionally to account for the political costs of importation at home.

 For example if a turns out to be low, so the redistributive costs of imports

 are high, the domestic government may want to apply for a reduction in imports

 to ease the political pressure it faces.

      Towards this end, we assume that the two countries negotiate a schedule

 of trades <z(ct), x(a)> which are applied contingent on the value of a

 announced by the home country. For this negotiated agreement to be feasible

 we require that it be incentive compatible (IC), meaning that the menu of

 trades <z(a), x(a)> must be designed so that the home country truthfully

 reports a.8 To formalize this idea let U(a'/a) denote the utility of the home

 country when it announces a' and a is the actual value. tJ(a'/a) is defined by
                                                                                   7.



                           U(Z(a'))      X(a') —   (—a)r(z(cz')).                 (6)


 Incentive compatibility requires


             U(ctJa) > U(cz'/a) for all        a, a'.                            (IC)


       (IC) restricts the set of trade policies which can be implemented. For

 example, consider a policy designed to maximize the sum of domestic and

 foreign country welfare, inclusive of the political costs of importing as

 perceived by the home country. Denote this sum by


            W(Z,a)        u(z(a)) —    (ra)r(z(ci))   —   v(z(a)),

and let   z*(U) = argmax W(z,a), where z satisfies

                  = U'(Z*(ct))   —
                                     c;_a)r'(z*(a))   —   v'(z*(a))   =   0.     (7)

We   shall refer to z as the "politically optimal" level of trade. It provides

for efficient trade subject to political constraints at home. Note that z' =

r'/(v"-(J)       > 0, since lower values of a raise the redistributive cost of

Imports, and reduce their optimal level. In principle Z*(a) could be

implemented with a specific tariff of


                        t Il 1 %
           TaJ'.
             I
                      a—jt
                      1
                           z taii,
provided the home country were to reveal the true value of a.

      Incentives for truthful revelation would depend on how the tariff

revenues were to be distributed. For example, suppose that the home country
                                                                                                 8.



were to collect all of the tariff revenue.                   Then foreigners are paid their

marginal cost so that x(a) =            vt(z*(a))z*(ct).        In this case utility at home

would be


                U(cz'/cz)    = U(z*(a'))   —   v'(z*(ct'))   z*(u') —   (_a)r(z*(a')).          (9)



Differentiating (9) with respect to the announcement a' and evaluating it at

a'    = a we obtain


                Ui(a/a)
                             = -V"ZZ'          0,                                               (10)


using    (7).      Thus the home country would have an incentive to announce a lower

value    of   a   than actually occurred, or          it   would overstate   the pressure for


protection.

        Alternatively,         suppose that the foreign country were to collect all the
tariff revenues, as would occur under "voluntary" export restraints.
 Foreigners would receive the full domestic prices of imports so x(a) =

 u1(z*(a))Z*(a),        and


                  U(a'/a)    = u(z*(a'))   —    u1(z*(c1))Z*(a) — (_ct)r(z*(ct$)).              (11)



 Differentiating            (11) with respect to the announcement a', and evaluating at

 a'   = a, yields

                  U1(ala) = — z*S[uu1Z*(a) + (—a)r'J.                                           (12)


 This expression is of ambiguous sign, so there may be an incentive to
 understate        or overstate the value of a. This             is because all consumers would

 experience a decline in utility due to the higher import price, but the factor
                                                                                       9.

  income for the median voter would also rise, and the relative magnitude of

  these effects is ambiguous.9

        To conclude this section we characterize the set of trade policies which

  are incentive compatible. Assuming that z(ct) and x(a) are differentiable, a

 Define U(a)      U(a/a). Then (13a) also implies that

                       =
                           U2

 Differentiating (13a) totally with respect to a implies U11 + U12 = 0 or

 U12    0 by (13b). Hence


            U12 =   r'(z(c))           z'(a) > 0
                                                                                    (15)


implying that z'(a) ) 0 since r'(z(a)) > 0.           It turns out that given our

assumptions, the local (IC) conditions are sufficient to insure (IC) holds

globally as well. These results are formally summarized in:


Proposition 2 Necessary and sufficient conditions for (IC) are:


       (a) U'(a) =         r(z(a)),

       (b) Z(a)   is    nondecreasing.


In what follows, the more technical proofs of our results appear in the

appendix. Condition (a) of Proposition 2 has a natural interpretation. As a

      The determination of <z(a), x(a)> would presumably involve bilateral

 negotiations between the home and foreign country. One can imagine a myriad

 of different processes and arrangements by which such trade agreements would

 be Constituted. For our purposes it is convenient to assume that negotiations

 are handled by a third party (perhaps by an institution like GATT) who

 evaluates the claims of the home and
                                            foreign country in constructing a trade
 agreement. In particular we imagine that the agreement <z(a), x(Q)> is

 determined by maximizing the weighted sum of expected home country and foreign

 country welfare subject to (IC) and (IR) constraints.
                                                              Formally <z(a), x(a)>

subject   to (IC), (IR).       In (TP) the weight   might be though of as reflecting

the relative bargaining power of the two countries.         By varying x we may

examine how optimal trade policy responds to different bargaining situations.



4.1 Solution for x         1




     An interesting special case occurs when x =        1, for then the integrand in
(IF') simply becomes W(z,). The solution to (IF') for the case where x > 1 is

recorded in:

Proposition 3 Suppose x            1. Then <z(a), X(u)> satisfy:

tariff—quota policy would achieve the political optimum and also be incentive

compatible. Note that by construction the median voter at home gains from

this trade restriction. The magnitude of gain is measured as area ABG in

Figure 1, which is the difference between marginal utility and marginal cost

of imports, integrated over the reduction in z.

     Proposition 3 demonstrates the existence of incentive compatible

agreements that provide for politically optimal trade. While such agreements

are feasible (they satisfy IR and IC) they require that all of the extra rents

generated by the agreement are captured by the home country, as indicated by

parts (b) and (c) of Proposition 3•11 Such an uneven distribution of rents is

unlikely to result from a bargaining process. Thus while the case x                  1


serves as a useful benchmark for our analysis, the more likely scenario is

that x < 1. This allows for some of the differential rents generated by the

negotiated agreement to accrue to the foreign country.



4.2 Solution for x      <   1




     To solve (TP) for the case where            < 1, it turns out to be convenient to

rewrite the problem taking explicit account of the constraints. (IR) requires

that U(z(a), x(a),cz)           U(z°,x°,cz) for all realizations of a. The graph of

U(x0,z0,cx) appears in Figure 2. The slope of U(x°,z°,a) with respect to a is

r(z°). Recall that (IC) requires that —           U(z(a),x(a)a)   =
                                                                      r(z(a))   and that

z(a) be nondecreasing. Since r'(z) > 0, this means that the slope of

U(z(ct),x(ct),a) is nondecreasing as well. Cases where U(z(u),x(a),a) =

U(z°,x°,a)   over two distinct intervals are not possible, since then

—. U(z(cz),x(a)a) is not increasing everywhere.12 Hence U(Z(cz),x(ct),a) and
                                                                                                        14.



U(z0,x0,cz) can only coincide over a single interval as depicted in Figure 2.

Further since x       < 1,    (IR) for the home country will always bind over some

interval.

         Let us denote the interval over which (IR) binds as [czl,a2], where a                           al

(    a        a. Then (IC) implies:

                  U(a) =      U(a) =                                         ac[al,cz2]

 In what follows it will be useful to solve for x(a) in terms of u, v, and r.

Recall,


                                                          —   x(cz).
                 U(a) =    u(z(a))   —   ia—cz)r(z(ct))


 Substituting for U(a) above from (16) and solving for x(a) yields:

          Substituting the expression in (17) for x(a) in the statement of (TP), we

    have after some simplification,

subject to (IR) and (IC), where F(.a) is the cumulative density for                         .
     To solve (TP') we require that the following regularity condition (RC)

on the density f(a) be satisfied:



            .—.
                         > 0 for all a,

(RC) is satisfied by a wide class of densities including the uniform and

normal densities. With (RC) we are guaranteed that Z(a) is nondecreasing in

the solution to (TP'), as required by (IC).13

     A characterization of the trade policy which solves (TP') is given by:
                                                                                             16.

     Results for the corner case where z0 =                   z*(a)      or z0 =   Z*(;)   will be seen

to be limiting cases of Proposition 4.



4.3 Interpretation of Negotiated Trade Policy


     Parts (a) —(c) of Proposition 4 are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3.

Figure 2 illustrates that (IR) binds along an interior interval of the support

for a. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the negotiated import level

z(a), the status quo level z0, and the politically optimal level of imports



     Recall that when x                 1,   negotiated   trade is politically optimal with

z(a) =   z*(a)   for all .          The problem with this is that the home country earns

all of the rents from the negotiation. By allowing x < 1 we distribute some

of the rents from negotiation to the foreign country as indicated by part c of

Proposition 4. However, when x < 1, the negotiated trade vector is no longer

politically optimal. According to Proposition 4 and Figure 3, the level of

imports is too large for small realization of a and it is too small for large

realizations of a. This deviation from politically optimal trade is explained

as follows.

     Let's suppose for the sake of illustration that one attempts to implement

a policy with z(a) =            z*(a)   for all a, and that all of the gains accrue to the

foreign country subject to satisfying (IR) at home.15 In this case

x(a) =   W(z*(a),a))    —
                                LJ(z0,x0,cz) + v(z*(a)). Does this policy satisfy (IC)?

Given the trade vector <z*(a), x(a)> we have,


U(a'/a) =   u(z*(aI))       —    (_a)r(z*(ao))      —   v(z*(cz'))   —
                                                                         W(Z*(cz'),a)      + U(z°,x°,a').
                                                                                    18.



Differentiating U(a'/a) with respect to a' and evaluating the expression at

a' = a yields,


     Ui(cz/a)   = r(z°)   -   r(z*(a))         0 for a           a*,                (18)



where a* satisfies z0 =        z*(cx*). According    to (18) there is an incentive to

overstate the political costs of importing for a > a*, and there is an

incentive to understate these costs when a < cL*.

     When a < a* the way to prevent the home country from claiming that it's

political costs are low when they are really high (i.e., when a is small) is

to force the country to import more when it declares that its costs are low.

This discourages a high cost country from behaving like a low cost importer.

Similarly, when a > a*, the way to prevent the home country from claiming

large political costs when its costs are really low, is to restrict the level

of imports when the country claims high political costs. This makes it less

attractive for a low cost country to claim that it is a high cost importer.

The necessity to eliminate incentives for misrepresentation by the home

country explains the distortions of the import level z(cz) from the politically

optimal level. Note that at the end points a and ;, it is not necessary to

distort import levels and z(cz) =          z*(a).   This is because there are no lower a

 types who would try to claim that they are an a type, and there are no higher

 a types who would try to claim they are an              type.

      An alternative way to characterize the negotiated trade policy is to

 examine the tariff, T =        u'-v',   which is the difference between the domestic

 and foreign price of the import, and the marginal political cost of importing

 which is MC =     (;—a)r'(z).      Under negotiated trade both T and MC fall as

 political costs decline:
                                                                                        19.


                    =
                        (u"—v")z'(a)     0,


             dMC
                        =   —r'(z) + (—a)r"(z)z'(a)
              dcz                                     0,



 by part e of Proposition 4•16 Generally, however, the tariff will not equal

the marginal political cost of importing as would be required if the level of

 imports were politically optimal. Part b of Proposition 4 implies that

             W {} 0              as     a } a*.

Hence when a < u so that political costs are high, W < 0 implies that

 T <   (a—a)r'(z)       =
                            MC or that the tariff is less than the marginal political
costs of importing. The tariff exceeds the marginal political cost of

importing when political costs are relatively low, such that a > ci*.

       An interesting feature of the negotiated trade agreement <z(a), x(a)> is

the extent to which it coincides with the status quo agreement <z°, x0>. One

way to implement negotiated trade is to allow the home country to select an

import—export combination from the specified trade schedule <z(a), x(a)>. The

amount of autonomy afforded the home country is reflected in the degree to

which <z(cz), x(a)> differs from <zO, x0>. Note that the choice of zO is

politically optimal for some level of costs, a*. Figure 3 shows that for

values of a sufficiently close to cx*, negotiated trade simply calls for

implementing <zO, xO> since z0 is close to being politically optimal.

However, as indicated in Figure 3, greater decision making authority is

afforded the home country when realized political costs differ significantly

from a*. The home country is allowed to use its knowledge of political costs

to pick an import level which is more efficient than the status quo level z0.
                                                                                      20.


      Part d of Proposition 4 indicates that the coincidence between

<z(a), x(ct)> and <TO, x0> diminishes as x increases.      When more weight is

placed on the welfare of the home country, It is afforded more decision making

authority. In Figure 3, higher x means that the interval (cq,cx2) shrinks, and

2(a) moves closers to z*(a). In the limit when x = 1, the borne       country    is

delegated complete authority to choose imports, and z(a) =       z*(ct).   However this

is done at the expense of the foreign country. Hence the autonomy of the home

country must be restricted if the foreign country is to obtain any gain from

the negotiated agreement.

      To conclude this section we note that the preceeding discussion has

assumed that z*(cz) < z0 < z*(;). The negotiated trade policy does not change

significantly in the corner cases where either (I) z0         z*(a) or (ii) z0

*(). In       case (i) one can show <2(a), x(a)> coincides with <z0, x0> over

some interval [al,c*2] where a =   a   <   < :.   For   ctc(a2,:), 2(a) < z*(cz) and

2(u) =   Z*(;).   In case (ii) one can show that <2(a), x(cz)> coincides with

<z°, x0> over [a],a2] where a < a 2 = a.          For ac(a,ai), z(a) > z*(a) and

z(a) =   z*(cz). It can be seen that these corner cases are just limiting cases
of the policy described in Proposition 4.



 5.    Political Pressure in Both Countries


       Suppose that the foreign government also has pressure to raise the income

of its median voter. With the labor-intensive good exported abroad, the

 optimal foreign trade policy would involve expanding exports.        We shall


 incorporate the foreign political pressure into our statement of (TP), and

 investigate whether a negotiated trade restriction can satisfy (IC) for both

 countries.
                                                                                                  21.


      Analogous to U(z,x,a) in Proposition 1, utility of the median voter

abroad can be stated as


          V(z,x,8) =         x   —   v(z)   —
                                                (B—8)s(z),                                       (19)



where [8,8] is the median capital/labor endowment abroad, and s(z) is the

foreign rental on capital depending on exports. An Increase in exports would

reduce the amount of the labor-intensive good available abroad, thereby

raising its price and lowering the rental, so s' <                       0.   The countries will now

negotiate a schedule of trades <z(a,B), x(a,8)> contingent on a and B

announced by each of them. We shall consider a dominant strategy where, for

any value of B, the home government has an incentive to truthfully announce a,

and similarly for the foreign country. Let U(a,B) and V(a,B) denote welfares

with the announced and true values of (,B). Then analogous to Proposition 2,

(IC) at home requires:'7



          LJa
                = [u'-(a-a)r']         za —     xa + r(z)    =
                                                                 r(z),                         (20a)


          za(a,8)        0.                                                                    (20b)


Similarly, (IC) abroad requires:


                =   —[v' + (B—B)s'] zB + xB +           s(z)     =
                                                                     s(z),                     (21a)



          ZB(cx,B)
                        0.                                                                     (21b)


     Consider maximizing the integral of world welfare W(z,a,B), defined as

the sum of (4) and (19), subject to (IC) and a statement of (IR) for both

countries. We are interested in the set of trade schedules z(a,B) which can

satisfy the (IC) constraints. Differentiating (20a) with respect to B we
                                                                                 22.



obtain an expression for           while differentiating (21a) with respect to

yields xa. Setting these equal and simplifying, we obtain the following

partial   differential equation for z(a,8):

            WzzZZ8 + WzZ = 0.                                                    (22)



       The class of solutions to (22), where statements of (.IR) can be used to

provide boundary conditions, defines the set of trade schedules over which

world welfare can be maximized. We have not been able to obtain any

non—trivial solutions to (22).18 However, It is significant that we rule out

the politically optimal level of trade z*(,e), at which Wz(Z*,cz,) = 0 and

world welfare is maximized without the (IC) constraints.'9 To see this,

differentiate the latter condition to obtain z* =       r'/Wzz   >   0 and

   =    s'/W   <   0,   where Wzz < 0 is assumed.2° Thus, with politically optimal

trade (22) reduces to r's'/Wzz =      0, which can never hold. We have therefore
established:


Proposition 5 Politically optimal trade z*(,) cannot satisfy (IC) for both

countries.

       Proposition 5 can be understood as follows. With political pressure only

at home, the optimum Z*(a) was incentive compatible when the home country

received all the gains from restricting trade (Proposition 3). Foreign

welfare was constant at its status quo level. However, in the discussion

around (18) we argued that a constant level of welfare could not be incentive

compatible for that country. Thus, with political pressure In both countries,

(IC) requires some sharing of the gains from negotiated trade. Analogous to

Proposition 4, this implies a trade schedule which Is not at the first best

optimum.
                                                                                  23.


 6.    ConclusIons


       The approach we have utilized to explain trade negotiation contrasts with

 the repeated game view of such negotiations (e.g., McMillan, 1986). Here one

 envisions that two or more countries who trade with each other repeatedly

 reach an agreement, which is enforced by the threat of reversion to

 protectionist policies should one of the countries violate the agreement.

 Violations are only profitable for a country if It can "cheat" on the

 agreement for some minimal period of time until its trading partner discovers

 the violation. With this view, one interprets changes from the status quo

agreement as evidence of retaliation against countries who have been caught

violating the agreement. While such behavior is possible we think it is

unlikely that countries would believe that trade violations they would

contemplate would go unnoticed for very long. This is because trade policy is

a matter of public record, and is subject to scrutiny and review by various

special interest groups that have a stake in the outcome of the trading

process. In contrast to this, the model we have adopted assumes that

unilateral deviations by a country from the status quo agreement can be

observed, but that incentives for one country to deviate from the agreement

can't be verified or observed by its trading partners. This means that the

countries must bargain In an Incomplete Information environment.

      Our results can be given two Interpretations. First, as a positive

theory, they suggest a reason for the use of "voluntary" trade restraints

rather than tariffs. A VER is generally requested by the Importing country,

but the quota rents are earned by the exporter. One reason for the transfer

of rents is that the exporter Is compensated for the trade restriction (as

discussed by   Deardorff,   1986), and so retaliation is not expected. However,

our analysis suggests another reason: the transfer of rents means that the
                                                                                  24.



trade restriction is incentive compatible, I.e., if the importing country did

not actually face strong political pressure, it would not find it beneficial

to have the restriction. Thus, the transfer of rents becomes a policing

device to ensure that political pressure is truthfully revealed.

     However, it should be noted that an incentive compatible policy will not

generally involve a full transfer of the quota rents, as occurs under the VER.

For example, in Proposition 3 the transfer is just sufficient to return the

foreign country to its status quo utility. We characterized this policy as a

"tariff-quota," in which the tariff is applied only to imports exceeding some

limit. In Proposition 4 the foreign country obtains higher welfare, but the

transfer would equal the full revenue/rents only by coincidence.      The

interpretation of our model as an explanation for VER's is therefore limited.

     Another interpretation of our results is as a normative theory,

suggesting a policy which could be applied to actual trade restrictions. The

simple results (Proposition 3) state that the foreign country should be

exactly compensated for any trade restriction, keeping its utility unchanged.

The amount of compensation required is easily calculated from the foreign

supply curve, as illustrated in Figure 1, and could be implemented with an

appropriate tariff-quota. To raise foreign welfare beyond its status quo

level requires a more complicated policy (Proposition 4). In this case the

 initial   level of trade is preserved over a discrete interval of a (see Figure
 3). For levels of political pressure outside this interval, trade is
 restricted or increased,   but   does not coincide with the political optimum.
 The private nature of political pressure at home is In this case imposing a

 cost which lowers world welfare. This result also occurs with private

 political pressure in both countries (Proposition 5), even if the countries

 have equal weight in world welfare.

    (1987), who considered production uncertainty with two possible states.

    The present paper is also related to Jensen and Thursby (1986), who

    suppose that the foreign country does not know the home objective function

    with certainty. They examine Nash equilibrium tariffs of Bayesian games.

    Prusa (1987) examines an incentive compatibility approach to the transfer

    pricing problem.

4. The distribution of capital ownership is skewed to the right for most

    developed countries.

                                                                4(y1TT'+l)   +   Y2'
   p +   i'(PYj+Y)

                                           y   = 0 when the competitive economy

   maximizes GNP.

6. We restrict our attention to trade policies (choice of z and x), used to

   raise income of the median voter. These should be considered as

   second-best since, as shown by Mayer and Riezman (1987), they can be

   dominated by a production subsidy and consumption tax with the tariff used

   only to influence the terms of trade. Before examining domestic

   instruments in this model, however, it is necessary to consider the

   information structure. For example, production subsidies could

   realistically be considered as private information to each country.
                                                                                        26.


     Dislocation costs would be private Information to workers, which affects

     the feasibility of factor market interventions. We feel that a ranking of

     trade and domestic instruments should only be made with Information

     asymetries of this type Incorporated.

7. We assume that       is not so low that the home government would want to

     reverse the pattern of trade. This is ensured if a equals the capital

     labor ratio which, if used in production, would yield autarky. Then the

     optimal trade policy for the median voter will not restrict trade that

     far.

8. The Relevation Principle assures us that there is no loss in generality

     from considering incentive compatible policies (see Myerson, 1979).

9.    A presumption that (12) is negative, leading to an overstatement of

      political pressure, is obtained by requiring that home welfare under the
                                                                               =
      VER is greater than with free trade. Free trade occurs when

                                                                                        0
      yielding   utility U(cxIcL). Then U(czlci)    U(:/c) implies that U1(a/a)

      for some aEa,;], and if this condition holds for a =           then (12) is

      negative. For the quadratic case mentioned after Proposition 1, we can

      show that U1(a/) is minimized at a =         , and   so we must have Ui(/a)           0

      leading to an overstatement of political pressure.

10. With minimal loss of generality, we assume that z*(a)            Z°       Z*(cd.

      Other cases are dealt with at the end of section 4.3.

11. This must be the allocation of rents given the restriction that z0

      [Z*(a), Z*(ct)]. In that case (IR) requires that U(z*(a*),x*(u*),cz*)

      =   U(zO,xO,cz*) where     e [a,;] is defined by zO(;*) =    z*(ct*).     Further,

      (IC) implies that U'(;) =     r(z*(;)),   while dW(z*(;),a)/dcz =   r(z*(;))     by

      the envelope theorem. Condition (c) follows from the fact that
                                                                                         27.

 12. This is readily seen by redrawing Figure 2, with U(z(a),x(a),a)

     coinciding with lJ(z0,x0,) on two seperate intervals.

13. If Z(a) Is decreasing in the solution to (TP') then the solution must be

     modified to satisfy the constraint that z(a) be everywhere

     nonedecreasing. Typically this means that there will be Intervals over

     which z(a) is constant.

14. Note that Z(a) takes a discontinuous upward jump at                   as depicted in
     Figure 3. See the proof of Proposition 3 for details.

15. Ignoring the (IC) constraint, this policy would maximize (TP) when x < 1.

16. To sign the change in MC we also require r"             0. This would be

     satisfied In the quadratic case mentioned after Proposition 1, for which

     r"=O.
17. For concreteness, we shall assume that z and x are twice continuously

     differentiable functions of (a,8).

18. It is not difficult to construct solutions for which
                                                                   2a   or   zA are

     identically zero, while also satisfying (IR) for both countries.

19. This result is not surprising. It is well known that dominant strategy

     pareto efficient mechanisms typically don't exist in general economic

    environments (e.g., Groves and Ledyard, 1985).

20. This concavity condition is guaranteed if the quadratic case discussed

   after Proposition 1 is applied to both countries.

Necessity. Follows from arguments presented in the text.

Sufficiency. Integrating (14) we can express U in (4) as

where             is   an arbitrary constant. Using (A2.1) we have (assuming a2                    < a1)
         'Y(a)



                 U(a1/a') — U(a2/a1)

 where the second equality follows by using (A2.1). The final line of (A2.2)

 follows from al >           a       and z(a) nondecreasiflg. A similar proof applies when al

 < a2.

 Proof of Proposition 4

        Pointwise maximization of (TP') yields the following conditions



             Wz(Z,ci) + (1—k)
                                      r'F(a)
                                      f (   a)
                                                    0 (=   if z(a) < z°)           ac[a,al]        (A4.1)



             Wz(Z,cz) — (1—x)        r[1—F(u)] < 0 (=
                                            f(a)
                                                              if z(a) > z°)        acCa2,iJ        (A4.2)


where (IC) implies z(a)              z0 for ac[cx,cc]] and Z(a)          z0 for ara2,;]. Let
H(al,a2) be the integral over 1,;]                  of   the total weighted surplus for (TP').

Applying Leibniz rule for differentiation we obtain


            -aal
                   = W(z(cq),a)        —
                                            W(z°,ai)     + (l—x)r(z(ai))F(ai)
                                                                                                   (A4.3)
                                                                 f(a1)

                   =   - (W(z(a2),a2) + W(z°,a2) +(1—X)r(z(a2) )[1—F(a2)J
                                                    _________________                              (A4 .4)
                                                                    f(a2)


Note (IC) implies that z(a)                 z(al)      z0 for all a      al. According to (A4.l)
Wz(Z,a) < 0 for a             al. This together with the fact that W is concave and

z(a)     z0 implies _!i._ > o.         Hence, cq is determined as inf(alz(a) =
                         a   al                                                          z°)
provided ai        a. Otherwise al = a, which occurs when z0 = z*(cx).

       To determine a2 we note that when z(a2) = z0                        > 0. Since Wz(z,cz) > 0

for a a, and W is concave we must have z(a2) > z0 at U2                       in   order for
                                                                                               a
provided a2 < .         If    z0 =   z*(),       then a =
                                                                                                   A.3


     Suppose z0 =   z*()    for                    Then since al =    lnf(aIZ(a)   =   z°)   and

          < 0 we have a < .            It   also follows that a >         since               > 0.


This proves part (a) of Proposition 4.

     According to (A4.1) and (A4.2)


                            for a = a,                                                        (A4.5)
          Wz(z,cx) = 0                        a,



thus implying z(a) =     z*(a)    for a =     a, a. Recall that W is concave in Z. This

together with (A4.1) and (A4.2) imply


           z(cz) > z*(a)      ,        ac(a,al)
                                                                                              (A4.6)

           z(cz) < z*(cl)     ,         ac(a2,cz).


Finally z(a) =   z° for acEal,a2] by construction. This completes the proof for

part b.

      Note that for czc[al,c12] z(a) =         z0 and x(a) = x0 so that


                              =      tJ(z0,x0,a)
                                                                                               (A4.7)

            V(Z(a),X(a))      V(z°,x0).


 By (IC), for ac[cz,czl)


            U(z(cz),X(cz),a) =       U(Z°,X°,al)     —
                                                         ai   r(z(a))da



                                 =   U(z0,x0,a)     —
                                                         1    Er(z(a))—r(z°)]da


                                  > U(z0,x0,a),                                                (A4.8)
                                                                                         A.4


where the second line of (A4.8) follows from rewriting the expression

U(z°,x0,al) and the third line follows from z(a) < z0 for a < cx'. A similar

argument can also be used to show that U(z(a),x(a),a) > U(z°,x°,c) for

ac(a2,a].

     For cxc [a,a) we have


     V(z(a),x(a)) =        W(z(a),a)       —
                                                U(z(a),x(a),a)


                       =               —I              [Wz'(a) + r(z(a))]da
                                               a


                       —
                           [U(Z°,x0,cz1)           -   I   r(z(a)da)]
                                                       a

                                                cxl
                       =   V(z°,x°)    —       f       Wz'(a)da    > V(z°,x°),        (A4.9)
                                               a


where the second line of (A4.9) follows from rewriting W(z(a),a) and

U(Z(a),x(a),cx) and the third line follows from the fact that W < 0 for

ac[a,a). An argument similar to (A4.9) serves to establish V(z(cx),x(a)) >

V(z°,x°) for ac(cx2,cz]. This completes our proof of part (c).

     To establish the comparative static effects of a change in A, one totally

differentiates (A4.l) and (A4.2) with respect to x to obtain


            dz(cz) —
                   —             — r'F(a)/f(a)               < 0                 r
             dA             + (l—x) r"F(a)/f(a)

                                                                                     (A4.lO)

            dz(a) —               r'[l-F(a)]/f(a)                   > 0
             dx              —    (l—x) ru[l_F(a)]/f(a)
                                                                                     A.5


where the denominators in (A4.1.O) are both negative, provided the second order

conditions for pointwise maximization of (TP') are satisfied.

     To establish the comparative statics results for a change in x on al,

recall that al is determined by the condition z(u) =             z0, where z() satisfies

(A4.1). Differentiating (A4.1) totally with respect to x reveals that

dz(a)/dA <   0, implying that dcq/dX > 0.       For a recall that a is determined

              0.   Differentiating this expression totally with respect to A and
by dH/da2 =

recognizing that z(c12) >   z yields        <   0,   thus completing the proof of part d.

     To complete the proof of the Proposition we must show that z(a) is
                                                                                       and
nondecreasing. Totally differentiating (A4.1) and (A4.2) with respect to

employing CRC) yields the desired results that          z'(cz)     0 for all a.
