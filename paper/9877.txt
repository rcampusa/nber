                                          ABSTRACT

       This paper uses newly available Chinese micro data to estimate the return to college
education for late 20th century China when allowing for heterogeneous returns among individuals
selecting into schooling based on these differences. We use recently developed semiparametric

methods to identify the parameters of interest. We demonstrate that heterogeneity among people in
returns to schooling is substantial. People sort into schooling on the basis of the principle of

comparative advantage, which we document to be an empirically important phenomenon in modern
Chinese labor markets. Standard least squares or instrumental variable methods do not properly
account for this sorting. Using new methods that do, we estimate the effect on earnings of sending
a randomly selected person to college is a 43% increase in lifetime earnings (nearly 11% annually)

in 2000 for young people in urban areas of six provinces of China. The effect of college on those
who go is 13%. Our evidence, and simple least squares evidence, suggests that after 20-plus years
of economic reform with market orientation, the return to education has increased substantially in

China, compared to the returns measured in the 1980's and the early 1990's.

1. Introduction

        Heterogeneity and missing counterfactual states are central features of microdata. Due to unobserved

heterogeneity, observationally identical people make different choices, earn different wages and hold different

levels and compositions of asset portfolios. The evaluation problem for social programs arises from a missing data

problem. We cannot observe the outcomes of all possible choices for the same person. If we observe wages for

college graduates, we cannot observe the wages they would have earned if they had been high school graduates.

        Conventional approaches to selection and missing data problems do not account for heterogeneity in

responses to schooling on which agents select into schooling. This paper uses newly released cross-sectional

micro data from the China Urban Household Investment and Expenditure Survey (CUHIES 2000), to estimate the

return to education for China when responses to schooling differ among individuals and individuals select into

schooling based their idiosyncratic returns. Our work draws on previous research by Heckman and Vytlacil (1999,

2000, 2001), Carneiro, Heckman and Vytlacil (2001) and Carneiro (2002), which develops a semiparametric

framework that accounts for heterogeneity and selection.1

        Our results reveal that the average treatment effect (ATE) of four year college attendance (the earnings

gain arising from randomly selecting someone to go to college for four years), is 43% (the annual return is 10.8%)

in 2000 for young people in urban areas of six provinces of China, whereas the OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)

and IV (Instrumental Variables) estimators give 29% and 56% respectively (with estimated annual returns of

7.25% and 14% respectively). Heterogeneity in returns is substantial in the population. Estimated selection bias is

an empirically important negative 22%. Like Carneiro, Heckman and Vytlacil (2001), we find that there is

comparative advantage in the labor market for schooling. The best college graduates are among the worst high

school graduates. OLS gives a downward-biased estimate of ATE . IV produces an upward biased estimate of

ATE .

        1
            The MTE is the central concept in this literature. It was introduced by Bjorklund and Moffitt (1987). The marginal
treatment effect is the average return to schooling for persons indifferent to going on to schooling at different levels of
unobservable factors that determine schooling choices. Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2000, 2001) show that all conventional
treatment parameters are different weighted averages of this parameter.


                                                               3
          After more than twenty years of economic reform with market orientation, the average return to education

in China measured by OLS or ATE has increased markedly when compared to those in the 1980’s and early

1990’s. (Chow 2001 presents estimates of OLS-generated rates of return in this period). Education markets have

begun to function effectively in China, and skills are now being rewarded more adequately than they have been in

the past.

          The paper is organized in the following way. Section 2 describes earnings models with and without

heterogeneous returns to education. Section 3 defines selection bias, defines the marginal treatment effect and

presents a semiparametric method for estimating it. Section 4 discusses our data and presents empirical results for

China. Section 5 concludes.



2. Models with and without Heterogeneity

          We first consider a conventional model of the return to education without heterogeneity in returns. We

write the following common coefficient Mincer model:

    ln Yi = βS i + γX i + U i                                                                       (1)

where i is a subscript for individuals ( i = 1, 2, " , n ), ln Yi is log income, S i is schooling level or years of

schooling, X i is a vector of variables such as an intercept, years of Mincer experience, Mincer experience

squared, and dummy variables for sex, region, sector, and ownership of firm. U i is the residual term with

E (U i ) = 0 , β is the rate of return to education, and γ is a vector of coefficients.

          One problem with OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) estimates of Equation (1) is that there may be an

omitted ability Ai , which is in the residual term U i . Many empirical analysts suspect that Cov ( Ai , S i ) ≠ 0 so that

E (U i S i ) ≠ 0 and OLS gives biased and inconsistent estimates (Griliches, 1977 is a classic statement of this

problem).2



2
 Most data sets do not contain measures of ability. Economists use three strategies to eliminate or attenuate the ability bias.
A huge literature uses instrumental variables (IV). The goal of this literature is to find an instrument I i that is highly
correlated with S i but not correlated with U i . The second approach uses the fixed effect method: find a paired comparison
                                                              4
         The specification we consider is more general than the model (1). We estimate a model with

heterogeneous returns to education, which may be written in random coefficient form as

   ln Yi = β i S i + γX i + U i                                                                     (2)

where β i is the heterogeneous rate of return to education, which varies among individuals. X i is a vector of

conditioning variables defined below. This model accounts for ability bias in a more general setting.

         In this paper we focus on two schooling choices: high school and college. We let S i = 1 denote four-year

college graduates and S i = 0 for senior high school graduates (those not going to college). Clearly, there are

more choices of schooling and our analysis is a simplification of reality, but is a natural starting point with ample

precedents in the literature. There is considerable evidence in many contexts that returns to schooling are

nonlinear in years of schooling so conventional log wage on years of schooling regression coefficients generate

rates of return that are badly biased estimates of the return to college education. (Heckman, Lochner and Todd,

2003).

         The two potential selection outcomes (ln Y0i , lnY1i ) can be written as

   ln Y0i = γ 0 X i + U 0i      if   Si = 0                                                      (3a)
    
    ln Y1i = γ 1 X i + U 1i     if   Si = 1                                                      (3b)

where E (U 0i X i ) = 0 and E (U 1i X i ) = 0 in the population. In the notation of equation (2), observed log earnings

Yi = Si ln Yi + (1 − Si ) ln Y0i and U i = SiU1i + (1 − Si )U 0i .




such as a genetic twin or sibling with similar or identical ability. A third approach is to use proxy variables for ability and
include them as regressors in X i .
Many data sets do not have enough information to use the fixed effect method, and the method is critically dependent on
additive separability of errors. Such comparisons may exacerbate measurement error problems. It is also very hard to find
satisfactory instruments. In fact, most commonly used instruments in the schooling literature are invalid because they are
correlated with the omitted ability. (See Carneiro and Heckman, 2002 and Carneiro, 2002).
An alternative method uses proxies for ability and includes them as the regressors. Many empirical analyses reveal that better
family background and better family resources are usually associated with better environments that raise ability (Carneiro and
Heckman, 2003). We use parental income as a proxy for ability in our empirical work.


                                                                5
           In a cross section it is usually impossible to know both ln Y0i and ln Y1i for anyone due to a fundamental

missing data problem. For those going to college, we cannot observe ln Y0i ; for those not going to college, we

cannot observe ln Y1i . So we can only determine the distributions F (ln Y0i X i , S i = 0) and F (ln Y1i X i , S i = 1)

but not F (ln Y0i X i ) or F (ln Y1i X i ) . In the presence of heterogeneity and selection in general, we can no longer

use conventional methods like OLS or Instrumental Variables (IV) to identify economically interesting

parameters.

           Collecting results

   ln Yi = S i ln Y1i + (1 − S i ) ln Y0i                                                       (4a)

         = [(γ 1 − γ 0 ) X i ]S i + γ 0 X i + [U 0i + (U 1i − U 0i ) S i ]                      (4b)

         = [(γ 1 − γ 0 ) X i + (U 1i − U 0i )]S i + γ 0 X i + U 0i                              (4c)

         = β i S i + γ 0 X i + U 0i                                                             (4d)

where

   β i = (γ 1 − γ 0 ) X i + (U 1i − U 0i )                                                       (5)

is the heterogeneous return to education for individual i . When γ 1 ≠ γ 0 (i.e. there is an observed heterogeneity

term (γ 1 − γ 0 ) X i ), or U 1i ≠ U 0i (i.e. there is an unobserved heterogeneity term (U 1i − U 0i ) ), β i varies in the

population, the return to schooling is a random variable with a distribution. In the first case where we condition on

X, the distribution of returns is degenerate. In the second case it is not degenerate. The mean of β i given X is:

   β ( X ) = E ( β i X i ) = E[(γ 1 − γ 0 ) X i ]                                                      (6)

  Suppose individuals select going to college (or not) according to the following decision rule:

   Si* = Pi ( Z i ) − U si
   Si = 1 if Si* ≥ 0                                                                            (7)
        =0         otherwise,


where S i* is a latent variable denoting the net benefit of going to school and Z i is an observed vector of variables

( Z i may include some X i ). Pi = Pi ( Z i ) is the propensity score or probability of receiving treatment (going to

college), which can be estimated by a logit or probit model. U si is the unobserved heterogeneity for individual i

in the treatment selection equation.
                                                                             6
        Without loss of generality we may assume that U si ~ Unif [0, 1] (See Heckman and Vytlacil, 1999). The

decision of whether to go to college (or not) for individual i is determined completely by the comparison of the

observed heterogeneity Pi ( Z i ) with the unobserved heterogeneity U si . The smaller the U si , the more likely the

person goes to college.



3. Selection Bias and The Marginal Treatment Effect

        Let ∆ i = ln Y1i − ln Y0i be the economic (gross) return to a policy that moves individual i from S i = 0 to

S i = 1 . According to Equations (3a), (3b) and (5), ∆ i = β i , is the causal effect of education. Using equations

(3a), (3b) and (6), the probability limit of the ordinary least squares estimator can be written as:

   plim( βˆOLS ) = E (ln Yi X i , Si = 1) − E (ln Yi X i , Si = 0)
              = E (γ 1 X i + U1i X i , Si = 1) − E (γ 0 X i + U 0i X i , Si = 0)
                                                                                              (8)
              =     β (X ) +       [E (U1i Si = 1) − E (U 0i Si = 0)]
               (ATE)                     (Bias)

where ATE is the average treatment effect, (the effect of randomly assigning a person with characteristics X to

schooling) defined as

   ATE = E (∆ i X i ) = E ( β i X i ) = β ( X ) .                                                      (9)

        If agents know and act on some components of (U 0i , U1i ) , S i is generally correlated with both U 0i and

U 1i , and the second term in Equation (8) will be not zero, so OLS is biased for ATE .

Note that Equation (8) can also be written as:

   plim( βˆOLS ) = E (ln Yi X i , Si = 1) − E (ln Yi X i , Si = 0)
              = E(βi X i , Si = 1)      +    [E (U 0i Si = 1) − E (U 0i Si = 0)]              (10)
                       (TT)                         (Selection Bias)

where TT is treatment on the treated, the effect of treatment on those who receive it (e.g., goes to college)

compared to what they would experience without treatment (i.e., do not go to college), defined as:




                                                                 7
  TT = E (∆ i X i , Si = 1) = E ( β i X i , Si = 1)
        = β ( X ) + E (U1i − U 0i Si = 1) = ATE + E (U1i − U 0i Si = 1)                                  (11)
                                                     ( Sorting Effect )

        The sorting effect E (U1i − U 0i Si = 1) is the mean gain of the unobservables for people who choose “1”.

The selection bias E (U 0i Si = 1) - E (U 0i Si = 0) is the mean difference in the no schooling (S=0) unobservables

between those who go to school and those who do not. It is the difference in unobservables between what college

graduates would earn if they were high school graduates and what high school graduates would earn. The bias in

(8) is the sum of sorting and selection bias.

        Conventional IV estimators do not, in general, identify these treatment parameters in the presence of

heterogeneity and selection. Finding an instrument I i correlated with S i but not U 0i or even U 1i − U 0i is not

enough to identify β ( X ) , because:

                Cov( I i , ln Yi )            Cov ( I i ,U 0i ) Cov[ I i , (U1i − U 0i ) Si ]
   plimβˆIV =                      = β (X ) +                  +
                 Cov( I i , Si )              Cov( I i , Si )        Cov( I i , Si )
                                                                                                         (12)
                           Cov[ I i , (U1i − U 0i ) Si ]            Cov[ I i , (U1i − U 0i ) Si = 1]Pi
                = β (X ) +                               = β (X ) +
                                Cov( I i , Si )                                 Cov( I i , Si )

where Pi = Pr( S i = 1) is the propensity score. In the presence of both heterogeneity and selection bias, U 1i ≠ U 0i ,

U 1i − U 0i is dependent on Si, so the second term in Equation (12) will be not zero, thus plim( βˆIV ) ≠ β ( X ) so IV

is not a consistent estimator. Only in some very special circumstances, when U 1i − U 0i = 0 (i.e. neither

unobserved heterogeneity nor selection bias exist) or when U 1i ≠ U 0i but U 1i − U 0i is independent of Si (i.e. there

is unobserved heterogeneity but no selection bias), will the second term in Equation (12) be zero. In this case, IV

is a consistent estimator for β ( X ) (Heckman, 1997 and Heckman and Navarro-Lozano, 2003).

  Neither OLS nor IV is a consistent estimator of the mean return to education in the presence of heterogeneity

and selection. However, under the assumptions presented in Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2000, 2001), Carneiro,

Heckman and Vytlacil (2001), Carneiro (2002) and Navarro-Lozano (2002), it is possible to identify the

heterogeneous return to education with marginal treatment effect ( MTE ) via the method of Local Instrument

Variables ( LIV ), where MTE is:

                                                                   8
     MTE ( X i = x,U si = us ) = E( ∆ i X i = x,U si = us ) = E(βi X i = x,U si = us )
                                                                                                               (13)
                                             = (γ 1 − γ 0 ) x + E (U1i − U 0i U si = us ) .

The MTE is the average willingness to pay (WTP ) for ln Y1i (compared to ln Y0i ) given characteristics X i and

unobserved heterogeneity U si . 3 MTE can be estimated from the following relationship, where LIV can be

estimated by semiparametric methods for derivatives (see Heckman 2001):

                                                                           ∂E (ln Yi X i = x, Pi = p )
     MTE ( X i = x, U si = Pi = p) = LIV ( X i = x, Pi = p ) =                                           .      (14)
                                                                                       ∂p

For notational simplicity, we keep the conditioning on X implicit in what follows.

            Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2000, 2001) and Carneiro (2002) establish that all the other treatment

variables can be unified using MTE

4. Data Set and Empirical Results

        Our data are from the China Urban Household Income and Expenditure Survey (CUHIES) for the year

2000, which was conducted by the Urban Socio-Economic Survey Organization of the National Bureau of

Statistics. The survey is a sequence of cross-sections from 1992 to 2002 and is ongoing. The urban data randomly

selects households across the whole urban population.

        We have the data for the year 2000 for urban areas of six provinces: Guangdong, Liaoning, Sichuan,

Shaanxi, Zhejiang and Beijing. Four provinces, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Beijing and Liaoning, are located in

eastern part of China, while the other two, Sichuan and Shaanxi, are in the western part. Table 1 provides the

comparison of average resident income in urban areas among these provinces. The average resident incomes in

the three provinces, Beijing, Guangdong and Zhejiang, are much higher than the average level of China, while

they are a bit lower in the other three provinces, Sichuan, Liaoning and Shaanxi. The average income in the six

provinces we use is 7627 yuan, which is higher than the average income of China, 6280 yuan.

        The sample size for the six provinces is 4250 households. For each household, there is rich information

on all household members, including head, spouse, children and parents. Age, sex, education level, employment

status and enterprise ownership, occupation, years of work experience and total annual income are available for

each household member. There are seven education levels in the sample: university, college, special technical

school, senior high school, junior high school, primary school, and other.

        For our purposes, we combine all the children in the six provinces who are either college or university

graduates or senior high school graduates. They are all working and earn positive wages in 2000. Our sample

consists of 587 individuals, including 273 people with four-year college (or university) certificates and 314 people

with only senior high school certificates. There are 331 males and 256 females in the sample. The summary

statistics for the variables used in our analysis are reported in Table 2, which reveals the individuals in the sample

are mainly young adults with a mean age of 26.3. Thus ours is an analysis of wages early in the life cycle of new

cohorts of Chinese workers.

        Table 3 presents OLS and IV estimates of the mean return to four-year college attendance. We use the

probability of going to college as the instrument with the exclusions defined below. The OLS and IV estimates

are 29% and 56% respectively for the young people in the urban areas of six provinces of China in 2000
                                                         10
(annualized 7.25% and 14%, respectively). The OLS estimates are much higher than the OLS estimates reported

by Chow (2001) for an earlier period (1980’s and early 1990’s). The variables in the outcome equation include the

years of Mincer experience, Mincer experience squared, our proxy of ability (we use parental income as the proxy

in this paper) and some dummy variables such as the sex, the provinces of residence, the sector and the firm

ownership in which he or she works. The propensity score is estimated by a logistic model, with coefficient

estimates presented in Table 4.4

            We use father’s education, mother’s education, parental income, and the year of birth as determinants of

the probability of going to college. The last column of the table is the mean marginal effect for each explanatory

variable. Figure 1 shows the density function for the estimated probability of college attendance (Pr( S = 1)) .

            Table 5 and Figure 2 give the results from our semiparametric estimation. We use parental income in the

earnings function to control for ability. For details on the procedures used to generate these numbers see

Carneiro, Heckman and Vytlacil (2001), whom we follow. Table 5 contains the estimated coefficients for

Equations (3a) and (3b) using local linear regression. Figure 2 plots the estimated marginal treatment effect as a

function unobserved heterogeneity u s , the components in the choice equation. The MTE is declining in u s . This

implies that people with lower u s , i.e. those more likely to go to college according to the decision rule (7), have

higher marginal returns to schooling. The people with the highest u s , who are least likely going to college, have

the lowest average returns. Figure 2 suggests substantial heterogeneity in the return to education for China. The

declining MTE implies that matching and conventional OLS and IV methods do not identify any relevant

treatment effect in our data. (See Heckman, 2001 or Heckman and Navarro, 2003). It also suggests that the

marginal participant in Chinese higher education earns less than the average participant.

            Table 6 presents a comparison among various treatment parameters. The average return to 4-year college

attendance for a randomly selected person is 43% (11% annually) given by ATE . The effect of going to college

    The general forms of the logistic model and the marginal effects derived from it are defined as:
                           exp( β ′ X )
     Pr( S = 1 | X ) =                      = Λ(β ′X )
                         1 + exp( β ′ X )

                            ∂ Pr( S = 1 | X )
     Marginal effects =                         = Λ ( β ′ X )[1 − Λ ( β ′ X )]β .
                                   ∂X

                                                                                    11
on those who go is 51%, so there is purposive sorting into schooling on the basis of gain (13% annual). The OLS

estimator is downward biased for ATE with only a 29% return (7% annual). The inconsistent IV estimator is 56%

and is upward biased due to heterogeneity and selection bias (Heckman and Vytlacil derive the exact bias). The

Chinese data set show that IV > ATE > OLS . The estimated selection bias of –22% is very important in

estimating the economic return to schooling for China. Persons who go to college would make poor high school

graduates. Treatment on the treated ( TT ) and treatment on the untreated ( TUT ) are 51% and 36% respectively.

Thus IV is upward biased for TT.

        The estimated sorting gain is large and positive, suggesting that the principle of comparative advantage is

important. The “sorting gain” reported in Table 6 is defined as:

        Sorting Gain = E ( βi − β X i , Si = 1) = E ( βi X i , Si = 1) − β ( X ) = TT − ATE        (17)

Table 6 and Figure 2 also reveal that the average return to college attendance is high in 2000 for young people in

urban areas of the six provinces of China.

        Figure 3 plots the estimated weights used to form treatment parameters ATE , TT and TUT . ATE

weights MTE evenly. TT overweights the ATE for persons with low values of u s who, ceteris paribus, are

more likely to attend college. TUT overweights the ATE for persons with high values of u s who are less likely

to attend college. Not surprisingly, in light of the shape of MTE and the shape of the weights, TT > ATE > TUT .

This is also revealed in the Table 6. There is substantial heterogeneity among individuals and there is a positive

sorting gain and a negative selection bias.

        In order to test the importance of introducing a proxy for ability in the wage equation, we exclude

parental income from the wage equation and re-estimate the marginal treatment effects. The results are displayed

in Figure 4. In this case, the MTE increases in u s and its average value is obviously much higher than that in

Figure 2. Therefore, neglecting ability (or its proxy) results in an upward bias for the marginal treatment effect

and the estimated return to schooling.

        To explore the sensitivity of the estimates to various exclusions and inclusions, we present the estimates

shown in Tables 7(a) – 7(d). MTEs are plotted for various specifications of the model controlling (or not

controlling) for sectoral choices and for ability (see Figures 5 and 6).

                                                          12
        Our main specification conditions on sectoral choices including the ownership structure of the firm. As is

well known, conditioning on sectoral choices in the wage equation is likely to lead to an understatement of the

full return to schooling because one benefit of education is that it facilitates choice of sector. When we drop

various firm ownership and sectoral indicator variables, estimated returns go up (see Table 7d for estimates

deleting all sectoral choice and ownership variables). This is clear from Figure 5. However, the effect of including

or excluding these variables is very small on estimated marginal treatment effects. Failing to condition on ability

(parental income) raises the estimated return to implausible levels and changes the shape of the estimated MTE.

This evidence is consistent with the findings of Carneiro (2002).



5. Concluding Remarks

        This paper uses newly available micro data to identify the returns to higher education in China. We

demonstrate the importance of considering heterogeneity and selection bias. Neglecting these two factors leads to

biased and inconsistent estimates such as those obtained using conventional OLS and IV parameters. We

demonstrate the importance of proxying for ability in the wage equation to identify returns to education.

Excluding it leads to implausibly high estimates of the return to schooling. On the other hand, controlling for

sectoral choices barely budges the estimates.

        In 2000, the average return to four-year college attendance is 43% (on average 11% annually) for young

people in the urban areas of the six provinces. The returns to those going to college are even higher. These

estimates are all higher than the conventional OLS estimates of the Mincer model, which in turn are higher than

the OLS estimates reported for earlier time periods. They imply that, after 20-plus years of economic reform with

market orientation, the average return to education in China has increased substantially when compared to those

in the 1980’s and early 1990’s.
