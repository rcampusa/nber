                                            ABSTRACT



       I examine the outcomes of cases of entry by merchant shipping lines into established markets

around the turn of the century.      These established     markets are completely   dominated    by an

incumbent   cartel composed    of several member shipping lines.      The cartel makes the decision

whether or not to begin a price war against the entrant; some entrants are formally admitted to the

cartel without any conflict. I use characteristics of the entrant to predict whether or not the entrant

will encounter a price war conditional on entering.      I find that weaker entrants are fought, where

“weaker” means less financial resources, experience, size, or poor trade conditions.    The empirical

results provide support for the “long purse” theory of predation. I discuss qualitative evidence such

as predatory intent expressed    in correspondence    between cartel members which supports the

empirical results.   The results are also found to be robust to misclassification    of the dependent

variable which is a particular concern when dealing with historical data.

1. Introduction
   The phenomenon of predatory pricing has interested economists for many years. The idea that
a firm might be able to “fight” a rival and cause its exit from the market is dramatic.                       Analysis
shows        that conditions     necessary     for predatory    pricing    violate     some   standards   of perfect
competition,      making the possibility         of predation   controversial.       The contradiction    inherent in
predatory pricing has further motivated the theoretical debate -- low prices in the short term are
good    for consumers,         but in the long term there is the welfare-decreasing                   effect of less
competition..      As social scientists we would like to understand the motivations of the firms acting
in our economy.       Since predation is a possible and interesting type of behavior, it is worth figuring
out under what conditions, if any, we do see it and why.
   The Chicago School has argued that predatory pricing is unlikely to be profitable for a firm,
much less a group of firms, and will therefore not occur. A firm expecting to gain from predatory
pricing must be able to earn excess profits (after the victim’s exit) to pay for the price war, but
excess profits are inconsistent with perfect competition.             More recent models in the game theory
literature     describe   situations   under     which predatory     pricing is rational.          One situation      is
asymmetrical finances, or the long purse story, where war begins because each side believes it has
the greater financial resources.         Signaling     (asymmetric    information)        is another explanation      of
predatory price wars.          Creation and defense of a reputation can also be a reason for predatory
pricirig.      Theoretical     work on reputation       has mostly focused           on the characteristics    of the
incumbent (cartel) rather than entrant. However, this paper will concentrate                     on the type of the
entrant and how it affects the probability of predation.
   At the turn of the century, British shipping firms operated in cartels that held and defended
monopoly positions in various international shipping routes.                I construct a dataset for this paper
which allows possible incidence              of predation by shipping cartels to be examined quantitatively.
The dataset consists of cases where an entrant attempted to break in to a cartel and records which
entrants precipitated a price war. This paper seeks to understand why some entrants are “fought”
and others are not. I describe the practices of the shipping cartels and discuss qualitative factors
that make predation a likely response to entry. I also examine entrants’ choice of market share to
see if it is related to entrant and market characteristics.               This unusual opportunity        to examine
predation is a result of both lack of antitrust laws and the propensity of the shipping industry for
collusion; the actions taken by shipping cartels are illegal in many modern economies.                     However,
it is worth studying illegal behavior because it tells us what firms will do if unconstrained,                     and
thus contributes to our positive understanding of firm behavior. 1                    “

1 On the policy side, if predatory pricing does not exist, then we do not need laws forbidding it and we could save
the resources used in enforcement.    If we see undesirable behavior, then understanding what features of the
environment and competition the behavior depends on helps us form relevant policy prescriptions.



                                                           3
     The results reported in the paper confirm that entrant shipping line characteristics                help predict
the probability of a price war:         a very young ftrrn is a weaker entrant and is more likely to be
preyed upon.         The young firms in the dataset are “weak” in the sense that they lack financial
resources,    have little multimarket      contact with rivals, lack experience,          and lack an established
customer base.        I find no evidence that long term contracts for cargo or government subsidies are
important in determining the strength of an entrant.             Nor do I find that the amount of time since
the last war occurred is relevant to the probability of predation, which might be the case if the
incumbents     were trying to maintain a reputation              for preying.     I do find that contracts            and
government subsidies affect the share with which the entrant enters, however. The significance of
some entrant-specific        characteristics    in determining      the incidence      of war lends support            to
theoretical    models with the same feature. The results provide the most support for the “long
purse” theory of predation.         An additional note is that the age of an entrant is unrelated to the
state of competition,      demand, or supply shocks,.          This finding provides support for the idea that
the price wars were not simply the outcome of vigorous competition in the context of demand and
Sllpply   shocks.
     The organization of the paper is as follows,         In Section 2 I discuss the predation literature and
the way these models could fit the behavior of shipping cartels.                Section 3 sets out the qualitative
evidence for predatory pricing, industry characteristics,           practices, and intent.2 Section 4 outlines
the model while Section 5 explains the variables used in the estimation and discusses the results,
Section 6 concludes.


2. Predation Literature
     The amount of theoretical literature in the predation area is vast. The position of the Chicago
School provides a valuable null hypothesis and starting points A firm will not engage in predatory
pricing because it would have to be able to recoup its short run losses by earning excess profits in
the long run, Those future profits depend on its successfully driving out the entrant or rival and
then maintaining monopoly power long enough to earn back its lost profit, which is difficult in a
free market.        The problem becomes even more difficult should a cartel, rather than a single firm,
consider predation.       The distribution of losses and gains must be arranged, and free-rider cheating
must be controlled.        The proponents      of this view conclude that price wars are not evidence of

predation,     but evidence of competition.           Perhaps cost changes or demand shocks trigger the
periods of low prices, but the intent is not predatory.45
   In a summary of the recent literature, Ordover and Saloner ( 1989) list three reasons a fm
might undertake predatory pricing.              The first is asymmetrical finances, or the long purse story,
where war begins because each side believes it has the greater financial resources.                           If the
incumbent’s superiority were common knowledge, entry would not be an equilibrium strategy for
the entrant. Some versions of the theory depend on imperfect capital markets,
   Signaling (asymmetric information) is a second explanation of predatory price wars. Ordover
and Saloner compare signaling to standard                limit pricing, except that the entrant has already
entered. Predation will occur in cases where the entrant lacks information about demand or costs.
For example, in Fudenberg                and Tirole (1986), predation    is used when it the entrant is less
informed or weaker, and can be convinced to exit.                A price war might lower acquisition price
(McGee 1980) or, by analogy, convince the entrant to accept a lower number of sailings (market
share) in the final agreement. Saloner (1987) notes that the incumbent is trying both to induce exit
and to improve its own position in case the entrant actually stays.
   Creation and defense of a reputation is the third story behind predatory pricing.                 Selten’s chain
store paradox (1978) shows that predatory pricing in the face of entry is irrational in a finite
game.        Milgrom    and Roberts        (1982) look at reputation     and its importance        in the case of
uncertainty.     They prove that when potential entrants can enter every period, the incumbent’s
reputation for preying will have a deterrent effect on entry and therefore some initial predation
may be rational.       Their result depends on a finite horizon for the game, which is not the case in
most industries, including shipping.             However, Fudenberg and Levine ( 1989) show that in the
case of an infinite horizon, a monopolist committed to a strategy can get at least his Stackelberg
equilibrium payoff if he is sufficiently patient.        Preying to convince entrants of its strategy can be
profitable for a monopolist in a game that does not end with certainty in any period.G


   Two General Types of Predation Models



 4 For example, SIade (1989) and Green and Porter (1984) describe models where demand shocks cause a price
war to begin among colluding oligopolists.
 5 A phenomenon which may be related to the cartels’ existence and pricing patterns is that of the “empty core. ”
Considerable scholarship has applied the theory of the core to the problem of ocean shipping e.g. W. Sjostrom
(1992) and S,J, Pirrong (1992). Although the empty core may well have contributed to cartel formation, the
question still remains whether the cartel fought entrants or whether periods of low prices represented spells where
equilibrium did not exist. The question of why cartels fought price wars can be addressed regardless of the
motivation for cartel formation.
6 Indeed, the incumbent can to do better than Stackelberg, if it is faced with forward-looking           entrants, by
committing    to a strategy over time.




                                                          5
   There are two main types of predation models. Those such as Milgrom and Roberts (1982) or
McGee (1980) derive very strict results; predation is rational but never necessary, or useless and
never used.     In contrast, other models predict predatory behavior will be less common or less
often optimal when the entrant has better “survivability” characteristics,       or is “tougher.”    These
papers allow for an entrant’s characteristics        to affect the chance of a price war.    Whether the
entrant’s toughness is a long purse or an investment of some kind, the general conclusion we can
draw from this strand of the literature is that predation is less likely to be undertaken against firms
which are stronger.       If this sort of model corresponds    to the shipping market of the late 1800s,
then entrant and market characteristics should help explain the probability of a price war.
   For example, Fudenberg and Tirole (1985) propose a theoretical model for the traditional ‘long
purse’ story. In their model, predation causes the entrant to have sufficiently little cash after entry
that it cannot stay in the market; no bank will lend to it at a profitable interest rate.       An entrant
with more cash, or a better relationship with its bank will attract less predation,    In an extension of
the Fudenberg       and Tirole model, Snyder (1993) shows that long term contracts            between an
entrant and its bank can succeed as a predation defense in some cases.          The long term nature of
the financing strengthens      the entrant.     Bolton and Scharfstein (1990) examine yet another ‘long
purse’ type of case.     Suppose a firm is financially constrained in order to provide managers with
incentives, then its rivals have a motive for attempting to make the firm earn losses in a price war
and exit.     The price war will only be successful if the entrant is sufficiently weak that the
incumbents can force exit. The type of model which allows for different outcomes depending on
entrant and market characteristics motivates the empirical work that follows.         I test if variables of
this type help predict the probability of a price war.
   Unfortunately,      empirical studies of predatory pricing are rare due to a lack of suitable data;
predatory pricing is often illegal in modern economies.         Evidence of predation has been found in
empirical work, mostly historical, such as Burns’ (1986) study of American Tobacco preying to
reduce the costs of acquiring         rivals.     Weiman and Levin (1994)     show that Southern       Bell
Telephone priced below cost and earned drastically less per phone in areas where it competed
with rival networks; the company succeeded in driving out or merging with most of its rivals by
1913. Genesove and Mullin (1996) show that the Sugar Trust priced below cost in the late 1800s
and argue that the Trust was trying to drive out recent entrants. Lerner (1994) finds evidence for
long purse predation in the disk drive indust~.         He finds that healthy firms choose a lower price
for products located in product space next to products of financially constrained firms in order to
drive out those weak firms.         This set of studies provides evidence that predation       is a viable
strategy for a firm.




                                                        6
    The legal standard for identi~ing        predatory pricing involves examining the relationship of the
low (possibly predatory) price to different measures of costs.7 Since I do not have detailed costs
over time, much less marginal cost data, it will be impossible for me to prove predatory pricing
existed according to common legal standards.               Moreover,     as economists     we are not especially
interested in the legal standard.       The definition of a “predatory” price which I will use throughout
the paper is a price which is lower than it otherwise would be due to an intent to force exit of a
rival.




 3. The Merchant Shipping Industry


   Merchant shipping has the classic features of scheduled transportation                   industries,    Airlines,
shipping, and railroads all feature large fixed costs of running the trains, planes, or boats.                  The
transport      system commits      to a regular      schedule    of departures      and stops     at intermediate
destinations    no matter how much cargo or people may want to use each particular stop.                        The
marginal costs of scheduled transportation             systems are very low up to capacity.               Giving an
additional passenger peanuts (plane), taking his or her ticket (train), or handling and storing a load
of tea (merchant shipping) is not costly compared to the use of the capital.                   The cost structure
gives providers an incentive to take on cargo at any rate above marginal cost if capacity is not full.
This type of cost structure can lead to all kinds of interesting behavior -- price discrimination,
price volatility, predatory pricing, for example -- because a low price can be charged that is not
below marginal cost.       Understanding     behavior in the shipping industry will provide insights into
the many other industries with similar cost structures.


3.1 Shipping Conferences
   Shipping Conferences         are associations     of deep sea merchant         or passenger     shipping lines.
British     shipping   lines invented    the concept     and the name “conference”             which I will use
interchangeably with “cartel.”       British lines were the largest, most technologically           advanced, and
dominant in most trade routes during the period.a                Therefore,     the first conferences      could be

 7 Various standards      for predatory   prices have been advanced:       price is less than marginal    cost,
short run marginal      cost, long run marginal     cost, average cost, or average variable     cost, cost does not
have any particular      relationship   to price due to more complex factors, and output increases.          See
Areeda, P. (1978) for full details.
8 Additionally, British lines were privately held and did not receive large government subsidies, providing a better
experiment for the economist, UK mail payments did exist, but on the routes in this dataset [hose payments were
not designed to sustain a line when there was not enough private business to keep it going.          In contrast, the
German government subsidized several lines to Africa, explicitly noting that there was not enough business on the
route for a line to run without government help.

composed entirely of British lines and nevertheless hold a monopoly position on a route.9                           It is
important to note that the existence of formal cartels in the economic sense is not an resumption.
It is possible to examine the actual contracts signed by the member firms agreeing to scheduling
and freight rates, the freight rates agreed to, the sailing schedules agreed to, the dues paid, and the
correspondence      written by members of many conferences. 10 In addition, there are scores of
secondary sources (listed in the Bibliography under “Data Sources”) which report and comment
on the behavior of the conferences because they were financially and technologically                   important.
   A Shipping Conference is composed              of a number of lines, all traveling the same route. 11 A
shipping line (or firm) might have been quite small, three ships for example, or could have been
large enough to cover many routes all over the world, as many of the well-known shipping firms
did. The purpose of a shipping conference was to set rates and sailing schedules to which each
line would adhere. The cartel also allocated market shares of specific types of goods and decided
the exact ports to be served by each member line (which had a similar effect since production of a
good was often concentrated in one area).
   A conference agreement includes all shipping lines providing scheduled service on the route.
Part of the definition of a conference is that is has a complete monopoly of scheduled service
(hence the conflict when another firm wished to offer service on the route). Conference size in my
dataset ranges from five to fifteen or so members.              Two of three conferences studied here cover
routes from the UK to British colonies (UK to South Africa, UK to India), the third runs from the
UK to the Far East (China, Japan, Hong Kong); all are mostly composed of British firms.                             See
Appendix II for more detailed histories of the conferences.
   Cargo rates were rather like modern day airline fares. Each type of good had a different rate,
often nonlinear in quantity, as did each port-pair.            Some large shippers had long term contracts
which offered savings off the standard rates. On top of that, some shippers might be able to claim
an additional rebate (discussed below).            As a result, it is nearly impossible for a researcher to
construct an average per ton rate for even one month on one route; I do not attempt it in this
paper.   Additionally, there are no price series which hold these factors constant over a significant
time period, so the paper does not contain an analysis of price movements                        over time such as
Green and Porter (1984).

9 The first conferences were formed in the 1870’s; the practice quickly spread ~nd has lasted to the present day.
By the turn of the century most shipping routes had a been cartelized, although many of these cartels were not
stable.
 10 The Shipping Records Archive of Glasgow University, Scotland, is one such repository.
11 Technically, each conference agreement would apply to only one direction of one route, UK to Calcutta for
example, because the opposite direction might be served by a different set of firms. Boats often travel led circular
routes, A to B to C to A, for example. A line running a ship from A to B would belong to the A to B conference.
but not to the conference on the B to A route. I include both directions of the route in my discussion and analysis
because my three conferences had a high proportion of overlapping members in the two directions.

3.2 Qualitative Evidence Concerning Predation
   As mentioned above, there are a plethora of secondary sources on the early shipping indust~.
Shipping was very important to the political economy of Britain in the late nineteenth century; it
helped the nation retain control of its colonies and fed the industrial revolution with raw materials
and export markets. The popular press, the business press, and the government wrote about to the
activities of British shipping lines and the conferences they belonged to. The three conferences
used in this analysis cover politically important trade routes (South Africa, India, Far East), and
remained intact and stable for the whole period, which improves the amount of available evidence.
Both the qualitative and quantitative data I use in this study were collected from firm histories of
shipping companies,         general histories of shipping, or histories of a specific port which were
generated due to this popular interest.lz               Most of these books are not specifically about the
operations of a particular cartel and the entry it faced, and therefore tabulating and cross-checking
the data was a difficult and time-consuming             process.      I also had access to some primary sources:
correspondence,       ledgers of accounts, and contracts written by the members of some cartels, as
well as the minutes          of a government          investigation     into (allegedly    destructive        [o colonial
development)         conference      practices.      All the      descriptions   of    market     practices     and   the
characteristics of conferences which affect the success of predation are culled from these sources.
Because the quantitative           information    I have is limited, it is important       to have the support of
qualitative evidence, and therefore it is presented in some detail below.
   The qualitative evidence on price movements (not available for many cases of entry) challenges
the explanation of the Chicago School because prices seem to not always move with supply and
demand.     Suppose entry causes prices to drop because supply has increased, and exit causes
prices to rise for the same reason. In some of the observed cases of entry, market prices rose a
few weeks after they plummeted due to entry, but no exit had occurred.                      Prices are described as
changing dramatically from one week to the next, more rapidly than demand could have changed,
without corresponding         changes in capacity. Also, price levels are correlated with membership in
the formal conference organization;           prices rise from price war levels to exactly the pre-war level
at the time the entrant is admitted to the formal conference organization.                      At the same time, the
secondary sources quote a letter or newspaper report saying that the entrant has agreed to abide
by the conference prices and has been assigned a market share.                    This combination        of events is
more consistent       with a deliberate price war than the interaction                of supply and demand,           To
determine sound cases of predatory                pricing, Easterbrook     (1981) suggests       finding evidence of
firms being driven out of the market by low prices and then of prices rising. Table I lists several


12 These   sources    are listed   at the end of the paper.

cases of entry where prices fell and then rose in cases where the entrant was driven out as well as
those where the entrant joined the cartel,
    Establishing predatory        intent is an important part of the qualitative            argument.      Appendix I
quotes from a series of letters between members of a conference facing a determined entrant.                        The
members discuss “punishing S trick by making him take unremunerative                      rates” and “repel [in.g] his
attack” because there is “no room for the Strick Lines” in the trade. The lower prices they agree
to charge in these letters are a deliberate and conscious                  attempt to force Strick to leave the
market. One of the cartel’s problems that leaps out at the reader is the difficulty of coordinating
the competitive response to an entrant. The burden of fighting the entrant will likely fall unequally
on members as will the cost of admitting the entrant.                 Cartel members reduced conflict by using
direct transfer payments          among themselves;         these are described      frequently      in the secondary
sources and must have been very common.                  In this way any Pareto improvement            could be taken
advantage of.
    The strength of a conference’s market power is critical in deciding whether predation could k
a profitable strategy. The only substitutes              available to the merchant were sailing ships (speed
depended on the weather), tramp ships, or a specially chartered vessel. The distinction between a
liner and a tramp depends on how the ship is scheduled.                A tramp picks up a full shipload of cargo
X at port A and carries it to port B, whereupon                  the ship looks for another contract.           Tramps
operate on a spot market where rates may fluctuate overnight according to supply and demand.
Tramps were a viable option in a port such as Singapore where many ships passed through on
their return journey to Europe with empty space, 13 In South Africa tramps were rarer and did not
reliably have space at any given time. In all the conferences, speed was probably the most crucial
distinguishing characteristic of the conference ships. Relatively valuable manuf~ctures and tea had
high opportunity      costs of time. Therefore, slower means of transportation                 were not very good
substitutes.     Additionally, chartering a slower tramp required paying for the whole ship.                        The
chartering solution would not be feasible for a merchant who wanted to send regular, less-than-
shipload lots; too much space, capital, and risk was involved.                    The data sources I read never
describe a merchant resorting to tramp shipping due to the high prices charged by conference
ships.   Additionally, the conference defended itself vigorously against charter companies; those
merchants who joined together to form a charter company would be discriminated against by the
conference during their rebellion and perhaps afterwards also,
   There is some evidence that prices in all three conferences generated positive profits for cartel
members.       During price wars, the entrant line was occasional y able to operate without loss at the


13 In fact, the “Straits Conference”   from Singapore   was very unstable and much less successful   than others due to
tramp competition

“fighting” rates.    For example, Solomon (1982) reports that during the price war caused by the
entry of shipowner Houston in the South African trade, Houston’s half-price rates were enough [o
cover his costs and the costs of the slower Conference lines.14 Letters from the owner-manager
of the Blue Funnel line report that Far East Conference rates increased Blue Funnel earnings by
20% over free market rates.15 The Calcutta Conference members claimed to be earning profits
after cutting their prices in response to entry by India Mutual.
    If excess profits were being earned, then the conference had to be concerned with protecting
its monopoly position from firms that wanted to share in those profits.                 Besides fixing rates of
freight and volumes carried, the conferences            invented the “deferred rebate” which may have
accomplished      this.    To promote     shipper loyalty, the lines arranged          to pay back a certain
percentage      (usually 10%) of a shipper’s total freight bill over six months, ~ the shipper had
patronized the conference exclusively during that six months and for a further six or nine month
waiting period.     Therefore the shipper faced the loss of 10% of a year’s freight if he decided to
switch his business to an entrant.      The deferred rebate created a strong barrier to entry, which, as
noted above, is necessary for predation to be profitable. 16
   If the cartel could protect itself from external challenges, it still faced the common problem of
cartel members themselves cheating on the agreement.               A convenient feature of shipping from a
collusive point of view is that it is impossible to expand capacity (number of ships) without being
detected.      Secret price discounts for major customers          was the only feasible way to cheat, but
keeping discounts         secret was difficult due to the fact that brokers            were involved in each
transaction.     Brokers were the equivalent of modern-day travel agents.              They made reservations
for freight and collected charges from the customer.             Brokers often worked for more than one
shipping fm      and had their own reputations to maintain.           The histories I have read suggest that
cheating on the part of cartel members was not a significant problem
   Revenue pooling also cut down on the incentive to attract cargo away from other lines and
promoted stability by giving the aggressive line only a fraction of marginal freight revenues.                   A
revenue     pool might require every line to contribute 50%17 of its freight revenues, for example, to
a common fund.        Distributions   from the fund were made in accordance with previously agreed
upon market shares.        Revenue pools, direct payments, and cargo sharing agreements developed in

 ‘ 6 Shipping conferences have been accused of creating the deferred rebate to protect their monopoly for many
years. Traditionally, they have defended themselves with various reasons why the deferred rebate is necessary, but
not anticompetitive.  For example, the penalty could have been designed to promote stability in the amount of
cargo shipped, which would lower average costs by allowing the shipowner to match demand and capacity exactly.

all three conferences, Additionally, the British Government made shipping lines bid for long term
contracts to carry its cargo; government cargo was usually exempted from a cartel agreement.                          A
cartel therefore did not enforce any agreement for the segment of the market where collusion
might have been harder to sustain. 16
    Predation requires imperfect information or imperfect capital markets; otherwise it is not a
rational strategy. The capital markets of nineteenth century Britain were certainly not primitive,
as the quotation below indicates, but it would be difficult to argue there were no imperfections,
     “The boom in the market for stocks and shares of all kinds after the repeal of the Bubble
     Act in 1825 included massive joint-stock promotions in the shipping industry ...The new
     capital was sorely needed...to cover the much higher costs of iron-hulled steam-powered
     fleets ...and no less than 413 shipping companies were registered under the new limited-
     liability legislation between 1856 and 1881. The more extensive use of limited liability in
     the 1890s and early 1900s improved owners’ opportunities for introducing external
     finance.”’9


Limited liability allowed the owners to use external financing more easily. However, Green finds
that ship owners had not been eager to borrow from banks in the early part of the period.
     “For most of the nineteenth century the industry had been reluctant to ask banks and
     other institutions for support...’it was never company policy to attempt to secure outside
     finance.’ For their part banks had been unenthusiastic about closer involvement. “z”


A reliance on private financing would increase the informational asymmetries required for a “long
purse” price war. Incomplete information regarding financial resources was a characteristic of the
shipping industry in this time period.          Most shipping firms were privately owned.               Their capital
would typically be owned by one or two extended families and neighbors. Each fm                        would have a
different mixture of loans and equity, and partners with different wealth and liquidities.                     Thus a
cartel would not have known the exact financial strength of an entrant nor would an entrant know
the precise financial strength, cohesion, or prospects for growth of a cartel.
   Price wars were exciting events for the media of the day, uncommon enough to be news, but
common enough to be analyzed for motives and patterns.                  The dataset I have constructed         has 47
cases of entry of which 14 are price wars. Based on a lot of reading from the industry and time
period, this proportion      of wars does not seem unusual. Overall, liner shipping in this period was

typical~y claiDmthat the goods were not selling at [heir destination due to high transportation costs. The cartel
would consider whether or not to lower the freight rate on that product. The customer would end up paying the
cartel rate or not sending the goods. If the customer instead used a rival line, (rather than the geographically closer
line or previous provider) the cartel would have a strong hint that the new carrier had cheated on price.

uniquely placed to try coordinated acts of predatory pricing.              Predation was not illegal, ships were
fungible, marginal costs were low, transfer payments within the cartel were easy, and the deferred
rebate created      a barrier to entry.        All of these factors contributed        to creating a favorable
environment for predation activity.


4. Model
     Most predation     is modeled as occurring          due to private information,     but I cannot use that
technique here. If a party has private information, it may think it will gain from either entering the
market or starting the price war.             Ex post,     one economic      agent discovers    its action was a
“mistake” and would not have undertaken the entry or war if it had had full information.                          Any
characteristics    of the entrant which were common knowledge                   and therefore   available to the
econometrician      should, therefore,      not predict predation.z 1 What should predict predation                 is
private information available to either party.           However, neither the cartel nor the econometrician
can use private information in a regression, for example, so another type of model is needed for
this study.
     Suppose the entrant line has a type, t, which represents its strength in terms of cash and other
resources.




E,   and therefore t, are unknown to any party, while X~ is common knowledge.                   If there were no
uncertainty about an entrant’s type, strong entrants would enter and weak ones would not. We
would never observe price wars. E is therefore crucial; its distribution is described by cdf F(.) and
pdf f(.).     The cost of fighting a price war to the entrant is c, where c>O. The cost of fighting the
war to the incumbent cartel depends positively on the strength of the entrant and is C(t)>O. For
convenience, the entrant’s outside opportunity             will be zero.    If the entrant is accepted into the
incumbent cartel, its payoff is p and the cartel’s payoff is -p.                 One way to think about the
magnitude of p is that it represents          a share of cartel profits forever, H/(m), where ~ is cartel
profits, r is the discount       rate, and I/n is the market share allotted to the new entrant. The
extensive form game is as follows:




21 In this study, the information available to the econometrician   would have been common knowledge   to other
shippers ex ante (as the entrant entered) as well as ex post.

t* is defined to be the (known) entrant strength at which the cartel is indifferent between forcing
exit and admitting the entrant. Define n= H/(m) and define ~                        by,

pr(xp+E>t*).                    n-c=o

Should a price war actually occur the cartel’s decision rule is to admit the entrant if its type turns
out to be greater than t*, but to drive it out otherwise.                     The strategies can be expressed more
succinctly in the following diagram.


         no entry                                  war                                     no war/admit

The interesting region here is the middle one, where the entrant knows it will be preyed upon and
yet enters anyway. Assume in this region that n - c - C(t) > O; this is equivalent to saying that the
profits at stake are large compared to the cost of predation for some part of the distribution of
potential       entrants.        I believe this is a realistic assumption         for my data.           The assumption   is
necessary to show that the intermediate region exists.

summing, n – c – C(t) S O, a contradiction


   The intuition for the game is straightforward.                 An entrant with cash and other resources is
more expensive to fight.       The cartel would prefer not to share the market with any entrants; it
calculates the cost of forcing an entrant to exit and compares that to the gain (recovering profits)
from exit.        In some cases the common            knowledge      characteristics     of the entrant       make this
calculation come out strongly one way or the other.                  In other cases, it is not clear how many
resources the entrant has (its type).         In [his case, it is worth fighting the entrant to learn its type
because the probability of winning times the profit recovered is greater than the expected cost of
the war. The value of E and the entrant’s true strength is revealed to everyone in the event of a
price war due to the strain of the war on the entrant’s resources.
        I have a set of measurable entrant characteristics,               X, that can be used to estimate the
entrant’s true type. Regressing these characteristics             on whether or not a price war occurred will
generate two interesting results.       First, if any of the characteristics are statistically significant then
the private information model, more common in the literature, is not completely appropriate for
shipping cartels.      Secondly,     the coefficients    on the variables will provide estimates              of which
characteristics    give the entrant significant strength.          From the above equilibrium strategies, the
appropriate equation to estimate is,


   Pr( War I Entry ) = @( X~ + E).




5. Variables and Estimation
   5.1 Variables
   I include in the dataset when, where, and for how long price wars occurred; these facts were
consistently    reported in the texts just mentioned.             Facts such as the pattern of price changes
around the entry event are usually not described, unfortunately.                    Most of the entry incidents are
mentioned in more than one source, so I am quite confident that events occurred as reported,                          I
record a war, rather than entry without               war, when the historical           sources   describe    a sharp
commercial conflict between the parties including price cuts.                 Sometimes the texts use the term
“price war” when describing        vigorous   price   decreases    in the history    of the firm or market, but not



                                                          15
always. Other common descriptions are “sharp price decrease, ” or “rates dropped by 40%,” for
example.     If entry involves only negotiation and no price cuts, or minor price changes (five or ten
percent) then it is not classified as a war.zz           A typical price war might last three months and
feature a price drop of fifty percent to the ports the entrant has chosen to serve.                Price decreases
of greater than fifty percent are also observed, as well as wars that lasted as little as two days or
as long as one year, Four potential observations              were dropped due to insufficient information on
the tonnage of the entrant or whether or not it was receiving a government subsidy. There were
an additional five or so references to price wars in second~                sources that did not identify either
the participants,   the time period, or the market, so I was unable to use them as observations.                       I
have no reason to believe that the omitted observations                  vary in a systematic        way from the
included observations, but there is no way to know for sure.
   Clearly shipping conferences         felt that keeping their monopoly positions was worth periodic
price wars. However, they did not fight every entrant which threatened to erode the conference’s
monopoly position.       A price war is an expensive way to protect a monopoly.               The first concern of
any type of entrant or cartel would be the cost of fighting a price war weighed against the
benefits.    It is impossible to determine the expected cost of a war without detailed information on
marginal cost for each ship in each line, composition of cargoes, exact structure of rate cuts, etc,2a
However, it is possible to find some proxies for the cost of a price war.                 Below I describe each
explanatory vaiable and its possible impact on the cost of a war as well as the predation theory it
supports.
   Testing the long purse hypothesis requires data on the financial backing of an entrant:                  personal
resources of the main owner and hiszl family, resources of other equity holders, relationship with
bank, and outstanding       loans.    Much of this information is unobsewable              to me, so I must use
proxies.25    Firm Tons is the total number of ten thousands of gross tons of shipping that the

22 I chose a cutoff point of 2070; price decreases greater than this counted as wars, otherwise the incident was not a
war. The distinction was made easy because there is a natural break in the data around this point; all reported
percentages were either small or more than 307..
 23 If the entrant were serving a selected port or carrying a particular commodity, the price cuts could k
specifically targeted and the cost to the conference members much reduced. The war against DADG’s entry to a
single South African port in 1894 is a perfect example; the conference lowered rates on fertilizer and machinery to
that port. Often I can’t find this information for an observation, and other times a general price cut was required.

24 All shipowners   during this period were men.

 25 However, I do know whether the company was publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange or not and can
use that as an explanatory variable,         Stock Exchange Intelligence lists publicly traded shipping companies’
financial structure in its yearly report.     The long purse hypothesis is less likely to be a motivation when the
entrant’s financial situation is publicly known: a public firm can conceal less information than a privately owned
firm, However, most of my entrants were not publicly traded and I found the dummy variable, P[lblicly O}vned,
empirically ineffective, so it is not discussed further.

entrant owns; all of them may not be on the route in question. The tonnage data come from the
annual publication Lloyd’s Register of ShiPuing.                 During this time period, Lloyd’s reported the
tonnage, type, and owner of every ship in the world, allowing a researcher to construct a tonnage
series for each shipping line for each year which is very accurate.                  The data sources make clear
that the size of the entrant firm is correlated with financial and other resources.                 The very biggest
lines had large cash reserves and networks of ships all over the world.                    The larger the firm, the
more likely the price war was occurring on only part of its routes and the more cash the firm
would have had.           Also, a fm       operating on more routes raised the likelihood of multimarket
contact with a fm           in the cartel.    For these reasons, a very large f~m would be less likely to
provoke a price war after entering a given route. A Fudenberg and Tirole long purse model fits
here, as well as a standard cost-benefit tradeoff as entrant strength increases.
    I also know the number of gross tons the entrant places on the route (Roclte Tons) from
secondary source descriptions of the entry incident.2G The amount of tonnage the entrant places
on the route determines            the maximum volume of trade the cartel loses.                 As the size of the
successful entrant rises, either ex post Cournot prices (including the new entrant’s capacity) will
fall or else current members’ share of perfect monopoly profits will Fall, Greater lost profits from
large entrants lowers the opportunity cost of any type of price war.2T As the entrant’s tonnage on
the route (Route TOTZS)increases, it is likely to provoke price wars; the cartel would like to drive
down the entrant’s route tonnage even if it does not expect to drive it to zero, A line’s Firm Tons
are not relevant to this problem.
   The dummy v~iable New is assigned a one if the fu-m had existed for less than five years at the
time of entry.        A young fm         is unlikely to have the cash and insurance reserves common to
established shipping firms at the time.zs When a firm was founded, funds were used to purchase
ships and begin operations;          large amounts of cash were not set aside.            After a firm had been in
existence for a while, it would have built up cash reserves and it might be self-insuring, in which
case it would have additional cash reserves.              Since most shipping firms were privately held, the
data do not reveal what the cash positions of each firm in the sample were at each entry date.                            I
assume that the conference is more likely to think its own reserves were greater than those of the


 26 I realize that net tons would be a better measure of capacity than gross tons (Net tons measures only cargo
space whereas gross tons includes the space taken up by the engine and fuel), However, gross tonnage data were
available for all observations while net tonnage data were not.

 27 An alternative    explanation for price wars could be irrational behavior on the part of either incumbent or entrant
owners, It could      be the case that friendships, connections, and pride were stronger motivations for shipowners
than profits, It is   also possible that outside shareholder control was more difficult during this period, leading to
less monitoring of    managers and their profit-maximizing    behavior or lack thereof.

28 This statement says nothing about the financial positions of the o}vners of the firm, as opposed to the firm itself,

new entrant if the entrant is a “new” firm. If a difference in expectations             exists it would generate
a long purse argument for predation.
    I believe that there is not a significant skill and information differential between old and new
firms. Most “new” entrants in the dataset are run by managers with a great deal of experience in
the shipping business,        Typically, a manager with ten years of management                  experience    at a
shipping firm borrows money from his relatives and starts out on his own. These managers have a
lot of experience with the trade and good information about the market.                  For example, I find the
difference in the growth of trade in years when new entrants entered compared to years when
other entrants entered is not significant.      The value of Firm Tons differs significantly between Ne}v
and older entrants       (100 compared       to 28 thousand       tons, t-test   2.09) as one might expect.
However, Firm Tons is included separately in the regression,                as described above. The value of
Route Tons does not differ significantly between the two groups.
   Contracts secured by an entrant before entry will make a long purse price war less effective,
therefore longer and more costly to the conference and in turn, less likely to be undertaken.
Contract is a dummy variable taking a one if the entrant has a long term contract for cargo on the
route.   This information is taken from the entry description in the secondary sources.                   Conrracf
will capture the Snyder version of the long purse theory.                  Long term contracts       should have
reduced the likelihood of all types of price wars by increasing their cost; the entrant had to
maintain sufficient tonnage to fulfill the contract and that tonnage would be immune from a price
war.
   Trying to make a government subsidized line (Government                 Subsidy) run out of funds and exit
does not make much sense since the fu-rrthas a softer budget constraint.                However, a war against
a subsidized    line could be effective in convincing            it to reduce its services on the route. zg
Government-owned        firms are not run by owners, in contrast to most of the firms in the sample,
but by professional      managers.      A Bolton-Scharfstein        long purse hypothesis        where the cash
problems due to the price war pressures managers might be the correct model. The coefficient on
the dummy variable Government Subsidy will indicate whether a subsidized fm                       is more or less
likely to be preyed upon for long purse reasons.
   The entrant’s opportunity cost, which here is relative trade growth on other routes, will affect
incentives   to enter and exit which           in turn affect the incidence         of price wars.         Outside


 29 Both German and Japanese subsidized lines experienced problems gathering and keeping political support for
their subsidies, especially when they made losses.        Non-monetary    as well as monetary penalties existed for
managers of publicly-subsidized  firms which earned persistent operating deficits: the line could be closed down, or
the management altered, NYK had an unstable political constituency in the Diet in the 1880s; its subsidies were
approved with difficulty and the debate affected its status in the conference. NDL lost 5.25 million Marks on mail
steamer lines to East Asia and Australia despite a subsidy of 44 million Marks. Scholl ( 1985) p200,




                                                        18
Opportunities     is defined to be a two-year moving average of the growth rate of all British trade
excluding the entrant’s route less the growth rate of the entrant’s route .30 A change in alternative
trade conditions      affects the entry choices of potential           entrants.s 1     In particular,    if outside
opportunities    get worse, weaker entrants will find it worthwhile to attempt entry into the cartel.
In that case, a higher equilibrium level of predation on the part of the cartel may be optimal.                        A
decline in Outside Opportunities        could therefore increase the probability of a price war.
    Trade Gro)vth is a two-year moving average of the percent change in the value of trade on the
route.   The value of Trade Growt/I fluctuates widely from year to year because of extremely
procyclical trade flows during the late 1800s.           If trade on a route was increasing the conference
may have been less likely to fight a price war; a price war would mean more foregone profits than
a war during a recession,         Additionally, a trade boom (Trade Grovvth) reduces the need to bargain
down the entrant’s quantity in absolute terms.           Although the cartel should have valued additional
boom trade as much as current trade, the difficulty of coordination              within the conferences caused
heavy reliance on the status quo.          It was much easier for a conference to allocate six sailings a
year to an entrant if the original members could keep their current schedules.                 Arguing over which
lines would make room for an entrant in a case where the market was not expanding was a time
consuming,      tension-filled,    and costly process.        Hence,     increasing    trade   on a route      made
negotiating entry easier. This variable picks up the cost of a price war, rather than testing one of
the three theories.
   Time Since Last War is a dynamic variable measuring the number of years since the last war
occurred in the cartel.      (This variable is not defined for the first entrants in each cartel.)           If there
has not been a war in the conference for many years, the members will have more cash reserves
than if they have been fighting price wars recently, all else equal ,SZ The variable Time Since Last
War also helps explore reputation-motivated           wars. If the cartel is signaling that it is a tough type
with each price war and its reputation erodes, there will be less need for a reputation-building                 war
if one just occurred.      Therefore, the probability of war conditional on entry will increase as the
last war recedes in time.         However, if the cartel’s reputation      does not erode and is well-known
before the sample period starts, this dynamic effect will not show up in the results.                 However, as
mentioned     above, Time Since Last War has cash flow implications                   which work in the same
direction.   Time Since Last Entry is defined analogously.


30 I use British Government trade statistics from the appropriate years to calculate all the trade variables.
31 This variable is used for foreign entrants because they are sharing traffic on the trade route with the British
incumbents, although they might not overlap 10070 with business already handled by the incumbents. Also,
industrial products originating in Germany (shipped by German lines) are direct substitutes for British produc[s,
32 Since trade is very cyclical, lines build up their cash reserves to outlast downturns and dispurse more money to
shareholders when reserves are high enough (in the opinion of management).        These cash reserves can be used to
help a firm survive a price war also.



                                                         19
   Throughout      the study I consider the continental ports of Hamburg and Antwerp to be good
substitutes for London, Liverpool, Glasgow, and Middlesbrough.                  A map of the area (Figure 2)
shows how geographically close these ports are to each other, particularly in comparison to the
long trade routes       considered     here.     Additionally,   Germany      produced     many of the same
manufactured goods in demand in the Far East and South Africa, so transshipment                     of cargo was
not necessarily required.      German lines did enter all three cartels during the period and provided
robust competition for the British Iines.ss
   The information I have regarding entrants is sufficiently crude that one variable can feature in
several hypotheses,     especially if one imagines a few alternative models under that hypothesis.
However, Table IV summarizes the expected effect on the probability of war for each of these
variables under each strategic hypothesis.


   5.2 Estimation


As mentioned above, the main specification I estimate is,


         Prob( War I Entry ) = @( X~ )


where the dependent variable is zero in case of an uncontested entry, one in case of a price war.
The X’s are the characteristics         of the entrant     and the market,       which have been discussed
previously.
   The estimation of the probability of a price war is conditional on entry. An immediate reaction
might be that there is a selection problem, and I should estimate an equation which explains if the
line enters in the first place and then estimate an equation which determines the probability of war.
However, the simplicity of the model removes this concern.               The model assumes that an entrant
can be characterized by one variable, strength.         If the entrant is strong enough, it enters, and if it is
strong enough again, it is not fought.         So entry is already explicitly conditioned on strength in the
model.    For example, since strength is the only characteristic of interest, there does not exist an
identi~ing    vuiable (to use in a Heckman correction procedure) which affects entry and not the
probability of war.     The strength of an entrant determines both whether it will enter, and how
successful it will be upon entry. An analysis of the entry decision would be very interesting study,




33 There is a large literature on the topic of the growth of German shipping, its competition with British shipping
and its success, and whether or not direct subsidies to German shipping lines during the period gave them an
advantage over British firms, For example, see Aldcroft (1974).
but very difficult to undertake in this context since one cannot observe the set of potential entrants
which do not enter.


    5.3 Results
    Results from the probit estimation are contained in Table V. The first specification in column
(1) shows that firm and market characteristics            are crucial in estimating the probability of war.
Ne}v has a large positive coefficient; young firms are more likely to be fought by a cartel.                A long
purse theory could explain this result; New firms are less likely to have the accumulated resources
that an older firm has.
   Firm Tons has a negative and coefficient that is significant at the 10% level (one-tail test). It is
of the expected sign; larger firms are stronger entrants and provoke wars less often. The effect is
not constant across all firm sizes; the coefficient on very small firms is insignificant, but wars are
less likely for firms in the second quartile. Between the second quartile dummy and the coefficient
on Firm Tons, only the smallest firms have an un-reduced probability of predation.                    In total the
entry of big lines is less often met with an aggressive response,             A “long purse” explanation for
price wars is consistent with the Firm Tons finding.             On the surface this finding is inconsistent
with Burns’ ( 1986) result where he finds that American Tobacco preyed upon larger rivals, not
smaller,     However, there are several significant differences in the industries.             First, capacity is
fungible in shipping, so merging is not necessary to reduce competition.               American Tobacco was
much larger and stronger than all its rivals - unlike these shipping conferences - and we therefore
never observe its response to a relatively “strong” rival. Burns claims American Tobacco picked
fights with larger rivals because there was a larger merger premium available for reduction.                   The
analogous statement for shipping conferences is that wars should have occurred against entrants
that expanded capacity a lot; that could be the case here also if one believes the positive (but
insignificant)    coefficient   on Route    Tons.34     The Firm       Tons result    is also consistent      with
multimarket contact reasons (cost) for avoiding a price war. On four occasions in the dataset,
despite there being no price war, the entrant exited.          In these cases, the lines reached agreements
where each party would exit from the other party’s “territory” to resolve the conflict created by
the entry.
   A larger number of Route Tons should do more damage to cartel profits; the opportunity                     cost
to the cartel of starting a price war falls and the opportunities        for renegotiation rise.35 That story



  34 I adjust the Route TotLs variable by weighting it by the inverse of the route’s distance; Indian observations
remain unchanged.     Since a longer route requires more tonnage to supply say, a monthly service, the adjustment
facilitates route comparisons,

 35 See Gelman and Salop ( 1983) for a model where small entrant capacity reduces the likelihood of retaliation,



                                                        21
is neither supported      nor disproved     by the pattern in the Rollte Tons coefficients here.               Each
quartile of RouteTons was given its own coefficient so that the effect of entrant size could differ
across sizes.    Although the coefficients on RouteTons             are nexly always positive - for all four
quartiles and across specifications - they are never significant.
         The extent of Trade Growth on the route negatively affects the probability of a price war.
If trade is growing quickly, more profits are foregone in the event of war and the cartel is less
likely to initiate one.    Ceding market share to an entrant may also be easier to negotiate in the
midst of a boom.3G Outside Opportunities             negatively affect the probability of a price war also.
Booming trade on another route may reduce the incentive to enter and therefore the need for
price wars.     Time is significant if included; there is a small, positive trend in the probability of a
price war over time.        I expected the conference dummies to be significant; this could reflect
different reputations     or equilibrium levels of predation.        However, the conference dummies are
insignificant if included and the results for the other variables are unchanged; conference dummies
are therefore omitted.      The normal pdf evaluated at the estimated index is reported at the bottom
of each column to allow calculation of marginal effects. The effect of New, for example, is quite
strong; the probability of incurring a price war upon entry is about 36% higher for a young firm
than an older one.
   In column (2) I include two more variables that represent the strength of an entrant.                  Having a
contract to carry cargo on the route (Contract) does not affect the probability of a price war; it
was predicted to decrease the likelihood of a price war because the cartel realizes a war would be
costly and ineffective. Likewise, having a Government Subsidy does not affect the probability of a
price war. The two long purse effects of Gover}zment Subsidy, additional pressure on managers
and the soft budget constraint, may be canceling each other out. These variables may also be too
crude to pick up an effect; I do not have a great deal of historical information about these firms
such as contract details and incentives or rules attached to subsidies.




36 It is interesting to note that Real outside Opportunities and Real Trade Growth are insignificant if they are
included in the regression rather than the nominal values. The two series are quite different because a relatively
small change in the general price level creates a large wedge between nominal and real rates of change. Only the
nominal values have predictive power. Inflation and deflation were known phenomena by this period, but it seems
unlikely that shipowners would deflate trade flows when thinking about how well a route was doing comp~red to
last year. For example, Temin, P. ( 1987) reports that managers at AT&T analyzed nominal protl[s up until the
1970’s, Alternatively, when managers deflated they may have used a price index specific to goods traded on that
route and items that were part of costs; a specific price index of this nature might not have been very correlated
with the overall consumer price index, which is what I have. Trade routes were often dominated by only a few
products, e.g. tea or manufactured cotton products, for which I do not have price indices. In that case, the deflated
trade measures are not reflecting anything economically significant and the variables should indeed be unimportant
in the regression.




                                                        22
   Column (3) adds a dynamic vwiable to the specification:                    Time Since Last War.           The
information       about a cartel’s behavior in the past might be helpful in predicting               the current
probability of war.      It appears here that elapsed time since the last war in the cartel does not
significantly increase the probability of the current entry triggering a war.             This result gives no
support to any dynamic story of learning or erosion of cartel reputation,
   If the model previously discussed is correct, firms with lower types should not only be preyed
upon, but on average         they should exit more often.           My estimation     of the index for each
observation is also the estimation of the firm’s signal.          I divide the ‘war’ observations     into those
that resulted in exit and those that did not; the first group has six observations             and the second,
eight.     If the model is correct, we would see a higher index for the exit group than the accepted
group.      The two means from specification          (1) are 0.622 and 0,349 respectively.           However,
because the sample sizes are so small, the two means are insignificantly different (t statistic=0,46).
If the sample were larger, we would expect the exit group to have a significantly higher mean
estimated index value.
   Tables VIa and b report the outcomes of the price wars and focus on differences between the
New and non-New’ groups.           Of the war events, close to half resulted in exit by the recently-arrived
entrant.    It is clear from the raw event counts in Table VIb that New entrants face a much greater
likelihood of both predation and exit. The fact that the predation is often successful supports the
claim that cartels are more likely to prey on New entrants.
   Despite a small number of observations,           many of the coefficients from Table V are significant
at the 10% level. Table VIC shows that the empirical estimation (column ( 1) of Table V) does
quite a good job at predicting the outcome of entry.               Ten out of fourteen wars are correctly
predicted. The explanatory variables, characteristics           of entrants and the market, are empirically
important in determining whether or not a cartel will begin a price war. The significance of those
characteristics     shows that entry and predation       decisions are not completely        driven by private
information.      Additionally, the effect of age provides some evidence for a predatory explanation
of price wars, rather than a demand or cost shock approach.


5.4 Correction for Misclassification          of a Price War
   It is possible that my sources may mistake a negative demand shock for a predatory price war.
The reason this is of some concern is that if the dependent               variable in a probit regression is
misclassified,     the resulting    coefficients   are biased    (Hausman    and Scott     Morton     ( 1994)) .37


  37 Porter ( 1983) uses econometric techniques to identify railroad price wars and discovers a high correlation
between his results and accounts of price wars cited by newspapers.    His evidence suggests historical reports of
price wars are quite accurate.




                                                        23
Misclassification could occur in the other direction also: an entry which resulted in a price war,
but was never described as such in my sources.                     If a price war is misclassified then the estimates
presented      in Table V will be inconsistent.               Hausman and Scott Morton          (1994) discuss two
methods for correcting such bias.               One is simply to use a likelihood function which explicitly
includes the possibility of misclassification,             which we call U.38


pr(y=       1)= pr(warle7zt~)      =U+(l-2a)@(X~)


   Maximizing this likelihood function results in an estimate of the percentage                        of observations
which       are misclassified      as well as estimates             of the betas.     The   abili~   to identify     the
misclassification      percentage comes from knowing the shape of the tails of the distribution.                    For
example, as the value of the latent variable declines, the observed outcome still has an u percent
chance of being a one due to misclassification.                  Because this method relies on the shape of the
error distribution,      I present results from a semiparametric method that does not depend on any
error distribution.      The semiparametric        method has two parts, First I use Han’s (1987) Maximum
Rank Correlation         (MRC) procedure         to estimate the coefficients of the explanatory           variables.lp
Secondly, I estimate the extent of misclassification                  with an Isotonic Regression      (IR).40    These
techniques provide a basic check for misclassification                 problems and also provide a way to examine
the assumption of normally distributed errors.
   Table VII repeats the earlier probit results and gives both the MLE and MRC/IR coefficients.
All of these methods estimate the ratio of the coefficients rather than their absolute size.~ 1 The
MLE results which are robust to misclassification,                  but assume a normal error distribution,       are in
column two, and semiparametric             results which are robust to both misclassification        and non-normal
error distribution are in column three.             Column two indicates that some entries that are true “no
war” entries        may be misclassified          as “war.”         The point estimate      for the extent       of this
misclassification,      ~,   is 5 YO, but the standard error is also 5 YO,              The estimate     of u,, “war”
misclassification, is zero, although it has a huge standard error because convergence                     was difficult



38 The idea behind this equation is that the probability of observing a one will be the probability
that the latent variable is greater than zero times the probability that the outcome is not
misclassified, plus the probability that the latent variable is less than zero but the outcome is
misclassified.  Writing down that expression and simplifying yields the likelihood function above,
39 The obsemations are ordered by the index (X~) and then a sum is constructed by giving an
indicator variable a “one” in cases where the dependent variables are also in the “correct” order.
40 Isotonic regression non-parametrically     estimates a cdf using ranked index values. The final
estimate is in the form of a step function; the lowest and highest “steps” are the tails and provide
consistent estimates of the misclassification    percentages.
41 MRC procedure estimates a normalized coefficient vector which must be resealed by holding one variable fixed,
RouteTons     ifjirst quartile is held fixed in Table V.



                                                              24
to achieve due to the small sample size. As expected, standard errors are higher than the probit
standard      errors because      additional    coefficients    must be estimated.     No estimated    coefficient
changes sign or magnitude between the two specifications; the same general conclusions can be
drawn from the MLE results as the probit results.
   However, the MLE results rely on the assumption of normally distributed errors, unlike the
semiparametric      results.     The semiparametric      coefficients lie for the most part near the original
probit estimates,     although      the slope coefficient on Firn~ Tons increases in magnitude.                 The
coefficients on the trade variables also increase by about fifty percent in magnitude.             Notice that in
contrast to MLE, the Isotonic Regression method estimates the first step at height zero and the
last at height one; the estimates of both ~ and al are zero. According to these estimates, neither
category of dependent variable suffers from misclassification.
   Because the estimates in columns (1) and (3) are not identical, the assumption                     of normally
distributed     errors may not be a good approximation                for these data.     However,     the robust
semiparametric      method       produces      results quite similar to the original probit      results,   so the
normality assumption is not strongly affecting the coefficient estimates.              The important conclusion
of this section is that misclassification of the dependent variable does not appear to be a major
problem in this dataset.


5.5 Estimating Entrants’ Tonnage
   The analysis thus far has focused on the entry decision as a zero/one choice.                     However,    an
entrant also had the choice of how much tonnage to place on a route when it entered.                  This choice
should depend       on firm and market characteristics,              and perhaps     also on the probability     of
predation.      I examine a reduced form model of this problem to see if the results are consistent
with the entry results already obtained.               I look at that choice conditional      on entry, thereby
restricting the dependent variable to the strictly positive range. Potential entrants that placed zero
tons on the route, i.e. did not enter, are not included.           The equation I estimate is:


        E( Route Tons I Entry ) = Xy + &


where the X’s are the characteristics            of the entrants and the market discussed above with two
additional variables.          Past War Percentage        is defined to be the cartel-specific    percentage     of
entries which have resulted in wars up to the current entry. If a cartel’s equilibrium strategy is to
prey on a certain proportion         of entrants to maintain a reputation and keep others out then Past
War Percentage will be positively correlated with the probability of the current entrant attracting
a war. A higher Pasf War Percentage may also encourage entrants to place more tonnage on the
route since they are more likely to be bargained down in a price war. The second new variable,


                                                           25
Time Since Last Entw, is the number of years between the current entry incident and the most
recent case of entry into the same cartel.
    The results of an OLS regression explaining an entrant’s route tonnage choice conditional on
entry are reported in Table VIII. Relatively poor trade elsewhere (Outside Opport~~nitie.s) causes
an entrant to place more tons on the route.       New has a large negative coefficient; young lines on
average enter with a smaller amount of tonnage.          Having a Contract causes a line to place more
tonnage on the route, all else equal.     Contract was not significant in the probit specification, but
here displays a significant and positive effect on an entrant’s tonnage. Governmeizt Subsidy is only
marginally significant; firms receiving a subsidy may enter with more tonnage than otherwise.
   The coefficient on Firm Tons supports rational behavior on the part of shipowners.            The total
amount of tonnage the firm owns (Firm Tons) has a very weak influence on how much tonnage it
will place on the new route.      Only if the upper bound is binding do we expect an effect.           The
coefficient on New perhaps represents the effect of imperfect capital markets.       The coefficients of
the conference dummies are determined by sailing conditions and magnitude of trade flows on the
route and are not economically significant.
   In column (2) I include Time Since Last War to see if it affects entrant                 tonnage.   The
coefficient is insignificant.   If a cartel’s reputation is well-known, then the amount of time since
the last war should not affect the entrant’s choice of Rol~te Tons.        This result is therefore not
inconsistent with reputation theories, but is not evidence for them either.      Time Since Last Entry
might have a positive effect on entry tonnage because no other line has increased capacity lately.
On the other hand, it might have a negative effect because trade conditions have been so bad no
other line has wanted to enter.     Thus, it is not a surprise that the coefficient is not significant in
column (3).     However, the proportion      of entrants fought in the past is important.      Column (4)
shows that Past War Percentage          has a large positive coefficient but it is not very significant
either. Given that an entrant has decided to enter the route, it may want to enter with more tons if
there is a history of price wars on the route.        However,    the coefficient drops in half if early
entrants (Past War Percentage =0) are excluded from the regression.          The result is being driven
by early entrants who entered with fewer tons (perhaps because there was no history of organized
opposition    on the route or because technological      change in ship sizes is not captured with the
Time variable).   The tonnage results are consistent with the entry results reported previously, but
again, it is difficult to make any sense out of the dynamic variables because of the small sample
and the complex setting.


6. Conclusions




                                                    26
   The qualitative and quantitative results suggest that price wars in this industry were not caused
by competition (demand or cost shocks), but by predatory behavior.            If the wars occurred simply
because of market conditions, then the variable Ne}v should not be significant.               The age of an
entrant line should be irrelevant to the opportunity       cost of entering or exiting the route and the
size of any supply or demand shock.           Young entrants do not differ from older entrants on the
basis of characteristics    in the dataset,   However, if the two groups differ systematically in some
way I cannot observe, then age might be picking up demand or supply shocks.                        The intent
expressed in the correspondence        between members of the cartels as well as other anticompetitive
behavior exhibited by the cartels provides additional evidence for the predation story.

        The results    of the analysis here suggest        that British shipping     conferences     engaged
predatory price wars, and the incidence of such wars depended in part on the characteristics of the
entrant and the market.      Opportunities    for outside trade, growth of trade on the route, the age of
the entrant, and the size of the entrant’s firm all contributed     to the cartel’s decision to prey. The
overall results provide support for the general type of theoretical work which argues predation
will be a more profitable strategy against “weaker” entrants.           The characteristics    which I find
make an entrant weak are lack of age, or lack of the experience and financial resources correlated
with age, as well as weak market conditions.          Larger absolute size of the firm, regardless of its
entry size, also makes the entrant stronger.         This result is most consistent with the long purse
theory of predation.       I do not find that government     subsidies, contracts,   and public ownership
significantly affect the probability of predation.     I also find little evidence to support any kind of
reputation motivation for price wars.         One variable which might support a reputation story Time
Since Last War does not affect the probability of a price war.          In particular, my results indicate
that price wars in turn of the century shipping markets were not wholly the result of “mistakes” in
private information, but also depended on commonly known entrant types.                The significance of
the size and age variables in predicting predation suggests that the long purse theory of predation,
rather than signaling or reputation, was the dominant motive on the part of the shipping cartels.

1, Because the estimates of ~ and al are zero, their standard errors cannot be calculated using the MRC/IR
method; an adjacent step is necessary for standard error estimation.
 2. One variable must be held fixed to calculate the standard errors for the Han coefficients. In Table VII it is
RoL!teTons fsecond   qllartile.
3. The Probit and MLE results must be scaled in order to be able to compare them to MRC. The MRC/IR
method only estimates the ratios of the coefficients, not their absolute magnitude, I chose a scaling factor which
creates equal Firm Tons coefficients across the two methods. That scaling factor was then used on the other
Probit and MLE coefficients.
4. The size of the window width used to construct the kernel for computation of the standard errors of the MRC
estimates strongly affects the resulting standard errors. As the window width rises, so do the standard errors.
The corresponding standard errors in Hausman and Scott Morton (1994) are not sensitive to the window width;
the dataset in that paper has 5200 observations, I report results using a window width of 0.3, which gives
reasonable standard errors; however, there is no general theory that gives an optimal window width for this
method.

into the Bombay Trade. The correspondence reported here was saved by the Ellerman Line, a
member of the Conference, and is now archived in the Business Records Library of Glasgow

Minutes of Meeting of the Bombay Steam Trade Conference
May 6, 1903
“Mr. Gill having returned from London reported that before proceeding further with the points
already under review, there was a new and serious feature to take into account, namely the
reported amalgamation between Messrs. Strick, Messrs. Bucknall and the West Hartlepool
S .S .Co. in the Persian Gulf trade, who were stated to be endeavoring      to get shippers in
Manchester to sign contracts. Mr. Gill explained that he had discussed the whole matter very
fully with the B. I.Co. [British India], and they were willing, in order to assist in defeating this
opposition, to carry the goods on from Bombay to Persian Gulf Ports at cut rates, say one-third of
whatever rate the West Coast Lines accepted through from Manchester, with a minimum of five
shillings,... ”

Minutes of Meeting of the Bombay Steam Trade Conference

“3) Persian Gulf Trade: Again discussed, and until Strick’s next boat from Manchester was out of
the way, it was agreed that the Conference Steamers should quote very low rates, down to 17/6

take unremunerative rates. After the departure of Strick’s boat the matter to be reconsidered,...

“31st August, 1903
Dear Mr. Ellerman, [Ellerrnan Lines]
    I have today been shewn the Letters between Sir George Mackenzie and Mr. Lloyd of the 14th
and 17th July, by which it appears the proposal is to admit the S trick Line to the Bombay Trade
from Newport by a monthly sailing, in consideration of the Line withdrawing from the Persian
Gulf Trade and not taking cargo via Bombay to the Indian Coast, i.e., if you give up the Persian
Gulf Trade we would negotiate for your admittance to the Bombay Trade from Newport.
    It is further proposed that the Strick Line should stop competition from Bombay and Karachi
cargo from Manchester and Liverpool, whilst the Bombay Lines are to discontinue carrying cargo
to the Persian Gulf Ports via Bombay, and although this may be a good arrangement for the S trick
and Persian Gulf Lines I fail to see how it can be of advantage to the Bombay/Liverpool Lines,
and the reason for their advocating it.
    You have always urged the necessity for the Bombay Lines loading from Newport, and I have
agreed with you that it is to our interest to do so. There is no room for the Strick Lines and I am
opposed to any negotiations for an arrangement with him. We must repel his attack, and if
continued we should retaliate on the Persian Gulf Trade.
                                                 Yours faithfully,
                                                 C.W. Cayzer” [Clan Line]

Appendix II: Conference Histories
   South Africa
   The South African conference served the ports of the Cape Colony and Natal from both the East and
West coasts of Britain (see Figure 3). The two founding lines were the Union Line and Castle Line. In the
1870s the South African Government gave each a half share in the mail contract to spur technological
competition;   the Union and Castle lines split the contract          until 1900 when they merged.            Meanwhile
steamships were becoming more efficient and profitable and a spate of entry began.                The Union and Castle
lines felt sufficiently   threatened   to organize a formal conference       in 1882 with two other firms.            The
conference established     freight rates to be charged by all members and tightly regulated the number of
sailings and ports of call allotted to each member line. The two mail lines worked closely in the conference,
essentially deciding the rules for the other member lines; they kept the lion’s share of sailings for themselves
and negotiated favorable rate differentials for their faster (mail) ships.       Additionally, South Africa did not
export very much during the period - gold and diamonds were the major commodity exports - yet the colony
demanded every sort of British manufactured         good from railway ties to jam.      Needless to say, the shipping
lines did not have much volume in the way of “homeward,” or UK bound, freight. The two mail lines
expressly forbade the others from loading what little homeward freight there was, instead paying each line
an annual subsidy in compensation. 43 The mail lines made substantial side payments on several occasions
to settle disputes and most lines belonged to at least one revenue pooling arrangement.                Though the cartel
was disrupted by entry, price wars never arose because of internal disagreements           alone.
   Competition    on the basis of price, though submerged,         is occasionally    visible in shipper actions.     For
example, a line could compete on the basis of price by absorbing              wharfage dues, usually paid by the
shipper, or by including some inland transportation,           or by misclassifying    freight.     The rate differential
between the faster mail ships and the slower cargo lines was also an area of continual disagreement,                    as
each member line tried to implement a pricing policy favorable to itself.
   A particular characteristic    of South African trade was the strength of local merchant feeling against the
monopoly power of the Conference .44 On several occasions South African merchants who wanted an
alternative to the conference encouraged entry without success.          Local merchant associations occasionally
formed their own line with charter ships, or threatened to, on all three routes.                  If the merchants   were
homogeneous and united, as in the case of Calcutta,         they could gain.     Most often merchants movements
were too fractured to extract concessions from the conference, as in South Africa.45



43 In fact, a cargo line which “loaded homewards”    was fined E2,000 by the conference!    Solomon, E. ( 1982) p39.

44 See Solomon, E. (1962) for a thorough description.

 45 According to Hyde, F. (1967 p97) conference pricing gave merchants one advantage, “.,.a uniform, continuous
rate to make forward contracts with a certainty that no competitor by getting cheaper conveyance, can undercut

    Calcutta and Bombay Conferences
    The Indian conferences      were naturally    more disparate than the South African conference due to the
geography of the route (see Figure 1). Some members continued on to the Far East, some to the Persian
Gulf, some to the East coast of Africa, etc. The first Calcutta conference was formed in 1875 consisting of
British India, the P&O, Hall, and City lines. All Indian tea was shipped from Calcutta or Ceylon; the
Calcutta Conference agreed on the tea rate each year.           Each line paid a percentage of its freight revenues
into a common pool which was then allotted to lines in a certain proportion.         No restrictions were placed on
volume carried or number of sailings,         Again,    many side payments    and other   pooling arrangements     also
existed. For example, after Clan entered the tea trade in 1882, it was paid L2,000 per year by the P&O and
fl ,000 by British India not to carry passengers.qb
    On occasion a member would quit the conference and start a price war over some disagreement                      --
usually market share. I do not include these cases of war in the above analysis.           A representative   example
of this type of behavior occurred in 1886 when Clan decided it would like a bigger share of the tea coming
from the port of Calcutta (one of the stops in the India Conference).        The other lines were not receptive, so
Clan withdrew from the Conference and started carrying tea in special arrangements            with plantations.    The
conference capitulated     in the summer of 1887, giving Clan a larger percentage of trade.          Motivations   for
such behavior were different from standard             entry so the two types of observations      are therefore   not
combined.
   The Bombay Conference was initially formed in 1879. It set standard cargo and passenger rates, most
importantly rates on Lancashire cotton piece goods from Liverpool.           By 1885, its members consisted of the
P&O, British India, Anchor, Harrison,         Hall, Clan, City, and Rathbone.        I can find 16 cases      of entry

occurring in the following years.      Many entrants were resented and fought vigorously, others were given
complex shared rights to certain ports and cargo.


   Far Eastern Freight Conference
   The original Far Eastern Freight Conference            (hereafter   FEFC) agreement    included the P&O, 0SS,
Glen, Shire, Mogul, Skinner, and Messageries Maritimes (French) in 1879. The most valuable cargo of all
heading to China was Lancashire and Yorkshire (L&Y) goods: yam, wool, cotton, and silk manufactures.
0SS, being based in Liverpool where the products were manufactured,              had a virtual monopoly of L&Y
goods. However, it paid shares of the L&Y revenue to other lines in the Conference which were forbidden
to load at Liverpool.



him or depreciate his stock, ” He thought merchants were worried about windfall profits and losses if freight rates, a
large proportion of the cost of goods, were set by a free market.

46 Muir, A. (1978) p133,




                                                           41
   Although primarily British firms tried to enter in the early period of the FEFC, in the 1890s a new
group of non-British lines began sending ships to China.     A few nations which had interests or possessions
in the region now had ocean-going steamships.     Swedish and Italian lines are the main examples.        Austrian
Lloyd (Italian) entered Far Eastern routes in 1892; it was heavily subsidized by the Italian Government, but
seemingly without a clear strategy in mind for the business of the line.        In contrast,     the government   of
Japan gave the FEFC’S main competitor,       the newly formed Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) line, explicit
goals, One was to keep export freight rates low. The Japanese government frequently denied rate increases
to NYK on silk and cheap manufactures.       The NYK bargained and muscled its way into the conference in
several stages from 1893 to 1901.        Government    subsidies,   special route subsidies,      and specific rate
requests on the part of the government      considerably   enhanced NYKs      bargaining       power vis a vis the
FEFC,47




  47 Doug Irwin (1991) applies modern strategic trade theories to this period, He does not claim the agents knew
what they were doing strategically, whereas the in this case the Japanese Government may well have been aware of
the effects of its actions.
