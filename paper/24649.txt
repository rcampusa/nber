                                         ABSTRACT

We use Adobe Analytics data on online transactions for millions of products in many different
categories from 2014 to 2017 to shed light on how online inflation compares to overall inflation,
and to gauge the magnitude of new product bias online. The Adobe data contain transaction
prices and quantities purchased. We estimate that online inflation was about 1 percentage point
lower than in the CPI for the same categories from 2014--2017. In addition, the rising variety of
products sold online, implies roughly 2 percentage points lower inflation than in a matched
model/CPI-style index.

1        Introduction
The e-commerce share of retail spending in the U.S. has almost tripled in the
last 10 years to 10% overall and more than 50% in several major categories,
according to the U.S. Census Bureau (2018). See Figure 1. If online pricing is
fundamentally different than traditional retail, its spread could have a rising
impact on the overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) and, potentially, bias it.1
        We use Adobe Analytics data on online transactions for millions of products
in many different categories from 2014 to 2017 to shed light on how online
inflation compares to overall inflation, and to gauge the magnitude of new
product bias online. The Adobe data is similar to the Billion Prices Project of
Cavallo and Rigobon (2016), which scrapes list prices from the web, but the
Adobe data also contains the quantity purchased for the products in addition
to prices. Table 1 provides a quick comparison between the CPI, the Adobe
dataset, and the scraped data from the Billion Prices Project.
        We follow two literatures. One uses detailed scanner data from grocery
stores to analyze new product introductions, such as Broda and Weinstein
(2010). Another studies consumer surplus from the internet and e-commerce
in particular — e.g., Brynjolfsson, Hu and Smith (2003), Goolsbee and Klenow
(2006), Brynjolfsson and Oh (2012), and Varian (2013).
        We document 1.3 percentage points per year lower inflation online than in
the CPI for the same categories. The data also show that the entry of new
products and the exit of old products is extremely important for most
categories of goods. The net entry of new goods during the sample implies that
matched-model price indices overstate true inflation by an additional 1.5 to 2.5
percentage points per year.
    1
     Economists have long known about the potential for new products to bias upward the
inflation measured in the CPI. See Boskin et al. (1996) and, more recently, Groshen et al.
(2017). Recent business press articles have argued that online commerce may be leading to
growing problems in measuring inflation and complicating monetary policy decisions at the
Federal Reserve, as in Cohan (2017), Torrey and Stevens (2017) and Gross (2017). Meanwhile,
Gorodnichenko and Talavera (2017) document that online prices are more flexible and exhibit
higher exchange rate pass-through than offline prices.

2    Adobe Data

Adobe Analytics provides a variety of services to e-commerce merchants who
share their transaction data for Adobe to analyze. Adobe clients include 20 of
the 30 largest employers in the nation and 80% of Fortune 500 retailers.
    Its underlying data are the quantities and revenue from individual
transactions (not including taxes or shipping costs).       Product codes are
merchant-specific, so our definition of a product will be the product-merchant
combination. We use Adobe’s data aggregated up to the monthly level: total
quantities and average transaction prices for each good for each month. Adobe
anonymizes the data so we cannot identify any retailers or customers.
    We use a subset of the categories and merchants from the full Adobe data
set. Table 2 shows the number of products in the Adobe data we use (overall
and by CPI Major Group), averaged over the January 2014 to September 2017
period. It contains over 2 million products in the average month from January
2014 through September 2017, vs. about 140,000 per month in the entire CPI.
There are 211 CPI categories known as Entry Level Items (ELIs), and the Adobe
data covers 65 of them. The categories covered make up 19% of the CPI relative
importance weights in Bureau of Labor Statistics (2018).
    Revenue in our Adobe dataset amounts to about 15% of all retail
e-commerce tabulated by the U.S. Census Bureau (2018). Table 3 shows how it
is distributed across CPI Major Groups. Compared to the full CPI, the dataset is
definitely tilted toward tangible goods like appliances, furniture, clothing,
electronics, and toys. Within some broad CPI categories, it covers only certain
types of products. Within Housing, for example, the Adobe data do not include
rent or owner’s equivalent rent, only specific products hence we label them
“Household Goods.” Similarly, we refer to “Information Technology” as the
goods within Education and Communication that the Adobe data covers.

3        DPI vs. CPI Inflation

We construct a matched-model price index using the Adobe data, and call it
the Digital Price Index (DPI) to distinguish it from the CPI. We start with price
changes for overlapping products in months t−1 and t. These are products
selling positive quantities in both months. We take log first differences of
average unit prices. To aggregate price changes across products within an ELI,
we use Tornqvist weights. These are the average spending share of the product
in the ELI in months t−1 and t. The spending shares are based on Adobe data
for overlapping products.2
        To facilitate comparison with the CPI, we aggregate the Adobe ELI inflation
rates using the CPI relative importance weights for each ELI-month. We use the
same set of ELIs to construct both our comparison CPI and the DPI. In this way

    2
    Like the BLS, we do something special for apparel. We construct a simple index of average
unit prices. This is to avoid extreme deflation from fashion and seasonal cycles for clothing.

we can rule out that differences between the two indexes arise from categories
which are not covered by the DPI or the weighting of categories covered.
   We plot the two indices together in Figure 2. The DPI exhibits notably more
deflation over the period than the CPI for the same categories, ending up 4%
lower by the end of the sample. Table 2 shows the average annual inflation rates
from 2014–2017. Overall (headline) DPI inflation is 1.3 percentage points per
year lower than CPI inflation for the equivalent products. Breaking out by Major
Groups, inflation is lower in the DPI than in the CPI in every category other than
medicine & medical supplies.
   Now, excess deflation in high frequency, chain-weighted price indices can
result from oscillating prices due to recurring discounts. This phenomenon is
known as “chain drift.” Even if the prices and quantities revert to their starting
levels, a chained price index may not revert to 1. This has been documented in
grocery store scanner data by Ivancic, Diewert and Fox (2011) and de Haan and
Van der Grient (2011).

               average inflation for 2014–2017. Source: Authors’ calculation
               using Adobe Analytics and BLS data.



    To gauge the sign and magnitude of chain drift in the Adobe data, for each
year we added an artificial “13th month” in which all prices and quantities are
identical to first month’s prices and quantities. When then asked whether price
index returns to 1 in the 13th month. As shown in Table 5, we found positive
chain drift on average and in 6 of the 8 Major Groups. Chain drift was most
positive for ICT and apparel items. Thus, chain drift if anything reinforces our
finding that inflation is lower online than offline.



4    Product Entry and Exit
Because the Adobe dataset include quantities as well as prices, we are able to
look at spending on entering and exit products.                The CPI does not have
quantities for items sold within ELIs, so it can see the frequency of products
exiting but it cannot tell the market share of exiting products. And, since the

BLS samples only a small fraction of products at a given merchant, it cannot
assess the frequency of product entry within merchants, much less the market
share of entrants. The AC Nielsen scanner dataset also contains quantities
sold, but this dataset is heavily tilted toward food and beverages in grocery
stores — see Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl (2017). The Adobe data allow us to
quantify the importance of new varieties outside of grocery stores.
      We classify a product as new if the product-merchant combination did not
exist in the data in the previous calendar year. Analogously, we classify a
product as exiting if it does not appear in the following calendar year. We
present the entry and exit rates of products by category, weighting by sales of
each product in Table 6.3 In apparel, fashion and seasonal cycles depress sales
of outgoing products and inflate sales of new products. We therefore report
results with and without apparel.

  3
  We weight by the average monthly sales of a product during the calendar year across the
months the product was available.

       As shown in Table 6, roughly half of online sales are on products that did not
exist in the previous year. Even without apparel, the figure is 44%. Entry rates
are particularly high for ICT products and for recreational items such as toys.
Products that disappear, meanwhile, totaled about 24% of sales before they left
the market (22% excluding apparel). Note that, if all that was happening in the
data was relabeling of the same products each year, then we would expect both
entry and exit rates to be inflated by equal amounts. Such relabeling cannot
explain the high share of entering relative to exiting products. Product entry
and exit rates covary positively across the Major Groups.
       The food and beverage category shows much less dynamism than other
categories. Entry and exit rates for these categories are less than half that for all
Adobe products (even excluding apparel).                Thus previous studies finding
substantial new product bias in grocery stores, such as Broda and Weinstein
(2010), may have actually understated the importance of new products.4
       We close this section by asking whether entry and exit rates vary with a
product’s price or revenue. To the best of our knowledge, little is known about
this question empirically, despite the prominent role of new products in
growth theory.5       Figure 3 shows that entry rates are higher for high price
products. This is consistent with products entering with above-average prices,
as has been documented in the CPI for apparel, electronics and appliances by
Bils (2009). Entry rates are lower for high revenue products, perhaps suggesting
it is harder to create high quality products and/or it takes time for products to
accumulate sales as in Hottman, Redding and Weinstein (2016).
       Figure 3 shows that exit rates are higher for high price products. This is
more surprising, as the aforementioned studies found steep price discounts
preceding product exit for apparel and electronics. Exit rates are lower for
higher revenue products. This could be because such products are harder to

    Bils and Klenow (2004) report a markedly lower exit rate for food than for other CPI items.

    Classic references include Romer (1990) for expanding varieties, and Aghion and Howitt
(1992) plus Klette and Kortum (2004) for rising quality through creative destruction. See
Acemoglu (2008) for a textbook treatment.
12                               GOOLSBEE AND KLENOW



creatively destroy by competitors, as hypothesized by Garcia-Macia, Hsieh and
Klenow (2018).         It lends support to the idea that firms can escape from
competition by innovating as in Aghion et al. (2005).



5         The Impact of New Products on Inflation

Feenstra (1994) showed that a direct way to gauge the importance of new
products in a CES framework is to look at the growth rate of overall spending in
a category minus the growth rate of spending for products that exist in both
time periods. The higher this net growth rate, the lower the true inflation rate
relative to the matched model inflation rate. As shown in Table 3, entering
products do tend to have significantly bigger market shares than outgoing
products in the Adobe data, even outside apparel.6 Feenstra (1994) showed
that the reduction in true inflation equals the net growth in spending on new
varieties times 1/(σ − 1), where σ is the elasticity of substitution between
varieties. We use a baseline value of σ = 4 based on Hottman, Redding and
Weinstein (2016). We also consider a higher value of σ = 6 for robustness — a
more conservative value given new varieties are less valuable if they are closer
substitutes for existing varieties.
         Table 7 presents estimates of new goods bias in the Adobe online data. Even
excluding apparel, the arrival of new goods is equivalent to 1.5 to 2.5
percentage points lower inflation than what a matched-model would indicate.7
This is much higher than the 0.6% per year new product bias estimated by the
Boskin Commission, though that was for the CPI as a whole. The Adobe data
may cover items with larger-than-average new goods bias. Outside apparel,
new goods bias looks largest for recreation and ICT products, and lowest for
medicine and food.
     6
     This should capture improvements in product quality in addition to brand new types of
products, because both are associated with new product ID codes in the Adobe data.
   7
     We exclude apparel because incoming items may sell a lot more than outgoing items purely
due to seasonal/fashion cycles.

         The vital role for new goods in the Adobe online data calls for more research
on new varieties in traditional retail, preferably outside of just the items with
UPC codes that are mostly confined to food, beverages, and drugstore items.8
If offline sales are similar to online sales, as suggested by Cavallo (2017), new
products may be even more important than previously thought.

6         Conclusion
Using a new dataset on e-commerce transactions in many categories of goods
from Adobe Analytics, we calculated matched-model inflation and explored the
importance of new products. Combining the two, the true Adobe DPI inflation
rate — adjusted for new goods — was more than 3 percentage points per year
lower than the CPI inflation rate for the same categories from 2014–2017.
     8
    Aghion et al. (2017) study the entire nonfarm business sector, but only at the establishment
level rather than at the detailed product level.

7     Appendix

7.1    Summary of the Computations

We calculate inflation in the Adobe Analytics e-commerce data dataset to
facilitate comparison to the CPI in the same categories.           Our procedure
consisted broadly in the following steps:


    1. We first matched as many of Adobe’s categories as possible with categories
      used by the CPI. After this step, we continued working only with matched
      data and used CPI category names, which are formally called Entry-Level
      items (ELIs).

    2. Since the CPI is computed on a monthly basis, we aggregated the daily
      Adobe data on revenue and quantities by month for each product. We
      computed the average price for product i in category (ELI) j by:

                                              30
                                              X
                                                   Ri,j
                                   pi,j,t =   30
                                              X
                                                   qi,j

      where from now on t refers to the month.

    3. For our baseline we do not trim the data at all. As a robustness check,
      we gauge the effect of trimming on the price level. As shown in Table A1,
      trimming on the price level has little effect on Adobe inflation rates.

    4. Next, to compute the price index for every ELI at a given month, we first
      find the products which were sold both in the last and present month
      (adjacent products).

    5. Again, our baseline does not trim at all. But Table A1 shows robustness to
      trimming on extreme price changes within ELI’s.
16                                        GOOLSBEE AND KLENOW



     6. For each ELI we then compute the price index for ELI j for a given month
           by using a geometric average of “price relatives”:

                                                        Y  pi,j,t wi,j,t
                                               Πj,t   =
                                                        i∈j
                                                            pi,j,t−1

                            vi,j,t−1 +vi,j,t                   p      q
           where wi,j,t =                      and vi,j,t =   P i,j,t i,j,t .
                                   2                            i pi,j,t qi,j,t


     7. We then aggregate the ELI indices using monthly cPI relative importance
           weights to arrive at our Digital Price Index (DPI):

                                                          X
                                                 Πt =             Wj,t−1 Πj,t
                                                              j


           where the Wj,t−1 are the CPI weights for each ELI-month.9

     8. We follow the BLS and do something special for apparel. Apparel prices
           exhibit a sawtooth pattern over seasonal and fashion cycles. We compute
           the average unit price for every clothing ELI, rather than create a matched-
           model index which would exhibit sharp deflation.

7.2     Matching Categories

We were able to match 63 CPI ELIs and 2 CPI Strata to Adobe categories and
aggregates of them. We will refer to these as 65 ELI’s for short. Table A2 provides
average annual inflation rates and other sample information for the DPI vs. CPI
at the ELI level.
     We can also aggregate up to the 8 CPI Major Groups, since the 65 ELI’s have
some coverage in all of them. Figures A1 through A8 plot the cumulative
inflation rates for the DPI vs. the CPI at the Major Group level.
     Figure A9 shows that revenue weighting in the DPI does not affect
cumulative inflation relative to weighting each product within ELIs equally as
in the CPI. Figure A10 shows that inflation would be even lower if one used
Paasche or Fisher instead of Laspeyres, as we have done to facilitate
comparison with the CPI.
