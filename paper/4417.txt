    This paper reviews recent theory and evidence on trade and industrial policy reform in

developing counn-ies. First, the theoretical and empirical basis of the rationales for policy reform

are discussed. Next, two sources of heterodoxy are identified and evaluated: (a) the East Asian

experience with interventionist indosrrial policies; (b) recent models of imperfect competition.

The survey then turns on strategic issoes in reform, and discusses the theory of piecemeal reform,

tax or tariff uniformity, credibility, political economy, and interactions with stabilization policy.

The penultimate section reviews the available evidence on the consequences of recent policy
                                                                                    -

            TRADE AND INDUSTRIAL POLICY REFORM IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES:

                           A REVIEW OF RECENT THEORY AND EVIDENCE


I. Inlmduction
   A decade or two from now, the 1980s will probably be remembered as the time when two

significant, and not unrelated, set of events ocurred. First, much of the developing world, including a

majority of countries in Latin America and Africa, became engulfed in a debt and macroeconomic cnsis

of major proportions. Per capita income scarcely grew, and, in many countries, declined over the

course of the decade. it became commonplace to call this the lost decade" for development.

    But maybe not all was lost. For the second major feature of the decade was that in scores of

countries, the inward-oriented, import-substituting policies of the past came under cn!ical scrutiny from

policy makers—often from the same government leaders who had enthusiastically espoused and

implemented the older poricies. By the end of the decade, the anti-eeporl and anti-private enterprise

bias of the prevailing policy regimes was largely discredited. Public enterprise, industrial promotion. and

trade protection were out; privatization, industrial de-regulation, and free trade were in.

    This paper is an attempt to review what we know about the consequences of theae policy reforms.

I try to cover in equal measure both theory and evidence, as it is only the interplay of the Iwo that

allows us to comprehend and interpret the world around us. Just as theory without facts is vacuous, a

search for evidence in the absence of a sound conceptual framework yields unintelligible resutts.

Research on policy reform has not been short on either theory or evidence, even though, as we shall

aee, there is stilt a need for systematic empirical studies on the consequences of the recent round of

reforms. My focus is strictly on trade and industrial policies; macroeconomic stabilization issues are

touched upon only to the extent that they impinge on microeconomic reforms. Further, I will emphasize

the more recent literature.

    Since the World Bank has been intimately involved in the policy reforms of the igitos thrcugb Its

Structural Adjustment Loans, I begin the survey by considering the role of the World Bank and the

concept of "structural adjustment". In the following section (section 3), I briefly discuss the nature of the
  policies to be reformed. Section 4 is devoted to the rationale for trade end industrial policy reform. I

  identify four basic arguments; fi) improvements in static resource allocation; (ii) dynamic benefits in the

  form of learning end growth; (it) improved flexibility in face of esternal shocks; end (iv) reduced rent-

  seeking. I discuss critically the theory end evidence that underlie each one o! these arguments.

     Sections 5 and 6 turn to two sources of "heterodoxy". First, I discuss recent revisionist accounts of

 the East Asian experience lsection 5). These accounts have stressed the positive role cf government

 intervention in trade and tndustry, and sit uncomfortably with the orthodox emphasis on restricting the

 government's role. Section 6 covers recent modela with imperfect competition. These models!

 developed in part in response to the challenge posed by East Asia to received theory, provide increased

 latitude for government intervention on account ot both static and dynamic effects. Section 7 is

 devoted to the literature on the strategy of reform and covers recent contributions including those in the

 theories of piecemeal reform, timing end sequencing of reform credibitty, and political economy.

 Section 8 reviews the available evidence on the consequences of the reforms of the
                                                                                          1980s, paying
 particular attention to the supply response, and to static and dynamic efficiency. In section 9, I offer

 some briar concluding remarks.

2. Policy reform, afructunt adjuafrnent and the Woald Bank

    tJonng the 1980s, the term atructural adjuatment" became virtually another name for policy reform.

Almost all major episodes of policy reform during [his period in the developing world were instigated

and/or supported by Structural Adjuatment Loans (SALa) from the World Bank. The reforms usually

took place in the context of Intense policy dialogues with the World Bank—as well as with the

International Monetary Fund, which began to disburse medium-term assistance under its own Extended,

Structural Adjustment, and Enhanced Structural Adjustment facilities. The policy dialogue with the

Bretfon Woods inatitutiona, along with the conditionality that goes with the latler'a lending, helps account

for the remarkable uniformity that has characterized the reformiata' agenda. Wherever reforms were

attempted, the words "atructural adjuatmenr became the code used to describe and legitimize them,

and liberalization and outward orientation the main strategies employed. Williamson (1990) has termed
                                                        3

this agenda the Washington consensus"' Perhaps the only important exception was Chins; where

policy developments were insulated from World Bank and IMF conditionality. But even here, the

ongoing reforms since 1978 have unmistakably moved the economy in the direction of greater use of

the market mechanism and private incentives, and of greater export orientation.

   The role ptayed by the World Bank in the reforms of the 1 980a has been chronicled and analyzed in

a number of different sources, notably by World Bank staff themaalves. Thomas 8L8L (4991) and

Corbo, Fischer, and Webb (1992) present useful compilations of Bank studies, focusing on the

effectiveness of adjustment lending. A comparable independent study including case studies is that by

Mosley, l-larrtgan, and bye (1991).

   According to Ernest Stern, a vice president of the World Bank who was closely invotved in the

development of SAL5, interest in such lending arose from the frustration felt in the Bank in the aftermath

of the second oil shook regarding the lack of real invotvement in country policies, despite substantial

commitment of resources in the form of project assistance:

        Initially our thinking focused on the ways to help countries develop greater export capacity,

        When we started, however, we were quits naive about just how pro foundly distorted the

        development strategies of many of the developing countries were.... (These countries] must

        begin to move from highty distorted price incentives and investment frameworks to something

        more stable, more oriented to the market system of prices, and more open and less protected.

        (E. Stern, 1991, 1-2)

Hence, even though the origin of SALs lay in the esternal payments crisis brought on by the two rounds

of oil shocks in the 1 970s, the Bank's attention soon turned to correcting microeconornic distortions.

Indeed, it became common to view the subsequent debt crisis of 1982 as "one of the symptoms of

these distortions," as Stern htmselt put it (1991 2).


        However, he later came to regret the implication that the
choices made by reformists all over the developing world were in
fnct derived from a consensua reached in Washington, D.c.
 (Williamson, 1992)
                                                         4

      The goals set forth for SALs, therefore, covered both macroeconomic stabilization and

  microec000mic reforms. As Thomas etal, put It:

          Two types of poticy response, both labeled adjustment, were called for [to deal with the

          external shocks of the later 1970a and the earty lQBQs]. The first was stabilization, or managed

          reductions in expenditures to bring about an orderly adjustment of domestic demand to the

          reduced level of external resources available to the country, The second was structural

          adjustment, or changes in relative prices and institutions designed to make the economy more

          efficient, more flexible, and better able to use resources and so to engineer sustainable long-

         term growth. It was envisioned that effective structural adjustment measures would reduce the

         necessary extent of stabilization. (1991, 11)

 Contrast this definition of structural adjustment with the following one by Streeton'

         The essence of deveropment is structural adjustment: from country to town, from agriculture to

         industry, tram production for household consumption to production for markets, from largely

         domestic trade to a higher ratio of foreign trade.,.. In this very general sense, development is

         synonymous with structural adjustment and a paper on structural adjustment would he a paper

         on developmeni (1989, 3)

While one cannot help but agree with Streeten, I witi use the term structural adjustment in the narrower

sense used by Thomas &Lfij.2 In particular, I will focus on structural adjustment pp(jçies, i.e., policies

aimed at improving an economy's efficiency and its tong-term growth. Macroeconomic stabilizaton

policies, aimed at price stability end overall balance between an economy's resources and its

expenditures, are covered in the companion chapter by Corbo and Fischer. However, as wilt become


      An even narrower definition is given by Edwards and van Wijnbergen (1989, p. 1482): "A structural
adjustment program can be detined as a set of policy measures that attempts to permanently change
relative prices of fl8fible to nontradabte goods in the economy, in order to reallocate, or help along
reallocation of, production factors in accordance with the new set of external and domestic economic
conditions" (emphasis added). By focussing only on one key relative price, and the one that is most directly
influenced by the exchange rate at that, this definition presents a somewhat incomplete picture or the
microeconomic changes typically called for in the Bank's structural adjustment programs
                                                      5

clear, it is not always easy to draw clear distinctions between slsbilizalion end structural measures.



3 What is to be reformed?

    An exhaustive list of the policies that came under atteck by the reformers would till volumes, as

does indeed any official catalogue describing the industrial incentive regime in a typical import-

substituting country. In trade policy, Ihe reforms were directed at licensing and other quantitative

restrictions, high and extremely dilterentiated tariff rates, export taxes, end burdensome bureaucratic

requirements end paperwork. In industrial policy, the targets were inetflcent end loss-making public

enterprises, entry and exit restrictions on private enterprise, price controls, discretionary tax and subsidy

policies, and soft-budget constraints.

    The best quantitative picture of the state of trade protection in developing countries is provided in

Erzan etal. (1989), These authors provide a snapshot of tariff and non-tariff barriers in some 50

developing countries as of the mid-1980s. They list sectoral average tariff rates, as well as coverage

ratios for non-tariff measures such as licenses, quotas and advanced import deposits. See also

Kostecki end TymowskL (1985) for a review of import chsrges (other than customs duties) and a

calculation of their ad-valorem equivalents in a smaller group of developing countries. Prevaiing

industrial potcies are discussed, more qualitatively, in Dervis and Page (1984) Frischtak (1989), and

Meier and Steel (1989). De Soto (1969) provides an influential account of the burdens imposed on

private-sector actvity by bureaucratic regulations and paperwork in Latin America, particularly where

small business is concerned.

    Policy discussions on trade policy were much influenced by the early work directed by Little.

Scitovaky, and Scott (1970) Balessa (1971), and Bhagweti (1978) and Krueger (1978). These studies

undertook quantitative descriptions and evaluations of trade regimes, notably by messunng effective

rates of protection in developing countries. They demonstrated that the existing policies had resulted in

haphazard and often inordinstety high levels of protection: hard to reconcile with policyrrokers stated

objectives.
                                                        6

     More recently, Krueger, Schtff and Valdes (1991) have completed a multi-volume study on

 agricultural pricing policy that promises to do for agriculture what this earlier work has done for trade

 policy in industry. These authors quantify the effects of policy interventions on agriculture, taking into

 account both direct effects (i.e, sector-speciflc interventions) and indirect effects (i.e., those arising from

 trade restrictions on manufactures and induced changes in the equilibrium exchange rate). They

 document the existence of a large disincentive for agricultural production, with the explicit and implicit

 taxation of agriculture ranging from 25 percent in the case of Asian and Mediterranean countries to

 more than 50 percent in sub-Saharan African countries. lnteresttngty, Krueger et.al find that meat of

 this tax originates not from direct interventions, but from the general-equilibrium implications of industrial

 protection and overvalued exchange rates (for a summary of their findings, see Krueger, Schiff, and

Valdes, 1986). In a sense, then what these authors have documented is the flip aide of the earlier

industrial protection studies referred to above.



4. Why reform? The rationales for policy refonn

    By the late 1970s, the studies mentioned above on trade and industrialization policies had gradualty

erected a formidable case for policy reform in developing countries. The indisputable success of South

Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong with what appeared to be market-oriented potcies

strengthened the argument (see below, however). Perhaps the clincher was that the external-payments

crisis originating from the debt debacle made policy change unavoidable. However, it was by no means

clear that change would take the form of liberalization; the first impulse of policy makers confronting a

balance-of-payments crisis a typicalfy to tighten quotas and impose foreign exchange rationing. That

the 1980s eventually turned out differently was partly due to the fact that policy makers esrned from

their pasi mistakes, But there were other reasons as well; ('r) World Bank and IMP conditionality ruled

out access to external financing in the absence of at least some lip—service to reform; (ii) the depth and

persistence of the macroeconomic crisis relegated to second-place distributional considerations that

would have blocked rnicroeconomic reforms in more normal times (Rodrik, l992a).
                                                      7


    There are four basic arguments in favor of market-oriented policy reform: (i) economic liberahzation

reduces static inefficiencies arising from resource misaflocation and waste; (ii) economic liberalization

enhances learning, technological change, and economic growth; (iii) outward-oriented economies are

beftter able to cope with sdverse external shocks; (iv) market-based economic syslems are less prone

to wasteFul rent-seeking activities, While all four of these arguments are used widely, it is the last three

that have dominated the discussion on structural adjustment policies. This is understandable since the

benefits on account of the first, basically some Harberger triangles, are quantitatively minor compared to

the benefits arising from the others, which usually are sizable rectangles. However, by and large, only

the first oF these arguments is solidly grounded in accepted economic theory.

4.1. Static effects: Resource mis-allocation

    The efficiency costs of Import-substitution policies, encompassing most notably high levels ot trade

protection snd industrial regulation, were documented extensively in the studies cited above (Little

Scitovsky, and Scott 1970, Balassa, 1971, Bhagwali, 1978, and Krueger, 1978). These potcies had

encoursged the development of industries that were high-cost, and did little to ensure that productivity

would increase over time. The resutiag pattern of specialization became divorced from comparative

advantage. From the perspective of resource allocation, the effects were anti-esport anti-agriculture.

anti-labor, and anti-newcomers in industry.

    The literature on these issues is broad, and it is impossibie to provide a complete list of references.

On the employment consequences of trade regimes, see in particular Krueger (1983). The dismal

export performance of sub-Ssharafl African countries is reviewed by Svedberg (1991), who traces its

roots largely to domestic economic policies. The consequences of industrial regulations are discussed

in Frischtak (1989), and Meier and Steel (1989). Two recent sources on India's infamous industrial

regime are Fursell (1990) and Bhagwati (1993). For additional references on the earlier literature, see



       My Four-fold classification is not meant to be entirely exhaustive. An additional rationale for trade and
 industrial policy reform is improved capacity utilization in the face of bottlenecks and macroeconomic policy
 faitures. However, as the quafflers in the previous sentence indicate, I do not consider this to be as "basic"
 an argument as Ihe others I have included.
   the surveys by Pack (1988) and Eruton (1989).

       While the theoretical and emp1ricel arguments for the resource misallocation costs of the import-

  substitution syndrome are strong, it is much harder to make a compelling case regarding the
                                                                                                        gt4de
  of these costs. Reasonable estimates of the welfare cost of relative-price distortions under usual

  neoclassical assumptions rarely produce numbers in excess of a couple of percentage points of GNP

  (see, for example, Srinivasan and Whalley, t986). Moreover, when distortions get too large, the

  emergence of parallel and black markets tend to arleviate Ihe welfare coats (aee Roemer and Jones,

  1991). How, then, can such small numbers be reconciled with the large and growing
                                                                                            performance gap
  between import-substituing countries and the outward-oriented countries of East Asia? To provide an

  answer, it is common to turn to explanations that go beyond static allocative-efficiency.

  4.2. Dynamic affects: Technical change1 learning, and growth

     Import-substituting industrialization policy was supposed to enhance technological capabilities and

 economic growth. That it failed to do so, while outward-oriented East Asian countries
                                                                                            continued to grow
 at phenomenal rates, suggested to many economists not only that the infant-industry position was

 untenable, but that it had it exactly backwards. The anti-export and anti-competition bias
                                                                                                of prevailing
 pnltcies, the argument now went, discouraged innovation, cost-cutting, the acquisition of technological

 capabilities, end therefore eventual growth. Correcting these biases would remove the
                                                                                             technological
 disincentives. A representative statement is from Balaesa (1988, 45)

         It has often been observed that Imonopolies and oligopolies
                                                                         prefer a 'quiet life" to innovative

         activity, which entails risk and uncertainty. In turn, the carrot and stick of competition gives

         inducement for technological change. For one thing, in creating competition for donestio

         products in home markets, imports provide incentives for firms to improve their operations. For

        another thing, in response to competition in foreign markets, exporting trms
                                                                                         try to keep up with
        modern technology In order to maintain or improve their market position.

This view became conventional wisdom as a retrospective explanation of the East Asian success, as

well as a prospective argument tor removal of distortions in other developing countries.
                                                      9

    The analytical foundations of such arguments regarding the dynamic benefits of liberalization have

never been too cloar. Too often, the preferred method of proof is a casual appeal to common sense.

tn particular, no distinctions are typically made between policies for which received theory is silent as

regards learning (or hss ambiguous implications), and those for which a definite theoretical presumption

exists.

    Relative-price distoftions, such as trade taxes and investment subsidies, are of the first kind. Such

distortions affect iv profitabif ties across industries and sectors, tf some sectors are adversely

affected by intervention, others must be left in better shape. Consequently, even if changes in a

sectors profitability could be presumed to have unambiguous consequencas for innovative actrvity

(which they do not), the çj change in economy-wide innovation would still be unpredictable. Innovative

activity would be reduced in some sector, but enhanced in others.

          This argument spptes equally well to X-efflciency: if tariffs encourage entrepreneurial slack in

import-competing sectors because they increase such sectors' relative prices, by the same logic they

must reduce slack in export-oriented sectors (Rodrik, I 992b). Moreover, Balassa's statement above

notwithstanding, the LpüQ_ri relationship between the degree of product-market competition and

innovative activity is by no means clear; for the state of the debate In the advanced-country context, see

Nalebuff and Stiglitz (1983), Hart (1983), and Scharfstein(t 988). Neither is it clear whether the

inadequacy of incentives to upgrade quality due to informational externalities call for policy intervention

(as in Bagwell and Staiger. 1989) or are aggravated by it (as in Grossman and Horn, 1988).

          To rescue the conventional wisdom, one needs to resort in each case to liner arguments and

special assumptions that are rarely made clear. An early esception is Corden (1974, 224-31). who

dissected many of the arguments linking trade policy to cost-cutting incentives and showed their

fragility. Developments in the theories of industrial organization and growth have now made learning

and technical change more amenable to analysis, and some recent contributions will be reviewed in

section &3.

    In the second group are trade and industrial policies that have unambiguously deleterious
                                                      10
 consequences for learning and technological capability. Some prominent examples are as follows

 Domestic price controls on Industrial commodities like steel discourage innovation and quality upgrading

 because they lead to excess demand: in the presence of excess demand, firms have no need to

 increase demand for their product by improving it (see Perez and Peniche, 1987, for the case of

 Mexican steel4). Soft-bud9et constraint policies similarly discourage innovation in a number of ways:

 when profits are taxed on the basis of ex post profitability, the benefits of any innovation are shared

 with the government when the government stands ready to bait out a loss-making enterprise it

 discourages the adoption of technologies that may otherwise render the firm viable (Atiyas, Dutz, and

 rrischtak, 1992, 16-17). Entry and exit restrictions, through capacity licensing or prohibition of layofl,

 prevent more efficient newcomers from replacing less efficient ones. More directly pernicious are

 restrictions on imports of technology and capital goods, and local-purchase requirements forcing firms to

 use inferior inputs end equipment (as is common in many countries that prohibit imports when domestic

substitutes exist). See Lall (1987) for relevant evidence from India.

    There is a wide array of empirical evidence that has been brought to bear on these issues and to

test, in particular, the hypothesized cause-end-effect relationship between protection and poor

technological performance. 1-lowever, since the conceptual issues are rarely sorted nut as a prelude to

empirical analysis, the results of these esercises are difficult to interpret. There are three types of

empirical evidence that deserve menlion: ci) firm-level case sludies; (ii) crosa-industry studies nI

technical efficiency and productivity change, and (Hi) cross-country studies of economic growth. I will

briefly discuss each in turn.

4.Zi. Firm-level case sludies of technological change

Several in-depth case studies of technological change and learning have been carried out at the firm

level and the results are described in a number of sources, including Katz (1987), Lalt (1987), and Pack



      The authors quote the owner of the company they studied as saying that if the sun were not visible
through the steel sheets, they could be sold.
                                                     11

(1987). See Levy (1991) for case studies of learning related to export markets among Taiwanese and

Korean footwear producers. Pack (1992) provides an overview and survey of the firm-level literature on

technical change. These studies show that there is a considerable amount of tech nological tinkering

that goes on even when firms are cut off from foreign markets. They do not, however, lead to any easy

generalizations regarding the exlent to which trade regimes affect the pace of learning. In fact, it is easy

to read the case evidence in very different ways: Katz (1987) concludes from his and his collaborators'

studiee that reducing costs has not been a high-priority for Latin American firms because of high levels

of trade protection and little internal competition; the author of one of those stuthes, however, provides

evidence that it was firms which could rely on steady growth in captive domestic markets that undertook

the highest levels of technical effort (Pearson, 1987, p, 421).

4.2.2. Crosa-industiy studies of technical efficiency and productivity change

There exist a number of studies that correlate aspects of policy regimes with measured changes in total

factor productivity (TFP)et the industry level. Among the most notable of these are Krueger and

Tuncer (1982a), Ntshimizu and Robinson (1984), Nishimizu and Page (1991).

    Krueger and Tuncer (1982a) find that, on average, periods of slower TFP growth in Turkish industry

coincided with period in which the trade regime was more restrictive. Drawing on data from Korea,

Turkey, Japan, and Yugoslavia, Nishimizu and Robinson (1984) relate the increase in sectoral TFP to

sources of demand growth, including export expansion and import substitution. They find a

preponderance of oases where export expansion is positively associated, and import substitution

negatively associated, with TFP growth. They caution specifically, however, that no causality can be

attributed to these results, Nishimizu and Page (1991) analyze a panel of industries from several

countries and regress TFP growth on country characteristics. They find that export growth is positively

correlated with TFP growth, but only in economies that follow market-oriented policies". However, they

also find that import penetration was negatively corretated with TFP performance in the same

economies in the post-1973 period. Naturally, the same comment about causatty applies to this study

as well.
                                                       12

     There have not been meny studies thet have attempted to test the infant-industry hypothesis

 directly. A well-known peper by Krueger and Tuncer (1 982b) corriperes sectorat TFP growth ratea in

 croas-section of Turkish industries, and reporta that there was no systematic tendency for more

 protected industries to have had higher TFP growth than less protected industries,5 Strictly speaking,

 the authors' method doea not conatitute an appropriate test of the Intant-induatry argument. Such a test

 would require e counterfactuat regarding the TFP path that the protected industries would have followed

 in the absence of protection; the implicit assumption that the less protected industries provide the

 appropriate counterfactust ie not compelting. Along similar lines, Dollar and Sokoloff (1990) analyze

 TFP growth in South Korean manufacturing industries (over the period 1963-79), and find productivity

 increase to play a smaller role in the growth of heavy industries than in the growth of light and medium

 industries. They speculate that the reason may have to do with the prevalence of credit subsidies for

 heavy industries, which would have encouraged capitat deepening. On the other hand, Waverman and

 Murphy's (1992) study of TFP growth in the automobile sectors of four countries—Argentina, Mesico,

 Korea, and Canada—provides a more mixed picture. Judged by the yardstick of TFP growth] the

second most successful country during the 1970s was Argentina (after Korea), the most closed of the

four econonlies. Waverman and Murphy find TFP growth to have been high in Argentina both during its

trade-liberalization period (1978-81) and earlier. Other, more informal evidence on infant industries are

sun,eyed in Bell, Ross-Larson, and Westphat (1984), who suggest that the evidence is rather damaging



      Actually, a closer look at their data leads to a conclusion more favorable to protection. Krueger and
Tuncer report data on three measures of protection end two measures of productivity growth. The only
correlations that are statistically significant at a 10 percent confidence level between these types of
indicators are two positive correlations between a measure of protection and a measure of productivity
growth. Moreover, one of these is statistically significant at the 1 percent level. I am grateful to Ann
Harrison for this information.

       Krueger and Tuncer claim (1982b): "... in order for infant industry considerations to have warranted
intervention in favor of industry i, costs per unit of output must have fallen more in i than in k (1145). This
is not quite right. One can imagine a situation where dynamic leaming externalities in industry i call for
intervention, but once these externalities are appropriately internalized vie policy, productivity still grows
slower than in other industries.

to the case for infant-industry protection.

    The above studies can be criticized for not being able to control for induatry or country effects that

exert an independent Influence on productivity. An Interesting study that avoids some of these

problems is Chen and Tang (1987) on Taiwan's electronics industry. These authors compare the level

of technical efficiency (as measured by distance from an estimated productton frontier) in two groups of

firms, one (hat comprises firms that are constrained to export all their output, and one that includes

firms that are allowed to service the protected domestic market, They find that the former group

exhibits a higher level of technical efficiency than the latter. However, the interpretation of this rssut is

open to question also. in parttcutar, there is reason to suspect that the two samples of firms would be

subject to selection bias: since firms know which policy regime thay are going to be operating under, it

would seem obvious that only firms (hat had reasonably high estimates of their efficiency would submit

themselves to the exports-only regime.

    A recent paper by J.-W. Lee (1992) is significant because it focuses on the productivity

consequences of Korea's industrial policy, which has been the subject of great debate (see sectirm 5).

Lee constructs sectoral estimates of tariff and non-tariff barriers, tax incentives, and credit subsidies.

His econometric analysis covers a panel of 38 Korean msnufscturing sectors over four 5-year periods

(during 1963-83). He finds sectoral TFF growth rates to be negstivs)y and statistically significantly

correlated with non-tariff barriers, but positively and significantly correlated with tax incentives these

findings are interesting as well ss puzzling. it is difficult to reconcile the two sets of results

theoretically, suggesting perhaps thaI differences in the implementation of these interventions may have

had something to do with the findings.

    Other empirical studies of how contacts with the outside world influence domestic technological

performance include Katrak (1989), Aitken and Harrison (1992), and Prasnikar, Svejnsr, and Klinedinst

(1992). Katrsk finds a positive reislionship between the amount of imported technology and domestic

in-house R&D in Indian enterprises. Aitken and Harrison look for evidence of spillovsrs at the plant

level from foreign subsidfsries to local firms in a panel drawn from Venezuela. They find no indication
                                                     14

that foreign presence helps domestically-owned plants' productivity. Prasnikar           is a plant-level

econometric study of the determinants of technical efficiency in the former Yugoslavia. This study finds

no evidence that export orientation or the presence of joint ventures with foreigners had benetcial

effecta on technical efficiency. See the chapter by Evenson and Weatphal in this volume for a more

complete discussion of the related literature.

        Finally, a recent group of papers has been devoted specifically to the experiences of countries

undergoing structural adjustment programs, and has paid close attention to econometric and conceptual

issues. These papers will be discussed when we turn to the results of recent policy reforms.

4.2.3. Cross-country studies or economic growth

A large number of crosa-crountry studies have looked at the relationship between eccnornc growth and

aome measure of trade policy and/or price distortions, using various controls on the right-hand aide of

the regression. These studies generally conclude that openness has been conducive to higher growth.

   The immediate problem in such regressions is corning up with an appropriate indicator of trade

parley that would rank countries consistently among each other trom least open to most open. Many

candidate indicators exist, including trade shares, tariff and non-tariff measures, and residuals from

factor-endowments models of trade patterns. Pritchett (1991) reviews and discusses some of the

better-known measures.7 His disturbing conclusion is that there is virtually no statistically significant

positive correlation among them. Secondly, there is the usual problem of attributing causality: if

governments routinely tighten restrictions when economic performance becomes wcrse statistical

analysis will pick up a spurious relationship between distortions and growth. This may happen even in

the absence of conscious government policy. Under a fixed exchange rate, for example, the black-

market premium will endogenously increase in response to a foreign-exchange crisis, If such crises are



     Pritchett limits his sttsntion to objective' measures of outward orientation, these include: the share
of trade in GDP, adjusted for country characteristics and factor endowments; the average tariff and
coverage ratio of non-tariff barriers; measures of deviation of actual trade patterns from the pattern
predicted from a model of resource based comparative advantage; measures of real price distortions.
                                                       15

 associated with lower growth, the analyst will uncover a negative relationship between the black-market

 premium (the trade distortion variable) and economic growth.

     Hence, most of the indicators that have been used can be criticized on conceptual or empirical

 grounds. Balassa (1978), Feder (1983), Michaety (1977), Syrquin and Chenery (1989), and Easterly

 (1992) use exports (either their growth rate or their share in income) as the Indicator of openness. This

raises problems of endogeneity and reverse causality (Jung and Marshall, 1955, Esfahani, 1991). Alan

(1987) and Easterly (1992) use the trade orientation index presented in World Bank (1987), which haa

been criticized as being misleading and biased (Taylor 1991, p. 107). Edwards (1992) uses a measure

of openness computed by Leamer (1988), which attributes all of the residual from a cross-country

factor-endowments model to government intervention and has serious shortcomings in the way it ranks

certain countries.6 De Long and Summers (1991) use a range of measures, among which a dummy !or

high levels of efective rates protection (s 40%) and the World Bank (1987) trade orientation index are

found to exert an independent negative effect on growth. Barro (1991) and Dolfar (1992) use some

measure of the deviation in the local price level from purchasing power parity (n the case of Barro, only

with respect to investment goods), derived from Hexton and Summers (1988)!

    The last method deserves separate comment, as it appears at first sight to yield an intuitive and

objective measure of openness and price distortions, and has received considerable attention. What

Dollar (1992) does specifically is to take a len-year average for each country of the deviation in its price

level from that of the U.S. The systematic component of cross-country differences in non-tradablex




     6 For example, one of Leamer's measures (the scaled regression-based openness measure) ranks
 countries like Morocco, Indonesia and Ivory Coast ax more open than countries like Canada and the U.S.
White Edwards (1992) limits his sample to developing countries, such anomalies reflect the inadequacy of
the basic method. Leamer himself remains doubtful about his results: Aa I examine these results, I am
left with a feeling of skepticism regarding the usefulness of the adjusted trade inlenxity ratios as indicators
of trade barriers. I see taxIes (Japan's coffee), omitted resources (Iceland's fish), and historical accidents
(switzerland'x watches), I am not sure that I see trade barriers (1958, pp. 19899),

      This is by no means a complete list of such studies, For additional references, see for exareple
Esfahani (1991) and Helleiner (1990).
                                                     16

prices is purged, to the extent pnssibte, by regressing price levels en national income. Dollar claims

that Th country maintaining a high price level over many years woctd clearly have to be a country with a

relatively large amount of protection (inward orientation)' (525-26). However, it is not uncommon for

countries to maintain overvalued eschange rates (as measured by PPP) for a prolonged period of time,

even in the absence of trade restrictions--think of Chile in 1979-82 and the U.S. in 1981-85, for

example. Moreover, the converse of the statement is certainly not true: a large amount of protection

need not imply a high price level for tradables as a group. Trada protection raises the prices of import

competing goods relative to exportables; it has no definite implication for the aggregate price index for

tradables, A country can slap on extremely high levels of import barriers, and yet have its price index

for tradabtes scarcely move against the U.S. level (or indeed have it actually fall below the U.S. level).

In practice, what will bring this re-equiibration about is a compensating appreciation of the national

currency which will reduce the dollar pricea of local exporleblea while ii dampens the increase in the

dollar price of imporlablea.

   Judged from this perspective, some of the anomalies in Dollar'e rankings can be better understood.

For example, India and Indonesia are listed among the second least distorted group ol countries (there

are four groups in all), which should come as a surprise to anyone with some knowledge of these

countries' trade regimes daring 1976-85. What explains this, in al likelihood, is that these two countries

managed their exchange rates and macroeconomic policies rather well over the period in question,

avoiding sustained ovarvaluations of their currencies. It is even more surprising to find Chile listed

among the more closed economies, even though this economy was certainly one of the least protected

ones in the world during much of this period. Since Chile also experienced a pronounced exchange

rate overvatatlon during part of this period, this result is however understandable in light of the

methodology. In short, purchasing-power-parity-based indicators of price distortions are likely to capture

the exchange-rate (and therefore macroeconomic) stance of countries, and miss out on micro price


    IQ In his growth regressions, this price level index is actually combined with an index of real exchange
rate variability to produce what Dollar cafls an outward orientation index. The inclusion of the variability
index is itself problematic in this context.
                                                      11
distortions when exchenge rates ere managed well.

    An additional problem with growth regressions of the type discussed here is that they Lend to be

very sensitive to the precise configuration of explanatory variables included in the regression. Levine

end Renelt (1992) have shown that very Few explanatory variables are 'robusr to the inclusion of

additional variables on the right-hand side ot cross-country growth regressions. The share of

investment in GDP tends to be robust in this sense. Trade and price-distortion indicators sre not. But

they also report that the ratio of trade to GDP does appear to have a robust correlation with the

investment share. Partly In response to this criticism, Harrison (1991) has analyzed a large set of trade

end price distortions, and included them individually in a panel regression with country fised-effects and

additional controls of the type Levine and Renelt have used. Within this fixed-effect framework, she

recovers a systematically negative and statistically significant correlation between trade distortions and

growth.

4.2.4. Summary on empirical studies on dynamic costs at price distortions

A number of problems have plagued the empirical studies surveyed here. We summarize the more

important here: (I) the trade-regime indicator used is typically measured very badly, and is often an

andogenous variable itself (ii) the direction of causality is not awiays clear, even when a policy variable

is used as the trade indicator: govemments may choose to relax Lrade restrictions when economic

performance Is good: (iii) openness in the sense of lack of trade restrictions is often confused with

macroeconomic aspects of the policy regime, notably the exchange-rate stance:11 (iv) the causal

mechanisms that link openness to beneficial dynamic effects are rarely laid out carefutty and subjected

to test themselves; this makes it very difficult for poicy conclusions to be drawn.

    Measurement and conceptual issues aside, it is perhaps reassuring that so many studies using so

many different indicators tend to confirm that countries with fewer price distortions, particularly on the


    ' When foreign currency is rationed, an overvslued exchange rate ix equivalent to an import tariff.
However, in all other cases the consequences of exchange-rate overvaluation (or undervaluation) differ frcm
those of trade barriers. This distinction is rarely drawn in the studies discussed above.
                                                     18

trade side tend to grow faster. Even if we are not convinced by any single study, should we not be

swayed by all of them taken together? Perhaps so. But the virtual impossibility of accurate cross-

country measurement of distortions, as wett as the prevalence of distortions in Taiwan and Korea in the

1960s and 1970s (see below), should make us cautious with regard to the presumption of improved

performance in any specific country contemplating liberatzation.1

4.3. Response to external shocks

    The case for policy reform was much strengthened by the argument, originating most forcefully in

Bela Bslassa's work, that export-oriented countries are better positioned to deal with negative external

shocks than inward-oriented countries. The argument was advanced by analyzing the comparative

experience of countries during the second half of the 1970s. Focussing on the period following the first

oil shock (1974-18), Batassa (I 961a) first calculated the foreign-exchange impact of terms-of-trade and

export demand shncks for several countries. Then, he decomposed the aggregate shock into four types

of what he called potcy responses; (1) additional net external nencing; (ii) increase in export market

share; Qti) import substitution; end (iv) import effects of lower ChIP growth. He argued that export-

promoting countries, unlike inward-oriented countries, were able to increase their world market shares,

which in turn favorably affected their economic growth. Balassa (1981b) later confirmed these findings

with a larger sample of developing countries.13

    Focussing on the early 1980a, Sacha'a (1985) comparative analysis of East Asian and Latin

American experiences reinforced Balasse's conclusion. Sacha argued that the primary reason most

East Asian countries were successful in avoiding protracted debt crises was the higher share ot exports



    12Alao, the weight of published evidence should be tempered by a selection bias at work. Such is the
appeal of conventional wisdom on this iaetre that it is possible that many atudiea which find an insignificant
or positive relationehip between price distortions end growth do not make it beyond firat-dreft atage.

      See Srinivaaan (1955) for a review of theae and related studies by Mitra (1986). Salassa's
procedures have been criticized by Hughes and Singh (1991) for not taking into account the negative
interest rate shock to Latin American countries and the positive remittance shock to certain Asian countries,
thus making the comparison less favorable to the former.
                                                       19-

 in their GNPs, He also went one step further in linking the Latin American outcome to the political

 pressure originating from powerful urban groups with a stake in inward-orientation.

     At first sight it is paradoxical that more Open economies should perform better in the face of

 negative external shocks. Here it is useful to distinguish between the impact effect of a shock and the

 transition out of it. With regard to the former, it is clear that a given terms of trade shock is more

 harmful to a country with a high export-to--GNP ratio than one with a low ratio. Similarly, a reduction in

 external capital flows affects a country that has actively participated in international capital markets

 more than one that has not. Indeed, the impact effects of external negative shocks were gravest on the

 moat open economies auth as Korea in 1980 and Chile in 1982-83, but were barely fett in a closed

 economy tke india.

     The appropnate way to think of Balassa's and Sacha'a arguments, therefore, is as follows: it ix not

that outward oriented countries are immune to shocks, but that they have an easier time getting out of

crisis. But even here there are conceptual problems. if what one understands by outward orientation is

the absence of microeconomic distortions that bias incentives away from exports, it is difficult to see

how such distortions could be causally related to the balance-of-payments crises that have typically

followed external shocks. None of the case studies in Thomas etal. (1991), for example, makes a

convincing case that microeconomic distortions were at the root of the crisis of tho early 1980s. As a

matter of aimple economics, trade restrictions lower exports and imports, and have no implications for

the balance between the two. The trade balance is determined by macroeconomic policies—expenditure

policies arid exchange-rate potcy in particuiar. The correct response to an adverse balance-of-

payments shock is a combinaton of expenditure-reducing and expenditure-switching (i.e., exchange-

rate) policies. The evidence ix that countries that recovered relatively quickly from their respective

shocks were those that applied this simple recipe (see for example Dailami, 1991, on Korea, and

Moran, 1991, on Chile).14


    14 Weatphars criticism of Dailami's account is noteworthy: "[the chapter] does not develop with s uttcient
clarity the point that Korea'a rapid recovery from the macroeconomic crisis owed far more to stabilization
policies than to concurrent structural adjustment policies" (1991, 406).
                                                    20

   These objections notwithstanding, it is still possible that outward oriented countries have greater

flexibility in responding to shocks, or that their political economy more easily allows (and acommodatea)

a change in macro policies. The informal evidence is consistent with these views, but the studies cited

above—with the exception of Sachs (1965). which explicitly links policy choices to the underlying pottical

economy—have only scratched the surface. Consequently, we lack a good understanding of how and

why certain configurations of economic policy render the economy more resilient to external shocks than

others.

4.4. Institutional effects: Reducing rent seeking

   The final set of arguments in favor of policy reform has to do with governance issues. The

institutional setting under which import-substitution policies have typically operated has given rise to a

wide variety of incentive distortions and resource misatocations that collectively go under the name of

"rent-seeking". Starting with Krueger's (1974) classic article, it has become commonplace to argue that

the resource costs of the prevaitng distortions are multiplied several-fold by the existence of such

actvities. Examples of the waste generated include: employment of lobbyists and other intermediaries

in pursuit of licenses and incentives to be obtained from government officials; generation of excess

capacity when import licenses era allocated in proportion to installed capacity; competition for scarcity

rents in black markets when commodities and foreign exchange are ratoned: smuggling, under-

invoicing, and over-invoicing. See Krueger 0990) for a recent re-statement, Bhagwati (1982) for s

theoretical generalization, Gallagher (1991) for an empirical application to African countries, Tarr (1992)

for an application to autos and TVs in pre-trsnsition Poland. and Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1991) for

an extension in the context of economic growth.

   While the costs of rentseeking may be genuinely immense, it does not fellow that a correction of

price distortions and a move to outward orientation necessarily eliminates them. As long as

governments exist and they implement policy, individuals and groups will exercise poticsl power to

obtain particulsristic benefits for themselves. Por example, Onis (1991) shows how a new type of rent-
                                                     21
seeking took over once Turkish policy moved towards Korean-style outward orientation: rent-seekers

started to run after export subsidies instead of import tcenses.

   it is a plausible hypothesis, nonetheless, that certain types of policies are more conducive to rent-

seeking than others. Compare tariffs and quotas. As Bhagwab and Srinivasan (1980) have noted, tariff

revenue can be sought by rent-seekers just as quote premia are. Yet, it is reasonable to suppose that

the anonymity of revenues that accrue to the general budget somehow shields them from the gaze of

rent-seekers, something that cannot be said for quota licenses that carry hefty premia (Krueger, 1990).

Similarly, a uniform tax system may be more impervious to lobbying than one with a highly differentiated

structure (see Panagariya and Rodrik, 1992, for an analyis). But the lack of overt rent-seeking in East

Asia must be attributed primarily to the hardnesC of the slate in thai setting (see the next section), and

not to outward oriented policies per se.



5. Heterodoxy I: Reinterpreting the East Asian experience

    The East Asian success story--i.e., the stupendous growth rates achieved by Japan, South Korea,

Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong--raises the challenge of how this experience can be emulated in

othet settings. Economists who prescribe openness and price liberalization to developing countnes

typically present a picture of the East Asian experience that differs rather sharply from that presented by

East Asian specialists themselves. A usual caricature is that these countries schieved their miracles by

minimizing price distortions, giving marketa free rein, and emphasizing exports. ln the case of Korea

and Taiwan, in particular, emphasis is placed on reforms during the 1960s that greatly reduced the

restrictiveness of the trade regime, eliminated financial repression, and established a hee-trade regime

for esporters. Analysts who have studied these countries closely describe a much more nuanced

situation, and stress that government intervention has been pervasive (except for in Hong Kong). The

latter credit East Asian governments for making the miracles happen, not by getting out of the way of

private entrepreneurs, but by actively nurturing and protecting infant industries.

    With regard to liberalizing trade restrictions, for example, it is clear that East Asian countries did not
                                                        22
  go nearty as far some Latin American countries have done recently and that whatever was

  accomplished took place a lot more gradually. Here is how Hong (1991) describes the progress of

  liberalization in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan:

          It was not until the I 960s that Japan eliminated the bulk of its formal quantllstive restrictions:

          the nominal import liberalization ratio (by items) expanded from less than 70 percent in 1 960 to

          about 93 percent in 1964, and to 97 percent by 1976. Similarly, Taiwan did not eliminate the

          bulk of Its formal quantitative restrictions until the early 1970s: the nominal import-liberalization

          ratio increased From 61.5 percent in 1970 to 96,5 percent in 1973.... Korea is scheduled to

          eliminate the bulk of its quantitative restrictions during the period 1984-88. (p.
                                                                                               245)
 According to a Korean Development Institute (KDI) study (cited in Hong, 1991), the average effective

 rate of protection in Korea (for domestic sales only) actually rose from 30 percent in 1963 to 38 percent

 in 1978, after a dip to 24 percent in 1970.15 The conlrast with the rapid and no-holds-barred

 liberalization that has taken place in Chile in the second half of the 1970s, and in Bolivia, Mexico and

 Argenlina in the 1980s is staggering.

     With regard to industrial policy, the following evaluation of Tsnzi and Shome (1992) of Taiwan's tax
 incentives is ncteworlhy:

         Taiwanese policymakers believed that they could pursue an investment strategy that would

         second-guess the market and pick winners, As a consequence, Taiwan kept its tax rates much

         higher than Hong Kong but pushed the investors in the desired direction through Ihe
                                                                                                      widespread
         use of tax incentives. These incentives were fine-tuned to a degree rarely seen in other

         countries. (p. 57)

The same objectives ware pursued in Korea via selective and discretionary credit subsidies (see C.H

Lee, 1992). On industrial activism in Singapore, see Young (1992).



       This reflects an increase in protection of the agricultural sector, however. For
                                                                                        manufacturing proper,
the effective rate has declined from 28 percent in 1963 to 13 percent in 1978.
                                                     23

        The extensive involvement of the state in industrialization has long been familiar to close

observers of East Asia (see to' example Jones and Sakong, 1980, Westphal, 1982, and Pack and

Westphal. 1986). Two recent books have led the way in popularizing the reinterpretation of the East

Asian experience, Amsden (1989) on Korea and Wade (1990) on Taiwan. While many of Amsden's

and Wades arguments have been made before, what is new in these books is an smbitious re-

conceptualization of this experience, as well as their extensive documentalion of the governments role

in allocating resources and guiding ndustriatzation in both instances.

   Amsden (1989) describes in detail the Korean government's use of trade protection, selective credit

subsidies, export targets (for individual firms!), public ownership of banking sector, export subsidies, and

price controls—all deployed single-mindedly in the service of acquisition of technological capabilities and

of building industries that wtll eventually compete in world markets. She argues that government policy

was successful not because it got prices right, but indeed because it got them purposefully wrong.

However, a key element of the strategy, Amsden argues, wss thst in exchange for government

subsidies and trade protection the government also set stringent performance stsndsrds. Firms were

penalized when they performed poorly, as when they became subject to "rationalization" (government-

mandated mergers and capacity reduction) in the wake of over-extension. They were rewarded when

they fulfilled government objectives, as when they were awarded subsidized credit for fulfilling export

targets. Such discipline kept the system free of the rent-seeking that has contaminated incentive

regimes in other settings: "in other countries—like Turkey and India, for example.—subsidies have been

dispensed primsrity as giveaways. In Korea the 'wrong' prices have been right because government

discipline over business has enabled subsidies and protection to be less than elsewhere and more

affective" (Amsden, 1989, vi).

    Wade (1990) does not deny that there were elements of the free-msrket (ie., Hong Kong) recipe in



   e But see Johnson (1982) for an antecedent in Japan's case, as well as Jones and Sakong (1960) on
Kores.

  the Taiwanese strategy, but he quelittes the picture significantly. He cells Taiwan a governed market

  economy, characterized by; (1) high levels of investment: Oi) more investment in certain key industries

  than would have resulted in the absence of government intervention: end O) exposure of many

  industries to international competition (p. 26). He documents the pervasiveness of incentives and

  controls on private firms through import restrictions, entry requirements, domestic content requirements,

 fiscal investment incentives, and concessionel credit. I-fe argues that the Taiwanese state has

 consistently acted in anticipation of comparalive advantage in such sectors as cotton textiles, ptastics,

 basic metals, shipbuilding, automobiles, and industrial electronics; "Taiwan manages its trade differently

 from many other developing countries, but not less' (p. 113). Ute Amsden, he stresses the 'hard'

 nature of the East Asian state, but also argues that the emphasis on exports helped reveal policy

 mistakes and made reversal possible when some ventures got too costly.

     These works do not make easy reading for economists, both because they so boldly contradict

 conventional wisdom on what constitutes good economic policy, and because their authors' anatyses

 ocassionally remain incomplete or confusing. The latter is true particularly on the question of whether

 the verious policy interventions more or less offset each other, resueing in broad policy neutrality on

 balance, as liberalizers are prone to argue (e.g., Snaps, g91). On this important issue, Amsden

 openly contradicts the Lemer symmetry theorem (and Wairas' Law) withoul attempting a reconciliation.'7

Wade does the same, and also contradicts tiimselfi* Nonetheless, these books cannot easily be

dismissed: they present a serious challenge to those who would deny the usefulness of an activist



     17 "The argument that relative prices in Korea were distorted but in the right direction, that is, toward
exports, is therefore itself distorted: Prices were distorted in all directions in Korea—both for import
substitutes and for exports—and often for one and the same product in the two categories' (Amsden, 1989,
p. 155).
    78
        "The government was trying to promote both exports and, in different industries, import
substitution,.,,' (1990, p. 117, my anphasis) Later on, Wade writes: '[export promotion and import
substitution] are mutually asciusive only If daitned to refer to the overall balance of incentives between
domestic and foreign sale. But at the individual industry level, import-substituting incentives and export-
promoting inventivas can be complementary' (p. 363). His second statement is, of course correct, but
greatly limits the force of his argument since it is a partial-equilibrium one which cannot have applied to
more than a narrow segment of industry.
                                                     25

industrial poticy. Similar analyses of the East Asian experience, with varying emphases, are presented

in Banuri (1991), Bardhan (1990), Diddle and Milor (1992), Biggs and Levy (1990), Geretfi and Wyman

(1990), Johnson (1967), and Westphal (1990).

    It bears repeating what is perhaps the most striking aspect of the revisionist accounts of the East

Asian experience: the policy instruments used to such benefit in that context are no different from those

that have spparentty tailed so miserabty in Latin America, Africa, and the rest of Asia. The polides in

question are import quotas and licenses, credit subsidies, tax exemptions, public ownership, and so on.

For example, export subsidies that have worked so well in Korea in the 1 960s have been ineffective

and a source of rent-saaking in Kenya in the 1970s, and in Bolivia, Cote d'lvoire and Senegal during the

1980s. A reasonable hypothesis is that the reason has to do with differences n the way that the

government interacts with the private sector. One way of conceptualizing this difference is to think of

the government as a Stacketberg follower vis-a-vis the private sector in much of the developing world,

whereas it is the Stackelberg leader in East Asia. A modal of this sort can be used to explain how

identical poticies can have diametrically opposite consequences in different institutional settings (see

Rodrik, 1992d).

    tf there is a set of conclusions regarding the East Asian experience on which the revisionists and

the liberalizers can agree on, it probably goes as follows: (I) there has been a lot of government

intervention and sn active trade and industrial poticy; (U) but intervention has taken place above all in

the context of stable macroeconomic policies in the Form of small budget deficits and realistic exchange-

rate management; (iii) equally important, the governments' emphasis on and unmitigated commitment to

exports has helped minimize the resource costs and incentive problems that would have otherwise

arisen From heavy intervention; (iv) also, intervention has taken place in an institutional setting

characterized by a "hard state and strong government disciptne over the private sector; (v)


       This point was also stressed by Pack and Westphal (1 986): The differences between Japan, Korea,
and Taiwan, on one side, and most less successfut industrializing countries, on the other, are not to be
found in the use of different policy instruments. The differences are to be Found instead in different ways
of using the same poticy instruments—for example, in the scope of of their spptication, in whether they are
used promotionalty or restrictively (pp. 102-103).
                                                    26

furthermore, such a setting is lacking in most other developing countries. What one then does with

these conclusions dopends on one's predilections, Some would argue that it is possible to engineer

local versions ot the institutions that have made Korea's or Taiwan's policies so successful (e.g., Wade,

1990, chap. 11; Fishlow, 1991). Others would conclude that weaker governments should economize on

their scarcest resource, administrative competence, and restrict their involvement in the micro-

management of the economy (Krueger, 1990). Yet others would call for an entirety hands-off approach

(Lsl, 1990).



6. Heterodoxy II: Recent models of inperfect competition

    One of the common arguments against East Asian type industrial policies is that governments could

not possible make informed decisions about which industries will eventually become successful and

hence deserve support. Wade (1990) argues that this objection misses the point: "The governments of

Taiwan, Korea, and Japan have not so much pjd winners as made them." (p. 334, emphasis in the

odginsi). In other words, Wade implies that under the right set of government poficies, industries can

be nurtured into competitiveness even if these industries are es ante undistinguished with respect to

potential comparative advantage. Now, while this statement may be true as a matter of objective

description, its normative implications are not as salutary as Wade assumes. Indeed, in an economy

approsimating perfectly-competitive condttions, the policy just described would have to reduce the

economy's real income. Making "successfur esporters out of industries that do not possess an

underlying comparative advantage is a resource-subtracting potcy. So is this another display of poor

economics?

   The answer is not so clear in light of recent trade models with increasing returns to scale and

imperfect comperition. Assume for a moment that much of manufacturing operates under increasing

returns to scale, at least up to a point. Assume also that industrial production eshtbits demand or

technological spillovers; that is, the expansion of a firm leads to an increase in demand faced by other,
                                                       27
 neighboring firms or a reduction in their cosls.7° Under these circumstances, the pettern ot comparative

 advantage can be largely arbitrary. A policy that subsidized a sub—grouping of firms or industries

 eshibrting such demand complementarities or technological spillovers would permanently alter the

 economy's "comparative adventage in raise Its rear income (Pack and Westphal, 1986; Murphy

 1989; Krugman 1991, 1992). Moreover, the informstionat requirements of a policy of this sort need not

 be heavy: en input-oulpul lable and some knowledge ot the industrisi structure of more advanced

 countries are basically all that the policy makers would need.21

     There are strong echoes of Rosenstein-Rodan (1943), Nurkse (1953) and Hirschman (1958) in this.

 Indeed, one consequence of the emergence of this new literature has been the partial rehabilitation! at

 least at the level of theory, of concepts such as "big push," "balanced growth" and "linkages".

     This is just one example of how conventional wisdom can be upset by explicitly considering

Increasing returns to scale. However, the new fitereture is far from having yielded robust conclusions.


       See Stewart and Ghani (t992) for a survey of evidence on this and other type of spitlovers. Note
that a demand spillover, lelcen on its own (i.e., in the absence of increasing returns), would not constitute
grounds for policy intervention. A technological spitlover normally would.



      21 This is how Wade (1990, p. 335), citing the Economist, describes the way MITI picked industries to
  support: "First, MITI officials studied income elasticities of demand for various items in the main markets
  of the world, especially the United States, Second, they examined trends in technological change in various
  industries, Third they checked industries with high income elasticities and high potential for technological
  change against Japan's specialization Index, or the share of each industry in Japan's industrial exports over
 the share of that industry In world trade.... If world demand was growing especially fast for some particular
 item, the planners would get worried If Japan's specialization indes for that item was not going up too, On
 the other hand, if Japan's specialization index was already high for sn item whose world demand was not
 rising, they would not worry if its exports did not keep up. Fourth, they checked the trends against another
 index called the 'export and industrial estrangemenl coefficient.' This measured the relationship between
 an ilem's importance in Japan's total industriat output against its importance in exports.... With these
 measures, the government could identify sectors where measures for encouraging greater output and
 exports should be slapped up." None of this of course makes sense in the context of the compehtive model
 of economy. 8ut with increasing returns, demand spillovers, and imparted competition, a justification can
 be constructed, Of course, it is also easy to credit East Asian planner with too much: even Arnsden (1989)
 recognizes that Korean potcy makers may have gone too far with their promotion of heavy and chemical
industries in the late 1970s. See Yoon (1992) for a model of how a Korean producer of computer memory
chips became successful without direct government support, and Young (1992) for an interesting critique
of Singapore's industrial policy.
                                                       28

As we shall see, more often than not it has led to a bewildering array of special cases and an

embarrassingly rich set of possible outcomes from policy intervention. Consequently, it may be a

mistake to think of it as having signitcantly enhanced the case for intervention. Some have noted that

returns to scale and imperfect competition are rampant in developing countries, which makes the new

ideas particularly relevant to developing countries (Krugman, 1969; Rodrik, 1988; t-lelleiner. 1992a).

Others have dismissed them as largely irrelevant to developing-country circumstarrces and concerns

(Srinivaaan, 1989; Corden, 1990). See Grossman (1990) for a cautious survey of recent arguments for

promoting new industrial activities, and an avaluatton of their policy reievance,

    f-low important is imperfect competition in developing countries? Casual evidence would auggesi

that it is very important indeed. See Lee (1992) for a recent survey of studies on market structure in

developing countries. However, imperfect competition is often the consequence of oovernment policy

itself: entry and exit reatrictiona, capacity licensing and quantitative trade barriers are among the policies

that come to mind. The evidence on returns to scale is much more limited. Wtrat we have are mostly

engineering studies undertaken for advanced countries (as summarized in Scherer and Ross, 1990, for

example). Sertous recent econometric evidence comes in a paper by Tybeut and Westbrook (1 992a)

who analyze a panel of plant-level data from Chile. They find nc trace of significant returns to scale:

none of their estimates for three-digit induetriea suggests departures from constant returns, and only two

(out of 12) of their four-digit estimates indicate increasing returns. They caution, however, thet their

method is unable to pick up any set-up costa that might be present, Broadly supportive evidence

comes from Little (t 937), who reports that small enterprises do not face a substantial comparative

disadvantage via-a-via larger firma.

    Perhaps the recent literature's main contribution resides in providing new tools for analysia of some

age-old questions. The new tools relate to the modeling of three sets of issues in particular: strategic

interactions among firms; market-size externalities; and equilibrium when returns to scale and learning-

by-doing are h etny) to firma. These in turn have raised three typea of policy questions: (i) strategic

trade pcfcy O.e.. profit-shifting policy): (ii) policies to promote industries with scale economies; and (iii)
                                                      29

 policies to promote leerning end growth. I take up each in turn.

6.1 Strategic trade policy

    Much of the recent interest in modeling potcy in imperfectly-competitive settings arose from the

work ot Brander and Spencer (1985) on strategic trade policy. The basic Brander-Spencer model

consists of Iwo otgopolists based in different countries, competing in third markets and operating under

constant costs. Their cornpelition is modeled in a static, Nash-Cournol fashion; that is, esch firm

selects its output taking the other firm's oulput as given, and the equilibrium is defined as the pair nt

outputs from which neither firm wishes to deviate. In this setting, Brander and Spencer showed that if

one of the governments moved firsl and offered an esport subsidy to the domestic firm, the policy would

unambiguously increase home welfare (producer profits net of subsidy costs). What brings this result

about is the first-mover advantage arising from the assumed ability of the government to credibly

commit itself to a subsidy fie firms select their output levels. In effect, this transtorms the domestic

firm into a Stackelberg leader vis-a-vis the foreign firm, increases the market share of the domestic firm,

and enhances home weitare by shilling profits towards the latter,

    What makes support or home firms a polentally worthwhile objective in imperfectly-competitive

markets is the existence of excess profits, at least when there is limited entry. This makes a peso of

additional activity inherently more valuable in these industries than in other, perfectly competitive

sectors.

    However, the practical relevance of the profit-shifting argument ia quite limited. As Krugman (1992)

has put it, while an admirable piece of modeling craftsmanship, [the Brander-Spencer modefl has

generated intellectual and political heat out of all proportion to its long-run importance. The laundry list

of objections against the result is indeed formidable, The export-subsidy prescription is reversed (into

an export tax) when firms compete in prices (in Bertrand fashion) rather than in quantities (Eaton and

Grossman, 1986)22 With free entry into the industry, the rents from policy intervention are competed


    22 The logic, somewhat crudely, goes as follows. When firms play Bertrand] they each assume that
the other firms price remains unchanged in responae to an increase in own price. In actual fact, the
optimal response is to raise prices when the competitor does the same, This means that under Bertrand
                                                      30

 away and the home economy left worse ott? If the home government lacks perfect information about

 coats end demand, the intervention may be set at the wrong level. When the foreign government plays

the same game, a prisoners' dilemma situation results. Last but not least, the available empirical

studies (which are mostly of the catbratiori-simulation type) yield only small gains from strategic policy

even when policies are set optimally and with perfect information, See the essays in Krugman (1 986)

for a good discussion of the potcy issues raised by the Brander-Spencer model, and the real-world

limitations to its usefulness.

    Because they are rarely significanl players in oligopofistic global markets, the direct implications of

the Brander-Spencer model to developing-country exporters are even more limited. Baldwin (1992)

conducts a calibration-style empiricel analysis of one of the few exceptions; Brazilian exports of

commuter aircraft (the EMB-120) to U.S. and European markets. He finds that, on profit-shifting

grounds alone, even an optimally-selected Brazilian subsidy would have reduced home welfare. (But he

also shows that this result would be reversed once labor rents in the Brazilian aircraft industry are

allowed for.)

    Perhaps a more promising area for profit-shifting policy is domestic markets in which home firma

compete with local subsidiaries of multinational corporations or with direct sales from aligopoliats

abroad. In such markets, there is a parallel case for discriminating against the foreign firma. Such

discrimination can be accomplished by impori tariffs when foreign firms do not produce locally (Levy and

Nolan, 1992), or by discriminatory performance requirements when they do (Rodrik, 1987a). But in


conjectures the home firm is too restrained in setting its price, relative to the true (out-of—equitbrium)
response by its competitor. An export lax raises Ihe home firm's price, thereby correcting the "distoriion
due to the difference between the conjectured response and the actual response.



        It is possible to confuse the presence of excess profits with the lack of free entry. Suppose entering
an industry is risky, with a positive probabitty that an incumbent will make losses (and have to exit). In
order for there to be any entry at all, there must also be a positive probability of excess profits. Excess
profits, under free entry, will be zero         but positive           Subsidizing incumbents will simply lead
to additional entry, and the dissipation of additional rents created.
                                                       31
either case many of the limitations of the original protlt-shifting argument carry over to this setting as

well.

    Levy and Nolan (1992) systematIcally analyze policies In the area of trade and direct foreign

investment in the presence of excess profits, and present a useful summary of the implications br

developing countries. The "lessons" they list are as follows: (1) Competition from foreign firms need not

always be beneficial. (2) Imports can be excessive under laissez-faire. (3) Foreign investment can be

harmful, even under free trade. (4) Policies that discriminate in favor of domestically-owned firms can

be beneficial. (5) Given the available empirical evidence, imperfect competition in the Industrial sector

of developing countries does not justify nominal tariff rates in excess of 15 percent. (6) Imperfect

compátition in the industrial sectors of developing countries is not an argument against trade

liberalization measures of the type typically under consideration.

L2 Policies to promote induslries with scale economies

    The "new" trade theory has investigated a second area of potential policy intervention when

domestic firms operate at sub-optimal levels of capacity. In the presence of increasing returns to scale!

average costs of production exceed marginal costs; and since prices cannot fall below average costs for

firma to remain financiatly viable, there must exist a gap between price and marginal coat (even when

eacess profits are zero). In principle, this gap could be cloaed via policiea of subsidization and trade

protection which encourage increased scale of production.

    When economies of scale are large enough, and there exist demand spillovers from one sector to

another, it is even possible that otherwise profitable industries will never get established in the firat

place. This is the basis for Murphy, Shleifer, and Vtshny's (1989a. 1989b) justification for coordinated

industrialization poicies:

         When domestic markets are small and world trade is not free and costless, firms nay not be

         able to generate enough sales to make adoption of increasing returns technologies profitable.

         and heace industriafization is stalled.... (W]e focus [in this paper] on the contribution to

        industrialization of one sector to enlarging the size of the market in other sectors. Such
                                                          32

         spillovers give rise to the possibility that coordination of investment across sectors—which the

         government can promote—is essential for industriatration. (189a, pp. 1003-4)

Note, however, the important caveat with regard to trade. If firms are able to take advantage of world

markets, they are treed from dependence on demand spillovers from other sectors in the same

economy; they can instead rely on a much larger world market. While it is possible to think of market-

size externalities that are local rather than globake.g., when geographical proximity matters or there are

non-tradable inputs—the possibilty of foreign trade greatty reduces the applicability of Murphy          a

argument? Indeed, since government policy is often the greatest impediment to trade, the argument

can even be read as one in favor of free trade rathar than government interventon.

    This objection is a general problem with the idea of promoting increasing-returns industries, It

exporting is an option and transport costs low, firma can be expected to take advantage of it to reduce

their costs and become competitive. Consider, for esampte, the case of an import-competing firm with

strong scale economies (and assume the country in question is small in world markets). Trade

protection would allow the firm to increase its output and reduce its unit costs, Is thrs a good idea? If

the alternative is to close down the firm at no cost, the condition for such a policy to be make sense is

that the firm be able to reduce its average cost below the world price. Otherwise, we can save

resources by shutting down the firm and importing what was locally produced hefore. But if the firm can

reduce its average cost below its competitors' by expanding its scale of output sufficiently, ii needs no

inducement from the government to undertake what ts a profitable strategy in any case.25 The

(necessary but not sufficient) condition for local welfare improvement due to a small increase in



   24 Pack and Westphal (1956) make a similar argument in the presence of trade, but they critically
assume that the import price of the relevant final good esceeds its export price (i.e., there exists transport
costs),

       For a large-country the situafion may be different. Trade protection may raise the marginal oust of
the foreign firms, because it reduces their sales. This in turn makes the domestic firm achieve a larger
market share even in foreign markets. This is Xrugman's (1984) idea of import protection as export
promotion.
                                                      33
protection is less stringent, namely that the domestic marginal cost lie below the world price (Roddk,

1986). But of course the latter may still be an inferior strategy to letting the firm go bust,

    Allowance for free entry generally weakens the case for trade protection even further. Entry in the

presence of scale economies tends to crowd firms and lead to duplicstion of fixed costs; protection

leads to further entry, end aggravates the duplication. Harris (1984) has shown, in the context of a

computable general equilibrium model for Canada, how the reversal of this process can lead to an

'industry rationalization' effect that significantly enhances the welfare gains from trade liberatization.

The basic mechsniem can be underslood by considering the equality belween price and average cost in

a model with free entry. In the aftermath of trade liberalizalion, the domestic price in import-competing

industries has to be lower, which implies s lower level of average dosls in the new equilibrium. What

allows this new equilibrium to exist is the exit of some of the incumbent firms, which provides room for

the remaining firms to expand their production lines and reduce their unit costs. The quantitative

importance of this rationalization effect has been cnnfirmed in simulaton exercises carried out in partial

equiibrium for several Turkish industries (Rodrik, 1968) and in a general equilibrium exercise for Korea

(Gunasekers and Tyers, 1991). The latter study estimates welfare gains of the order of? percent of

GDP arising from lengthened production runs and increased labor productivity, a number that greatly

exceeds anything that comes out of models with constant returns. However, a rather similar model
                                                                                                               -

calibrated to Cameroonian data yields negligible effects from industry rationalization (Devarsjan and

Rodrik, 1992).

    Note that the potential For excessive entry creates a role for entry restrictions, especially when entry

has been artiflcafly spurred by trade restrictions. This point is rarely recognized in industrial-policy

discussions, which too often assume the worst about the effects of such restrictions (eg., Fnschtaic.

1939). Whatever deleterious consequences entry barriers in countries like India and Argentina may

have had, they may have at least prevented even greater departures from minimum effcient scale.

6.3 Policies to promote learning and growth.

    Recent modets of endogenous growth have stressed how learning and purposive R&D activity drive

economic growth through the creation of new products snd the improvement in the quality of esisting

ones. Unlike in the neo-claasical models of the Solow-type, long-run growth rates in these models are

not pinned down by a forever-diminishing marginal productivity of capital, and can be affected by

government policy (Lucas, 1988; Romer 1986). Endogenous growth is obtained by allowing non-

decreasing returns to reproducible assets, such as knowledge and human capital. A question of

particular interest has been how international trade and trade policy influence growth in models of this

kind. The answer is: it depends.

    To aee the different channels at work, consider a simple endogcnoua growth model of the type

considered by Grossman and Heipman (1991) and Rivera-Batiz and Romer (1991). We distinguish

between three sectors, which we call agriculture, manufacturing, and R&D. The agriculture sector is

intensive in unskilled labor, while manufacturing is intensive in akiilled tabor. We suppose they trade at

esogenoualy given world prices. The R&D sector also uses skilled labor and specializes in inventing

intermediate goods, which are produced under monopohsticaily competitive conditions. The wider the

range of intermediate gooda, the lower are the coats in the manufacturing sector (as in Ethier, 1982).

(Atternativety, this cost efect could arise from knowledge apillovera produced in the R&D sector.) The

profitability ot producing these intermediate goods determines the rate at which new goods are

produced, and therefore the rate at which manufacturing coats decline. The R&D sector is therefore the

economy's growth sector: activity in this sector directly determines the economy's growth rate.

   International trade has three main conaequencea in a model of this type? Following Grossman and

Helpman (1991, chap. 9) and Rivera-Batiz and Romer (1991), we can list them as follows:

   (1) The comparative-advantage or allocation effect Static comparative advantage determines the

instantaneous resource-pulls in an economy opening up to trade. If the effect of these is to direct



   2A fourth, more direct, consequence arises from the enhanced contact with toreiunera and with foreign
technologies that trade often atmulatea.
                                                    35
resources towards the "growth sectoC of the economy, the effect of trade is to speed up economic

growth; otherwise, opening up to trade may lead to reduced growth. In the context of the model

sketched out above, s country that is poorly endowed in human capital would experience a reduction in

the relative wages of skilled labor, and therefore a decrease in the cost of doing R&D. The

consequence would be an increase in that country's growth rate. The opposite is true for an economy

that Is well endowed with skilled labor (Grossman and Helpman, 1991, chap. 6). More broadly, trade is

likely to enhance growth to the extent that innovative activity is more closely linked to the exporting

sector than the import-competing sector, and diminish it otherwise.

    (2) The market size or integration effect. International trade expands the size of the market which

the R&D sector services; but it also increases the competition faced by the home R&D sector. The first

of these effects generally increases growth, as long as there is some increasing returns built into the

R&D sector. For example, when intermediate goods are traded and used in the R&D sector, the

enlarged market size allows a wider range of inputs, tower costs, and therefore a boost in R&D activity

and growth. Alternatively, when there is learning-by-doing, the larger market size speed up the rate or

learning (Davis 1991). The second effect is generally detrimental to growth because the smaller

market share implied by each of the innovating domestic firms reduces the incentive to innovate.

Feenstra (1990) provides a model of two countries with unequal sizes in which intermediate goods are

not traded. The latter property implies that the smaller country has a cost disadvantage in producing

these goods, and its trms lose market share when trade is opened up, Consequently, trade

unambiguously reduces the smaller country's growth rate.

    (3) The redundancy effect. In the absence of trade, some innovative activity is necessarily

duptcatod in different countries. That is, resources are devoted to developing identical products. With

trade, such duplication can be avoided.

    Hence, only the last of these effects is unambiguously favorable to trade in vew of this, it is

possible to come up with models of trade and growth to satisfy any type of priors or to rationalize any
                                                      36

conventional wisdom,27 Gomptcating the analysis turther, growth and welfare do not atways go hand in

hand in these models: it is possible for growth-enhancing poficies to reduce welfare, and for welfare-

enhancing opening up to reduce growth.

    Are there any generalizations that can be drawn for developing countries in particular? There is one

robust feature in the type of models considered here, and that is the following: the more asymmetric the

trading countries are—in terms of size, extent of a head start, or static comparative advantage--the more

likely that growth effects will be asymmetric also. This raises the danger that developing countries may

end up with the short end of the stick, as could happen when comparative-advantage and/or markot-

size effects lead to a crowding out of their innovative sectors. For countries that are similar, the danger

is less reaL2° Somewhat paradoxically, this resuscitates the theoretical case for regional integration

schemes ggg developing countries, even though such schemes have long gone out of academic

fashion.

    A particularly noteworthy paper in Ihie research tradition that has served to clarify the links among

agricultural productivity, openness, and growth is Matsuyarna (1991). This paper shows how the effect

of agricultural productivity on growth is mediated through the openness of an economy. Matsuyama

considers a model with the following key features: (I) there are two sectors, agriculture arid

manufacturing: (ii) there is learning-by-doing in the manufacturing sector, which drives growth; and (Hi)

the income elasticity of demand for agricultural output is less than unity. tn a closed economy, the



      Krugman (1957) and Young (1991) provide additional examples where trade is detrimental to growth.
IJe Melo and Robinson (1990) present an imaginative CGE application to esplain" Korea's growth
performance in terms of externalities ariatng from exports and from the acquisition of technology via
imported goods, Buffle (1992) and Taylor (1992) explore models with yet additional channels of ambiguity.
In Taylor's model, growth is driven by profitability, and the effect of commercial policy depends on how
much it depresses the profitability of the export sector relative to the increase in the import-competing
sector's profitability.



   2S As Rivera-Eattz and Romer (1991, p. 974) put it, "there is a strong presumption that trade restrictions
between similar regions like North America and Europe wit reriuce world wide rates of growth."
                                                          37

     model predicts that agricultural productivity is positively related to growth: the more productive is

     agriculture, the higher the resources that can be devoted to manufacturing, and the Faster the rate of

     learning and growth. In an open economy, by contrast this result is reversed: a more productive

     agriculture leads the economy to specialize in agriculture and therefore to withdraw resources from

     manufacturing, which is the engine of growth. Turning Malsuyama's results on their head, one can then

     argue that the optimal trade strategy for a developing country depends on its level of agricultural

     productivity. Countries that are poorly endowed in arabia land have little to Fear from openness: indeed

     they should encourage it. But countries that have a comparative advantage in agricdlture should worry

     about the consequences of crowding out manufactures iF they rely on trade too much?

         The focus on ideas and on learning in many of these papers is a useful counterweight to the

     traditional focus on the accumulation ot physical and human capital (i.e., investment and schootng) as

     the engine of growth. It requires attention to be devoted to the microeconomics of how ideas are

     generated and transferred. As Romer has emphasized, the focus on ideas places openness to the

     outside world at the center of Ihe analysis, but in a different way than nne usually thinks of openness in
                                                                                                 -
     trade models:

              When one considers the economic opportunities afforded by ideas, openness is central to the

              analysis, but not necessarily in the sense articulated by the classical theory of trade In terms

              of the effect on the rate oF growth (and even on the overall effects on consumer welfare), it

              probably matters little whether the consumers of a deveIopng country have access to cigarettes

              and citrus products made in the US.

                  What does matter is whether investors from the rest of the world have an incentive to put

              ideas to use in that nation. By creating the right incentives, any country in the world can follow

              the first oF the two strategies mentioned in the title Jof Romer's paper]: using ideas. But it also


Ii          For esample, Lucas (1990) simulates a macro-econometric model of the Indian economy to find that
     real value added in manufacturing (at world prices) would fall in the aftermath of complete trade
     liberalization.

         matters whether producers in a rratton receive the rtght signals about the ideas that can be sold

         on world markets, whether they have eccess to the right inputs, and whether they receive the

        right rewards (or generating such ideas. This is what is required for the second strategy,

        producing ideas. (p. 5)

Rorner goes on to discuss the cases of Mauritius and Taiwan as archetypal examples of these two

respective strategies. See also Amsden and t'fikino (1991) for historical examples on the two strategies,

and Young (1992) for a parallel account on the divergent industrial strategies in I-tong Kong and

Singapore. These case studies illustrate that a government's commitment to provide the right incentives

for the transfer and generation of new technologies (i.e., adequate property rights and policy stability) is

cf significantly greater importance than the extent of policy intervention per se.

    Informal case studies like these aside, there are as yet practical!y no direct emprrical tests of the

specific trade-growth linkages identitied above. We need such tests to close the large gap that

presently exists between the empirical work described in section 4.2.3 and the theoretical models

discussed here. The former is informative but largely devoid of policy content, while the latter are

stimulating, but remain empirically untested.



7. How to refonn? Issues in the stntegy of reform

    The recognition that trade and industrial regimes in developing countries are sorely in need of

reform, as well as the growing experience with reform, has led to an expanding literature on appropriate

strategies for reform, Some of the issues involved—such as piecemeal reform—have a relatively long

tradition of analysis within economics. Others—such as the analysis of policy credibility and of

interaction with stabilization--are of more recent origin, and owe their genesis to the special

circumstances ol the 1980s. My review will stress the more recent analytical contributions. For broad

discussions of reform strategy on various aspects of trade and industry, see Takacs (1959), Nnllis and

Kikeri (1989), Thomas, Nash and associates (199), Michaely, Papageorgiou and Choksi (1991),

Johnson (1991), Krause and Kihwan (1991) and Atlyas, Dutz, and Frischtsk (1992). Evans (1991,
                                                      39

1992) provides a mora heterodox perspective on reform strategy. On cost-benefit analysis of

privatization in second-best environments, see Jones, Vogelsang, and Tandon (19O),

7.1 The theory of piecemeal reform

The theory of piecemeal reform is a natural estension of the theory of the second best. The question it

poses is the following: Suppose all policy distortions cannot be removed at once; what partial reforms

can we undertake and be certain that we have increased (rather than reduced) aggregate real income?

See Oixit (1985, sec. 4) for a review of the literature and references. Two results stand out in this

literature: (i) an equal percentage red uction in all distortions increases aggregate income (the 'radial

method): and (it) reducing the distortion on the most highly-taxed good increases aggregate income

provided thst good is s substitute to all others (the "concertina" method).

    Two notable recent extensions of this literature are Fstvey (1 988) and Lopez and Panagariya

(1992). Fatvey shows that the presence of quantitative trade barriers does npt affect these conclusions,

provided 'distortions" in the above is read as applying to tariff-ridden goods only: that is, the radial and

concertina methods slill work as long as they are applied to tsrtfUridden goods only. Further, since the

presence of quantitative restrictions cuts off spillovers, a loosening or removal of any quota distortion is

beneficial if quotas are the only distortion. Lopez and Psnagsriya show that in the presence of a "pure"

intermediate input (i.e., one that is not produced at home), the substitutability assumption of the

concertina method will normally fail; in reasonable models such an input has to be complement to at

least one final good. Therefore, when pure intermediate goods have high tariffs, the concertina method

cannot be relied on to reduce the overall tariff structure in a gradual manner.

7.2 Is tax or tariff uniformity a good idea?

    Provided the substitutability condition holds at every step along the way, the logic of the concertina

approach to reducing distortions leads us at the end of the road to a uniform tax or tariff system.

Indeed, ruling out complementarities like those discussed by Lopez and Panagariya (1992), any move

towards uniformity from above—that is, the reduction of the most extreme distortions—will necessariiy be

an improvement over the status quo ante,
                                                      40

    This is occasionally interpreted as a justifcation for recommending uniform tariffs or, at least

reduced dispersion in ates. However, the theorems just stated sre derived under the assumption that

the tariffs in existence do not serve an economic or non-economic purpose in the first place. Once the

stated goal of having taxes end/or tariffs is made explicit, we can almost always find a non-uniform tariff

structure that will do better than any uniform one?C For revenue-raising purposes, for example, a

differentiated tariff structure along Ramsey principles would be called for. For providing import-

competing goods with a given amount of protection a differentiated structure would be called for also,

unleaa we do not care about consumption distortions. With pre-existing market distortions, the optimal

lariff atructuré will be similarly non-uniform in general. A uniform tariff is optimal only when the objective

of poTicy is to reduce aggregate imports to a certain level. For a transparent discussion of these issues,

see Panagariya (1990). For a realTwortd application that shows how second—best tariff can signitcanily

diverge from uniformity, see Devarajan and Lewia (1990). On the design of optimal tariffs for

distributional or revenue reasons, aee Heady and Mitra (1957). On hew export taxes can be justifled in

the preaence of revenue constraints and market diatortiora, aee Roumasset and Setboonsarng (1988).

    Tariff uniformity ia aometimea recommended on the basis of administrative simplicity and political

econcmy, rather than economic efficieny. However such arguments are not always subjected to

careful scrutiny. When they are, they turn out to have a number of limitations (see Pansgsriya and

Rodrik, 1 992). -

7.3 Tuning and sequencing of reform

    A different set of second-best issues arises when we consider the time path of liberalization,

possibly in connection with liberalization in other areas. Two questions in particular have dominated the

analysis in thia area: (i) how quickly should reform be introduced? and (U) how should reform ir different



    ° It goes without saying that tariff are rarely trst-beat policies. The only exceptions are the presence
of market power in world trade, and a non-economic objecttve that targets the volume of imports directly
(see Dixit, 1985). So conaideratona in the present paragraph apply to instances where tha tirsi-beat
policies are not available for acme reason.
                                                      41
areas be sequenced?

    On the speed of reform, the classic, but too-often neglected contribution is Mussa {1B6). Mussa

considers the optimal timing of trade reform in a model where domestic factors of production face

adjustment costs when they relocate from one sector to another. Contrary to the widely-held belief that

adjustment costs call for gradualism in policy reform, he shows that the optimal policy consists of an

immediafe jump to free trade unless there exists specific market distortions; adjustment costs by

themselves are not an argument for gradual introduction of reform. To understand this conclusion, we

have to draw a distinction between the rate at which the reform itself is introduced and the rate at which

the private sector nds it optimal to adjust to the reform, In the presence of adjustment costs, it is true

that agents may find it optimal to spread out over time their sectoral reallocation. However, it does not

follow that reform itsetf shoutd be spread out over time also. Mussa shows that, as long as individuals

have rational expecfations regarding the ruture path of factor rewards and there are no market

distortions, they witl in fact adjust al a socially optimal rate when the reform is introduced all at once.

Departures from these assumptions may call for gradualism (or indeed overshoofincU, If for example,

individuals have static expectations regarding fufure factor prices, they may adjust 100 quickly, and then

it may be beneficial to stow down the reform. Other complicatinns arise when there are distortions in

the adjustment process, or when the govetnment wishes to moderate (for distributional reasons) the

losses incurred by individuals in the previously-protected secfors.

    On the issue of sequencing, most of the analytical work has focussed on the question of whether

trade liberafzation should precede or follow capital-account liberalization. Studies by Edwards (1934),

Edwards and van Wijnbergen (1966), and Rodrlk (1937b) generally come out in favor of a trade-first

strategy. The transition to markets in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union has given rise to

broad-ranging discussions of alternative sequencing options with regards to reforms in the areas of

prices, trade, finance, and privatizatton; see, for example. Genberg (1990). Hinds (1990), Kornai (1990),

Lipton and Sacha (1990), Portea (1990), and Williamson (1991).
                                                       42

 7.4 Credibility in poticy reform

    Policy reforms in the Southern Cone of Latin America during the I 970s and throughout the world

during the 1980s were frequently met with skepticism on the part of the private sector, who had been

deceived in the past by promises of reform and by aborted efforts. Calvo (1969) has shown how the

lack of credibility that a reform will last introduces a distortion that could easily render the (incredible)

reform harmful rather than beneficial. See Rodrik (1991) for an application of this idea to structural

adjustment programs.

    To see the basic idea, consider a trade reform that is put in place today, but is widely expected tc

be temporary. This temporariness introduces a distortion in the intertemporal structure of prices, the

effect of which may outweigh the temporary elimination of the static distortion. In Calvo's (1989) model,

the distortion exhibits itself in the form of over-borrowing while the reform lasts: since imporied goods

ere perceived to be cheap only temporarily, the private sector goes into debt for usual reasons of

intertemporal susbtitution. In a model where foreign borrowing is ruled out, the same intertempcrsl

distortion would exhibit itself in the form of s sub-optimally low level of investment, thanks to a reduced

saving rate (Rodrik, I 989a).

    In view of the adverse incentves created for private-sector behavior, credibility problems can be

self-fulfilling: the reversal of reform may come about for no other apparent reason than the belief trial it

will be aborted (Rodrik, 1991). In addition, credibility problems can arise because of dynamic

inconsistenoies in government policy. In an interesting paper, Matsuysma (1990) analyzes the extort to

which a government can credibly threaten to liberalize so as to induce domestc trms to undertake

appropriate investments. He shows that such threats are unlikely to be credible. As long as firms

realize that the government's best option is not to liberalize in the absence of such investments, the

firms' best strategy in turn is not to yield. Sinoe liberafzation "thrests are incredible, they are never

carried nut, Similarly, Hardy (1992) models the soft-budget constraint that is inherent in government

policy, notably but not exclusively in Eastern European countries, as a form of dynamic inconsistency.

As long as the government ceree about unemployment, its commitment not to bail failing enterprises is
                                                      43
 not entirety credible. Hardy suggests that the creation of a "social satety net" may render such a

commitment more credible, by reducing the income loss to unemployed workers.

    As these examples show, depending on the precise source of the credibility prcblem and how it is

modeled, the policy prescriptions vary. Froot (1988) suggests going slow on liberalization, while Rodnk

(1989a) argues for going over-board to signal the government's true intentions, Engel and Kletzer

(1991) show how credibility can be enhanced over time by optimal potcy choice when individuals are

Bayesian learners. For a broad, informal discussion of government strategies, including external

commitments (e.g., accession to GAll), reputation-building, signalling, increasing the costs of potcy

reversal, and institutional design, see Rodrik (1989b).

7.5 The fallacy of composition

    The simultaneous implementation of outward-oriented poTicies in countries pioducing the same

commodity exports (e.g. coffee or cocoa) has raised the worry that a fallacy of composition may be the

end result. Even if the terms-of-trade consequences can be judged minor for exporters taken one at a

time, the same need not be the case for the group as a whole. Such considerations have been given

increased salience by the exceptionally low level of real commodity prices in the 1 980s. Over the

longer horizon, there is evidence that the terms of trade for primary commodities have experienced a

small, but statistically significant negative trend during the present century (Gnu and Yang, 1988;

Qiakosavvas and Scandizzo, 1991). These considerations give rise to the possibility that export taxes

(whether administered singly or jointly) remain part of the optimal potcy package for certain commodity

exporters (Panagariya and Schiff, 1990. 1992; Evans             1992). However, in view of the extremely

restrictive import policies already in place in these countries, it is hkety that such considerations would

not come into play short of dreslic liberalizations. In other words, the existing restrictions are much too

high to justify on the basis of terms-of-trade arguments.

    Ever since Bhagwati (1968), it is known that a country with market power in trade cannot esperience

immiaeriztng growth as tong as it has in place optimal export taxes. Bandyopadhyay (1992) has shown

that this logic need not hold when there are more than a single exporter of the same commodity, unless
                                                     44

exporters select their export tax cooperatively. As the quatlier in the previous sentence indicates, the

reason is that export taxes that are selected, say, In a Nash tashion cannot adequately cope with the

externality genersted by each country's growth. Even when countries impose their individually optimal

export taxes, they can still be immiserized when they grow.

7.6 Political economy issues

    One ef the most important puzzles in understanding economic reform is the following: if reform is

such a great idea, why are governments typically so reluctant to undertake it? There has been

increased attention paid by economists to lhis question recently, for the simple reason that it is

impossible to design sensible reform packages without understanding what keeps governments frcrn

embracing reform in the first place. Attempts to resolve the puzzle usually revolve around disttibutionel

issues: losers from reform, it is assumed, tend to be politcalty-powerfut groups, such as urban

industrialists and organized labor, while the gainers, such as agricultural workers and small

induslrialists, are disenfranchised and powerless.

    Two recent papers have gone beyond this simple, almost tautological explanation. Alesina and

Drazen (1 991) focus on the question of why reforms are delayed, even though all groups lose as a

consequence. While their reference point is a stabitzation (i.e., macro) crisis, their basic argument is

relevant to all distortions whose costs increase over time. Their answer relies on asymmetric

informahon: when groups are uncertain about the costs incurred by their rivals, they may choose to

enter a war cf attrition in the hope that somebody else will give in First and agree to pay a

disproportionately large share of the costs (or, more to the point, receive a disproportionstaly small

share of the reform's benefits). What this argument shows is that reforms may be delayed even when

all groups stand to benefit from it.

    In Fernandez and Rodrik (1991), a different form ci uncertainty is introduced. It is assumed thst

individuals do not know precisely how they will fare under reform, even though the aggregate

consequences may be well known. This is motivated by the evidence that large trade reforms bring into

existence new activities that could not have been predicted ex ante. The paper shows thst under these
                                                       45

 circumstances, reforms thst would have been accepted ea post (I.e., once the uncertainty is resolved)

 may rail to be adopted ax ante, even if Individuals are risk neutral and completely rational. Political

 systems have a status-quo bias in the sense that many beneficial reforms are passed up, even though

 they would have been popular if introduced by a dictator.

     The concern with distributional and other political-economy issues has lad to their introduction into

 analyses that are otherwise quite conventional. For example, in their analysis of the Marshall Plan

 (which they call "history's most successful structural adjustment plan"), de Long and Eichengreen (1991)

 identify the Plan's ma)or contribution as follows: it facilitated the negotiation of a pro-growth 'social

 contract that provided the political stabifity and climate necessary to support the postwar boom" (p. 6).

 Levy and van Wijnbargan (1992) pay spedal attention to distributional issues in their CGE analysis of

 agricultural liberalization in Mexico1 focusing on poor farmers in particular, and reccmmand measures

 that would alleviate adverse consequences. De Janvry etat. (1992) construct art index of political

feasibility of policy outcomes, based on a number of arguments drawn from the pcttical-acononiy

tterature, and introduce it in a CGE model.

7.7 Interaction with stabilization policy

    Perhaps the hallmark of the reforms of the 1 980s has been their implementation in the contest

macroeconomic instabitly. Indeed, the most aigniticant trade and price reforms often have been in

reality mere appendages to stabIlization programs (as in Bolivia in 1965, Mexico at end-i 987, Brazil and

Peru in 1990, Argentina in 1991). This despite the broad professional consensus, emerging largely from

the failures in the Southern Cone of Latin Amreica during the late i970s, that a stable macroeconomic

environment is a kay prerequisite to the success of microeconomic reform (Corbo and da Meto, 1987:

Cavallo, 1991: Hachatte, 1991), This consensus has received dramatic confirmation in research

undertaken by Kaufmann (1991) at the World Bank. Kautmann re-estimated rates of return from 1200

World bank projects in 58 countries. He found that the overall Quality cI macroeconomic management—

as measured by the extent of fiscal deficits, exchange-rate ovarvaluation, and negative real interest

rates—made a significant difference to the productivity of investment prcjects. It is selt-evident that
                                                      46
triple-digit inflation can negate the benefits of structural reform; entrepreneurs are unlikely to take full

advantage of relative-price changes when there is a high degree of uncertainty about the overall price

level.

    I-lance, there can be tttla dissent from the view that macroeconomic stability is essential to the

success of structural reform. Much of the debate on the wisdom of undertaking structural reform in the

context of stabilization policies has focussed instead on whether the former can assist in the disinflation

process. Three channels in particular have been addressed;

    (1) Exchange-rate management. Trade tberalization typically calls for a compensating exchange

rate depreciation, in view of the likely downward nominar rigidity of wages and other non-tradables

prices. Stabilization of the price level, by contrast, requires avoiding such jumps in the exchange rate.

Hence liberalization in the midst of stabilization exerts conflicting pressures on exchange rate policy

(Sacha, 1987). Usually, the conflict is resolved in favor of stabilization, leading to a prolonged

overvaluation and large trade deficits (as in Mexico after 1987 and Poland in 1991).

    (2) Importing price discipline from abroad. Trade liberalization, and the removal of quantitative

restrictions, in particular, may help disinflation by forcing convergence between domestic inflation in

tradables prices and external tnflation. This strategy was tried in Chile during the 1970s, but has been

judged a failure thanks to the backward-looking nature of wage contracting (Corbo and de Melo, 1987).

In the context of Eastern European atabifizations of the early I 990s, the strongest advocate of this

strategy has been Jeffrey Saohs—somewhat paradoxically in light of his earlier predilections in favor of

delaying liberalization (Sacha, 1 987). Sacha has argued that precious effort neeed not be wasted on

breaking up monopolistic enterprises, as long as the trade regime is treed up in the initial stages ct the

program (Berg and Sacha, 1991),

    (3) Fiscal revenues. Shoring up fiscal revenues is a primary goal of stabifzation programs. Certain

types of trade fberalization may go in the opposite direction, when they involve substanlial outs in

export and import taxes. In practice, however, the typical trade liberalization package is as likely tc

increase fiscal revenues as to reduce them. Transforming quotas into tariffs is an unambiguously
                                                       47

  revenue-enhancing rrleesure. So is reducing the scope of tariff exemptions, or reducing prohibitively

  high tariffs that encourage ernuggling and squeeze out otfical trade. A preliminary review of the

  evidence from countries undertaking SALs indicates the absence of any clear patterns with respect to

 fiscal consequences of trade reform (Oreeneway and Mimer, 1991).

     In addttion structural reform can interact with stabilization in more subtle ways. One reason that so

 many Latin American governments have jumped on the free trade bandwagon is their desire to enhance

 the credibifity of their stabifization efforts. What better way to signal that these governments now really

 mean business than to disavow their entire comples of impofl-substitution policies (Rodrik. 1 992c)? A

 paper by Diwan (1990) makes this notion more precise in the context of bargaining with external

 creditors. He argues that a shift towards export-promoting policies increases the cost to a debtor

 government of repudiating its debt, because the trade penalties that would be incurred—such as the loss

 of trade credits—are proportional to the volume of trade. This renders the government's promise to

 honor its debt more credible, and thereby relaxes its credit ceiling,1



 8. What has been achieved? Evidence on consequences of policy reform

     Since the reforms of the 1 980s are recent and still largely under way, a section evaluating the

 results of these reforms has to be necessarily briefer than one would wish. In addition, the results of

structural reforms are likely to have been delayed by the environment of macroeconomic instability in

which they have been typically carried out. For the same reason, the consequences of microeconomic

reforms are hard to disentangle from the effects or stabitzation policies. Available studies are too often

sloppy in identifying precise cause-and-effect relationships.

    For obvious reasons, the World Bank itself is the primary source for information on the extent of

 trade reforms dominating the agenda. Sixty-one countries have submitted themselves tc the

 conditionality of at least one SAL (or SECAL—sector adjustment loan) over the period 1979-89, and on

 average more than three-quarters of alt conditions have been substantially implemented. For other, less

 comprehensive accounts, see Whalley (1989), Ftodrik (1992c), and Helleiner (1992b) on lrade reforms

 and Vvilliarrtson (1990) for a progress report which focuses on Latin America. See Lardy (1992) on the

 important case of China, and Pryor (1991) for an account of agricultural and other reforms in Marxist

 developing countries. Trade and industrial policy reforms in Eastern Europe are reviewed in Blanchard

etal. (forthcoming). On privalizatton, World Bank (1992) is a comprehensive survey of developments

over the last decade; It reports that more than 80 countries have launched ambitious efforts to private

their public enterprises and that more than 2,000 enterprises (including 805 in Eastern
                                                                                          Europe
however) have been privatized in developing countries since 1980.

8.1 The supply response and restructuring

   World Bank staff has ao been at the forefront of evaluating the consequences of policy reform

One strand of analysis has focused on whether countries that have received SALs have
                                                                                           outperformed
others, once other circumstances are controlled for to the extent that they can. Faini etal. (1991) and

Corbo and Rojas (1992) have undertaken large-scale econometric studies
                                                    50
addressing this question. The answer seems to be that, once external shocks are controlled for SAL

recipients tend to do better than comparator countries in exports and economic growth but worse in

investment. These findings are broadly confirmed by the work of Mosley etal. (1991). The reduction in

investment is puzzling, and suggests that the increase in growth may be largely due to the impact ci

additional imports made possible by external financing. However, there are Important interpretational

problems that attach to these studies, In particular, the links between specific policies and outcomes

are not examined. And policy retorm is measured simply by a dummy vanable that takes the value of

unity when a country has received a SAL.

    The argument for getting prices right is predicated on the existence of a non-negligible supply

response to price changes. With respect to exports, the evidence would appear to be clear: a credftile,

and lasting effort to increase the supply-price of exportables is rewarded by a large, often very quick

export response. The export pertormance of Korea and Taiwan during the 19605 had already turned

elasticity pessimiam on its head. More recent experience has given additional reason to be confident

about the presence of e strong supply response in exports. In countries where export profitability has

been increased in a sustained fashion, export miracles have soon followed: aen, for exanple, Hachetta

 (1991) on Chile, Krueger and Aktan 0992) on Turkey, and Lardy (1992) on China Even in Eastern

 Europe, wtere low-quality manufactures were long judged unmarketable in Western markets, a turn tc

 undervalued exchange rates in 1990-91 (alongside the collapse of domestic demand) has yielded a

 large increase in exports to the West (see Rodrik, forthcoming).

    However, as this last example indicates, export booms have generally been associated with sharp

 currency devaluations and, ocaaaionally, export subsidies. Export processing zones have also played a

 critical role in some other more narrowly-based casesl electronic components in Malaysia, garments in

 Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and the maquiladora in Mexico (Hellainer, 1992b). It is more difficult to

 identify cases where import liberalization itself was causally implicated: Chile may be the cnly significant

 exception, but even here the effects were delayed well unfl the exchange rate began to play a

 supportive role in the mid-1960s The Lamer symmetry theorem is a poor guide tor the short-run,
                                                       51
  especially when the economy is mired i macroeconomic instability,

      One of the striking regularities in the export performance of these countries has been that, once a

  decisive increase in exports is achieved, the process tends to be setf-perpetuating even when the

  originally advantageous circumstances reverse themsetves somewhat, In Korea and Turkey, exports

  have been affected during periods of prolonged real appreciation, but have not come crashing down

  This suggests that export performance is subject to strong hysteresis effects: it may take a big push

  (i.e.. sizable change in incentives) to get exports out, but by the same token, once the transition is

 made, not much may be required to keep then going. A rare gtimpse into the microeconomics of the

 exporting decision is provided in a paper by Roberts and Tybout (1992). The authors carry out a

 statistical analysis of plant-level data from Colombia, and look for evidence of sunk costs and hysteresis

 in the decision of plants to export. They find strong persistence, in the sense that the exporting status

 of a firm exerts an inordinate influence on the future decision to export

     In poorer, agricultural countries such as those in Africa, the supply response may be considerably

 more limited than in Latin American or Asian countries. For one thing, agricultural supply elasticities are

 necessarily tow in the short run. A survey of the aggregate supply response in agriculture suggests that

 long-run pnce etasticites of supply may be In the range of 0.3-0.9, with poorer countries at the tower

end of this range (Chhibber, 1990). Infrastructure constraints appear to be a key bottleneck The sharp

increse in cocoa outpul in Ghana following the price reforms of 1983 would sem to belie this conclusion

However, a significant (perhaps a third) of the increase in output can be attributed to previously

smuggled exports now showing in offcial statistics (Green, 1989). This example suggests that the true

supply elasticity can be overstated when the presence of unoftical markets prior to reform are not taken

into account. Also in Ghana, Steel and Webster (1991) have found some limited evidence of industrial

restructuring at the firm level (msinly in product mix), but further adjustment has apparently beeeri

blocked by inadequate demand and lack of credil.

   A healthy export response can be entirely consistent with sluggish industrial restructuring, if firms

simply choose (and have the incentive) to substitute foreign markets for domestic markets. In Eastern
                                                    52

Europe, where structural change is badly needed to get away from Soviet-style industriaizatiorr, the

early evidence is that reform policies have not been able to foster much restructuring. There is some

evidence that the much-repressed services sector has revived somewhat (Berg and Sachs, 1991). But,

as of the middle of 1992, there was scant evidence of restructuring within manufacturing industry

(Estdn, Schaffer, and Singh, 1992; commander and Codoelli, 1992; Bcrensztein, Demokas, and Ostry,

1992). The reasons appear to be labor-hoarding by enterprises and the governments' reluctance to let

large firms go bankrupt. in addition, the increase in exports to the West has ameliorated, but not

entirety offset, the huge fall in industrial output that followed reform efforts. Hughes and Hare (1992)

report, moreover, that the shift towards exports in the Eastern European countries has not noticably

pulled resources into the more competitive industries (as measured by domestic resource costs).

8.2 Consequences for static and dynamic efficiency

   Evaluating the efficiency consequences of policy reforms is s difficult task, and ore that differs

considerably from model-based analyses of prospective reform. One needs s countertactual regarding

what would have happened in the absence of reform, and to disentangle the effects of the reform under

consideration from the effects of other ohenges in the environment. To render a welfare judgement,

one needs in addition a set of shadow prices to value the change in the quantities of outputs and

inputs. Even if all these obstacles are surmounted, there is the difficulty or figuring out exactly what has

happened. Here is Leroy Jones (1991) on evaluating divestiture:

        An sti too typical story of divestiture runs as foitows: visit country X and be told that enterprise V

        is a divestiture success story with vastly enhanced profitability; visit company Y and be shown

        how costs have been reduced and demsnd increased by a vsdety of impressive management

        reforms; visit the political opposition and be told that profits were turned around primarily

        because of a side-condition of divestiture that competing imports be banned for five years. (p.

         129)

Such difficulties have not stopped Jones and his colleagues from evaluating the welfare consequences

recent pdvatizstion efforts (Calal etsl., 1992). Their study is a rare and exemplary effort to apply a
                                                      53

common methodology to reforms in diferent countries. Their analysis of twelve cases from Chile,

Malaysia, Mexcio, and the U.K. reveals that 10 of them improved national welfare and 11 improved

world welfare. Moreover, the welfare gains appear quantitatively significant.

   The productivity consequences of Chins's reforms since the late 1970s have been the subject of a

series of papers by Dollar (1990), Jefferson (1990), and Jefferson, Rawsk', and Zheng (1992). Dollar

(1990) hnds that Chins's incentive reforms have led to rapid TFP growth and a reduction in TFP

differentials across firms. Moreover, he finds that TFP growth was positively correlated with the shsre

of profits that firms were allowed to retain. Jefferson (1990) draws attention to the pronounced increase

in 1FF in the iron and steel Industry during the reForm years, while Jefferson etsl. (1992) argue that

factor accumulation—mainly in material inputs—was still the principal contr4bulor to aggregate growth in

the state and collective sector.

    The most systematic evidence to date on the efficiency consequences of trade reform comes from a

research project ted by James Tybout at the World Bank Tybout and his collaborators have

assembled panel data sets From several developing countries, and have subjected them to statistical

analysis, paying close attention to conceptual and econometric issues. Tybout (1992) provides a

progress report, and links this research to antecedents. Three questions have been addressed in

particular: (I) has trade liberalization led to reduced price-cost margins in import-competing sectors? (ii)

has it resulted in firms taking better advantage of scale economies through industry rationalization? (iii)

has it led to improvements in technical efficiency?

    On the first question, Foroutsn (1992), Levinsohn (1992), Harrison (1990), and Grether (1992)

provide an affirmative answer. The first two authors analyze the Turkish case, where a substantial

trade reform took place during the 1980s. In a three-digit industry-level analysis with panel data,



        On the more recent evidence, see also Helleiner (1992b, p. 44) who summanzes the results of
seventeen country studies he directed in the following terms: "The case studies in this volume otter very
weak, if any, support For the proposition that either import liberatzstion or esport espansion are particularly
associated with overall productivity growth."
                                                       54

  Foroutan finds that higher import penetration is correlated with lower price-cost markups (controlling for

  capital-output ratios and fixed effects). Levinsoho undertakes a plant-level version of Foroutan's

  exercise. Also instead of using import penetration as the independent variable, he looks at the
                                                                                                        charge
  after 1984, the year that major trade retorm was implemented. His finding is that price-cost
                                                                                                   gaps
 decreased irt imperfectly competitive induatriea which experienced a decrease in protection, while they

 increased or stayed the same in others. Harrison undertakes an anatyala very much like Levinaohn'x

 for Cole D'lvoiro, and reachea broadly similar concluaions. Finally, Grether looks at both plant- and

 industry-level panel data from Mexico, and concludes that price-cost margins were reduced by the trade

 reforms of the 1980a; the relaxation of quarbitative reatrictiona was apparently particularly
                                                                                                 effective, as
 trade theory would predict.

     With regard to industry rationalization, the reautts are leaa encouraging. tybout (19e9) carries out

 ftn analysis of plant level data from Chile for the 1979-85 period, and finds no relationship between

 import competition and exit ralea. Roberts and Tybout (1991) examine annual plant-level data from

 Chile and Colombia, and find that, controlling for industry and country effects, higher trade exposure is

positively correlated with smaller plant sizes over the long run. Further, the mix of high and low

productivity plants is not strongly axaociated with trade exposure. As Roberta and Tyboul indicate,

 'both of thexe findings cast doubt on the mechanisms linking trade, plant size, and productivily in a

number of recent analytical and simulation atudies (1991, p 2). Similar results are obtained in Tybout

and Weatbrook's (1992b) study on the Mexican liberalization: "We find that scale effects were only

significant for a minority of industries during the sample period [1984-89], and that improvements in

scale effloency were jp associated with heightened foreign competition" (p. 1). A possibly dissenting

conclusion is reached in Dutz'a (1991) study on Morocco. Dutz finds that the probability of exit in

response to an increase in imports ix significantly higher among small firms than among large firms;

together with his evidence that large firms are more efficient, this may suggest an improvement in

average technical efficiency following liberalization. This concission needs to be tentative, however,

since the focus should be on net rather than mss exit rates.
                                                         55

    Finally, the available studies are generally favorable to the hypothesis that trade reform is conducive

to gains in technical efficiency. Foroutan (1992) reports that growth in import penetration is correlated

with growth in TFP in Turkey. Tybout             (1q91) find in Chile that performance in TEP was better in

industries that experienced the largest declines in protection. Similarly, industries undergoing the most

dramatic reductions in protection in Mexico improved their efficiency the most (Tybout and Westbrook,

1992b; but see also the mixed results obtained by Grether, 1992). On the other hand, Harrison's (1990)

results on Cote d'lvoire fail to uncover a similar link once imperfect competition is explicitly allowed for:

"our data suggest that when we incorporate imperfect competition into the productivity estimates [which

are biased if perfect competition is assumedi, there is no apparent relationship between productivity and

trade reform" (p. 25).



9, Conclusions: What ve know and what            don't

    Few would disagree with the proposition that getting prices systematically and significantly wrong in

the way that import-substituting countries have done in the past has been a costly mistake, But few

would also disagree that getting prices right, in and ol itself, will be insuffticient to make Bolivia or

Ghana grow at Korean rates. A cautious conclusion From the literature surveyed here would be as

follows: the benefits of price reform remain small in relation to developmental objectives, and tend to be

linked to economic growth through uncertain and unreliable channels. Furthermore, the East Asian

experience indicates that relative-price distortions, and the analysis thereof, are vastly over-emphasized

relative to the institutional dimensions of reform. It bears repeating that the South Korean and

Taiwanese economies have prospered in policy environments characterized by quantitative trade

restrictions, selective subsidies, and discretionary incentives bearing more than a passing superficial

resemblance to those in other developing countries. What has differed, of course, is the discipline

eserted by the East Asian state over private-sector groups. It also bears repealing that countries like

Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia have travelled recently much faster and further on the road to

price reform and trade liberalization than South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan before them ever did.
                                                     56
    Genuine reform requires the creation of a new set of interactions between government and the

private sector, one that provides for an environment of policy stability and predictability, that

discourages rent-seeking activities, and that improves on the governments' ability to discipline the

private sector. In other words, the change that ia needed is not only in policy, but also in policy rnujn.

The East Asian experience Is full of clues as to what the end-product should look like, But we know

much less about how to get there. Economists' comparative advsntage may lie in analyzing price

distortions; but it is research on Issues of governance and institutional design that promises to yield the

larger marginal social product.
