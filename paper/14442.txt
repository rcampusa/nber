Teacher Quality in Educational Production: Tracking, Decay, and Student Achievement

                                             ABSTRACT

Growing concerns over the achievement of U.S. students have led to proposals to reward good teachers
and penalize (or fire) bad ones. The leading method for assessing teacher quality is "value added"
modeling (VAM), which decomposes students' test scores into components attributed to student heterogeneity
and to teacher quality. Implicit in the VAM approach are strong assumptions about the nature of the
educational production function and the assignment of students to classrooms. In this paper, I develop
falsification tests for three widely used VAM specifications, based on the idea that future teachers
cannot influence students' past achievement. In data from North Carolina, each of the VAMs' exclusion
restrictions are dramatically violated. In particular, these models indicate large "effects" of 5th grade
teachers on 4th grade test score gains. I also find that conventional measures of individual teachers'
value added fade out very quickly and are at best weakly related to long-run effects.

1 Introduction

Parallel literatures in labor economics and education adopt similar econometric strategies for
identifying the effects of firms on wages and of teachers on student test scores. Outcomes are
modeled as the sum of the firm or teacher effect, individual heterogeneity, and transitory, or-

thogonal error. The resulting estimates of firm effects are used to gauge the relative importance
of firm and worker heterogeneity in the determination of wages. In education, so-called “value
added models” (hereafter, VAMs) have been used to measure the importance of teacher qual-
ity to educational production, to assess teacher preparation and certification programs, and as

important inputs to personnel evaluations and merit pay programs.1
    All of these applications suppose that the estimates can be interpreted causally. But ob-
servational analyses can identify causal effects only under unverifiable assumptions about the
correlation between treatment assignment – the assignment of students to teachers, or the match-

ing of workers to firms – and other determinants of test scores and wages. If these assumptions
do not hold, the resulting estimates of teacher and firm effects are likely to be quite misleading.
    Anecdotally, assignments of students to teachers incorporate matching to take advantage
of teachers’ particular specialties, intentional separation of children who are known to interact
badly, efforts on the principal’s part to reward favored teachers through the allocation of easy-to-

teach students, and parental requests (see, e.g., Jacob and Lefgren, 2007; Monk, 1987). These
are difficult to model statistically. Instead, VAMs typically impose an assumption that teacher
assignments are random conditional on a single (observed or latent) factor.
    In this paper, I develop and implement tests of the exclusion restrictions of commonly-

used value added specifications. My strategy exploits the fact that future teachers and firms
cannot have causal effects on past outcomes, while violations of model assumptions may lead to
apparent counterfactual “effects” of this form. Both test scores and wages are serially correlated,
and as a result an association between the current teacher or firm and the lagged outcome is

strong evidence against exogeneity with respect to the current outcome.
   I examine three commonly used VAMs, two of which have direct parallels in the firm ef-
fects literature. In the simplest, most widely used VAM – which resembles the most common
specification for firm effects – the necessary exclusion restriction is that teacher assignments

are orthogonal to all other determinants of the so-called “gain” score, the change in a student’s
test score over the course of the year. If this restriction holds, 5th grade teacher assignments
should not be correlated with students’ gains in 4th grade. Using a large micro-data set de-
scribing North Carolina elementary students, I find that there is in fact substantial dispersion of
students’ 4th grade gains across 5th grade teachers. Students are particularly strongly sorted on

the basis of past reading gains, though there is clear evidence of sorting on math gains as well.
Because test scores exhibit strong mean reversion – and thus gains are negatively autocorrelated
– sorting on past gains produces bias in the simple VAM’s estimates.
   The other VAMs that I consider rely on different exclusion restrictions, namely that class-

room assignments are as good as random conditional on either the lagged test score or the
student’s (unobserved, but permanent) ability. I discuss how past gains can be used to test these
restrictions as well. I find strong evidence in the data against each.
   Evidently, classroom assignments respond dynamically to annual achievement in ways that

are not captured by the controls typically included in VAM specifications. To evaluate the
magnitude of the biases that assignments produce, I compare common VAMs to a saturated
model that conditions on the complete achievement history. Estimated teacher effects from the
saturated model diverge importantly from those obtained from the VAMs in common use. I
discuss how selection on unobservables is likely to produce substantial additional biases.

   My estimates also point to an important substantive result. To the extent that any of the
VAMs that I consider identify causal effects, they indicate that teachers’ long-run effects are at
best weakly proxied by their immediate impacts. A teacher’s effect in the year of exposure –
the universal focus of value added analyses – is correlated only 0.3 to 0.5 with her cumulative

effect over two years, and even less with her effect over three years. Accountability policies that


                                                 3
rely on measures of short-term value added are likely to do a poor job of rewarding the teachers
who are best for students’ longer run outcomes.
   An important caveat to the empirical results is that they may be specific to North Carolina.
Students in other states or in individual school districts might be assigned to classrooms in ways

that satisfy the assumptions required for common VAMs. And the results may not generalize to
models of firm effects on worker wages. But at the least, VAM-style analyses should attempt
to evaluate the model assumptions, perhaps with methods like those used here. Models that
rely on incorrect assumptions about the assignment of students to teachers and the matching of
workers to firms cannot support their intended uses. Policies that use VAM-based estimates in

hiring, firing, and compensation decisions may reward and punish teachers for the students they
are assigned as much as for their actual effectiveness in the classroom.
   Section 2 reviews prior work that uses pre-assignment variables to test exogeneity assump-
tions. Section 3 introduces the three VAMs, discusses their implicit assumptions, and describes

my proposed tests. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 presents results. Section 6 attempts
to quantify the biases that non-random classroom assignments produce in VAM-based analyses.
Section 7 presents evidence on teachers’ long-run effects. Section 8 concludes.



2 Using Panel Data To Test Exclusion Restrictions

A central assumption in all econometric studies of treatment effects is that the treatment is
uncorrelated with other determinants of the outcome, conditional on covariates. Although the
assumption is ultimately untestable – the “fundamental problem of causal inference” (Holland,
1986) – the data can provide indications that it is unlikely to hold. In experiments, for exam-

ple, significant correlations between treatment and pre-assignment variables are interpreted as
evidence that randomization was unsuccessful. Similar tests are often used in non-experimental
analyses: Researchers conducting propensity score matching studies frequently check for “bal-
ance” of covariates conditional on the propensity score (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1984), and



                                                4
analogous tests are used in regression discontinuity analyses (Imbens and Lemieux, 2008).
    Panel data can be particularly useful. A correlation between treatment and some pre-
assignment variable X need not indicate bias in the estimated treatment effect if X is uncor-
related with the outcome variable of interest. But outcomes are typically correlated within

individuals over time, so an association between treatment and the lagged outcome strongly
suggests that the treatment is not exogenous with respect to post-treatment outcomes. This in-
sight has been most fully explored in the literature on the effect of job training on wages and
employment. Today’s wage or employment status is quite informative about tomorrow’s, even
after controlling for all observables. Evidence that assignment to job training is correlated with

lagged wage dynamics indicates that simple specifications for the effect of training on outcomes
are likely to yield biased estimates (Ashenfelter, 1978). Richer models of the training assign-
ment process may absorb this correlation while permitting identification (Heckman et al., 1987).
But even these models may impose testable restrictions on the relationship between treatment

and the outcome history (Ashenfelter and Card, 1985; Card and Sullivan, 1988; Jacobson et
al., 1993). Of course, these sorts of tests cannot diagnose all model violations. If treatment
assignments depend on unobserved determinants of future outcomes that are uncorrelated with
the outcome history, the treatment effect estimator may be biased even though treatment is

uncorrelated with past outcomes.
    In studies of teacher productivity, the multiplicity of teacher “treatments” can blur the con-
nection between value added modeling and program evaluation methods. But the utility of past
outcomes for specification diagnostics carries over directly. Identification of a teacher’s effect
rests on assumptions about the relationship between the teacher assignment and the other deter-

minants of future achievement, and the relationship with past achievement can be informative
about the plausibility of these assumptions.2
   2 Only a few studies have attempted to validate VAMs. Jacob and Lefgren (2008) and Harris and Sass (2007)

show that value added estimates are correlated with principals’ ratings of teacher performance. And Kane and
Staiger (2008) demonstrate that VAMs estimated on observational data predict teachers’ experimental effects.
These studies are extremely valuable, but they cannot rule out quantitatively important biases coming from non-
random classroom assignments. The estimated correlations between principal ratings and value added are relatively
weak, and the Kane and Staiger experimental sample is too small (and potentially non-representative) to rule out

3 Statistical Model and Methods

3.1 Defining the Problem

I take the parameter of interest in value added modeling to be the effect on a student’s test
score at the end of grade g of being assigned to a particular grade-g classroom rather than
another classroom at the same school. Later, I extend this to look at dynamic treatment effects
(that is, the effect of the grade-g classroom on the g + s score). I do not distinguish between
classroom and teacher effects, and use the terms interchangably. In the Appendix, I consider

this distinction, defining a teacher’s effect as the time-invariant component of the effects of the
classrooms taught by the teacher over several years.
    I am interested in whether common VAMs identify classroom effects with arbitrarily large
samples. I therefore sidestep small sample issues. Under realistic asymptotics, the number of

classrooms should rise in proportion to the number of students. If so, classroom effects are not
identified under any exogeneity restrictions: Even in the asymptotic limit, the number of stu-
dents per teacher remains finite and the sampling error in an individual teacher’s effect remains
non-trivial. I instead consider the properties of VAM estimates as the number of students grows

with the number of teachers (and classrooms) fixed. If classroom effects are identified under
these unrealistic asymptotics, VAMs may be usable in compensation and retention policy with
appropriate allowances for the sampling errors that arise with finite class sizes;3 if not, these
corrections are likely to go awry.
    A final important distinction is between identification of the variance of teacher quality and

the identification of individual teachers’ effects. I focus exclusively on the latter. As it is im-
practical to report each of several thousand teachers’ estimated effects, I report only summaries
of their distribution across teachers. I select statistics, like the estimated standard deviation
of 5th grade teachers’ effects on students’ 4th grade achievement, that are informative about
any but the most extreme alternatives regarding classroom assignments.
    3 A typical approach shrinks a teacher’s estimated effect toward the population mean in proportion to the degree

of imprecision in the estimate. The resulting empirical Bayes estimate is the best linear predictor of the teacher’s
true effect, given the noisy estimate. See, McCaffrey et al. (2003), pp. 63-68.

3.2 Data Generating Process and the Three VAMs

Following Todd and Wolpin (2003) and Harris and Sass (2006), student achievement can be
modeled as a linear, additive function of the full history of inputs received to date plus the

student’s innate ability. Separating classroom effects from other inputs, we can write the test
score of student i at the end of grade g, Aig , as

                                             g                         g
                             Aig = αg + ∑ βhgc(i,h) + µi τg + ∑ εih φhg + vig .                                    (1)
                                           h=1                       h=1


Here, βhgc is the effect of being in classroom c in grade h on the grade-g test score, and c (i, h) ∈
{1, . . ., Jh } indexes the classroom to which student i is assigned in grade h. µi is individual

ability. We might expect the achievement gap between high-ability and low-ability students to
grow over time; this would correspond to τg+s > τg for each g and each s > 0. εih captures
all other inputs in grade h, including those received from the family, non-classroom peers, and
the community. It might also include developmental factors: A precocious child might have
positive ε s in early grades and negative ε s in later grades as her classmates catch up. As this

example shows, ε is quite likely to be serially correlated within students across grades. Finally,
vig represents measurement error in the grade-g test relative to the student’s “true” grade-g
achievement. This is independent across grades within students.5
    A convenient restriction on the time pattern of classroom effects is uniform geometric decay,
                  0
βhg0 c = βhgc λ g −g for some 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 and all h ≤ g < g0 . A special case is λ = 1, corresponding
to perfect persistence. Although my results do not depend on these restrictions, I impose them
as needed for notational simplicity. I consider non-uniform decay in Section 7. Note that there
   4 Rivkin   et al. (2005) develop a strategy for identifying the variance of teachers’ effects, but not the effect of
individual teachers, under weaker assumptions than are required by the VAMs described below.
    5 I define the β parameters to include any classroom-level component of v and assume that v is independent
                                                                                 ig                  ig
across students in the same classroom. The Appendix discusses the use of repeated observations on teachers to
distinguish correlated errors from teachers’ true causal effects.

is no theoretical basis for restrictions on the time pattern of non-classroom effects (i.e. on φhg ).
    It will be useful to adopt some simplifying notation. Let ωig ≡ ∑h=1 εih φhg be the composite
                                                                                     g


grade-g residual achievement, and let ∆ indicate first differences across student grades: ∆βhgc ≡
βhgc − βh,g−1,c , ∆τg ≡ τg − τg−1 , ∆ωig ≡ ωig − ωig−1 , and so on.
    Tractable VAMs amount to decompositions of Aig (or of ∆Aig ≡ Aig − Aig−1 ) into the current
teacher effect βggc(i,g) , a student heterogeneity component, and an error assumed to be orthogo-
nal to the classroom assignment. Models differ in the form of this decomposition. In this paper I
consider three specifications: A simple regression of gain scores on grade and contemporaneous
classroom indicators,


VAM1: ∆Aig = αg + βggc(i, g) + e1ig ;


an augmented regression that controls for the prior year’s score,


VAM2: ∆Aig = αg + Aig−1 ψ + βggc(i, g) + e2ig ;6


and a regression that stacks gain scores from several grades and adds student fixed effects,


VAM3: ∆Aig = αg + βggc(i, g) + µi + e3ig .


All three VAMs are widely used.7 VAM2 and VAM3 can both be seen as generalizations of

VAM1: VAM2 is equivalent to VAM1 when ψ = 0, while VAM3 reduces to VAM1 when
µi ≡ 0.
    Despite their similarity, the three VAMs rely on quite distinct restrictions on the process by
which students are assigned to classrooms. I discuss the three in turn.
   6 VAM2    is more commonly specified as an equivalent model for the end-of-year score, Aig = αg +
Aig−1 (ψ + 1) + βggc(i, g) + e2ig. Relative to this, the expression in the text merely subtracts Aig−1 from each side. I
focus on the gain score version to maintain the parallel with VAM1 and VAM3.
   7 The most widely used VAM, the Tennessee Value Added Assessment System (TVAAS; see Sanders et al.,

1997), is specified as a mixed model for level scores that depend on the full history of classroom assignments,
but this model implies an equation for annual gain scores of the form used in VAM1. VAM2 is more widely
used in the recent economics literature. See, for example, Aaronson et al. (2007); Kane et al. (2006); Jacob and
Lefgren (2008); and Goldhaber (2007). VAM3 was proposed by Boardman and Murnane (1979), and has been
used recently by Rivkin et al. (2005); Harris and Sass (2006); Jacob and Lefgren (2008); and Boyd et al. (2007).

3.3 The gain score model (VAM1)

Differencing the production function (1), we can write the grade-g gain score as

                                      g−1
                    ∆Aig = ∆αg + ∑ ∆βhgc(i,h) + βggc(i,g) + µi ∆τg + ∆ωig + ∆vig .                               (2)
                                      h=1


If we assume that teacher effects do not decay, ∆βhgc = 0 for all h < g. The error term e1ig from

VAM1 then has three components:


                                         e1ig = µi ∆τg + ∆ωig + ∆vig .                                           (3)


VAM1 will yield consistent estimates of the grade-g classroom effects if and only if, for each c,

                                                                
                                            E e1ig | c (i, g) = c = 0.                                           (4)


Differences in last year’s gains across this year’s classrooms are informative about this restric-
tion. Using (2), the average g − 1 gain in classroom c is:


 E ∆Aig−1 | c (i, g) = c = ∆αg−1 + E βg−1,g−1,c(i, g−1) | c (i, g) = c + E e1ig−1 | c (i, g) = c .
                                                                                           

                                                                                                                 (5)
The first term is constant across c and can be neglected. The second term might vary with
c if (for example) a principal compensates for a bad teacher assignment in grade g − 1 with
assignment to a better-than-average teacher in grade g. This can be absorbed by examining

the across-c (i, g) variation in ∆Aig−1 controlling for c (i, g − 1). I estimate specifications of
this form below.8 Any remaining variation across grade-g classrooms in g − 1 gains, after
controlling for g − 1 classroom assignments, must indicate that students are sorted into grade-g
   8 This strategy has zero power unless there is independent variation in c (i, g − 1) and c (i, g). If students are
“streamed,” moving together with the same classmates from grade to grade, controls for c (i, g − 1) will absorb all
across-c (i, g) variation. In the Tennessee STAR experiment (see Nye et al., 2004), streaming was quite common,
and in many schools there is zero independent variation in 3rd grade classroom assignments controlling for 2nd
grade assignments. This makes it impossible to distinguish the effects of 2nd and 3rd grade teachers, and prevents
the use of my test. In the observational data examined below, students are substantially reshuffled between grades.

classrooms on the basis of e1ig−1 .
    Whether this would indicate a problem with assumption (4) depends on whether e1ig is
serially correlated. Equation (2) indicates four sources of potential serial correlation. First,
ability appears in both e1ig and e1ig−1 (unless ∆τg = 0). Second, the εig process may be serially

correlated. Third, even if ε is white noise, ∆ωig is a moving average process of order g − 1
(absent strong restrictions on the φ coefficients). Finally, ∆vig is an MA(1), degenerate only if
var (v) = 0.9
    The discussion of serial correlation in e1ig helps clarify the conditions in which (4) will
likely hold. The most natural model that is consistent with (4) is for assignments to depend

only on student ability, µi , and for ability to have the same effect on achievement in grades
g and g − 1 (i.e., ∆τg = 0). With these restrictions, VAM1 can be seen as the first-difference
estimator for a fixed effects model, with strict exogeneity of classroom assignments conditional
on µi . By contrast, (4) is not likely to hold if c (i, g) depends, even in part, on ωig−1 , vig−1 , or

Aig−1 .


3.4 The lagged score model (VAM2)

VAM2 augments VAM1 with a control for the lagged test score. If teacher effects decay geo-
metrically at uniform rate 1 − λ , the grade-g score can be written in terms of the g − 1 score:


 Aig = αg − αg−1 λ + Aig−1 λ + βggc(i, g) + µi τg − τg−1 λ + ωig − ωig−1 λ + vig − vig−1 λ , (6)
                                                         



and the grade-g gain is thus


                                    ∆Aig = α̌g + Aig−1 ψ + βggc(i, g) + e2ig                         (7)
   9 Rothstein   (2008b) concludes that ∆vig accounts for as much as 80% of the variance of ∆Aig .

As before, each of the terms in (8) is likely to be serially correlated. The VAM2 exclusion
                                 
restriction, E e2ig | c (i, g) = c = 0, would hold if grade-g classroom assignments were random
conditional on Aig−1 . It is unlikely to hold if assignments depend directly on e2ig−1 or on any
of its components. In particular, c (i, g) cannot depend on µi except through Aig−1 .10

    The VAM2 exclusion restriction can again be evaluated by replacing the dependent variable,
∆Aig , with its lag, ∆Aig−1 . By (6), the lagged score equals


                          Aig−1 = α̌ig−1 + Aig−2 λ + βg−1,g−1,c(i,g−1) + e2ig−1 .                               (9)

This can be rearranged to express the g − 1 gain in terms of the g − 1 score and classroom:

                                 1 
                   ∆Aig−1 =          α̌ig−1 − Aig−1 ψ + βg−1,g−1,c(i,g−1) + e2ig−1 .
                                                                                  
                                                                                                              (10)
                                1+ψ

Thus, the grade-g classroom assignment will have predictive power for the gain score in grade
g − 1, controlling for g − 1 achievement, if grade-g classrooms are correlated either with grade-

g − 1 teacher effects (i.e. with βg−1,g−1,c(i,g−1) ) or with e2ig−1 . As in VAM1, the former can be
ruled out by controlling for g − 1 classroom assignments; the latter would indicate a violation
of the VAM2 exclusion restriction if e2 is serially correlated.
  10 If τ − τ
         g    g−1 λ is constant across g, (6) can be seen as a fixed effects model with a lagged dependent variable.
IV and GMM estimates of the first-difference of (6), treating ∆Aig−1 as an endogenous variable, can identify λ
and βgg if c (i, g) depends on µi but is strictly exogenous conditional on this (Anderson and Hsiao, 1981; Arellano
and Bond, 1991). Koedel and Betts (2007) is the only teacher value added study of which I am aware that takes
account of the issues raised by lagged dependent variables. Value added researchers typically apply OLS to (7).
This is inconsistent for ψ , and identifies βggc only if c (i, g) is random conditional on Aig−1 .

3.5 The fixed effects in gains model (VAM3)

The final VAM returns to the earlier assumption of zero decay of teachers’ effects.11 It incor-
porates the ability term in (2) into the estimating equation,



                                   ∆Aig = ∆αg + βggc(i,g) + µi ∆τg + e3ig ,                                      (11)

leaving only two components in the error term, e3ig = ∆ωig + ∆vig .

    The presence of the student fixed effect in VAM3, combined with the small time dimension
of student data sets, means that VAM3 requires stronger assumptions than the earlier models.
Assuming that ∆τg = 1 for each g, (11) is a fixed effects model. An OLS regression with fixed
effects is numerically equivalent to a regression of the de-meaned outcome on the de-meaned

explanatory variables. The de-meaned grade-g gain is:


                           !                         !                !
      1 G            1 G                 1 G                  1 G
∆Aig − ∑ ∆Aih = ∆αg − ∑ ∆αh + βggc(i,g) − ∑ βhhc(i,h) + e3ig − ∑ e3ih .
      G h=1          G h=1               G h=1                G h=1
                                                                    (12)
The equation for the de-meaned gain score thus has a grade-specific intercept and coefficients

for all classroom assignments in grades 1 through G. Importantly, the error terms from all
grades enter into (12). Thus, correlation between the classroom assignment in one grade and
the error term in that or any other grade would bias the estimated β coefficients, even in large
samples. To avoid bias, teacher assignments must be strictly exogenous conditional on µi .                       12


    Conditional strict exogeneity means that the same information, µi or some function of it, is

used to make teacher assignments in each grade. This requires, in effect, that principals decide
  11 While   VAM1 and VAM2 can easily be generalized to allow for non-uniform decay, VAM3 cannot.
  12 As  G gets large, G1 shrinks toward zero, and e3ih disappears from the equation for the de-meaned grade-g gain,
g 6= h. For practical value added implementations, however, G is rarely larger than three or four. Without strict
exogeneity, one small-G approach is to focus on the first difference of (11). When G > 2, OLS estimation of the
first-differenced equation requires only that c (i, g) be uncorrelated with e3ig−1 , e3ig , and e3ig+1 . Though this is
weaker than strict exogeneity, it is difficult to imagine an assignment process that would satisfy one but not the
other. Another option is IV/GMM (see note 10), instrumenting for both the g and g − 1 classroom assignments.
Satisfactory instruments are not apparent.



                                                         12
on classroom assignments for the remainder of a child’s career before she starts kindergarten. If
teacher assignments are updated each year in response to the student’s performance during the
previous year, strict exogeneity is violated.
    The extension of my test to the strict exogeneity assumption in VAM3 is a direct application

of Chamberlain’s (1984) correlated random effects model. Under strict exogeneity, any apparent
effect of (for example) 5th grade teachers on 4th grade gains in VAM1 appears only because
both 5th grade teacher assignments and 4th grade gains depend on µ . 3rd grade gains also
depend on the scalar µi . So 5th grade teachers who appear to have positive effects on 4th grade
gains – because they are assigned high-µ students – should also appear to have positive effects

on 3rd grade gains. An indication that a 5th grade teacher has different effects on 3rd and 4th
grade gains would thus imply that omitted time-varying determinants of gains are correlated
with teacher assignments, and therefore that assignments are not strictly exogenous.
    Formally, consider a projection of µ onto the full sequence of classroom assignments:


                                   µi = ξ1c(i,1) + . . . + ξGc(i,G) + ηi .                             (13)


ξhc is the incremental information about µi provided by the knowledge that the student was in
classroom c in grade h, conditional on classroom assignments in all other grades. Substituting
(13) into (11), we obtain

                                                  G
                                ∆Aig = ∆αg + ∑ πhgc(i,h) + ηi + e3ig ,                                 (14)
                                                 h=1

where πggc = ξgc ∆τg + βggc and πhgc = ξhc ∆τg for h 6= g. Under conditional strict exogeneity,
E [e3ih | c (i, 1) , . . . , c (i, G)] = 0 for each h, and the fact that (13) is a linear projection ensures

that ηi is uncorrelated with the regressors as well. An OLS regression of grade-g gains onto
classroom indicators in grades 1 through G thus estimates the πhgc coefficients without bias.

∆τ1 and ∆τ2 are scalars, so (15) represents J3 −1 overidentifying restrictions on the 2J3 elements
of the π31 and π32 vectors.13
    Equation (15) implies that the elements of π31 should be perfectly correlated with the corre-

sponding elements of π32 (or, if ∆τ1/∆τ2 < 0, perfectly negatively correlated), so the correlation
between elements of the estimated coefficient vectors π̂31 and π̂32 should be close to 1 (or -1).

is distributed χ 2 with J3 − 1 degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis of strict exogeneity.14
If D is above the 95% critical value from this distribution, the null is rejected. In practice,

implementations of VAM3 treat µi as a fixed effect, thus imposing the additional restriction that
∆τ2 = ∆τ1 . Under the null that this model is correct, the restricted D has J3 degrees of freedom.


3.6 Implementation and Computation

To put the three VAMs in the best possible light, I focus on estimation of within-school differ-

ences in classroom effects. For many purposes, one might want to make across-school com-
parisons. But students are not randomly assigned to schools, and those at one school may gain
  13 There  are J1 additional overidentifying restrictions created by a similar proportionality relationship between
π12 and π13 : Past teachers should have similar effects on all future grades’ gains. These restrictions might fail
either because strict exogeneity is violated or because teachers’ effects decay (that is, β12 6= β13 ). I therefore focus
on restrictions on the future teacher coefficients, as these provide sharper tests of strict exogeneity.
   14 Although there are J − 2 parameters to be estimated, they are underidentified: Multiplying ξ by a constant
                           3                                                                              3
and dividing ∆τ1 and ∆τ2 by the same constant does not change the fit. In the implementation, I normalize ∆τ1 = 1.



                                                          14
systematically faster than those at another for reasons unrelated to teacher quality. Random as-
signment to classrooms within schools is at least somewhat plausible. To isolate within-school
variation, I augment each of the estimating equations discussed above with a set of indicators
for the school attended. The indicators for all of the classrooms at a school are collinear with

the indicator for the school, and I normalize the classroom coefficients to have mean zero across
classrooms in the same grade at the same school.15
    The tables below report summary statistics for the teacher coefficients rather than the full
coefficient vectors themselves. Due to sampling error, summary statistics computed from the
estimated coefficients differ from those that would be obtained were the true coefficients known.

Aaronson et al. (2007) propose a simple estimator for the variance of the true coefficients across
teachers. Let γ be a mean-zero J-vector of true projection coefficients – those that would be
obtained with an infinitely large sample – and let γ̂ be an unbiased finite-sample estimate of
γ , with E [γ 0 (γ̂ − γ )] = 0. The variance (across elements) of γ can be written as the difference
between the variance of the estimated coefficients and the sampling variance:


                                  E γ 0 γ = E γ̂ 0 γ̂ − E (γ̂ − γ )0 (γ̂ − γ ) .
                                                                         
                                                                                                               (17)


I compute E [γ̂ 0 γ̂ ] using a degrees-of-freedom adjustment for the school-level normalization of
the estimated coefficients; E (γ̂ − γ )0 (γ̂ − γ ) is merely the average sampling variance of the
                                                 

normalized coefficients. All calculations are weighted by the number of students taught.

    Some of the specifications discussed above – particularly (14) – include indicators for class-
room assignments in several grades simultaneously. This introduces several complications. I
discuss them briefly here, then in more detail in the Appendix. First, school indicators in several
grades are identified only from students who switch schools between grades. School switching
is likely to be endogenous to a variety of unobserved student characteristics. In specifications

containing classroom assignments from multiple grades, I restrict my sample to students who
  15 This normalization makes W    singular in (16). For the OMD analysis, I drop the elements of πgh that correspond
to the largest class at each school.



                                                        15
do not switch schools, and include only a single set of school indicators.
   Second, specifications with several sets of classroom indicators have design matrices of
large dimension. Numerical inverses may be unstable. My focus on samples of non-movers
eliminates this problem when the specification includes only school and teacher indicators, as

it ensures that indicators for teachers at different schools are uncorrelated and that the design
matrix is block diagonal. I treat these specifications as separate regressions for each school,
each with only a few dozen regressors. Specifications that include continuous covariates (e.g.,
VAM2) cannot be decomposed in this way. For these, I begin with brute-force estimates, then
verify the estimated coefficients using an iterative algorithm (described in the Appendix) that

does not require inversion of large matrices.
   A final complication is that the coefficients for teachers in different grades can only be sep-
arately identified when there is sufficient shuffling of students between classrooms. If students
are perfectly streamed – if a student’s classmates in 4th grade were also her classmates in 3rd

grade – the 3rd and 4th grade classroom indicators are collinear. I exclude from my samples a
few schools where inadequate shuffling leads to perfect collinearity.



4 Data and Sample Construction

The specifications described in Section 3 require longitudinal data that track students’ outcomes

across several grades, linked to classroom assignments in each grade. I use administrative data
on public school students in North Carolina. The data, assembled and distributed by the North
Carolina Education Research Data Center, have been extensively cleaned to ensure accurate
matches between the component administrative data systems, and have been used for several

previous value added analyses (see, e.g., Clotfelter et al., 2006; Goldhaber, 2007).
   I examine end-of-grade math and reading tests from grades 3 through 5. To construct the 3rd
grade gain, I use “pre-tests” given at the beginning of 3rd grade in place of 2nd grade scores,
which were not given. I standardize the scale scores separately for each subject-grade-year



                                                16
combination.16
    The North Carolina data identify the school staff member who administered the end-of-
grade tests. In the elementary grades, this was usually the regular teacher. Following Clotfelter
et al. (2006), I count a student-teacher match as valid if the test administrator taught a “self-

contained” (i.e. all day, all subject) class for the relevant grade in the relevant year, if that class
was not designated as special education or honors, and if at least half of the tests that the teacher
administered were to students in the correct grade. Using this definition, 73% of 5th graders
can be matched to teachers. In each of my analyses, I restrict the sample to students with valid
teacher matches in all grades for which teacher assignments are controlled.

    I focus on the cohort of students who were in 5th grade in 2000-2001. Beginning with
the population (N=99,071), I exclude students who have inconsistent longitudinal records (e.g.
gender changes between years); who were not in 4th grade in 1999-2000; who are missing
4th or 5th grade test scores; or who cannot be matched to a 5th grade teacher. I additionally

exclude 5th grade classrooms that contain fewer than 12 sample students or are the only included
classroom at the school. This leaves my base sample, consisting of 60,740 students from 3,040
5th grade classrooms and 868 schools.
    My analyses all use subsets of this sample that provide sufficient longitudinal data. In

analyses of 4th grade gains, for example, I exclude students who have missing 3rd grade scores
or who were not in 3rd grade in 1998-1999. In specifications that include identifiers for teachers
in multiple grades, I further exclude students who changed schools between grades, plus a few
schools where streaming produces perfect collinearity.
    Table 1 presents summary statistics. I show statistics for the population, for the base sample,

and for my most restricted sample (used for estimation of equation (14)). The last is much
smaller than the others, largely because I require students to have attended the same school in
grades 3 through 5 and to have valid teacher matches in each grade. Table 1 indicates that the
   16 The test scale is meant to ensure that one point corresponds to an equal amount of learning at each grade and

at each point in the within-grade distribution. Rothstein (2008b) and Ballou (2008) emphasize the importance of
this property for value added modeling. All of the results here are robust to using the original scale.



                                                       17
base and restricted samples have higher mean 5th grade scores than the full population. This
primarily reflects the lower scores of students who switch schools frequently.17 Average 5th
grade gains are similar across samples. The Appendix describes each sample in more detail.
    As discussed above, my tests can be applied only if there is sufficient re-shuffling of class-

rooms between grades. An Appendix table shows the fraction of students’ 5th grade class-
mates who were also in the same 4th grade classes, by the number of 4th grade classes at the
school. Complete reshuffling (combined with equally-sized classes) would produce 0.5 with
two classes, 0.33 with three, and so on. The actual fractions are larger than this, but only
slightly. In schools with exactly three 5th grade teachers, for example, 35% of students’ 5th

grade classmates were also their classmates in 4th grade. In only 7% of multiple-classroom
schools do the 4th and 5th grade classroom indicators have less than full rank (after dropping
one teacher per grade).
    Table 2 presents the correlation of test scores and gains across grades and subjects. The

table indicates that 5th grade scores are correlated above 0.8 with 4th grade scores in the same
subject, while correlations with scores in earlier grades or other subjects are somewhat lower.
5th grade gains are strongly negatively correlated with 4th grade levels and gains in the same
subject and weakly negatively with those in the other subject. The correlations between 5th and

3rd grade gains are small but significant both within and across subjects.
    VAM3 is predicated on the notion that student ability is an important component of annual
gains. Assuming that high-ability students gain faster (i.e. that τg+1 > τg for each g), this
would imply positive correlations between gains in different years. There is no indication of
this in Table 2. One potential explanation is that noise in the annual tests introduces negative

autocorrelation in gains, but Rothstein (2008a,b) concludes that noise cannot account for the
magnitude of the observed negative year-to-year correlation. This strongly suggests that VAM3
is poorly suited to the test score data generating process.
   17 Table 1 shows that average 3rd and 4th grade scores in the “population” are well above zero. The norming

sample that I use to standardize scores in each grade consists of all students in that grade in the relevant year (i.e.
of all 3rd graders in 1999), while only those who make normal progress to 5th grade in 2001 are included in the
sample for Columns 1-2. The low scores of students who repeat grades account for the discrepancy.

5 Results

Tables 3, 4, and 5 present results for the three VAMs in turn. I begin with VAM1, in Table
3. I regress 5th grade math and reading gains (in Columns 1 and 2, respectively) on indicators
for 5th grade classrooms, then normalize the resulting coefficients to have mean zero within

each school. In each case, the hypothesis that all of the teacher coefficients are zero (i.e. that
classroom indicators have no explanatory power beyond that provided by school indicators) is
decisively rejected. The VAM indicates that the within-school standard deviations of 5th grade
teachers’ effects on math and reading are 0.15 and 0.11, respectively. This is similar to what

has been found in other studies (e.g., Aaronson et al., 2007; Rivkin et al., 2005).
   Columns 3 and 4 present falsification tests in which 4th grade gains are substituted for
the 5th grade gains as dependent variables, with the specification otherwise unchanged. The
standard deviation of 5th grade teachers’ “effects” on 4th grade gains is 0.08 in each subject,

and the hypothesis of zero association is rejected in each specification. In both the standard
deviation and statistical significance senses, 5th grade classroom assignments are slightly more
strongly associated with 4th grade reading gains than with math gains.
   One potential explanation for these counterfactual effects is that they represent omitted vari-
ables bias deriving from my failure to control for 4th grade teachers. Columns 5-8 present es-

timates that do control for 4th grade classroom assignments, using a sample of students who
attended the same school in 4th and 5th grades and can be matched to teachers in each grade.
Two aspects of the results are of interest. First, 4th grade teachers have strong independent
predictive power for 5th grade gains. This is at least suggestive that the “zero decay” assump-

tion is violated. I return to this in Section 7. Second, the coefficients on 5th grade classroom
indicators in models for 4th grade gains remain quite variable – even more so than in the sparse
specifications in Columns 3 and 4 – and are significantly different from zero. Evidently, the
correlation between 5th grade teachers and 4th grade gains derives from sorting on the basis of

the 4th grade residual, not merely from between-grade correlation of teacher assignments.
   These results strongly suggest that the exclusion restrictions for VAM1 are violated. To

                                               19
demonstrate this conclusively, however, we need to show that the residual in VAM1, e1ig , is
serially correlated. To examine this, I re-estimated VAM1 for 4th grade teachers’ effects on 4th
grade gains. The correlation between ê1i4 and ê1i5 is -0.38 in math and -0.37 in reading.
   The negative serial correlation of e1 implies that students with high gains in 4th grade will

tend to have low gains in 5th grade, and vice versa. Because VAM1 evidently does not ade-
quately control for classroom assignments, it gives unearned credit to teachers who are assigned
students who did poorly in 4th grade, as these students will predictably post unusually high 5th
grade gains when they revert toward their long-run means. Similarly, teachers whose students
did unusually well in 4th grade will be penalized by the students’ fall back toward their long-

run means in 5th grade. Indeed, an examination of the VAM1 coefficients indicates that 5th
grade teachers whose students have above-average 4th grade gains have systematically lower
estimated value added than teachers whose students underperformed in the prior year. Impor-
tantly, this pattern is stronger than can be explained by sampling error in the estimated teacher

effects; it reflect true mean reversion and not merely measurement error.
   Table 4 repeats the falsification exercise for VAM2. The structure is identical to that of
Table 3. Columns 1 and 2 present estimates of the basic VAM for 5th grade teachers’ effects on
5th grade gains, controlling for 4th grade math and reading scores. The standard deviations of

5th grade teachers’ effects are nearly identical to those in Table 3. Columns 3 and 4 substitute
4th grade gains as the dependent variable. Once again, we see that 5th grade teachers are
strongly predictive, more so in reading than in math. Columns 5-8 augment the specification
with controls for 4th grade teachers. The 5th grade teacher coefficients are no longer jointly
significant in the 4th grade math gain specification, though they remain quite large in magnitude.

They are still highly significant in the specification for 4th grade reading gains.
   The VAM2 residuals, like the VAM1 residuals, are strongly correlated between 4th and
5th grades, -0.21 in math and -0.19 in reading. They are also correlated across subjects: -
0.14 between 4th grade reading and 5th grade math. Thus, the evidence that 5th grade teacher

assignments are correlated with earlier reading gains even after controlling for 4th grade scores


                                                20
in both subjects indicates that the VAM2 exclusion restriction is violated, regardless of whether
the dependent variable is the math or the reading gain. As before, 5th grade teachers’ effects on
5th grade gains are negatively correlated with their counterfactual “effects” on 4th grade gains,
suggesting that mean reversion in student achievement – combined with non-random classroom

assignments – is an important source of bias in VAM2.
    As discussed in Section 3.5, the falsification test for VAM3 takes a different form. I begin
by selecting the subsample with non-missing 3rd and 4th grade gains; valid teacher assignments
in grades 3, 4, and 5; and continuous enrollment at the same school in all three grades. I exclude
26 schools where the three sets of indicators for teachers in grades 3, 4, and 5 (dropping one

teacher in each grade from each school) are collinear. I then regress both the 3rd and 4th grade
gains on school indicators and on each of the three sets of teacher indicators.18
    Table 5 reports estimates for math gains, in Columns 1 and 2, and for reading gains, in
Columns 4 and 5. The first panel shows the standard deviations (adjusted for sampling error)

of the coefficients for each grade’s teachers. Gains in each subject and in each grade are sub-
stantially correlated with classroom assignments in all three grades. Although p-values are not
shown, in all 12 cases the hypothesis of zero effects is rejected. Columns 3 and 6 report the
across-teacher correlations between the coefficients in the models for 3rd and 4th grade gains

(i.e., between πg3 and πg4 ). The most important correlation is that for 5th grade teachers, -0.04
for math and -0.06 for reading. Recall that strict exogeneity implies that the 5th grade teacher
coefficients in the model for 4th grade gains should be proportional to the corresponding co-
efficients in the model for 3rd grade gains, π54 = (∆τ4/∆τ3 ) π53 , implying a correlation of ±1.
The near-zero correlations strongly suggest that a single ability factor is unable to account for

the apparent “effects” of 5th grade teachers on gains in earlier grades. Indeed, they are direct
evidence against the VAM3 identifying assumption of conditional strict exogeneity.
   18 It is not essential to the correlated random effects test that the full sequence of teacher assignments back to

grade 1 be observed, but the test may over-reject if classroom assignments in grades 3-5 are correlated with those
in 1st and 2nd grade and if the latter have continuing effects on 3rd and 4th grade gains. Recall, however, that
VAM3 assumes such lagged effects away.




                                                        21
    The lower panel of Table 5 presents OMD estimates of the restricted model.19 I consider
two versions, one that constrains      ∆τ4/∆τ3   = 1 (as would be needed in order to estimate VAM3
using conventional fixed effects methods) and another that does not. Neither model is able to
fit the data. For math scores, the estimated ratio ∆τ4/∆τ3 from the less restrictive model is 0.14,

implying that student ability is much more important to 3rd grade than to 4th grade gains. Thus,
the constrained estimates imply negligible coefficients for 5th grade teachers in the equation
for 4th grade gains, and do a very poor job of fitting the unconstrained estimate of the standard
deviation of these coefficients, 0.099. The test statistic D is 2,136, and the overidentifying
restrictions are overwhelmingly rejected. In the reading specification, the ∆τ4/∆τ3 ratio is close to

one, and the restricted model allows for meaningful coefficients on 5th grade teachers in both the
3rd and 4th grade gain equations, albeit much less variability than is seen in the unconstrained
model. But the test statistic is even larger here, and the restricted model is again rejected. We
can thus conclude that 5th grade teacher assignments are not strictly exogenous with respect to

either math or reading gains, even conditional on single-dimensional (subject-specific) student
heterogeneity. The identifying assumption for VAM3 is thus violated.
    The results in Tables 3, 4, and 5 indicate that all three of the VAMs considered here rely
on incorrect exclusion restrictions – teacher assignments evidently depend on the past learning

trajectory even after controlling for student ability or the prior year’s test score. It is possible,
however, that slight modifications of the VAMs could eliminate the endogeneity. I have explored
several alternative specifications to gauge the robustness of the results. I have re-estimated
VAM1 and VAM2 with controls for student race, gender, and free lunch status; this has no
effect on the tests. Similarly, I have explored a variety of alternative test scalings. The three

VAMs continue to fail falsification tests when I use the original score scales or percentiles in
place of the standardized-by-grade scores used in Tables 3, 4, and 5.
    The results are also not specific to the cohort examined here; I obtain similar results using
data from other cohorts. As a final investigation, I have extended the tests to evaluate VAM
  19 The OMD analysis uses a variance-covariance matrix W that is robust to arbitrary heteroskedasiticity and
within-student, between-grade clustering.


                                                     22
analyses that use data from multiple cohorts of students to distinguish between permanent and
transitory components of a teacher’s “effect.” As discussed in the Appendix, the implicit as-
sumptions under which this can avoid the biases identified here do not appear to hold in the
data.



6 How Much Does This Matter?

The results in Section 5 indicate that the identifying assumptions for all three VAMs are violated
in the North Carolina data. However, if classroom assignments nearly satisfy the assumptions
underlying the VAMs, the models might yield almost unbiased estimates of teachers’ causal

effects. In this Section, I use the degree of sorting on prior outcomes to quantify the magnitude
of the biases resulting from non-random assignments. I focus on VAM1 and VAM2, as the lack
of correlation between 3rd and 5th grade gains (Table 2) strongly suggests that the additional
complexity and strong maintained assumptions of VAM3 are unnecessary.
   In general, classroom assignments may depend both on variables that are observable by

the econometrician and on unobserved factors. The former can in principle be incorporated
into VAM specifications. Accordingly, the first part of my investigation focuses on the role
of observable characteristics that are omitted from VAM1 and VAM2. I compare VAM1 and
VAM2 to a saturated specification that controls for teacher assignments in grades 3 and 4, end-

of-grade scores in both subjects in both grades, and scores from the tests given at the beginning
of 3rd grade. This specification would identify 5th grade teachers’ effects if assignments were
random conditional on the test score and teacher assignment history. It is thus more general
than VAM2. It does not strictly nest VAM1, however: Assignment of teachers based purely on

student ability (µi ) would satisfy the VAM1 exclusion restriction, but not that for the saturated
model. Of course, if assignments depend on both ability and lagged scores, VAM1, VAM2, and
the saturated VAM are all misspecified.
   Table 6 presents comparisons of the saturated VAM with VAM1 and VAM2. The first rows



                                               23
show the estimated standard deviations of teachers’ effects obtained from VAM1 and VAM2, as
applied to the subset of students with complete test score histories and valid teacher assignments
in each prior grade. The unadjusted estimates are somewhat higher than those in Tables 3 and
4, as the smaller sample yields noisier estimates. The sampling-adjusted estimates are quite

similar to those from the larger sample. The next two rows of the Table show estimates from
the saturated specification. Standard deviations are somewhat larger, but not dramatically so.
   The final two rows describe the bias in the simpler VAMs relative to the saturated model (that
is, β55
     VAM1 − β saturated and β VAM2 − β saturated ). I again show both the raw standard deviation of
             55              55       55

the point estimates and an adjusted standard deviation that removes the portion due to sampling

error. For VAM1, the bias has a standard deviation over a third as large as the standard deviation
of the estimated effects. For VAM2, which already includes a subset of the controls in the
saturated model, the bias is somewhat smaller. For both VAMs, the bias is more important in
estimates of teachers’ value added for math scores than for reading scores.

   Of course, the exercise carried out here can only diagnose bias in VAM1 and VAM2 from
selection on observables – variables that can easily be included in the VAM specification. In
a companion paper (Rothstein, 2008a), I attempt to quantify the bias that is likely to result
from selection on unobservables. Classroom assignments likely also depend on characteristics

– behavior, personality, parental intervention, etc. – that may be observed by the principal
but are unobserved by the econometrician. These characteristics may be predictive of future
outcomes. Following the intuition (Altonji et al., 2005) that the weight of observable (to the
econometrician) and unobservable variables in classroom assignments is likely to mirror their
relative weights in predicting achievement, one can use the degree of sorting on observables to

estimate the importance of unobservables and therefore the magnitude of the bias in estimated
teacher effects. Under varying assumptions about the amount of information that parents and
principals have, I find that the bias from non-random assignments is plausibly 50-75% as large
(in standard deviation terms) as the estimates of teachers’ effects in VAM1, and perhaps half




                                                24
this large in VAM2.20 These estimates imply that VAM2 and especially VAM1 seriously mis-
identify teachers’ true causal effects, crediting teachers for the students they are assigned. One
cannot be confident that a teacher identified as good by these models is in fact a good teacher,
rather than simply a teacher who was given students predicted (by principals, if not by the

econometrician) to gain quickly.



7 Short-Run vs. Long-Run Effects

Although classroom assignments are the focus of this paper, it is worth returning to another
implication of the results in Section 5. Recall from Columns 5-6 of Tables 3 and 4 that 4th

grade teachers appear to have large effects on students’ 5th grade gains. Given the results for
4th grade gains, these “effects” cannot be treated as causal. But setting this issue aside, we can
use the lagged teacher coefficients to evaluate restrictions on time pattern of teachers’ effects
(that is, on the relationship between βgg and βg,g+s in the production function (1)) that are
universally imposed in value added analyses.

    When only a single grade’s teacher assignment is included, VAM2 implicitly assumes that
teachers’ effects decay at a uniform, geometric rate (βg,g+s = βgg λ s for λ ∈ [0, 1]), while VAM1
assumes zero decay (λ = 0). It is not clear that either restriction is reasonable. One can certainly
imagine that some teaching styles (e.g., “teaching to the test”) would produce large short-run

effects that decay quickly while other styles (emphasizing independent exploration) might yield
smaller short-run effects that persist and even grow in later years.21 As this example shows, it
is far from clear that accountability policy should focus exclusively on short-run effects rather
than long-run effects if the two in fact differ.

    While several studies have attempted to estimate the decay parameter ψ ,22 this is the first
   20 Kane and Staiger’s (2008) comparison of experimental and non-experimental value added estimates would be

unlikely to detect biases of this magnitude.
   21 Although a full discussion is beyond the scope of this paper, assumptions about “decay” are closely related to

issues of test scaling and content coverage (Rothstein, 2008b; Ballou, 2008; Martineau, 2006).
   22 Studies predating this one include Andrabi et al. (2008), Sanders and Rivers (1996), and Konstantopoulos

(2007).


                                                        25
value added study of which I am aware that estimates teachers’ immediate and lagged effects
without imposing a restriction of uniform decay. As a final investigation, I analyze the validity
of this restriction by comparing a grade-g teacher’s initial effect in grade g with her longer-run
effect on scores in grade g + 1 or g + 2.23 Under the uniform decay restriction, these should be

perfectly correlated (except for sampling error).
    I begin by estimating VAM1 and VAM2 for 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade gains, augmenting each
specification with controls for past teachers back to 3rd grade. I then compute 3rd and 4th
grade teachers’ cumulative effects over one, two, and (for 3rd grade teachers) three years. Table
7 presents summary statistics for these cumulative effects. I show their standard deviation and

their correlation with the initial effects βggc , both adjusted for sampling error. Two aspects of the
results are of note. First, the standard deviation of teachers’ estimated “effects” falls in the year
after contact – there is much more variation in 4th grade teachers’ effects on 4th grade scores
than in those same teachers’ effects on 5th grade scores. With uniform decay at rate (1 − λ ),

var (βg,g+s ) = λ s var (βgg ), so this is consistent with the mounting evidence that teachers’ effects
decay importantly in the year after contact (Andrabi et al., 2008; Kane and Staiger, 2008; Jacob
et al., 2008). Second, the correlation between teachers’ first year effects and their two year
cumulative effects is much less than one, ranging between 0.33 and 0.51 depending on the

model and subject. Correlations with three-year cumulative effects are (mostly) lower, centered
around 0.4. This is not even approximately consistent with uniform decay. Even if we assume
that the VAM-based estimates can be treated as causal, a teacher’s first year effect is a poor
proxy for her longer-run impact.
    As a final exercise, I bring together the analyses of endogeneity bias and decay to investigate

whether estimates of short-run effects from VAM1 and VAM2 are reasonably accurate proxies
from those that would be obtained from a superior model for longer-run effects. I estimate
  23 For VAM1, the effect of being in classroom c in grade g on achievement in grade g + s is simply ∑t=0
                                                                                                      s
                                                                                                          βg,g+t,c .
In VAM2, the presence of a lagged dependent variable complicates the calculation of cumulative effects. If
only the same-subject score is controlled, the effect of 3rd grade teacher c on 5th grade achievement is
(β33c (1 + ψ4) + β34c) (1 + ψ5) + β35c . A similar but more complex expression characterizes the effects when
lagged scores in both math and reading are controlled, as in my estimates.



                                                        26
the saturated VAM from Section 6 for both 4th and 5th grade gains, controlling for all past
observables, and compute the implied cumulative effect of 4th grade teachers on students’ 5th
grade outcomes. Figure 1 shows the scatterplot of VAM1 and VAM2 estimates of 4th grade
teacher effects against those from the cumulative saturated specification. Both VAM1- and

VAM2-based estimates of effects on math scores correlate just over 0.4 with those from the
richer model, while correlations for reading achievement are below 0.35.
   Many teacher accountability policies focus only on the very best and very worst teachers.
Figure 1 shows the 20th and 80th percentiles of the distribution of estimated effects from each
model. For each contrast, I compute the fraction of teachers in the top and bottom quintile

according to the cumulative, saturated specification who are assigned to the same quintile by
VAM1 or VAM2. These are similar to the correlations, around 0.43 for math and 0.35 for
reading. Even ignoring the impact of sampling error, which would tend to exacerbate these
results but is not accounted for here, it is clear that model misspecification produces extreme

amounts of misclassification. Policies that use VAM1 or VAM2 to attempt to identify the best
and worst teachers will both reward and punish teachers who do not deserve it and fail to reward
and punish teachers who do.



8 Discussion

Access to panel data allows the econometrician to control for individual heterogeneity much
more flexibly than can be accomplished in cross-sectional data, but even panel data models
can identify treatment effects only if assignment to treatment satisfies strong ignorability as-
sumptions. This has long been recognized in the literature on program evaluation, but has

received relatively little attention in the literature on the estimation of teachers’ effects on stu-
dent achievement. In this paper, I have shown how the availability of lagged outcome measures
can be used to evaluate common value added specifications.
   The results presented here show that the assumptions underlying common VAMs are sub-



                                                 27
stantially incorrect, at least in North Carolina. Classroom assignments are not exogenous condi-
tional on the typical controls, and estimates of teachers’ effects based on these models cannot be
interpreted as causal. Clear evidence of this is that each VAM indicates that 5th grade teachers
have quantitatively important “effects” on students’ 4th grade learning.

   This result casts serious doubt on the value of simple VAMs for accountability and incentive
policies, which will clearly be sensitive to the assignment of students to teachers. Teachers
operating under high-stakes VAM-based accountability and incentive systems can be expected
to lobby their principals to be assigned the “right” students who will predictably yield high value
added scores, and principals will presumably alter their assignment rules to direct these students

toward favored teachers. As teacher-student matching is a potentially important determinant of
student learning (Clotfelter et al., 2006; Dee, 2005), distortion of these matches due to efforts
to manipulate teachers’ value added scores can have real efficiency consequences.
   It is clear that richer VAMs are needed. These will need to accommodate dynamic classroom

assignments and will probably require behavioral assumptions about the principal’s objective
function and information set. For example, one might assume that classroom assignments de-
pend on the principal’s best prediction of students’ unobserved ability, and that this prediction
is after receipt with each year’s test results. None of the VAMs considered here can accom-

modate assignments of this form, which on its face seems more plausible than the identifying
assumptions for VAM1, VAM2, or VAM3.
   Attempts to infer causal effects even from rich, dynamic VAMs call for a great deal of
caution and attention to the required assumptions. Any VAM proposed for policy use should be
subjected both to thorough validation and to falsification exercises. The tests implemented here

suggest a starting point, and may be adaptable to richer models. Failure to reject the exclusion
restrictions need not indicate that the restrictions are correct, as my tests can identify only
sorting based on past observables. But rejection does indicate that the VAM-based estimates
are likely to be misleading about teachers’ causal effects.

   Even with a valid model, it will also be important to measure teachers’ effects on student


                                                28
achievement over several years, not merely at the end of the year of exposure. Estimates of
teacher quality are evidently quite sensitive to this aspect of the model. By contrast, there is
little apparent need to allow for permanent heterogeneity in students’ rates of growth, as the
data provide no indication of such heterogeneity.

   The questions investigated and methods used here have applications beyond the estimation
of individual teacher quality. The Appendix shows that conclusions about the relationship be-
tween teachers’ observed characteristics and their value added also rest on unsteady ground.
Estimates of the quality of schools and of the effects of firms on workers’ wages use identical
econometric models, and rely on similar exclusion restrictions. Evidence about the “effects” of

future schools and employers on current outcomes would be informative about the validity of
both sets of estimates.

A Data Appendix

    This appendix describes the construction of the samples used in the paper. I begin with
records on all students who were enrolled in 5th grade in North Carolina public schools in 2000-
2001. From this universe, I exclude students with inconsistent longitudinal records (i.e. “male”
in some years and “female” in others, amounting to less than 1% of the population); those who
cannot be matched to 4th grade records from 1999-2000, perhaps because they skipped a grade
or attended private school (10%); those who cannot be matched to a 5th grade teacher or for
whom the 5th grade test administrator is not a valid teacher as defined in the text (24%); those
whose 5th grade class has fewer than 12 included students (1%); and those whose elementary
school contains only a single included 5th grade class (3%). This leaves me with a sample of
60,740, 61.3% of the initial population. I refer to this sample as the “base” sample.
    Each of my analyses uses subsets of this sample that have complete data on test scores
and teacher assignments for enough years to permit the analysis. A student might be excluded
from the analytical subsample for a particular analysis because there is no record in one of
the necessary grades; because there is a record but no test score; because the student changed
schools between grades; because she could not be matched to a valid teacher in each of the
required grades; because she was the only otherwise-usable student from her class in one or
more grades; because there was only one included class at her school in one or more grades; or
because the school did not shuffle students adequately between grades, leading to collinearity
between the classroom assignments in one year and those in other years. Appendix Table A1
describes the samples used in Columns 1-4 of Tables 3 and 4 (requiring complete test histories
from grades 3-5 and teacher assignments in grade 5); in Columns 5-8 of those Tables (also
requiring valid teacher assignments in 4th grade); and in Table 5 (also requiring 3rd grade
teacher assignments and scores from the beginning-of-third-grade tests).
    Appendix Table A2 reports statistics on shuffling of classrooms between 4th and 5th grades.
This uses a somewhat different sample than other tables, consisting of all students with valid
records and valid teacher matches in both grades 4 and 5 who did not switch schools or make
abnormal progress between grades. Using this sample, I count the number of 4th grade classes
at the school, and I compute for each student the fraction of her 5th grade classmates who were
also in her 4th grade class. I average this over the full sample and over subsamples defined by
the number of 4th grade teachers at the school. I also identify schools where dummies for the J4
4th grade teachers and J5 5th grade teachers have rank less than J4 + J5 − 2, indicating perfect
collinearity of at least one teacher assignment with the others, and re-compute the statistic
excluding observations from those schools.

B Technical Appendix

   This appendix provides more detail on some of the computations undertaken in the paper.

B.1 School-level normalizations

   As discussed in the text, each of my regressions includes fixed effects for the school at-


                                              30
tended, and coefficients on teacher indicators are normalized to have mean zero at the school
level. This normalization is easiest to describe if the sample consists of only a single school.
Let T be an N-by-J matrix of indicators for having been taught by each of the J teachers in a
particular grade at that school. Many of my regressions take the form

                                          y = α + T β + ε.                                       (18)

Let S = [1 T ] be the data matrix formed by augmenting the T matrix with a constant. Because
each student has exactly one teacher, S0 S has rank J, so not all of the J + 1 coefficients in α and
β can be separately identified. Suppose, without loss of generality, that the last element of T
is dropped. Let b̂ be the estimates of the remaining elements of β , and let Vb be the estimated

variance matrix for the normalized coefficients β̂ − β̂ is simply DV D0 . This has rank J − 1.
     The extension of this procedure to samples spanning many schools is straightforward. Sup-
pose that the teacher indicators are ordered, so that the first J1 come from school 1, the next J2
from school 2, and so on. Let β̂ be the full vector of estimated coefficients with the coefficient
for the final teacher at each school set to zero (i.e the J1 , (J1 + J2 ), etc., elements of β̂ ), and
let V be the sampling variance matrix (with rows and columns of zeros corresponding to the
zero elements of β̂ ). Finally, let Ds be the Js -by-Js demeaning matrix for school s, computed as
described above. Then the demeaning matrix for the full sample is block diagonal:
                                                               

As before, the demeaned vector of coefficients is Dβ̂ and the variance-covariance matrix is
DV D0 . This variance-covariance matrix has rank equal to ∑s Js − S.

B.2 Sampling-adjusted standard deviations

    For many of the models considered in the paper, I report the standard deviation across teach-
ers of the teacher coefficients. Let θ̂ be a J-vector of coefficients, normalized as described above
within each of S schools, let V be the variance-covariance matrix, and let n be a vector of student
counts.

                                                   J −S

where diag {ñ} is the J-by-J matrix with diagonal element j equal to n j/n̄ (where n̄ = (10 1)−1 10 n)
and zeros off the diagonal. Note that this incorporates a degrees-of-freedom adjustment for the
school-level normalization.
     The standard deviation of teachers’ estimated effects is merely the square root of the above
expression. This overstates the standard deviation that would be obtained in an infinitely large
sample. Let θ be the plim of θ̂ , under the fixed-J asymptotics described in the text, and let θ̂ =
θ + u, where u is sampling error and E [uu0 ] = V . This suggests       that we can write the variance
of the “true” (net of sampling error) effects as var (θ ) = var θ̂ − var (u), where these variances
are computed across the elements of θ and weighted by n. The var θ̂ term is estimated as
                                                                                   

described above. var (u) is estimated as 1J ∑ j n̄−1 n j v j j , where n̄ ≡ (10 1)−1 10 n, as above, and v j j
is the jth diagonal element of V .

B.3 Computation of regressions with teacher indicators for multiple grades
    when there are no covariates

    Several of the specifications used here include indicators for teachers in several grades si-
multaneously. The correlated random efffects analysis is the most involved, with indicators for
3rd, 4th, and 5th grade teachers in the same regression (equation (14)):


                                Ãi3 = Ti3 π33 + Ti4 π43 + Ti5 π53 + e3i3                                  (22)
                                Ãi4 = Ti3 π34 + Ti4 π44 + Ti5 π54 + e3i4 .                                (23)

Two computational challenges arise. First, not all of the π coefficients can be separately com-
puted. The particular problem arises because I restrict the sample to students who do not change
schools. The fitted values of the regressions would be unchanged were we to add a constant c
to each element of the πg,h corresponding to a teacher at a particular school j and subtract the
same constant from the similarly-defined elements of πk,h for some k 6= g. As a result, the mean
of πg,h across all teachers in grade g at school j cannot be separately identified. I augment (22)
and (23) with school indicators, then select one teacher in each grade at each school to exclude
from the regressions.24 I treat the excluded π coefficient as zero, with sampling variance zero.
After estimating the regression, I normalize the coefficients of (22) and (23) to have mean zero
across teachers in each grade at each school, using the procedure described above.
    The second issue derives from the sheer size of the regression. Even after excluding the over-
identified coefficients, each of the Tig vectors has over 2,200 elements, and the full regression
(after dropping redundant indicators) has 5,501 regressors. Numerical inversion of a matrix
of this dimension may introduce inaccuracies. My focus on samples of students who do not
  24 Thesample used for these regressions excludes schools where, due to insufficient mixing, the [Ti3 Ti4 Ti5 ]
submatrix corresponding to teachers at the school has rank less than Js3 + Js4 + Js5 − 2.

switch schools permits a simpler computation.     Re-order the independent variables in equations
(22) and (23) as X = X(1) , X(2) , . . . , X(J) , where X( j) contains the indicator for school j and
the indicators for all teachers (in all three grades) at school j. Any sample student who ever
appears in school j never appears in any other school, so X(0 j)X(k) = 0 for all j 6= k. This ensures
that X 0 X is block-diagonal:

Each block has dimension of only a few dozen, so inversion is straightforward. The π co-
efficients (before the within-school normalization) and robust sampling variances are readily
computed from (X 0 X )−1 . The covariances between the coefficients of equations (22) and (23)
can be computed with
                                         −1 0                           −1

This implicitly clusters on the individual student, and is equivalent to applying system OLS to
the simultaneous equations (22) and (23).

B.4 Computation of regressions with teacher indicators for multiple grades
    when there are continuous covariates

    In a few cases (e.g. the “saturated” model discussed in Section 6), I include continuous
regressors Z along with the school and teacher indicators from several grades. These regressions
have the form
                                       y = X Π + Zψ + ε .                                   (27)
Letting W = [X Z] and Λ = [Π0 ψ 0 ]0 , we have y = W Λ + ε . Because the ψ coefficients are
common across schools, W 0W is no longer block-diagonal, and the school-by-school strategy
described above cannot be used directly here. In these models, I use a brute-force OLS regres-
sion estimator (implemented in Matlab) to compute the regression of the school de-meaned y
on the de-meaned W . This may introduce numerical inaccuracy in the estimated coefficients,


                                                 33
Λ̂0 . To avoid this, I use an iterative algorithm to obtain improved coefficient estimates. At each
iteration t (beginning with t=1), there are two steps:


   1. Treat the ψ parameters as known, using values from the previous iteration, ψ̂t−1 . Regress
      y − Z ψ̂t−1 on X . The methods used in the previous section can be applied here, as X 0 X is
      block diagonal with blocks corresponding to schools. Label the resulting coefficients Π̂t

   2. Treating the Π̂t coefficients as known, regress y − X Π̂t on Z. Z typically contains only a
      handful of variables, so this is simple to calculate. Label the resulting coefficients ψ̂t , and
      use these as inputs to step 1 on the next iteration.


These steps are repeated until the coefficient vector converges. Convergence is considered to
have been achieved when the maximum change in the regression residuals et ≡ y − X Π̂t − Z ψ̂t
from the previous iteration – that is, ket − et−1 ksup – is less than 10−6 σy .
    This is essentially the Gauss-Seidel method, though the structure of the problem makes it
possible to use only two sub-vectors of the full parameter vector Λ rather than stepping through
each element of Λ separately as in typical implementations. It can be shown to be a contraction
mapping on the sum of squared errors, so the coefficients necessarily converge to the OLS
coefficients. Abowd et al. (2002) use a similar (in spirit, though not in detail) computational
strategy.
    In practice, the initial brute-force estimates are quite accurate, and only one or two iterations
are required before convergence is achieved. As the iterative algorithm does not yield standard
errors, I use a brute-force estimate of (W 0W )−1 to compute these.




C Additional Specifications

C.1     Teachers’ observable characteristics

    VAMs are used not only to estimate individual teachers’ effects, but also to assess the re-
lationship of teacher quality with teachers’ observed characteristics (see, e.g., Clotfelter et al.,
2006, 2007; Goldhaber and Brewer, 1997; Hanushek and Rivkin, 2006). These analyses replace
the teacher indicators in VAM1, VAM2, or VAM3 with vectors of teacher observables – edu-
cation, experience, etc. The tests developed in the main text can be applied to these models as
well. Appendix Table C1 presents results for mathematics. (Results for reading are similar and
are available from the author.) I focus on a short vector of teacher characteristics: An indica-
tor for whether the teacher has a master’s degree, a linear experience measure, an indicator for
whether the teacher has less than two years of experience, and the teacher’s score on the Praxis
tests required to obtain elementary certification in North Carolina.25 As in the other analyses,
  25 Each  test is standardized among North Carolina teachers who took it in the same year, then (when multiple
scores are available) scores are averaged across tests.


                                                      34
I restrict attention to students who can be assigned to valid teachers in each grade for which
teacher characteristics will be controlled and who do not switch schools between grades. I fur-
ther exclude students for whom I am unable to assemble complete characteristics for each of
the relevant teachers.
    Column 1 presents estimates from VAM1 of the effects of 4th and 5th grade teachers on 5th
grade gains, controlling for school fixed effects and clustering the standard errors on the school.
The 5th grade teacher coefficients echo those in the literature: A master’s degree appears to
make little difference, but inexperienced teachers have quite negative effects on student gains.
Interestingly, inexperienced 4th grade teachers seem to have large positive effects on 5th grade
gains, perhaps indicating that students quickly make up for time lost during 4th grade. See the
discussion in Section 7.
    Column 2 repeats the VAM1 specification, this time using the 4th grade gain as the depen-
dent variable. The 4th grade teacher coefficients are consistent with those seen for 5th grade
teachers in Column 1. But Column 2 also indicates that the 5th grade teacher’s Praxis score is
positively associated with the 4th grade gain score, while the coefficient on the dummy for an
inexperienced 5th grade teacher is negative and nearly significant (t = −1.85). The hypothesis
that all 5th grade teacher characteristics have zero coefficients is rejected (p = 0.02). This is
clear evidence that the VAM1 exclusion restriction is violated by student sorting.
    Columns 3 and 4 present the analysis of VAM2, modeling 5th grade scores in Column 3
and 3rd grade scores in Column 4. Results in Column 3 are similar to those in Column 2. In
Column 4, none of the 5th grade coefficients are individually significant, but the test that all
are zero is marginally significant (p = 0.11). Given the low power of my tests for analyses
of teacher characteristics, which are only weakly correlated with student achievement in any
grade, I interpret this as only mildly encouraging.
    Columns 5 and 6 present the correlated random effects analysis that I use to evaluate VAM3,
modeling 3rd and 4th grade gains, respectively, as functions of the characteristics of teachers
in grades 3 through 5. I again consider two restricted models, one that constrains student abil-
ity to enter identically into each grade’s gain score equation and another that allows different
ability coefficients in different grades. The former model – corresponding to the version of
VAM3 that is uniformly used in the literature – implies that the 5th grade teacher coefficients in
columns 5 and 6 of Table 6 should be equal. Iin fact, we see a significant negative coefficient
for the no experience indicator in the model for 4th grade gains and a marginally significant
(t = 1.67) positive coefficient in the model for 3rd grade gains. The hypothesis of equal effects
is decisively rejected (p=0.02). The less restrictive model requires only that the coefficients
in columns 5 and 6 be proportional to one another. This restriction is consistent with the data
(p=0.81). However, the OMD estimates indicate a factor of proportionality of -0.92. If we
normalize τ̃3 = 1, defining “ability” to have a positive effect on 3rd grade gains, the model in-
dicates that high ability students gain much less during 4th grade than their low ability peers.
An alternative interpretation of this extremely counterintuitive result is that the test is unable
to detect violations of strict exogeneity in this context. The correlated random effects test has
power against violations of strict exogeneity only if classroom assignments depend on factors
that are correlated with the included variables. As all of the coefficients except those for the
inexperienced teacher indicator are small and far from statistically significant, and as even the
inexperienced teacher coefficients are consistent with the model only with implausible coef-
ficient estimates, the simplest interpretation is that VAM3 is poorly suited to identifying the

                                                35
effects of teacher characteristics on student achievement. Indeed, when I extend the analysis
to use the characteristics of 6th grade teachers – students are typically in middle school in 6th
grade, and ability tracking is more pronounced – to strengthen the overidentification test (see
Rothstein, 2008b), I reject proportionality of the 6th grade teacher coefficients.

C.2     Distinguishing between teacher and classroom effects using cross-
        cohort comparisons

    In the main paper, I use the terms “classroom effects” and “teacher effects” interchangeably
to describe the effects of being in a single classroom. Under certain circumstances a distinction
between the two – between a teacher’s effect that is the same every year and a classroom effect
that may vary from year to year as the teacher is assigned new cohorts of students – may make
it possible to obtain unbiased estimates of teachers’ causal effects under weaker conditions than
are considered in the text.
    Let βtyc be the effect of being in classroom c taught by teacher t in year y. (I suppress grade
subscripts for notational simplicity.) We can decompose this into a permanent component as-
sociated with the teacher and a time-varying component associated with transitory aspects of
the classroom in year y. Let c (t, y) be the classroom taught by teacher t in year y, and assume
that βtyc(t, y) = θt + υty . Here, θt is the teacher’s effect, and υty is the additional portion of the
classroom effect. If we assume that the non-random assignments of students to classrooms are
completely transitory – that the pre-assignment characteristics of students in classroom c (t, y)
are uncorrelated both with the characteristics of students in c (t, y + 1) and with the teacher’s
true effect θt – then the bias in β̂tyc(t,y) will be uncorrelated from one year to the next. A
decomposition of β̂ into permanent teacher components and transitory components – a regres-
sion of β̂tyc onto teacher indicators – would yield unbiased estimates of the permanent teacher
components θt . Alternatively, the variance of θt across teachers can be estimated from the
between-year covariance of β :

            E βtyc(t,y) βt,y+1,c(t,y+1) = E θt2 + E vty vt,y+1 + E [θt vty ] + E θt vt,y+1 .

By the assumptions above, the final three terms are all zero. This sort of decomposition has
been used by Hanushek et al. (2005) and Kane and Staiger (2008), among others.
    This strategy relies crucially on the assumption that the assignments are uncorrelated across
years. If some teachers are repeatedly assigned students with high expected gains  that are not
controlled in the VAM, this will create bias in the estimates of θt and E θt2 . To evaluate
whether assignments are in fact uncorrelated across years, I use students who were in 5th grade
in 2000 to estimate a regression of 5th grade gains on all prior scores, absorbing 5th grade
classroom indicators. This resembles the saturated VAM used above, but it excludes classroom
indicators from prior grades. Using the coefficients from this regression, I form predicted 5th
grade gains for each 5th grade student in both 2000 and 2001, then average these to the class-
room level. These mean predicted gains represent bias in single-cohort estimates of VAM1. I
also residualize the predicted gains against 4th grade scores to obtain the bias in VAM2. I then
correlate the average predicted gains (or residual gains) of a teacher’s students in 2000 with
those for the same teacher’s students in 2001.


                                                  36
    In each VAM and in each subject, these cross-cohort correlations are positive and highly
statistically significant. Evidently, teachers who are assigned good students in one year are
typically assigned better-than-average students the next year as well. Thus, while data following
teachers for several years may have some value for reducing bias from non-random assignments
– the (observable) quality of a teacher’s students is not perfectly correlated over time – the
assumptions that would support simple corrections are not satisfied in the North Carolina data.

Notes: The graphs show scatterplots of 4th grade teachers’ estimated effects on 4th grade gains
from VAM1 and VAM2 (vertical axes) against effects on 5th grade scores computed from a sat-
urated VAM that controls for all past teachers and scores (horizontal axes). Teacher effects are
normalized to mean zero within each school. Dashed lines show the 20th and 80th percentile
of the estimated effects. Each panel shows the correlation between the two sets of estimates
(weighted by the number of students taught, but not adjusted for sampling error), plus the frac-
tion of teachers who are assigned to the top and bottom quintiles by the cumulative saturated
model who are also assigned to these quintiles by VAM1 and VAM2.

Notes: Summary statistics are computed over all available observations. Test scores are standardized
using all 3rd graders in 1999, 4th graders in 2000, and 5th graders in 2001, respectively, regardless of
grade progress. "Population" in Columns 1-2 is students enrolled in 5th grade in 2001, merged to 3rd and
4th grade records (if present) for the same students in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Columns 3-4 describe
the base sample discussed in the text; it excludes students with missing 4th and 5th grade test scores,
students without valid 5th grade teacher matches, 5th grade classes with fewer than 12 sample students,
and schools with only one 5th grade class. Columns 5-6 further restrict the sample to students with non-
missing scores in grades 3-5 (plus the 3rd grade beginning-of-year tests) and valid teacher assignments in
each grade, at schools with multiple classes in each school in each grade and without perfect collinearity of
classroom assignments in different grades.

Notes: Each statistic is calculated using the maximal possible sample of valid student records
with observations on all necessary scores and normal grade progress between the relevant
grades. Column 7 lists the sample size for each row variable; correlations use smaller samples
for which the column variable is also available. Italicized correlations are not different from zero
at the 5% level.

3rd or 4th grade (or on the 3rd grade beginning-of-year tests), or who lack valid teacher assignments in any
grade 3-5 are excluded. Schools with only one included teacher per grade or where teacher indicators are
collinear across grades are also excluded.
