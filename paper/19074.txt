                                             ABSTRACT

This paper introduces dynamics in the R&D-to-innovation and innovation-to-productivity relationships,
which have mostly been estimated on cross-sectional data. It considers four nonlinear dynamic simultaneous
equations models that include individual effects and idiosyncratic errors correlated across equations
and that differ in the way innovation enters the conditional mean of labor productivity: through an
observed binary indicator, an observed intensity variable or through the continuous latent variables
that correspond to the observed occurrence or intensity. It estimates these models by full information
maximum likelihood using two unbalanced panels of Dutch and French manufacturing firms from
three waves of the Community Innovation Survey. The results provide evidence of robust unidirectional
causality from innovation to productivity and of stronger persistence in productivity than in innovation.

1      Introduction

For decades, R&D and innovation have been recognized by scholars and policy makers as major

drivers of country, industry and ﬁrm economic performance. Many of the early studies, following

the lead of Griliches (1979), used an augmented production function with R&D capital to estimate

the returns to R&D at the ﬁrm level. More recently, many studies relied on innovation survey
indicators and on the CDM framework to analyze simultaneously a knowledge production function

relating innovation output to R&D, and an augmented production function linking productivity to

innovation output (Crépon et al., 1998; Mairesse et al., 2005; Griﬃth et al., 2006). Both the eﬀects

of R&D on innovation output and of innovation output on productivity are usually found to be

positive and signiﬁcant in these studies. Most of them, however, are based on cross-sectional data

and cannot take into account the dynamic linkages between innovation and economic performance

nor unobserved ﬁrm heterogeneity. This is where the present study comes into play.1 More

speciﬁcally, using data from three waves of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) for France

and the Netherlands, we examine whether there is evidence of persistence in ﬁrm innovation and

productivity and of bidirectional causality between them.2

     There are several reasons why one should introduce dynamics in the interrelationships between

R&D, innovation and productivity. Firstly, the time lag between a ﬁrm’s decision to invest in R&D,

the associated R&D outlays and the resulting innovation success may be substantial because of

‘time to build’, opportunity cost and uncertainty inherent to the innovation process (Majd and

Pindyck, 1987). For example, the studies of knowledge production function using ﬁrm panel data,
where patents proxy for knowledge, specify a relation of patents to distributed lags of R&D (Pakes

and Griliches, 1980; Hall et al., 1986). Secondly, scholars argue that a successfully innovative ﬁrm

is more likely than a non-innovating ﬁrm to experience innovation success in the future, in other

words, that ‘success breeds success’. Several papers have investigated the persistence of innovation

success, measured by the number of granted patents (Geroski et al., 1997), the introduction of

new or signiﬁcantly improved products (Peters, 2009) or production methods (Flaig and Stadler,

1994), or the share in total sales accounted for by sales of these products (henceforth the share of

innovative sales) (Raymond et al., 2010). Thirdly, it is also argued that the economic performance

of a ﬁrm, especially of a repeatedly innovating ﬁrm, is likely to exhibit persistence. For instance,

Bailey et al. (1992), Bartelsman and Dhrymes (1998), and Fariñas and Ruano (2005) ﬁnd strong
    1 See also Parisi et al. (2006) and Huergo and Moreno (2011) for two diﬀerent attempts to go in this direction.
    2 There  are important diﬀerences between France and the Netherlands, in particular the size of the two countries,
the industrial composition, the extent of external trade and institutional and regulatory changes in our study period.
It is not clear a priori how these diﬀerences impact directly the ﬁrm innovation and productivity relationships between
the two countries. We consider it interesting and important to compare them for the sake of scientiﬁc replication
(see Hamermesh, 2007).

evidence of persistence of ﬁrm level productivity diﬀerentials using transition probabilities on the

quintiles or deciles of the distribution of these diﬀerentials over time, or using kernel techniques

to estimate the conditional distribution of ﬁrm level productivity at period t given productivity

at period t − 1. Finally, because of information asymmetry, ﬁrms may be more willing to rely on

retained earnings rather than to seek external funding for their future innovations (Bhattacharya

and Ritter, 1983), implying a feedback eﬀect from productivity to innovation.

    To investigate these dynamic aspects, we study four nonlinear dynamic simultaneous equations

models that diﬀer in the way that innovation enters the conditional mean of labor productivity:

through an observed binary indicator, an observed intensity variable or through the continuous

latent variables that correspond to the observed occurrence or intensity. We describe these models

in detail in Section 2.
    We show in Section 3 how to derive the full information maximum likelihood estimator assum-

ing random eﬀects that are correlated with suﬃciently time-varying explanatory variables. More

speciﬁcally, we take care of the initial conditions problem due to the autoregressive structure of

the models and the presence of ﬁrm eﬀects using Wooldridge’s (2005) ‘simple solutions’ approach,

and we handle multiple integration due to the correlations of ﬁrm eﬀects and idiosyncratic errors

across equations using Gauss-Hermite quadrature sequentially along the lines of Raymond (2007,

chapter 6).

    In Section 4, we explain the data on which we base our estimations and provide some descrip-

tive statistics. These data come from three waves of the Dutch and the French Manufacturing

Community Innovation Surveys (CIS) for 1994-1996, 1998-2000 and 2002-2004, supplemented by

a few ﬁrm accounting variables. We work with an unbalanced panel to have a larger sample and

thus to weaken possible survivorship biases and to obtain more accurate estimates.

    In Section 5 we present our results. For both countries they reveal strong persistence in produc-

tivity but weaker persistence in innovation, and they indicate a unidirectional causality running

from innovation to labor productivity. Whereas past innovation matters to productivity, the most

productive enterprises are not more successful in introducing new or signiﬁcantly improved prod-
ucts and do not attain larger shares of innovative sales than the least productive ones.



2     Model speciﬁcations

Our models consist of a knowledge production function and an augmented production function

relating respectively innovation output to R&D and other relevant innovation factors, and pro-

ductivity to innovation output and other relevant production factors. Four measures of innovation


                                                  3
output are considered in the analysis. The ﬁrst is an observed binary variable taking the value

one if an enterprise is a product innovator, and zero otherwise. In the innovation survey, a prod-

uct innovator is a ﬁrm that has introduced a new or improved product in the last three years.

The second variable is a continuous observed variable, namely the observed innovation intensity,

measured by the share of total sales in year t due to products introduced in the last three years,

i.e. t, t − 1 or t − 2. Although the latter is more informative than the former it is likely to be

more aﬀected by important measurement errors. We also consider the two latent innovation output

variables that underly respectively the propensity to introduce new or improved products on the

market and the potential share of innovative sales. Both latent variables are continuous measures

that substitute in one case for a binary variable and in the other case for a continuous variable

with corner solution. The latent variable speciﬁcation assumes there is an underlying true variable
which is not necessarily zero when it is not observed (e.g. in case of a small incremental innovation)

while the observed speciﬁcation assumes that innovation is well known and possibly equal to zero.

As innovation output later enters as an argument in the production function, it is also not clear

whether it is the observed ex-post or the expected ex-ante innovation that should determine labor

productivity. There are thus both economic and statistical reasons for preferring one speciﬁcation

over the other. We shall compare all four of them.


2.1     Knowledge production function (KPF)
     ∗
Let y1it denote a latent variable underlying ﬁrm i’s (i = 1, ..., N ) propensity to achieve product

innovations at period t (t = 0i , ..., Ti ) given past observed occurrence of product innovations y1i,t−1 ,

past labor productivity y3i,t−1 , past R&D and other ﬁrm- and market-speciﬁc characteristics x1it ,
and unobserved ﬁrm heterogeneity α1i .3 Formally


                            ∗
                           y1it = ϑ11 y1i,t−1 + ϑ13 y3i,t−1 + β ′1 x1it + α1i + ε1it ,                      (2.1)


where ϑ11 and ϑ13 capture the eﬀect of past product innovation occurrence and past productivity

on the propensity to innovate, β ′1 captures the eﬀects of past R&D and other explanatory variables

and ε1it denotes idiosyncratic errors encompassing other time-varying unobserved variables that
       ∗                                                               ∗
aﬀect y1it . The observed dependent variable, y1it , corresponding to y1it is deﬁned as


                                                        ∗
                                              y1it = 1[y1it > 0],                                           (2.2)
   3 By letting t vary from 0 to T , we allow ﬁrms to enter and exit the sample at diﬀerent periods. 0 denotes the

where 1[ ] denotes the indicator function taking the value one if the condition between squared

brackets is satisﬁed, and zero otherwise.
         ∗
    Let y2it denote the ﬁrm’s latent share of innovative sales, or potential innovation intensity,

given past observed innovation intensity y2i,t−1 , past labor productivity y3i,t−1 , past R&D and

other ﬁrm- and market-speciﬁc characteristics x2it , and ﬁrm-speciﬁc eﬀects α2i . Formally


                             ∗
                            y2it = ϑ22 y2i,t−1 + ϑ23 y3i,t−1 + β ′2 x2it + α2i + ε2it ,                         (2.3)


where the coeﬃcients ϑ22 and ϑ23 capture the eﬀect of past observed share of innovative sales and

past labor productivity on the potential innovation intensity, β ′2 captures the eﬀect of past R&D

and other explanatory variables and ε2it denotes idiosyncratic errors. The observed counterpart
    ∗
to y2it is deﬁned as
                                                        ∗        ∗
                                              y2it = 1[y1it > 0]y2it .                                          (2.4)


In other words, the share of innovative sales of ﬁrm i is observed to be positive in period t if its
innovation propensity is suﬃciently large in that period. If not, the share of innovative sales is set

equal to zero.

    The product innovation indicator and the share of innovative sales variables are taken from

the innovation survey of the two countries. Since the share of innovative sales lies within the unit

interval, we use a logit transformation in the estimation in order to normalize it over the entire set

of real numbers.4

    The set of other explanatory variables includes the log R&D per employee, the log market share,

and size, industry and time dummy variables.5 Due to the lengthy nature of research and innovation

activities, we use lagged R&D to explain innovation occurrence and innovation intensity. We also

thought it better to only consider R&D expenditure for ﬁrms that declare investing continuously

in R&D.6 We include a lagged dummy variable for non-continuous R&D performers to compensate

for the fact that for those ﬁrms we put the R&D expenditure equal to zero. Market share is used at

the three digit industry level as a measure of relative size that can reﬂect market power. It is lagged

in order to avoid possible endogeneity concerns (due in particular to measurement errors in ﬁrm

sales which would aﬀect both our market share and productivity variables).7 We take employment
   4 Zero values of the share of innovative sales are replaced by a positive value τ smaller than the minimum positive
                                                                                    1
observed value of that variable, and values one are replaced by a positive value τ2 higher than the second largest
observed value. These choices have a negligible eﬀect on our estimates.
   5 In some speciﬁcations, we have also three indicators of the distance to the productivity frontier. We ﬁnd,

however, that they are not statistically signiﬁcant (see Appendix D).
   6 R&D expenditure is likely to be a reasonable proxy of R&D capital for these ﬁrms. If we could construct

a measure of R&D capital stock, it would be a better measure to use. We cannot, however, for lack of enough
observations over time.
   7 The market share of a ﬁrm is deﬁned as the ratio of its sales over the total sales of the three digit industry it




                                                          5
as our measure of ﬁrm absolute size, and since the relation between innovation and size may be

nonlinear, we use four size class indicators: small enterprises (# employees ≤ 50), medium-sized

enterprises (50 < # employees ≤ 250), large enterprises (250 < # employees ≤ 500) and very large

enterprises (500 < # employees), the fourth class being considered as the reference. We control

for industry eﬀects, according to the OECD (2007) technology-based classiﬁcation of high-tech,

medium-high-tech, medium-low-tech, and low-tech industries, using three dummy variables for

the ﬁrst three industry categories and taking low-tech industries as the reference. Such industry-

speciﬁc eﬀects capture diﬀerences in technological opportunities (it is easier to innovate in certain

industries than in others) and in intensity of competition (which is expected to be higher in high-

tech than in low-tech industries). Since our panel consists only of three periods and we need one

for the lagged variables, we need only include a time dummy variable for the period 1998-2000,
with 2002-2004 being the reference. This time dummy controls for macroeconomic shocks and for

inﬂation.


2.2     Augmented production function (APF)

As in the great majority of studies, we assume a Cobb-Douglas APF that we write in terms of a log

linear productivity equation relating labor productivity to labor (i.e., we do not assume a constant

scale elasticity), physical capital per employee (proxied here by physical investment due to the

unavailability of a stock measure), and innovation output. We consider four speciﬁcations where

we explain productivity by latent innovation (i.e. the propensity to achieve product innovations or

potential innovation intensity) or by observed innovation (i.e. innovation occurrence or observed

innovation intensity). In all cases we also condition current labor productivity on its past values
and control for unobserved heterogeneity through ﬁrm eﬀects. Thus, we can write


                              y3it = ϑ33 y3i,t−1 + β ′3 x3it + γj yjit
                                                                   ∗
                                                                       + α3i + ε3it ,                         (2.5a)

                              y3it = ϑ33 y3i,t−1 + β ′3 x3it + γj yjit + α3i + ε3it ,                         (2.5b)


                                              ∗                                         ∗
with j = 1 or 2 where innovation propensity (y1it ) or potential innovation intensity (y2it ) explains

labor productivity in equation (2.5a), and innovation occurrence (y1it ) or observed innovation

intensity (y2it ) explains labor productivity in equation (2.5b). The coeﬃcient ϑ33 captures the

eﬀect of past labor productivity on current labor productivity, β ′3 captures the eﬀect of standard
belongs to. The latter is obtained by adding up the sales of all ﬁrms in our sample that belong to that industry after
multiplying them by an appropriate raising factor in order to have the total sales of the industry in the population.
As we shall see, a combination of a census and a stratiﬁed random sampling is used to collect the data. In the latter
case, the raising factor is calculated for each stratum as the ratio of the number of ﬁrms in the population of that
stratum over the number of ﬁrms in the corresponding stratum sample.

input variables, i.e. employment and physical investment per employee, γj captures the eﬀect of

innovation output on labor productivity, and α3i and ε3it denote time-invariant ﬁrm eﬀects and

idiosyncratic errors. We also control for industry and time eﬀects as in the KPF equations.



3     Full information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML)

We shall now explain how to derive the FIML estimator, that is how to take care of the initial

conditions problem due to the autoregressive structure of the models and the presence of ﬁrm

eﬀects, how to write the likelihood function, and how to handle the multiple integration due to the

correlations of ﬁrm eﬀects and idiosyncratic errors across equations.


3.1       Initial conditions

The initial conditions problem stems from the fact that the ﬁrst observed value of the lagged

dependent variables is correlated with the individual eﬀects. Ignoring or inadequately accounting
for this correlation results in a bias of the eﬀect of the lagged dependent variables. Several solutions

have been proposed in the econometric literature. We follow the one suggested by Wooldridge

(2005).

    Wooldridge’s ‘simple solutions’ have been originally applied to autoregressive nonlinear single-

equation models with individual eﬀects. We adapt the approach to a model with multiple equations.

In other words, we project in each equation the individual eﬀects on the ﬁrst observation of

the corresponding dependent variables and on the observed history of the explanatory variables.

Formally


                                   α1i = b10 + b′11 y 1i0i + b′12 x1i + a1i ,                           (3.1)

                                   α2i = b20 + b′21 y 2i0i + b′22 x2i + a2i ,                           (3.2)

                                   α3i = b30 + b′31 y 3i0i + b′32 x3i + a3i ,                           (3.3)


where y ki0i (k = 1, 2, 3) represents the initial values of the dependent variables, xki = (xki0i +1 , ...,

xkiTi )′ represents the history of (in principle all) the observations of the time-varying explanatory

variables, and ai = (a1i , a2i , a3i )′ denotes the vector of projection errors assumed orthogonal to

y ki0i , xki and εit = (ε1it , ε2it , ε3it )′ . The ancillary parameters bk0 , bk1 and bk2 are to be estimated

alongside the parameters of interest.

    Three important remarks are in order regarding equations (3.1)-(3.3). Firstly, if the coeﬃcient

vectors β k contain intercepts, only the sums of those intercepts and bk0 are identiﬁed. Secondly,


                                                       7
if the explanatory variables are time-invariant or do not show suﬃcient within variation, then

the coeﬃcients bk2 and β k cannot be separately identiﬁed. As a result, only the suﬃciently

time-varying explanatory variables enter equations (3.1)-(3.3). Thirdly, in order to discriminate

between the eﬀect of the lagged dependent variables and that of the initial values, given the

unbalancedness of the panel, we actually have to include in equations (3.1)-(3.3) two types of

initial values with diﬀerent coeﬃcients for ﬁrms present in all three waves and for those present

only in two waves. Following Wooldridge (2005) we make the following distributional assumptions:
               iid                                      iid

3.2    Likelihood

We now derive the likelihood functions. For simplicity, we provide the expressions explicitly only
                             ∗
for the speciﬁcations where y1it or y1it (respectively the latent propensity to achieve product

innovations and the observed indicator of innovation occurrence) enters the augmented production
                      ∗
function. Those with y2it or y2it are presented in Appendix B.


Model with latent innovation propensity


   The model with latent innovation propensity as a predictor of labor productivity consists of

equations (2.1)-(2.4) and (2.5a) with j = 1 in equation (2.5a). These equations constitute the
                                     ∗
structural form of the model. Since y1it is unobserved, we cannot, unlike in simultaneous equa-
tions models with observed explanatory variables, derive the likelihood function directly where the

dependent variable is included as a regressor. As a result, FIML estimates can be obtained only

through the likelihood function of the reduced form of the model. The reduced-form equations are

given by equations (2.1)-(2.4) and


                                  [                                     ]

where y1it has been replaced by its right-hand side expression of equation (2.1).8 The individual

eﬀects and the idiosyncratic errors of the reduced form are given by αi = (α1i , α2i , α3i )′ and

εit = (ε1it , ε2it , ε3it )′ , where α3i and ε3it are deﬁned in equation (3.5). After replacing α1i , α2i

and α3i by their expressions (3.1) to (3.3) into equations (2.1), (2.3) and (3.5), we obtain the

projection errors of the reduced form as ai = (a1i , a2i , a3i )′ with a3i = γ1 a1i + a3i . Since the

structural form idiosyncratic errors and projection errors are both normally distributed, their

reduced-form counterparts are also normally distributed with means zero and covariance matrices

reduced form is of interest in our analysis.

Model with observed innovation incidence

of equations (2.1)-(2.4) and (2.5b) with j = 1 in equation (2.5b). Unlike in the previous model, we

4     Data and descriptive statistics

The data used in the analysis stem from three waves of the Dutch and the French CIS pertaining

to the manufacturing sector, with the exception of the food industry, for the periods 1994-1996

(CIS 2), 1998-2000 (CIS 3) and 2002-2004 (CIS 4). The Dutch and French CIS data are merged
respectively with data from the Production Survey (PS) and the ‘Enquête Annuelle d’Entreprise’

(EAE) that provide information regarding employment, sales and investment.11 For each CIS,

the merged PS and EAE variables pertain to the last year of the three-year period. We consider

enterprises with at least ten employees and positive sales at the end of each period covered by

the innovation survey.12 Note that one of the particularities of the innovation survey is that, for

each period, product innovation occurrence relates to the introduction of a new product over a

three-year period, while the actual share of innovative sales pertains to the last year of the period.

As a result, a one-period lag corresponds actually to four years, a period suﬃciently long to capture
  10 As a matter of fact, adopting this approach is recommended in this case. Indeed, the indicator function that
relates the observed dependent variable, y1it , to the regressors, which would be used in the likelihood function of
the reduced form, is discontinuous and the maximization of the likelihood function of the reduced form is unfeasible.
  11 Both Dutch surveys were carried out by the ‘Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek’ (CBS) for the whole manu-

facturing sector and the two French surveys by the ‘Service des Statistiques Industrielles’ (SESSI) of the French
Ministry of Industry for the manufacturing sector excluding the food industry.
  12 We delete enterprises with a share of total R&D expenditures (intramural + extramural) in total sales greater

than 50% since they are likely to specialize in doing and trading R&D, hence should be classiﬁed in R&D services
not in manufacturing.

medium- to long-term eﬀects.13 In this paper we consider as innovators only those ﬁrms that have

introduced a product new to the ﬁrm, but not necessarily new to the market.

   In the following Tables 1, 2 and 3, we show some simple descriptive statistics, mostly means,

to present our samples and main variables. Table 1 shows, for both countries, the patterns of

enterprises’ presence in the unbalanced panel after data cleaning. Because of the dynamic structure

of the model, an enterprise must be present in at least two consecutive waves of the merged data in

order to be included in the analysis. There are 1920 such enterprises in our sample for France and

1228 for The Netherlands. In both countries about one third of the total number of enterprises are

present in the three waves.

   For each pattern, we report the mean and median employment head counts in the sample and in

the population where the head counts in the population are obtained by weighting head counts in
the sample using a raising factor obtained after correcting for non-response. Because of the lower

cut-oﬀ points in The Netherlands and possibly diﬀerences in the rates of non-responses in the two

countries, the diﬀerences in average ﬁrm size between the sample and the population are larger for

France than for The Netherlands. These diﬀerences are, however, smaller in the balanced panel,

which is to be expected since ﬁrms larger than the cut-oﬀ points are all included in the samples

and are also more likely to survive during the whole period 1994-2004. Using the unbalanced panel

allows us to obtain more precise estimates as more observations for broader types of enterprises

are used and also to control partly for survivorship biases as enterprises are allowed to enter and

exit the sample at any period. Overall French enterprises are signiﬁcantly larger than the Dutch

ones both in the sample and in the population, in the balanced as well as in the unbalanced panel.

              Pattern refers to the presence/absence of   ﬁrms in the three successive waves.
  13 The CIS, PS and EAE data are collected at the enterprise level. A combination of a census and a stratiﬁed

random sampling is used for each wave of the CIS and the PS. A census is used for the population of Dutch
enterprises with at least 50 employees, and a stratiﬁed random sampling is used for enterprises with less than 50
employees, where the stratum variables are the enterprise economic activity and employment in head counts. The
same cut-oﬀ point of 50 employees is applied to each wave of the Dutch CIS and the PS. A similar scheme is used
for the French CIS but a cut-oﬀ point of 500 employees is used in CIS 2 and 3, and one of 250 employees in CIS 4.
The use of diﬀerent cut-oﬀ points in the census/sampling scheme may result in diﬀerences across countries in the
average size of enterprises in our samples and may aﬀect our estimates. If we had aligned the Dutch sampling with
the French sampling we would have lost too many observations for the Netherlands. In the EAE, all enterprises
with at least 20 employees are surveyed.

    Table 2 gives the means of the non-transformed dependent and explanatory variables for the

unbalanced samples and for the subsamples of product innovators. Comparing ﬁrst all enterprises

with product innovators, it appears that in both countries product innovators do not seem to

be more productive on average. This is due to the existence among non-product innovators of

a few ﬁrms with very high values of sales per employee. When we take the logarithms of sales

per employee, as we do in our estimating equations, we downweigh outlier values and obtain

signiﬁcantly higher productivities for product innovators in both countries. We also observe that

on average in both countries product innovators are larger in terms of employment and have a

larger market share.

    Comparing now the two countries, we see that Dutch enterprises, either overall or for product

innovators only, have on average much higher physical investments per employee, larger market
shares but smaller sales per employee than their French counterparts. We also see that the Dutch

innovators have on average a signiﬁcantly higher share of innovative sales but a signiﬁcantly lower

mean R&D per employee than French innovators. It is ﬁnally interesting to note that in France the

majority of product innovators and non-innovators are very large in contrast to The Netherlands

where they are mostly medium-sized enterprises.

   Product innovators are ﬁrms that introduce product innovations at least once over the sample period. They do
 not necessarily do so in all three waves. The ﬁgures represent shares for the dummy variables, i.e., the size class

    Table 3 gives the same statistics as Table 2 but separately for each period of our unbalanced

  14 For each country, the ﬁgures of the various columns of Table 3 are not straightforwardly comparable as there may

be a “wave” eﬀect due to cyclical eﬀects or changes in the wording or in the sampling scheme of the questionnaire.
It is therefore important to control for this eﬀect by including wave-speciﬁc dummies, which we achieve in the
estimation of the various models.

share of innovative sales between the last two periods for France is not large enough to oﬀset the

large decrease that occurs between the ﬁrst two periods. We also see, for both countries, a strong

increase in the mean nominal sales per employee and in the mean market share between 1994 and

2004, while on average employment decreases for France and increases for The Netherlands. The

growth that we observe in the mean R&D and physical investment per employee between 1994

and 2004 is relatively modest (and only statistically signiﬁcant for The Netherlands). Although

the diﬀerences between the means of the main variables across countries are informative, it is

important to keep in mind that our estimates are not based on the diﬀerences of most of such

means but on diﬀerences within the two countries, four industry categories as well as within wave

survey patterns, since we estimate our models separately for France and The Netherlands and we

control for ﬁrm eﬀects and also include industry and time dummies in all the model equations, as
explained in Section 2.

5       Estimation results

We now turn to the results of the estimation of the models. We shall ﬁrst brieﬂy comment on the

general results before discussing the core results of interest, namely the estimated eﬀects of innova-

tion output on productivity and the dynamic interrelations between innovation and productivity.

Tables 4 and 5 present the estimation results for the model with latent innovation as a predictor of

labor productivity, and Tables 6 and 7 present the results for the model with observed innovation

5.1     Determinants of innovation and productivity

It is ﬁrst of all remarkable and comforting to notice that the results are quite consistent and robust
across speciﬁcations. We shall return to this ﬁnding in the next subsection. For now, let us take

advantage of it by commenting jointly on the results from the four speciﬁcations.

    Tables 4 to 7 show that large ﬁrms are more likely to be product innovators in France while no

such evidence is found for Dutch manufacturing.16 Size does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the innovation

intensities among innovators, a typical result mentioned in Mairesse and Mohnen (2010). A dou-

bling of the very low average market share from 1.5% to 3% is associated to a 3 percentage point

higher propensity to innovate in products and a 4 to 10 percent higher share in total sales due to

new products.17

    Overall we ﬁnd evidence of a lagged impact of R&D on innovation. Both in France and in The

Netherlands, enterprises that declare undertaking R&D continuously during the previous two to

four years are more likely to be product innovators and attain a larger share of innovative sales.

The eﬀect of a higher intensity of R&D on present innovation is stronger and more signiﬁcant in

The Netherlands than in France. The estimates show that Dutch ﬁrms with a 1% higher R&D

intensity four years earlier show a 7% higher probability of being a product innovator today, and a

0.13% higher share of innovative sales. The estimates are lower for France where a 1% increase in

R&D intensity four years earlier does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the probability to innovate, although
it corresponds to an increase in the share of innovative sales of about 0.7% (and signiﬁcant at the

10% level).18

    The estimated output elasticities of labor and physical capital are all statistically signiﬁcant and

their orders of magnitude are not unreasonable. The coeﬃcient of the log of employment reveals

that the scale elasticity is around 0.97 in France and around 0.93 in The Netherlands, pointing to

slightly decreasing returns to scale. If we subtract the estimated capital elasticity (0.065 for France

and 0.120 for The Netherlands) and assume an output elasticity of materials of 0.5,19 we obtain

an output elasticity of labor of around 0.40 in France and 0.31 in The Netherlands.20
   16 Since the reference size category consists of ﬁrms with more than 500 employees, the negative signs for the other

categories indicate a positive size eﬀect.
   17 The marginal eﬀects on the probability of the average ﬁrm to become a product innovator, reported in Tables

4-7, are obtained in the usual way, (see Greene, 2011, page 689). Similarly, the marginal eﬀects in the equation of
the share of innovative sales are given by derivating E(y2it |y1it = 1). The expression of this conditional expectation
is given in Greene (2011, page 873).
   18 To have a better appreciation of the time span between R&D investment and innovation success, we would of

course need a longer and yearly panel allowing us to estimate a distributed lag model, along the lines for example
of Pakes and Griliches (1980) and Hall et al. (1986) as regards R&D and patents.
   19 Assuming that materials account for half of the value of output growth and are priced at their marginal

productivity, we approximate the output elasticity of materials at 0.5. Unfortunately, we do not have data on
materials to estimate their output elasticity.
   20 If the capital stock follows the perpetual inventory formula and its growth rate (g) is constant over time, then

it can be shown that log(It ) = log[1 − (1 − δ)/(1 + g)] + log(Kt ). The estimated investment elasticity would then
not be very diﬀerent from the estimated capital stock elasticity.



                                                          19
5.2     The eﬀects of innovation output on labor productivity

Table 8 compares the four sets of elasticities and semi-elasticities of labor productivity with respect
to innovation from Tables 4 to 7, testing on the one hand their equality in the two countries for each

speciﬁcation, and on the other hand the equivalence of the latent and observed model speciﬁcations.

To be more precise we test whether the models with latent and observed innovation output in the

labor productivity equation are equally close to the ‘true’ unknown model. All these elasticities are

positive and highly statistically signiﬁcant except in the case of the observed innovation indicator

for France.

    To be more precise we can make the following remarks. Firstly, these estimates are statisti-

cally diﬀerent in the two countries only in the speciﬁcation with observed innovation. A product

innovator has on average a 20% higher labor productivity than a non-innovator in Dutch man-

ufacturing and a 6% higher labor productivity in French manufacturing. By contrast, in French

manufacturing a 1% increase in the share of innovative sales raises labor productivity on average

by 0.12%, compared to 0.05% in Dutch manufacturing. Labor productivity is more responsive to

increases in product innovation in French than in Dutch manufacturing enterprises.

    Secondly, using Vuong’s (1989) LR test for non-nested hypotheses, we conclude that the models,

with respectively latent and observed innovation output in the labor productivity equation, are

equally close to the ‘true’ unknown model. This result contrasts with that for France by Duguet
(2006) who used a similar test by Davidson and MacKinnon (1981) to conclude that observed

innovation is a better predictor of TFP growth than latent innovation. A likely reason for the

diﬀerence may be that the two-step estimation procedure used by Duguet (2006) ignores the

correlation between the errors in the innovation and productivity equations. In our case, there may

be little diﬀerence between the latent and observed innovation output speciﬁcation because the

modeling of the endogeneity of innovation on the basis of a latent variable is in any case contained

in the combined likelihood function, whether we use latent or observed innovation indicators in

the productivity equation. As for the similarity in the results when using a dichotomous or a

continuous measure of innovation, the explanation could reside in the fact that, with the exception

of the lagged dependent variables and the initial values, we use the same explanatory variables

in both equations. However, in the absence of a full-ﬂedged theoretical model, there is no reason

why these explanatory variables should be diﬀerent as identiﬁcation of the parameters is already

guaranteed by the inclusion of the lagged dependent variables and the initial conditions that are

diﬀerent in both equations.21
  21 Lööf (2005) proposes a set of variables that can potentially be used to explain diﬀerently the occurrence of

product innovation and the innovation intensity. These variables, however, are not available in all three waves of the
data for both countries (e.g. human capital, location of main customers) or are only available for innovative ﬁrms


                                                         20
      We corroborate the ﬁnding of Mairesse et al. (2005) that the estimates of innovation output

in the productivity equation are signiﬁcant only when the endogeneity of innovation is properly

taken into account. For instance, when innovation is treated as exogenous in the productivity

equation, the semi-elasticity of labor productivity with respect to innovation occurrence drops

from 20% to 4% and becomes statistically insigniﬁcant in Dutch manufacturing, and the elasticity

of labor productivity with respect to the observed share of innovative sales decreases from 0.12% to

0.01% in French manufacturing (results not tabulated but available upon request). In our analysis,

the endogeneity of innovation output in the labor productivity equation operates in both types

of models largely through the covariance matrices of the individual eﬀects and the idiosyncratic

errors. The correlations between innovation output and labor productivity, ρε1 ε3 and ρε2 ε3 , being in

general statistically signiﬁcant, the null hypothesis of exogeneity of the innovation output regressor
in the labor productivity equation is clearly rejected at any conventional signiﬁcance level using a

Wald or an LR test.

5.3        Covariance matrix of residuals

In order to capture enterprises’ unobserved ability to be innovative and productive we account for

individual eﬀects in each equation of the model. Likelihood ratio (LR) tests reject the absence of

individual eﬀects at the 1% level of signiﬁcance.22 The standard error for the individual eﬀects

explains at least one quarter of the total standard error in each equation. The correlation between
(e.g. partnership in innovation activities).

the unobserved individual eﬀects in the innovation propensity and the innovation intensity equa-

tions is positive and rather high (around 0.5) as expected. Similar omitted variables explain the

occurrence and the intensity of product innovation. The correlations between the idiosyncratic

eﬀects in the two equations after accounting for dynamics, common determinants and individual

eﬀects are so high that we have diﬃculties to estimate them precisely and are forced to ﬁx their

values at 0.99 for France and 0.95 for the Netherlands to avoid convergence problems in the iter-

ative search for a maximum likelihood. There is no signiﬁcant correlation between the individual

eﬀects in the productivity and the innovation equations. Instead, we observe a negative and statis-

tically signiﬁcant correlation, in both countries and in all speciﬁcations, between the idiosyncratic

error terms in the innovation and the labor productivity equations. This phenomenon could be

explained by a missing adjustment cost term: in order to innovate, enterprises may need to increase
their personnel, which in the short run may lead to a decrease in labor productivity because of

adjustment costs and time to learn.


5.4    The dynamics of innovation and productivity

Let us now turn to the central issues of the paper, namely the persistence of innovation and labor

productivity and the direction of causality between innovation and productivity.


Persistence in innovation


   In order to assess whether there is true persistence in innovation, as deﬁned in the econometric

literature on panel data, it is important to control for individual eﬀects and initial conditions (Hsiao,

2003). In our case, given that our panels are unbalanced with two or three consecutive observations

by ﬁrm, we have an additional diﬃculty of disentangling the eﬀect of the lagged dependent variable

and of the initial conditions. Indeed, the initial values of the dependent variable on which we must

project the individual eﬀects correspond to a two-period lag for enterprises that are present in

all three periods but to a one period lag for those that are present in only two adjacent periods.

For the latter, the lagged dependent variable is the same as the initial value and therefore the

associated coeﬃcient picks up the sum of the two eﬀects. Without imposing this constraint, we

notice that, as expected, the slope of the initial value for the 2-wave unbalanced panel is practically

equal to the sum of the initial value for the 3-wave balanced panel and the one period lagged eﬀect.

   As can be seen in Tables 4 to 7, our results show no evidence of true persistence in product

innovation in Dutch manufacturing neither for the occurrence nor for the intensity of innovation.
In other words, once individual eﬀects and the occurrence and the intensity of innovation in the

initial period are controlled for, achieving successful innovations and generating innovative sales


                                                   22
are no longer time dependent in Dutch manufacturing. In contrast, in French manufacturing there

is some evidence in support of the ‘success breeds success’ hypothesis. Nevertheless, the evidence

remains weak as the one-period lagged innovation has less of an eﬀect than innovation in the initial

period. By way of comparison, Raymond et al. (2010) found evidence of true innovation persistence

in Dutch manufacturing but over a diﬀerent time span and only for enterprises operating in high-

technology sectors. True persistence in the occurrence of product or process innovation was found

by Peters (2009) for German manufacturing and service ﬁrms and by Huergo and Moreno (2011)

for Spanish manufacturing ﬁrms. The last two studies, however, only use binary variables on

innovation. The major diﬀerence between these speciﬁcations and the present one is that none of

the previous speciﬁcations estimates the innovation and the productivity equations simultaneously

with a contemporaneous correlation between the corresponding error terms.


Persistence in productivity


   For both countries we ﬁnd very strong evidence of true persistence in labor productivity in

all speciﬁcations. Even after controlling for individual eﬀects and initial productivity, one period

lagged productivity conditions current productivity. The fact that highly productive ﬁrms tend to

remain productive and less productive ﬁrms remain less productive is normally taken up by the

initial condition characterizing the individual eﬀect. The lagged productivity term could reﬂect

the inﬂuence of a slowly decreasing stock of knowledge, which is not explicitly modeled but shows

up in the persistence of productivity (see Klette, 1996; Klette and Johansen, 1998; Lokshin et al.,

2008). Part of the persistence of productivity could also reﬂect persistence in ﬁrm market power
given that we have to rely on a revenue measure of productivity in the absence of ﬁrm level price

information to deﬂate gross output. The diﬀerences of persistence in innovation and productivity

could also be due to errors of speciﬁcation in our models, such as large random errors in the

innovation measures or important missing factors in the productivity equation, for example skills,

management practices and organizational characteristics.


Causality


   In both countries, there is clear evidence of a unidirectional causality running from innova-

tion to labor productivity during the period that we examine. In other words, four-year lagged
R&D has a positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on current innovation output which is positively and

signiﬁcantly aﬀected by past innovation output and has a positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on labor

productivity. We also estimate variants of the CDM model where labor productivity (eqs. (2.5a)-

(2.5b)) is explained by innovation output in period t and R&D intensity in period t − 1. While


                                                23
innovation output is signiﬁcant in all speciﬁcations, the direct eﬀect of R&D on labor productivity

is insigniﬁcant.23 In contrast, the lagged feedback eﬀect of labor productivity on innovation is not

economically nor statistically signiﬁcant. This result suggests that the most productive enterprises

at period t − 1 do not necessarily invest more in R&D at period t.24 This ﬁnding of unidirectional

causality seems to be new in the empirical literature. It is robust across the four speciﬁcations and

for the two countries.

    Furthermore, as can be seen from the estimates documented in Appendix D, enterprises that

were four years earlier closer to the technological frontier, deﬁned in terms of labor productivity,

are not more successful in achieving innovations nor in attaining a larger share of innovative sales.

This result conﬁrms the absence of a feedback eﬀect of labor productivity, more precisely eﬃciency,

on innovation.


Robustness analysis


    Table 9 presents the estimation results for the model with latent innovation propensity as a

predictor of labor productivity and radical innovation (i.e. product new the market) as a measure

of innovation output. Our results on the persistence of innovation and labor productivity and the

direction of causality between innovation and productivity are conﬁrmed in this speciﬁcation.25



6     Conclusion

We have in this study examined whether French and Dutch manufacturing ﬁrms display persistence

in innovation and productivity, whether innovation Granger causes productivity or whether the

reverse holds, whether the dynamics in the R&D-innovation-productivity relationship diﬀers be-

tween French and Dutch manufacturing ﬁrms, and ﬁnally whether models with observed or latent,

qualitative or quantitative, innovation indicators yield diﬀerent estimation results. To do so, we

have used unbalanced panels of French and Dutch manufacturing ﬁrms resulting from three waves

of the respective Community Innovation Surveys. With few exceptions, the results we obtain are

not very diﬀerent for the two countries and are robust to various speciﬁcations of the innovation-
productivity relationship. As in many related studies based on cross-sectional ﬁrm data, we ﬁnd
  23 The estimation results of these variants are not reported but can be obtained upon request. We thank an

anonymous referee for pointing this out.
  24 Estimation results from regressions explaining R&D at period t by productivity at period t − 1 are not reported

but can be obtained upon request.
  25 To save space, we do not report the estimation results for the model with radical innovation as a measure of

innovation output and latent innovation intensity and observed innovation (indicator and intensity) as predictors of
labor productivity. The results are similar to those of Table 9 and available upon request.
  Some studies consider process innovation, product innovation or a combination to explain labor productivities.
They usually face identiﬁcation problems as product and process innovation are highly correlated (see for instance
Hall et al., 2013).

We ﬁnd weak, if any, evidence of persistence in product innovation, but strong evidence of persis-

tence in labor productivity levels. Both the occurrence and the intensity of product innovation play

an important role in enhancing ﬁrm labor productivity. Past productivity does not, however, aﬀect

product innovation signiﬁcantly. Thus, our results provide evidence of a unidirectional causality

running from innovation to productivity, without a feedback eﬀect, and of a strong persistence

in productivity but not in innovation. Our results are robust to diﬀerent ways of modeling and

estimating and hold for both countries.

   In order to assess the generality of the result, it would be interesting to estimate the same

model on more country data and longer periods, which will become possible with additional waves

of innovation surveys in many countries. With the decision, at least in the European Union, to

hold innovation surveys every two years, it would be worthwhile in the future to re-estimate this
model with shorter lags (two years instead of four) and see whether the conclusions regarding the

dynamics of innovation still hold. Productivity increases could also be due to process innovation.

The introduction of process (and possibly other forms of) innovation would require one or more

additional equations, a challenging but not impossible task.

After obtaining the conditional likelihood functions shown in equations (3.13) and (3.14), the next
step consists in deriving the unconditional counterparts to l1i|ai and l2i|ai , which are obtained by

integrating out respectively ai and ai with respect to their normal distribution. Formally,

 Evidently, l1 and l2 cannot be derived analytically. Hence, we use Gauss-Hermite quadrature

sequentially, along the lines of Raymond (2007), to evaluate the triple integrals.26 The Gauss-

Hermite quadrature states that

where wm and am are respectively the weights and abscissae of the quadrature with M being the

total number of integration points.27 Numerical tables with values of wm and am are formulated

in mathematical textbooks (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1964). The larger M , the more accurate the

approximation.

  26 The use of this numerical method is well documented in the econometric literature in the context of panel data

single-equation models (see e.g. Butler and Moﬃtt, 1982; Rabe-Hesketh et al., 2005). However, its use in the context
of panel data models with multiple equations remains to date limited. A few exceptions are Raymond (2007, chapter
3) who studies the performance of the method in two types of dynamic sample selection models, and Raymond et al.
(2010) who apply the method to estimate the persistence of innovation incidence and innovation intensity.

resulting expression of H1 (a3i |...) into equation (A.7) and apply again the quadrature formula.

the structural parameters of the model where y1it enters the APF are obtained by maximizing
ln l1 subject to the constraints deﬁned in equations (3.7a)-(3.7c).

      The evaluation of l2 is done in a similar fashion and yields a similar expression except that the

underlined parameters are replaced by their non-underlined equivalents and that γ1 A1it is replaced

by γ1 y1it . The FIML estimates of the structural parameters of the model where y1it enters the

APF are obtained by maximizing ln l2 without additional constraints.

      The performance of the Gauss-Hermite quadrature is worth mentioning. It is known to be

inaccurate if the panel size, Ti , or intraclass correlation, also known as equicorrelation, is large.28

For instance, Rabe-Hesketh et al. (2005) show that, in the context of a random-eﬀect probit,

the quadrature yields biased estimates when Ti = 10 with an equicorrelation of 0.9, or for any

equicorrelation greater than or equal to 0.45 when Ti = 100 (see also Lee, 2000). However,

Raymond (2007, chapter 3) shows that the quadrature works very well in the context of dynamic

sample selection models with a panel of small size (Ti = 4) and equicorrelation between 0.3 and

0.5, the latter range being that of the equicorrelation when these models are estimated on the

Dutch innovation survey data. Thus, we expect the quadrature to produce accurate estimates.29

Evidently, we would need to carry out Monte Carlo analyses that use our nonlinear dynamic

simultaneous equations models as a benchmark in order to assess the extent of the accuracy of the

quadrature in these models. This is beyond the scope of our analysis and is left for future research.

The likelihood function of this model is similar to l1 except that γ1 A1it is replaced by γ2 A2it where

A2it is deﬁned in equation (3.11a). The FIML estimates of the structural parameters are obtained

by maximizing the log-likelihood subject to the constraints (B.2a)-(B.2c) in lieu of (3.7a)-(3.7c).


Model with observed share of innovative sales


   The model with observed share of innovative sales as a predictor of labor productivity consists

of equations (2.1)-(2.4) and (2.5b) with j = 2 in equation (2.5b). The likelihood function of this

model is similar to l1 except that the underlined parameters are replaced by their non-underlined
equivalents and that γ1 A1it is replaced by γ2 y2it . The FIML estimates of the structural parameters

of this model are obtained by maximizing the log-likelihood with no additional constraints.
  29 The equicorrelation is about 0.1 when the dynamic sample selection models are estimated on the French inno-

vation survey data. Thus, the poor performance of the Gauss-Hermite quadrature is even less of an issue.

Appendix C                   Labor productivity elasticity of the share of

                             innovative sales

Let the productivity equation be written as


                                         ln(y3t ) = γ2 logit(y2t ) + ... + ε3t ,                                 (C.1)

                                                                                                           (           )
                                                                                                                y2t
where y3t denotes productivity, y2t denotes the share of innovative sales and logit(y2t ) = ln                 1−y2t       .30
The labor productivity elasticity of the share of innovative sales, denoted by Ely3t ,y2t , is by deﬁni-

tion ∂ ln(y3t )/∂ ln(y2t ) and is derived as

                                             ∂ ln(y3t ) ∂ logit(y2t )      ∂ logit(y2t )
                             Ely3t ,y2t =                             = γ2               .
                                            ∂ logit(y2t ) ∂ ln(y2t )        ∂ ln(y2t )

By making the variable change v2t = ln(y2t ) and writing


                                            logit(y2t ) = v2t − ln [1 − ev2t ] ,                                 (C.2)


we can derive ∂ logit(y2t )/∂ ln(y2t ) as

                               ∂ logit(y2t )   ∂ logit(y2t )     1          1
                                             =               =         =         .                               (C.3)
                                ∂ ln(y2t )         ∂v2t        1−e v2t   1 − y2t

The elasticity is then written as
                                                                   γ2
                                                  Ely3t ,y2t =                                                   (C.4)
                                                                 1 − y2t

and is to be evaluated at values of interest (e.g. sample mean) of the share of innovative sales (in

level). When the latent share of innovative sales enters the productivity equation, we evaluate this

elasticity at predicted values of interest of the latent share of innovative sales.

   Since Ely3t ,y2t is a linear function of γ2 , the standard error of the estimated elasticity is straight-

forwardly obtained as
                                                  c y ,y ) =       S.E.(γb2 )

   The notion of technological frontier is mostly used in the macroeconomic literature on growth

convergence. Among various testable hypotheses one is that innovation becomes more important

as an economy approaches the world technology frontier (see e.g. Acemoglu et al., 2003, 2006). We

can identify in each 3-digit industry the enterprise with the largest productivity and then deﬁne

for each enterprise a technology gap variable as the diﬀerence between the largest productivity

within each 3-digit industry and the productivity of the enterprise belonging to that industry.

Then, looking at the distribution (within each industry) of the technology gap variable, we deﬁne

three dummy variables    DQ
                            2
                                ,   DQ
                                       3
                                           and   DQ
                                                    4
                                                        which take the value one if the technology gap lies

respectively between the ﬁrst (>) and second quartile (≤), the second (>) and the third quartile

(≤), and above (>) the third quartile. The dummy variable                  DQ ,
                                                                             1
                                                                                  which takes the value one if the

technology gap lies below or at the ﬁrst quartile, is used as the reference. Firms for which                 DQ
                                                                                                                1


is equal to one are the closest to the technological frontier. If the above-mentioned hypothesis is
satisﬁed, we expect the eﬀects of          DQ , DQ
                                             2    3
                                                        and   DQ
                                                                 4
                                                                     to be negative and statistically signiﬁcant.

We consider the lagged values of the dummy variables in the estimation for the same reason as for

the market share regressor. Furthermore, these dummy variables capture not only the distance to

technological frontier but also a type of (indirect) feedback eﬀect of productivity on innovation. As

a result, in order to avoid multicollinearity problems, whenever these dummy variables are included

in the estimation, the above-mentioned feedback eﬀect of productivity is ignored, i.e. we assume

ϑ13 = ϑ23 = 0.

   Since the results with the distance to frontier regressors are very similar across model speciﬁ-

cations, we report them only for the model with the innovation propensity as a predictor of labor

productivity (see Table 10). In other words, we still observe a unidirectional causality running

from innovation to productivity with the lagged distance to frontier dummies being insigniﬁcant.

The remaining estimation results can be obtained upon request.
