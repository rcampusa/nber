                                           ABSTRACT

Over the past few years, adult use of e-cigs has been increasing while adult smoking has been
declining. Although there is a negative time correlation, it is important to determine if there is a
causal effect of e-cig use on smoking. This is important because of the known health hazards
associated with smoking. A key concern with most prior studies of e-cigs and smoking is that
causality between e-cig use and cigarette use is ignored. One contribution of this paper is to
estimate structural and reduced form equations that replace e-cig use with e-cig price in order to
avoid this endogeneity problem. The data employed to estimate the empirical models come from
the Tobacco Use Supplements (TUS). These data are from the combined July 2014, January
2015 and May 2015 waves of the TUS. The results show that e-cig use increases the probability
of a quit attempt, the probability of a quit failure, the number of quit failures and the probability
of a quit success. It is also estimated that a 10% federal excise tax on e-cigs would reduce the
number of quitters in the US by more than 250,000 per year.

1. Introduction

        There are a number of devices on the market today that deliver a dose of nicotine in

vapor form to the user. These devices will be referred to as e-cigarettes (e-cigs) where the ‘e’

stands for electronic. 1 The first e-cigs were disposable and designed to resemble cigarettes.

Today, refillable devices, which do not closely resemble cigarettes, are more common. A

popular current device with the brand name Juul most closely resembles a flash drive. In all e-

cigs a liquid containing propylene glycol and usually containing nicotine and sometimes

containing added flavorings is vaporized by a battery powered heating element. There is no

research on long-term health issues related to e-cig use, however, e-cigs are currently believed

to be less dangerous than cigarettes because the vapor does not contain the toxins found in the

smoke of a conventional cigarette (Goniewicz; et al. 2013; Czogala et al. 2014). The US

National Institute on Drug Abuse states that because e-cigs deliver nicotine without burning

tobacco, they appear to be a safer, less toxic alternative to conventional cigarettes. 2 The UK

Public Health Department has taken a more definitive view and stated that e-cigs are

significantly less harmful to health than tobacco.

        Adult use of e-cigs has increased from 0.3% in 2010 to 3.2% in 2016 while adult

smoking declined from 20.9% in 2005 to 15.1% in 2015. These time series cannot be

interpreted as evidence that the use of e-cigs has causal effects on smoking. However, the

effect of e-cig use on smoking is an important public health question because smoking is known

to be hazardous. Although the public health impact of e-cigs depends on their effect on

smoking, seven states have already passed legislation that requires a tax on e-cigarettes, which

will deter the use of e-cigs. 3

Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Also, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have a tax.

2. Prior Studies

       One group of prior studies finds that e-cigs are associated with reduced smoking. Zhu et

al. (2017) finds that those who report use of e-cigs had a higher smoking cessation rate than

those who report no use of e-cigs. They relied on data from the Tobacco Use Supplements.

Brown et al. (2014) assessed the effectiveness of e-cigs when used to aid smoking cessation in

comparison with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and with unaided quitting. They rely on a

cross-sectional survey of the English population that includes 5863 adults who had smoked

within the previous 12 months and made at least one quit attempt during that period with either

e-cigs, NRT or no aid. They found that e-cig users were more likely to report abstinence than

either those who used NRT or no aid. That is, e-cig users were more likely to have quit smoking

than either the users of NRT or those using no aid. Zhuang et al. (2016) argue that a common

pattern is dual cigarette and e-cig use and that this dual use might delay the cessation of

cigarette smoking. They rely on a nationally representative sample of 2028 US smokers from

2012 and 2014. Long-term e-cig use was defined as using e-cigs at baseline and follow-up.

Use of e-cigs only at baseline or at follow-up was defined as short-term use. Non-users are

defined as those that did not use e-cigs at either survey. Quit attempt rates and cessation rates

were compared across the three groups. At the follow-up, long-term e-cig users had a higher

quit attempt rate and a higher cessation rate than either short-term users or non-users. Among

those making a quit attempt, use of e-cigs as a cessation aid surpassed that of FDA-approved

pharmacotherapy. They conclude that short-term e-cig use was associated with a lower rate of

smoking cessation but that long-term use of e-cigs was associated with a higher rate of smoking

cessation.

       Another group of studies finds that e-cigs are not associated with reduced smoking.

Grana, Benowitz, and Glantz (2014) have argued that although e-cig use may reduce smoking it

also may inhibit complete smoking cessation. Kalkhoran and Glantz (2016) provide a review of

papers that attempt to assess the relationship between e-cig use and smoking cessation by

                                                2
adult smokers. The question they are interested in is whether cigarette smokers who report e-

cig use have a higher or lower probability of quitting smoking. They found 38 studies including

two randomized controlled trials. These studies include Brown et al. (2014) referenced above.

The two randomized controlled trials showed that e-cigs increased the probability of quitting.

However, these studies relied on relatively small samples. Kalkhoran and Glantz (2016)

conclude that these studies as a group predict that the probability of a successful quit is 28%

lower for those who used e-cigs compared with those who did not use e-cigs. That is, e-cig use

is associated with significantly less quitting among smokers.



3. Approach

        A key concern with most prior studies of e-cigs and smoking is that endogeneity

between e-cig use and cigarette use is ignored. There could be causality in both directions or

use of both products could be driven by the same underlying unobserved factor. An example of

an underlying unobserved factor is a desire to quit smoking, which is related to the demand for

health. A greater unobserved desire to quit for health reasons could increase e-cigarette use

and increase quits with no causal effect of e-cigs on quitting. Alternatively, an unobserved

demand for nicotine might result in both greater e-cig use and a reduced probability of quitting

smoking. This is seen in the case of smokers who use e-cigs in places where smoking is not

allowed, which reduces the necessity to quit. Either dual causality or underlying unobserved

factors will bias the estimation results. One contribution of this paper is to estimate structural

and reduced form equations in order to avoid this endogeneity problem. The most relevant

outcome is successful quitting but the effect of e-cigs on attempts to quit can provide more

insight into the process. Because attempts can result in either failure or success, we also

estimate the effect of e-cigs on failures to quit. 4


4E-cigs could also affect the probability of starting to smoke although this is mainly limited to adolescents.
This project focuses on adults so the question of initiation is not relevant.

                                                       3
       The empirical model consists of the following three equations. The first is a standard

demand equation for e-cigs:

       (1) ECIG = E (e-cig prices, cigarette prices, demographics, fixed effects),

The second equation is a quit function, which has also been used in prior studies.

       (2) Quit = Q (ECIG, cigarette prices, demographics, fixed effect).

Because the estimated effect of e-cigs in this quit function is likely to be biased due to

endogeneity between e-cigs and cigarettes, equation (3), which is a reduced form of equations

(1) and (2), is defined with the e-cig variable replaced by determinants of e-cig demand.

       (3) Quit = Q (e-cig prices, cigarette prices, demographics, fixed effect).

The estimation of equation (3) eliminates the endogeneity between quitting and e-cig use in

equation (2). Equation (3) is estimated for all attempts, failed quit attempts, the number of

failed quit attempts and successful quit attempts.

       One concern with this approach is whether the empirical version of equation (1) can be

interpreted as a demand for e-cigs. E-cig prices are a function of supply and demand. We

expect that in a supply and demand model, if demand was held constant, shifts in supply would

reveal an inverse relationship between price and use. In the empirical models, we use a set of

demographic variables, the price of cigarettes and state and time fixed effects to control

demand. Cigarette prices are included in the e-cig demand function as the price of a potentially

related good. The regressions of equation (1) test the relationship between e-cig price and use

and a negative effect of e-cig prices on e-cig use is expected.



4. The Data

       The data employed to estimate the empirical models come from the 2014-2015 Tobacco

Use Supplements (TUS), which are sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and are based

on a subsample of the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey (CPS). The TUS provide an

extensive set of variables regarding tobacco products for adults ages 18 and over. The TUS

                                                 4
began asking questions about e-cig use in 2014 continuing in 2015. The data employed in this

study rely on the combined July 2014, January 2015 and May 2015 waves of the TUS. These

waves of the CPS includes about 450,000 individuals who are eligible for the TUS but only

about 230,000 choose to participate in the TUS. The TUS then limits the survey to those who

respond that they smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime. This reduced the sample

to about 91,000. The TUS has additional screens on who is asked questions about smoking

and e-cig use. 5 All of the quit related variables are defined for individuals who reported that they

smoked last year. The public use version of the TUS identifies counties with a population of

over 100,000. There are 368 identified counties included in the TUS and these counties

represent about 40% of the US population. For simplicity, we will refer to the counties with over

100,000 individuals as urban and the other counties as rural.

       The dependent variables include dichotomous measures of e-cig use, quit attempts,

failed quits and successful quits. A variable measuring the number of failed quits is included in

addition to the dichotomous failed quit variable. This variable includes the value zero for those

who had no quit attempts. Successful attempts are defined as attempts that result in cessation

for 90 days or more.

       Both continuous and dichotomous independent variables were also defined. The

continuous variables measure age, family income (divided by 1,000), number of children and

years of education. The dichotomous variables measure Married, Male, Black, and Hispanic

status. The dichotomous variables are equal to one if the individual is in the category defined

by the variable name.

       Measures of cigarette prices and e-cig prices were extracted from the Nielsen Retail

Scanner data set. The Nielsen data are derived from supermarkets, drugstores convenience


5 For example, the TUS only asks individuals who said they ever used e-cigs if they now use e-cigs with
individuals who never used e-cigs given a missing value. For the e-cig use variable everyone who was
not asked the question because they had responded earlier that they never used e-cigs and who reported
that they smoked last year were recoded from missing to 0.

                                                  5
stores, liquor stores and mass merchandisers. One concern with the price data is that vape

shops are not included. However, it is probable that vape shop prices are highly correlated with

prices in other nearby stores. Another concern is the percent of e-cigs bought by adults on the

internet. According to the 2014-2015 Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Survey

only 9.5% of adults buy their e-cigs online. Thus, retail store prices are probably a good

approximation of actual prices paid by adults. E-cigs come in disposable and reusable forms.

Disposable e-cigs provide fixed amount of nicotine and then must be disposed of. Reusable e-

cigs involve buying a starter kit and then buying replacements. The first e-cigs were disposable

but the reusable form is more common today. The Nielsen Retail Scanner data are limited to 65

large metro areas. Because a number of identified counties had no price data, or very few

reporting stores, average state level prices were used. These state level prices were averaged

at the state and wave level. Thus, the state prices are the average price in the state’s urban

counties only. The regressions are therefore limited to individuals who are identified in the TUS

as living in large counties. So the price variable is a state level variable but reflects only prices

in urban counties, the regressions are limited to individuals in the TUS who live in urban

counties.

       Table 1 presents weighted means and standard errors for the primary variables used in

the analysis for those who used e-cigs and those who did not use e-cigs. The purpose of this

table is to examine the descriptive data on differences between e-cig users and non-users in

quit attempts, failures, number of failures, successes and demographics. The data in Table 1

are very similar to the data presented by Zhu et al. (2017) who also used the TUS. Data are

presented first for those who report using e-cigs and second for those who report not using e-

cigs. The variables quit attempts, failures, number of failures and successes are each defined

as the percent of the full sample, which is everyone who reported smoking last year and lived in

an urban county. For example, for all individuals who reported smoking last year and who lived

in urban counties, about 46% of e-cig users attempted to quit while about 29% of non-e-cig

users attempted to quit. About 36% of the e-cig using sample reported failing and about 10%

reported succeeding. The corresponding values for non-e-cig users are 22% and 7%. Table 1

also shows that adult e-cig users are somewhat older, more likely to be married and less likely

to have minority status than adult non-e-cig users. Table 1 also shows that successful quits as

a percentage of attempts for e-cig users is somewhat smaller than for non-e-cig users. The

values are 21% for e-cig users and 24% for non-e-cig users. The reason that a greater


                                                 7
percentage of e-cig users are successful quitters is that there are more attempts by e-cig users

than non-e-cig users.

       An important statistical question, which is unclear from the descriptive data, is whether

e-cig users differ in their interest in quitting from non-e-cig users. That is, uncontrolled individual

heterogeneity between the groups may influence the data on attempts, failures and successes

reported in table 1. Two sources of heterogeneity described above are the demand for health

and the demand for nicotine. There are four questions in the TUS that provide some insight on

this issue. These questions are asked only of e-cig users about why they use e-cigs. The

questions are: 1) because they are allowed at times when, or in places where, smoking cigarettes

isn't allowed, 2) because they might be less harmful to me than cigarettes, 3) because they

might be less harmful to people around me than cigarettes and 4) because they help people to

quit smoking cigarettes. Response to the first question, which is about the demand for nicotine,

was 57% positive. Responses to the next three questions, which are about the demand for

health, were 75%, 79% and 78% positive, respectively. Non-e-cig users probably view e-cigs

less favorably. Also, table 1 shows that education and income, which are positively correlated

with the demand for health, are both higher for e-cig users than non-e-cig users. These data

suggest that the use of e-cigs is not random but motivated by the demand for nicotine and the

demand for health. The contribution of this paper is to avoid this endogeneity and test for

causal effects of e-cigs on smoking as described in Section 3.

       Table 2 presents weighted means and standard deviations for individuals who reported

smoking last year for urban and for rural counties. The purpose of this table is to examine the

means for these groups because in the empirical work to follow we estimate regressions only for

individuals in urban counties. These data show that the two groups are not significantly different

variation across states and waves in these prices. Cigarette prices vary because of differences

in state excise taxes, transportation costs and retailing costs. E-cigs are only taxed in a few

locations and marketing is typically more at a local level than in the case of cigarettes. E-cig

prices vary across states because of transportation costs, local retailer costs and local

marketing costs. The R-square is from regressions of the price variable on all the fixed effects

used in the regressions presented in tables 4-8. These values show that much of the variations

in price are accounted for by the fixed effects particularly in the case of cigarettes. This

correlation between price and fixed effects can affect the significance levels. The regressions in

                                                 10
tables 4-8 present alternative sets of prices, which provide some test for robustness with

respect to choice of price variables. Dropping the fixed effects would create other concerns.

The bottom of table 3 presents the correlations between the price variables. Some of these

correlations are large and could also present problems with significance in the estimation

models. These data problems are due in some measure to the relative newness of e-cigs which

results in a fairly short time dimension in the data.



5. Results

        Tables 4-8 present the regression results for e-cig demand and for the quit related

variables. All of the regressions include state and wave fixed effects variables and standard

errors clustered at state level. The tables include alternative combinations of cigarette prices,

starter kit prices, replacement prices and disposable prices. Each table presents the same set

of alternative price specifications. All of the regressions also use the same set of non-price

independent variables and are either logits or ordered logits. All of the regressions are based

on individuals who report that they smoked last year and live in urban counties. The reported

values are coefficients not marginal effects. In addition to coefficients, marginal effects and

elasticities are reported for all significant e-cig price variables. 6

        Table 4 presents logit results for e-cig use. In the four regressions presented in table 4

the replacement price is always negative but only significant in one regression. The

replacement price in the other three regressions has relatively low p-values but they are greater

than 0.10. The own price elasticity for e-cig participation based on the second specification and




6 The dependent variables, with one exception are dichotomous. These variables can be interpreted as

rates. The elasticity is the effect of a percentage increase in price on the percentage change in the rate.
For example, if the elasticity were 1, a 10 percent increase in the price would resulted in a 10 percent
decline in the rate and if the rate were .10 it would decline to .09.

the replacement price is estimated at -1.28. This is relatively high compared to own price

elasticity for cigarettes from past studies. The elastic demand suggests that good substitutes

for e-cigs are available. The cigarette price coefficients are positive in the three regressions that

include this variable and significant in two of these regressions. The positive coefficient

suggests substitution between e-cigs and cigarettes. Age, Male, Education and minority status

are all negative and significant. We conclude it is likely that the empirical relationship between

e-cig use and e-cig price is negative and that the relationship between cigarette prices and e-cig

use is positive although greater significance levels would have increased our confidence in this

result.


          Table 5 presents logit estimates on the effect of e-cig prices on quit attempts. The price

of replacements is negative and significant. That is, e-cig use is positively related to the

probability of a quit attempt. Also, Income and Male are negatively related to quit attempts while

Education, Child and Black are positively related to quit attempts. This is similar to the result for

attempts that is shown in table 1 with descriptive data only. That is, e-cig users make more quit

attempts.


          Table 6 presents the logit results for probability of a quit failure and Table 7 presents the

results for the number of quit failures. The regressions for the number of failed quit tries are

order logit regressions because the dependent variable includes four ordered outcomes,

including zero attempts. 7 In all eight regressions, the price of replacements is negative and is

significant in six. There are specific estimates for the marginal effects and for the elasticities for

each outcome of an ordered logit. The values reported are for the outcome 2-3 times. The

results show that e-cig use is positively related to the probability of a quit failure and to the

number of quit failures. As e-cig use goes up the probability of a failed quit goes up and the

number of failed quits goes up because e-cig use increases the number of quit attempts. Most

attempts result in failure but an increase in attempts increases the probability of an ultimate

          Table 8 presents the results for quit successes. The price of replacements is negative

but not significant while the price of starter kits is negative and significant. In the prior

regression, the replacement price was generally significant while the starter kit price was not.

Tests of joint significance show that these two variables are jointly significant at about 5% in the

regressions where they both are included. The regressions show that greater e-cig use

increases the probability of a successful quit. This is consistent with the descriptive data

presented in table 2, which also show that e-cig use increases success. The elasticity for

starter kits was estimated at -1.27 and the elasticity for replacements was estimated at about -

1. Age, Black and Hispanic are negatively related to successes while Education is positively

related to successes.

          A relevant follow-up question is how an e-cig excise tax would affect the number of

successful quits. As noted above seven states and the District of Columbia have taxes on e-

cigs. Many other states have also considered a tax on e-cigs. The Food and Drug

Administration has the authority to regulate e-cigs but this has not yet resulted in a federal

excise taxes on e-cigs. 8 The effect of an e-cig excise tax can be estimated with the elasticities

estimated in table 8. We assume a conservation value of -1.0 and assume a federal excise tax,

increases retail prices by 10%. The elasticities imply that this tax would reduce the

successful quit rate by about 10%. The successful quit rate for all smokers is about 7.3% and a

10% reduction would result in a successful quit rate of about 6.6%. About 36 million Americans

smoke and, assuming that 7.3% successful quits each year, about 2.6 million American

smokers quit each year. 9 A 10% increase in the price of e-cigs would reduce the number of

quitters by about 250,000 smokers.



C. Conclusions

       The results suggest that there is a positive causal effect of e-cig use on attempts to quit

smoking, on failures to quit smoking and on success in quitting smoking, although greater

significance levels would have made a stronger case. The replacement price was generally the

most important e-cig price. The successful quit rate, given an attempt, is actually slightly

smaller for e-cig users than non-e-cig users. The increase in the probability of a successful quit

is the result of more attempts by e-cig users than by non-e-cig users. According to Chaiton et

al. (2016), it can take six or more failed attempts before a smoker has a success. Thus, for

many smokers a successful quit may only come after a number of failed attempts. The

increased probability of an attempt and the increased number of failed attempts during the past

year suggest that e-cig use helps to create this sequential process that leads to cessation.

Overall, the results present a reasonable case for e-cigs as a useful aid to adults who are trying

to quit smoking.




9These losses are somewhat offset by the addition of about 800,000 new smokers each year. These
new smokers are young people some of whom may have begun smoking because of e-cig use as an
adolescent.
