Does the Current Account Still Matter?

                                             ABSTRACT

Do global current account imbalances still matter in a world of deep international financial markets
where gross two-way financial flows often dwarf the net flows measured in the current account? Contrary
to a complete markets or “consenting adults” view of the world, large current account imbalances,
while very possibly warranted by fundamentals and welcome, can also signal elevated macroeconomic
and financial stresses, as was arguably the case in the mid-2000s. Furthermore, the increasingly big
valuation changes in countries’ net international investment positions, while potentially important
in risk allocation, cannot be relied upon systematically to offset the changes in national wealth implied
by the current account. The same factors that dictate careful attention to global imbalances also imply,
however, that data on gross international financial flows and positions are central to any assessment
of financial stability risks. The balance sheet mismatches of leveraged entities provide the most direct
indicators of potential instability, much more so than do global imbalances, though the imbalances
may well be a symptom that deeper financial threats are gathering.

Are discrepancies between national exports and imports ever a legitimate cause for

government concern or intervention? The question is as old as economic theory itself.

Sixteenth-century English writers deplored the drainage of precious metals implied by

deficits in foreign trade; as a result, the term “balance of trade” had entered into public

discourse by the early seventeenth century.1 David Hume’s account in 1752 of the price-

specie-flow mechanism, arguably the greatest set piece of classical monetary economics,

vanquished for many years the mercantilist position that the perpetual accumulation of

external wealth was both desirable and feasible. More than 250 years later, however, the

foreign trade imbalances of national units – including even some that share common

currencies – still figure prominently in debates over economic policy.

         We should not be surprised. Even in an ideal world free of economic frictions,

foreign demand and supply conditions are constraints on the maximal welfare attainable

by the national unit. Its government therefore faces incentives to manipulate those

constraints. In simple neoclassical theory all countries gain from free trade, including

balanced trade, but in a real world permeated with economic and political distortions, a

government’s perceived short-run advantage may be enhanced by policies that enlarge

the trade surplus. Such policies necessarily affect trading partners because a bigger

surplus for one country requires correspondingly smaller ones for all the others. Of

course, it is also quite common that government policies lead to larger deficits, and in

theory, different distortions could result in absolute current account imbalances that are

too small, rather than too big, compared to an efficient benchmark.

current account, see Fetter (1935).

        Policies motivated by purely national advantage may well be collectively

counterproductive if widely undertaken, which is why countries have sought to

coordinate their trade and sometimes macroeconomic and financial policies. Economic

frictions in goods markets and financial markets potentially increase the gains from

policy cooperation, and they also can raise each country’s vulnerability to a range of

internal and external shocks, as well as the strength of spillover effects abroad. While

profitable to the private parties involved, some transactions between sovereign

jurisdictions may exacerbate systemic vulnerabilities, and therefore are legitimate targets

for policymakers’ attention.

        The recent global crisis and its troubled sequel have brought these possibilities

into sharp relief. Some but not all observers link the origin of the crisis to the rapid

increase in economic globalization that preceded it, especially financial globalization.

Nearly everyone, however, acknowledges that stronger financial and trade linkages

helped propagate the crisis across borders.

        Much contentious debate harks back to the debates of Hume’s day by focusing on

the current account balance as a potential conduit for international shock transmission, or

as a carrier of financial vulnerability. A country’s current account is the difference

between its saving and its domestic investment, or, equivalently, between its exports of

goods and services (including income receipts on assets held abroad) and its imports.2

The circumstantial evidence is that the crisis was preceded by historically large “global

imbalances” in current accounts, including big deficits run by a number of industrial

2
 This formula corresponds to Meade’s (1951, p. 7) definition of the “balance of trade.” Strictly speaking,
any balance of unrequited transfers is added to this trade balance to compute the current account balance.
The current account gets its name from its coverage of “current” as opposed to “capital” transactions. Its
position today in United States balance of payments statistics owes to the recommendations of the Review



                                                     2
economies that subsequently came to grief (including the United States). Figure 1 shows

how the dispersion of global current account imbalances grew from the late 1990s

through 2006, the year before the onset of the global crisis.

        But is concern about current account imbalances still warranted in the twenty-first

century? Policymakers certainly seem to think that it is. In 2006 the International

Monetary Fund launched a multilateral consultative process that aimed to promote an

orderly unwinding of large global imbalances. Similar issues have remained on the

agenda of the Group of Twenty countries in the wake of the crisis. And in July 2010 the

European Commission proposed an enhanced surveillance framework for EU members

based on a broad range of indicators of potential macroeconomic imbalances, including

current accounts.3 The latter, unlike the public finances and inflation, figured nowhere in

the Maastricht Treaty’s macroeconomic criteria for entry into the single European

currency.

        What these high-level discussions seem to miss when they focus on current-

account imbalances is the spectacular evolution and integration of international financial

markets over the past quarter century. Global imbalances are financed by complex

multilateral patterns of gross financial flows, flows that are typically much larger than the

current account gaps themselves. These financing patterns raise the question of whether

the generally much smaller net current account balance matters much any more, and, if

so, when and how. They also draw attention to the implications for asset prices and

financial stability of the much larger gross flows, which are intermediated through the



Committee for Balance of Payments Statistics (1965), a group that also stressed the linkage of the concept
to the national income and product accounts, as noted by Cooper (1966).

financial markets of current account deficit and surplus countries alike. Some economists

suggest that the current account is much less important nowadays than policymakers’

continuing attention to global imbalances would suggest.

        Ironically, the two main lines of attack on the importance of the current account

balance both rely on the increasing fluidity and depth of global financial markets, but

they take diametrically opposite views of those markets. To highlight the contrast, I state

both arguments in their most extreme forms.

        The first argument assumes that countries have extensively diversified their

idiosyncratic risks in sophisticated, well-functioning markets for contingent securities. In

this world of virtually complete Arrow-Debreu asset markets, extensive global financial

markets allow countries to pool their risks to the maximum feasible extent. Except when

current account imbalances arise because of excessive government deficits, they

represent optimizing household and firm decisions that support intertemporally efficient

resource allocations and thus do not raise policy concerns.

        The second argument against the continuing relevance of the current account is

less optimistic (to say the least). It is based on the view that risk sharing is inherently

imperfect and that high volumes of international financial activity often reflect skewed

incentives and expectations, tax avoidance or evasion, regulatory arbitrage, implicit

government guarantees, and other distortions. On this view, financial market

imperfections can reinforce each other so as to magnify systematic risks, which

themselves are endogenous to the financial system. This second argument maintains that

the stability impact of current account balances per se is small compared to that of the

gross asset flows that ultimately finance international financial transactions. The bulk of




                                               4
these flows spread interconnected counterparty risks that become acute in a crisis. In any

case, the impact of net current account flows on a country’s net external wealth are

dwarfed by capital gains and losses on increasing gross foreign asset and liability

positions.

       This lecture presents the case that even in today’s world of deep and globalized

financial markets, the national current account balance remains a policy-relevant variable

on both financial and macroeconomic grounds. Nonetheless, I will also argue that while

policymakers must continue to monitor global current accounts, such attention is far from

sufficient to ensure global financial stability. In line with the second view of current

accounts sketched above, large gross financial flows entail potential stability risks that

may be only distantly related, if related at all, to the global configuration of saving-

investment discrepancies. Adequate surveillance requires not only enhanced information

on the nature, size, and direction of gross global financial trades, but better understanding

of how those flows fit together with economic developments (including current account

balances) in the world’s economies, both rich and poor.



                I. International Flows, Stocks, and Budget Constraints



       A basic fact about financial globalization since the early 1990s is that gross

financial flows and gross stocks of foreign assets and liabilities have grown rapidly and

for some countries, explosively. The evolution of gross flows is illustrated by the

experience of the United States, which is a relatively closed economy compared to many

others. The two panels of Figure 2 show the gross payments flows underlying the U.S.




                                              5
current account balance, as well as those that have financed it. Panel (a) shows U.S.

residents’ net purchases of foreign assets and (with a negative sign) foreign residents’ net

purchases of U.S. assets. The algebraic sum of the two series in panel (a) is the net

increase in U.S. foreign assets less the net increase in U.S. foreign liabilities. It equals the

U.S. current account balance (plus the usually small capital account balance) in principle

but not in practice, because of inevitable errors and omissions in the data.4 Panel (b) of

figure 2 shows U.S. exports and imports, together with gross investment income flows

and net transfers. The algebraic sum of the five series shown in the lower panel yields the

current account balance.

           In the mid-1970s, gross financial flows were much smaller than trade flows, but

the former have grown over time and on average now are of comparable magnitude to

trade flows. Of course, international flows of investment income have grown over time as

gross foreign asset and liability stocks positions have grown. Figure 3 illustrates the

explosive growth of those stocks for a selection of countries and country groups, using

the position data assembled by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007), and extended by the

authors through 2010. Let A denote the economy’s gross foreign assets and L its gross

foreign liabilities (both aggregates encompassing the domestic public as well as private

sectors). The data in Figure 3 represent the average of external assets and liabilities,

divided by GDP, or (A + L)/2GDP; for country groups I show the GDP-weighted

average.

           The data indicate a rapid buildup in external positions, especially since the late

1990s, in the wealthier countries. On this measure, Japan’s “financial openness” merely

    The capital account is reserved for a relatively small class of items, such as debt forgiveness.


                                                         6
doubles since the late 1990s, while that of the U.S. triples, to about 1.5 times GDP. The

euro zone’s is higher still, whereas for the countries of Newly Industrialized Asia (Hong

Kong, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan), average openness is about 3 times GDP. Most striking

are the very high numbers for rich European financial hubs such as the Netherlands,

Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. For emerging markets (represented here by the

BRIC countries), financial openness remains much lower, and its growth rate so far is

more moderate.

       What is the relation between the international flows of asset sales and purchases

reported in balance of payments data and the stocks of foreign assets and liabilities? The

conventions governing the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) dictate that

the correspondence is imperfect, and increasingly so as financial globalization has

proceeded. Let CA denote the current account surplus, equal (apart from the generally

insignificant capital account balance) to domestic residents’ net purchases of foreign

assets less foreign residents’ net purchases of domestic assets (the level of financial flows

abroad). Let KGA and KGL be changes in the nominal market values of foreign assets and

liabilities (capital gains terms due to exchange rate and other asset price movements).

Then the overall change in the net international investment position or NIIP, defined as A

− L, is equal to the current account plus net capital gains on the NIIP:


                              A − L = CA + KGA − KGL .……………………………… (1)


       Notice that the net capital gain KGA − KGL is part of income as commonly

conceptualized by economists, but not as measured in the national accounts, just as other

capital gains on wealth do not enter into the NIPA concepts of income or saving. Because

the U.S. external portfolio is long foreign currencies and short U.S. dollars, long foreign


                                              7
equities and short U.S. debt, weakness in the dollar or strength in world equity markets

tends to flatter the NIIP of the United States. But the gains will not be recorded in the

U.S. national income accounts or current account balance.

        Alongside the expanding volume of financial flows shown in Figure 1, an

expanding amplitude of valuation changes on external assets and liabilities has also

driven the dynamics of those stocks. The panels of Figure 4 illustrate the trends since the

early 1970s for six selected countries. The plots display both current account balances

(flow changes) and the changes in national NIIPs that are not attributable to current

account flows (both expressed as percentages of GDP). The increasing volatility trend in

the non-flow changes is exactly what one expects given the steadily expanding ratios to

GDP of gross assets and liabilities, although time variation in the variance of asset-price

shocks also plays a role.5

        The key economic significance of the NIIP is that at any point in time, it limits the

present value of a country’s future net export deficits (not including international

investment income). This national constraint, which governs a country’s feasible

transactions with foreigners, can be viewed as an implication derived from three more

basic relationships.

        The household budget constraint, written in domestic nominal terms, is

  For some earlier references on the role of valuation changes, see Obstfeld (2004). As is discussed further
below, it is not in general correct to attribute the non-flow change in the NIIP entirely to asset-price
movements that are not captured in national income statistics. The procedures generally followed by
national statistical agencies do not always enforce consistency between the NIIP numbers (which can be
subject to large periodic revisions) and the current account numbers, so some part of the non-flow change is
likely to reflect measurement error.

where Y is nominal GDP and I is nominal spending on investment.7 Combining these

  In this and the subsequent government budget constraint I ignore the role of money and seigniorage.
Seigniorage can be significant – for example the Federal Reserves recent operating profits – but I leave it
aside because it will enter the national intertemporal budget constraint [equation (5) below] only when
foreign residents are willing to hold significant quantities of a country’s cash. This is the case mostly for
currencies that play a big role in underground transactions, notably the U.S. dollar, which is dominant in
global black markets as it is in the legitimate sphere.

  The fiscal theory of the price level interprets the government budget constraint, in analogy with the capital
valuation equation, as an equilibrium condition.

        Calculated at world prices, this derived national solvency constraint bites

regardless of the exchange-rate regime. It covers the consolidated public and private

sectors. For example, A comprises foreign exchange reserves that the government

acquires through currency-market interventions, just as L includes domestic sovereign

debt held by foreigners. The constraint shows what is needed for a current account deficit

to be sustainable. If deficits are driving the NIIP downward, then in the absence of

windfall capital gains on national foreign positions, expenditure has to fall or output to

rise in order that the private and public sectors both remain solvent. If sufficient

adjustments in those directions are not politically or technologically feasible, then further

borrowing is simply not sustainable, in the sense that it will ultimately lead to a solvency

crisis somewhere in the economy.

        The role of the NIIP as a limit on the present value of net export surpluses also

shows that its sign, positive or negative determines how a general rise in global rates of

return will impact domestic welfare. When A − L > 0, a rise in global rates of return

generally makes room for larger future net export deficits. When A − L < 0, future net

export surpluses generally must be increased when global rates of return rise in order to

service the negative NIIP.

        The reality of financial globalization requires care in interpreting the national

implications of measured gross positions, however. Several economies host foreign

headquartered financial institutions that have substantial balance sheets. Ireland is a

leading example. But balance of payments data are based on a residence rather than a


                                                       10
nationality principle, so potentially large fractions of gross external assets and liabilities

(and the corresponding net positions) may belong to foreign nationals, and be only

tangentially relevant to domestic nationals’ welfare. Furthermore, the national

government may not find it necessary or desirable to intervene in support of resident

institutions of foreign nationality that encounter financial problems. Nonetheless, in most

cases the NIIP will still offer a reasonably good indicator of national consumption

possibilities.



                     II. Arguments for Neglecting Current Account



The current account is one component of the overall change in the NIIP, and as such, its

direction and absolute size imply changes in the economy’s overall consumption and

investment opportunities, other things equal. Furthermore, because an opposite balance

elsewhere in the world economy must match a given country’s balance, national current

account developments necessarily imply opposite adjustments abroad. Several lines of

argument contend that current account imbalances are essentially self-correcting à la

Hume, or are of second-order policy importance compared to other aspects of

international financial flows.



                                      A. Complete Markets



In economic models with complete international asset markets, the scope for current

account imbalances is likely to be much reduced, while potential negative interactions

between international asset flows and financial market imperfections are absent. In a



                                              11
canonical endowment economy with international borrowing and lending only, a country

experiencing a temporary fall in output will borrow abroad to smooth its consumption,

thereby running a temporary current account deficit. But with complete markets the

adjustment process is entirely different.

    Consider, for example, the famous two-country endowment model of Lucas (1982).

In that (ex ante symmetric) model, two countries swap exactly half the claims on their

stochastic endowments, so that residents of both end up holding identical perfectly

pooled portfolios. In that case, people share the consequences of any endowment shock,

and since these shocks create no ex post wealth asymmetry between the countries, there

is no ex post international asset trade either.

        Complete market models with investment can result in current account deficits or

surpluses, but they are likely to be smaller than in the incomplete market case, sometimes

much smaller. For example, Coeurdacier, Kollmann, and Martin (2010) analyze a model

with equity claims and real consols, an asset structure sufficient to reproduce complete

markets up to a first-order approximation in a model with two shocks, shocks to

productivity and to investment efficiency. In that model (again up to a first-order

approximation), optimal portfolio behavior implies a zero current account as bond flows

always offset equity flows. Other complete-markets models with investment may,

however, imply nonzero current accounts. For example, when new firms are born in a

country, equity shares in them must be distributed to foreign investors via a net financial

inflow, or current account deficit.




                                              12
           Clearly such scenarios, with or without investment, provide no basis for

efficiency-enhancing policy intervention. On the other hand, empirical support for the

complete-markets hypothesis is, to put it charitably, weak.




              B. “Consenting Adults”: The Lawson Doctrine and the Pitchford Thesis



An alternative case for neglect holds that optimizing, forward-looking households and

firms – of the type that Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996), for example, model – will generate

current account balances consistent with efficient resource allocation, provided the

public-sector deficit is not excessive. Such imbalances can be expected to adjust toward

moderate levels over time, and in an orderly fashion, as firms exhaust the most

productive investment projects and as households shrink spending consistent with

declining wealth. This natural adjustment process echoes Hume’s vision of inherently

self-limiting trade imbalances, although it is more complex. In general, proponents of this

vision focus on the possibility of excessive deficits, which are most likely to be at risk of

abrupt reversal.

           The argument that profit-maximizing firms and utility-maximizing households,

unlike the government, are unlikely to over-borrow has been advanced in many cases of

large current account deficits. Chile in the early 1980s is a classic case in which a huge

current account deficit (peaking at 14.5 percent of GDP in 1981) was justified by Chilean

episode ended in a devastating crash, with Chile’s government massively socializing

private-sector debts.

         Despite this and similar experiences in the developing world, perhaps the best-

known enunciation of the case for neglect was offered subsequently by British Chancellor

of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. At the 1988 annual meetings of the IMF and World

Bank, as the U.K. current account deficit was rising from below 1 percent of GDP in

1986 to just under 5 percent in 1989, Lawson asserted that an external deficit originating

in private-sector behavior should be of no concern. This view became knows as the

“Lawson Doctrine.” 9 Around the same time a similar doctrine, knows as the Pitchford

Thesis (after Pitchford 1989) or the “consenting adults” view of the current account,

became influential in Australia, a country that has run oftentimes large deficits in every

year since 1974 without encountering a serious crisis.10

         One can appreciate the intellectual underpinnings of the Lawson Doctrine by

reviewing equations (2) – (4) above and their relationship to equation (5), the national

solvency constraint. For the purpose of this discussion I define P as the home price level

and rewrite the government budget constraint (3) in real terms as


                            D(t )       ∞ P ( s )Ω( s )                     
                                  = Et  ∫               [τ ( s) − g ( s)]ds  .
                            P(t )       P(t )Ω(t )

                                                                             


Suppose that the government is expected to follow policies consistent with market

valuation of its debt at par, given the price-level path desired by the central bank.

   An early advocate of the “consenting adults” view was W. Max Corden. For a discussion of the
Australian debate over the significance of the external deficit, see Belkar, Cockerell, and Kent (2007), who

summary of Corden’s more recent views is Corden (2007).

Suppose further that the aggregate of households is expected to respect equation (2),

given that the value of their equity assets is rationally assessed according to (4). Then the

national intertemporal constraint (5) holds automatically. It is a derivative concept,

however, because while equations (2)-(4) refer to basic economic units, equation (5)

refers to the geographical unit within which those economic units reside. The Lawson

Doctrine admits that the government may manage its affairs badly – the result being

undesired inflation, a haircut on government debt, or both – but it does not recognize the

private sector as a source of trouble. Thus, if the government finances are well managed,

there is no further need to worry about the country’s external deficits or debts.

       A key problem with the Lawson argument is that the dividing line between public

and private debts becomes hazy precisely in crisis situations. This problem, once thought

to apply most starkly to developing countries, is now manifestly a major issue for rich

countries as well. And when the government intervenes, it does so to achieve a national

objective, and with national effects.

       Government improvidence may adversely affect private-sector budget constraints,

of course, as when domestic holders of government debt take losses. But, conversely,

private sector difficulties may adversely affect the government’s budget, as when the

liabilities of failing banks receive public guarantees. (And of course, the expectation of

such guarantees undermines the efficient functioning of markets.) Particularly in systemic

crises, the budget constraints of the private and public sectors are inescapably

intertwined, so that the national unit effectively does become an economic unit itself. In

extreme cases, the government might even have to erect barriers between domestic and

foreign financial markets. It is the possibility that such events could occur, and the




                                             15
resulting market expectations, that make national current account deficits and external

positions relevant. Again, one must add a caveat concerning economies that extensively

host foreign-owned financial institutions. As noted above, their assets and liabilities may

have little connection with domestic nationals and a foreign government may be their

primary recourse for financial support in periods of financial stress.

       Some claimed in the past that, thanks to the common currency issued by a system-

wide central bank, national current accounts would no longer matter in the euro zone. But

the continuing fiscal and regulatory responsibilities of national euro zone governments to

maintain national financial stability explain why member countries’ individual external

accounts remain a cause for concern. In particular, the absence of system-wide euro zone

fiscal and regulatory authorities to oversee a highly integrated bond market has proved to

be a huge liability, and has contributed to market segmentation in the crisis – even before

the threat that some countries could depart the common currency. The contrast with the

fiscal and regulatory arrangements in currency unions such as the United States – where

sub-unit current account data are not even collected – could not be starker.

       Aside from these important considerations relating to the role of governments,

any number of factors, not all government imposed, may distort the behavior of firms and

households, leading to current account deficits that are too large to be sustained. Suppose

markets overestimate the value of equities. If foreigners largely hold these, it is they who

will take the loss when the crash comes. In the case of home bias in equity holdings,

however, the result is a fall in domestic wealth and consumption, including imports.

                    C. The Case for Focusing on Gross Flows and Positions



As I have noted, gross flows two-way financial flows now eclipse the net flows measured

by the current account. Gross foreign asset and liability positions likewise have grown

rapidly. But aren’t these gross quantities the ones policymakers should worry about? A

country with a gross short-term debt position may be vulnerable to a run, just as banks

are. And even if the country as a whole holds a large net foreign asset stock, it does not

follow that the particular agents with short-term foreign liabilities hold enough liquid

assets to pay them off should lenders refuse to renew their credits. A focus on net

positions does not recognize that my fellow citizens’ assets are not available to pay off

my debts – unless the government steps in, which generally happens only after a crisis

has occurred. It is thus gross exposures that would seem to carry the risks of financial

instability – of a balance-sheet crisis – regardless of whether the country has a current

account deficit or surplus, or is a net international creditor or debtor. Financial actors

engage in maturity and liquidity transformation within different currencies, regardless of

their home lender of last resort, and this opens the door to financial fragility.11

Furthermore, the portfolio shifts reflected in gross flows can have big effects on asset

prices, even in the absence of current account imbalances. Johnson (2009), Borio and

Disyatat (2011), and Shin (2012) present this view forcefully.12

         Another implication of expanding gross asset and liability positions, noted above,

is the increasing role of asset-price changes – the capital gains terms in equation (1) – in



11
   An early model of balance-sheet crises is Calvo (2000).
12
   In a world of complete asset markets, of course, gross asset flows are of no more concern than are net
flows.


                                                     17
explaining the variance of the NIIP. If the NIIP can jump wildly because of valuation

changes that swamp the current account’s effect, why put so much emphasis on the

current account? Let me expand on these arguments in turn.

       For the rich industrial countries, much of the expansion of gross external asset and

liability stocks has necessarily taken the form of debt instruments. There is considerable

trade in equity too, as in the Lucas (1982) model, but the fact of home bias in equity

ownership remains (although it is declining over time). Furthermore there is only so

much real capital to underlie equity claims. The extreme ratios of external asset stocks to

GDP that some countries display are not feasible except on the basis of extensive two-

way trade in debt or debt-like instruments, including derivatives.

       Figure 5 illustrates this fact for the United States’ external assets and liabilities.

The figure documents the well-know fact (see Gourinchas and Rey 2007a) that the U.S.,

on balance, issues debt in order to hold equity. The prevalence of debt on the asset and

liability sides is even more pronounced for the United Kingdom, as is shown in Figure 6.

For the U.K. in 2010, debt assets amounted to about 3.5 time GDP and debt liabilities to

about 4 times GDP.

       The motivations for such huge two-way debt flows, many of which are

international banking flows of short maturity, are only partially understood. There are

several microeconomic rationales for a positive effect of debt contracts on incentives, and

the availability of safe debt instruments is essential for market liquidity. But as

Gourinchas (2001) emphasizes, while debt may sometimes enhance the efficiency of

bilateral deals between individual agents, and even be essential to smooth market

functioning, liquidity can evaporate quickly and upward spikes in counterparty risk are




                                              18
highly destabilizing at the systemic, macro level. Unfortunately, also, tax shifting and

regulatory arbitrage are certainly important motivations for two-way debt transactions.

The pyramiding of debt claims between counterparties often carries financial stability

risks for the countries involved, regardless of their current account positions. Short-term

liabilities are subject to rollover risk, and liquidity problems easily can spread,

threatening the solvency of a range of financial institutions. When the assets of one

institution become impaired, those that have lent to it, or are suspected of having done so,

can lose credit themselves. The resulting contagion can spread rapidly across national

borders. Of course, this picture of globalized finance, while downplaying the importance

of net financial flows, is very far from the one underlying the complete-markets or

“consenting adults” view of the world!

       The prevalence of debt or debt-like instruments in international finance is

therefore potentially worrisome. Unlike equity, these instruments feature a predetermined

contractual payment (perhaps contingent) that is subject to default. When many financial

players are themselves leveraged, the phenomenon raises significant systemic dangers.

For this reason, countries such as India have actively discouraged debt inflows while

permitting inflows of portfolio equity and FDI.

       Johnson's (2009, pp. 13-14) summary makes the case well: "Current account data

are too partial (because of netting in the statistics) to give useful information on the

associated financial flows. The netting embedded in current account data can be

misleading because the assets acquired by some domestic residents are not necessarily

available to meet the liabilities of other domestic residents and because the composition

of claims acquired on the rest of the world, and hence their risk characteristics, may be




                                              19
quite different from the composition of claims on the domestic economy acquired by

foreign residents." For purposes of assessing vulnerability to financial crisis, there is no

substitute for information on the composition of each individual institution's gross assets

and gross liabilities. Crises are crises precisely because of financial markets' inability to

allocate liquidity where it is most needed, when it is most needed.

           A prime example of how two-way financial flows helped lay the groundwork for

the 2007-09 global crisis comes from the large position in AAA-rated United States

asset-backed securities (ABS) taken by European banks, as documented by Johnson

(2009), Bernanke et al. (2011), Borio and Disyatat (2011), Bertaut et al. (2011), and Shin

(2012), among others. To summarize broadly, many banks invested in ABS, in many

cases through special purpose conduits, funding their acquisitions of these dollar assets

with wholesale dollars often borrowed from U.S. money-market funds. For the European

banks, such transactions offered relatively high net returns as well as some relief from

regulatory capital requirements.13 For the money market funds, the transactions offered

apparently high liquidity as well as favorable interest rates. The transactions were thus

privately, if not always socially, profitable. Although extensive, this business received

relatively little attention in policy circles compared with the flows of emerging markets’

excess savings into U.S. Treasury securities and agency obligations. But the flows from

Europe played a key role in U.S. credit growth, including housing finance. Banking

inflows to the U.S. originated in current-account deficit countries (the United Kingdom)

and surplus countries (Germany, Switzerland) alike. Data from the Bank for International

Settlements on bank holdings by nationality show that by 2007, non-U.S. banks (mostly

                                                      20
European but also Japanese) held more than $6 trillion in claims on the United States –

compared to a total nominal U.S. GDP of about $14 trillion (Borio and Disyatat 2011).

       A first observation is that the transactions just described simultaneously raise

gross foreign debt assets and debt liabilities in both Europe and the U.S. The U.S. money

market fund acquires a gross claim on a European bank, which acquires an equal-valued

ABS issued in the U.S., a U.S. gross liability. The mirror image shows up on the

European external balance sheet.

       A second observation is that these transactions, although believed to be virtually

risk-free when undertaken in the frothy environment of the mid-2000s, actually involved

dangerous liquidity and currency mismatches that were unexpectedly exposed starting in

August 2007. At several points, European banks faced difficulty rolling over the short-

term dollar credits that funded their holdings of suddenly toxic American ABS. For these

banks, heavily reliant on wholesale funding, this amounted to a run on their dollar

liabilities. Selling dollar assets to repay the loans would have forced the banks to book

losses, while also contributing to fire-sale dynamics in U.S. financial markets. On the

other hand, borrowing euros (say) from the ECB and selling them for spot dollars would

have left the banks dangerously long dollars and short euros. Foreign exchange swap

markets, which normally would have been used to cover that risk, were simultaneously

dysfunctional. Some non-U.S. banks had access to Federal Reserve lending, and held

eligible collateral, but many did not. The situation was stabilized thanks to the

willingness of the Fed to provide dollars to the ECB, eventually in unlimited amounts.14

         A third and last observation is that these tensions, like many others in financial

markets in recent years, were felt by banks in current-account surplus and deficit

countries alike simply because the banks’ intrinsic vulnerability originated in the gross

positions on their balance sheets.

         Let me turn next to the second reason suggested above for de-emphasizing the

current account balance. This perspective admits the importance of the NIIP, but points to

equation (1) and argues that the current account is an increasingly minor component of

the overall change in the NIIP, which from year to year can easily offset the current

account entirely.

         Table 1 illustrates the increasingly loose relationship between current accounts

and changes in the NIIP. The table uses the Lane and Milesi-Ferretti data to compute the

simple average correlation coefficients ρ(∆NIIP/GDP,CA/GDP) over two periods, 1971-

1990 and the later period of more intense financial globalization, 1991-2010.15 For all

country groups the correlation coefficient drops between the two periods, but the change

von Peter (2009) and Goldberg, Kennedy, and Miu (2011). Fed support was renewed and remains in place
as a result of the European sovereign debt crisis.
15
   Because of insufficient data availability, over the first subperiod the high-income sample is 20 countries,
the emerging sample 56 countries, and the developing sample 81 countries. The respective sample sizes for




                                                      22
is most striking, naturally, for the high-income countries, which have generated the

largest gross foreign asset and liability positions.

         In the case of the United States, the correlation coefficient drops from 0.83 before

1991 to only 0.13 afterward. Figure 8 plots both the cumulated current account balance

data and the measured NIIP for the United States, both relative to GDP (taking the 1970

NIIP as an initial benchmark for the cumulated current account series). On face value,

these data seem to indicate that, for a lengthy period after 2002, the U.S. was apparently

able to borrow historically large amounts without any deterioration in its NIIP.

         Because capital gains and losses on net international positions result in such large

wealth transfers between countries, it is natural to ask whether these play any positive

risk sharing role. Gourinchas, Rey, and Govillot (2010) suggest that the U.S. may

effectively provide global crisis insurance to the world, in return for a low foreign

borrowing rate. The dollar has been a safe haven currency, appreciating in the face of

negative global shocks. This fact and the fact of declines in world stock markets during

crises result in outward wealth transfers from the U.S. during periods of global stress.

The patterns of such transfers across countries deserve further study, as does the general

question of the role of NIIP capital gains and losses in the global allocation of risk.16




the second subperiod are 21, 56, and 99. The correlations are relatively low for emerging and developing
countries over the first subperiod due to both poor data and to episodes of external debt restructuring.
16
   Simple representative-agent models of efficient international risk sharing with plausible relative risk
aversion imply that U.S. consumption spending should rise relative to foreign consumption spending in
states of nature where the dollar appreciates in real terms. In contrast, the structure of the U.S. external
portfolio dictates that (unexpected) dollar appreciation transfers wealth to foreigners from the U.S.; see
Obstfeld (2007). That pattern is consistent with efficient aggregate risk sharing (as is the Gourinchas-Rey-
Govillot idea) if, even after the international wealth transfer, U.S. spending is high relative to foreign




                                                     23
                    III. So Why Worry about Current Account Balances?



The arguments that current account deficits are self-correcting, that huge cross-border

financial flows promote efficient risk sharing, and that private-sector self interest leads to

socially efficient allocations absent government-imposed distortions all look increasingly

implausible in light of recent experience.17 Even if one rejects those doctrines, however,

one might still argue that the current account balance itself is of little significance,

especially for the advanced economies that reside increasingly in an ocean of two-way

financial flows and routinely experience large capital gains and losses on their gross

international assets and liabilities.

         So why continue to worry about the current account? To my mind, one can group

the answers under three main categories: the current account as a symptom of related

problems; the macro implications, both at home and abroad, of significant changes in

current account imbalances; and the likelihood that, over the long run, the current account

actually does do a reasonable job of tracking the NIIP.18

         Before proceeding, I have to emphasize that just as the “consenting adults”

framework claims, some current account imbalances, even very large ones, can be

justified in terms of economic fundamentals and do not pose threats either to the national

or international economy. Such imbalances need not be a symptom of economic

distortions elsewhere in the economy, but instead reflect reasonably forward-looking

decisions of households and firms, based on realistic expectations of the future. Not all


spending in states of the world where the dollar is relatively strong. But this pattern is not consistent with
the data, as a large literature in international macroeconomics documents.
17
   Which is not to say that government-related distortions such as “too big to fail” guarantees are
unimportant – just that they are not the exclusive source of inefficiencies.



                                                      24
fall into this category, however, and the facts of the case are typically amenable to

different interpretations – witness the debate over the global imbalances of the mid-

2000s, notably the U.S. deficit, as summarized by Obstfeld and Rogoff (2010). It is

precisely the uncertainty whether a given imbalance is benign that underlies

policymakers’ stance of continuing concern.



                        A. Large Current Account Imbalance as a Symptom



           Numerous crises have been preceded by large current account deficits – Chile in

1981, Finland in 1991, Mexico in 1994, Thailand in 1997, the United States in 2007,

Iceland in 2008, and Greece in 2010, to name just a few. But temporal priority does not

establish causality, and the empirical literature of the last two decades has not established

a robust predictive ability of the current account for subsequent financial crises

(especially where the richer economies are concerned). There are cases in which even

large current account deficits have not led to crises, as noted above, and furthermore,

several notable financial crises were not preceded by big deficits, including some of the

banking crises in industrial countries during 2007-09 (for example, Germany and

Switzerland).

           Frankel and Rose (1996), in a pioneering study, argued that large external deficits

did not significantly raise the odds of a subsequent currency crisis in emerging markets,

whereas Edwards (2002) argued that their result was somewhat sensitive to the definition

of “crisis” and the region being studied. In a recent survey, Frankel and Saravelos (2010)


18
     For a complementary discussion, see Blanchard and Milesi-Ferretti (2011).



                                                     25
conclude that the current account has some predictive power for currency crashes but less

so than other indicators, such as international reserves and real exchange rates.

Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) distinguish among currency, banking, and default crises

and find that while larger current account deficits often appear to proceed past crises, the

current account generally does not play a statistically significant role in helping to predict

various types crises. On the other hand, Catão and Milesi-Ferretti (2011) study a sample

including advanced as well as developing economies over 1970-2010 and find that bigger

current account deficits and bigger net external debt liabilities both raise the probability

of debt crises, defined to include large disbursements from multilateral support programs

as well as external default. So the evidence is somewhat mixed.

       A growing body of evidence, however, including the paper by Gourinchas and

Obstfeld (2012) but also including Borio and Lowe (2002), Mendoza and Terrones

(2008), Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2011), Schularick, and Taylor (2012), and many

others, does indicate that rapid increases in domestic credit plays an economically and

statistically significant role in predicting subsequent crises. Gourinchas and Obstfeld

attribute the relative resilience of many emerging markets in the 2007-09 crisis in part to

their avoidance of credit booms in the preceding years, and show that this was not the

case in Central and Eastern Europe, where the effects of the crisis were especially harsh.

       The ability to borrow abroad generally will allow a country to borrow at lower

interest rates, and with less pressure on the exchange rate and therefore on inflation, than

if it was financially closed. So it is natural to suspect some systematic relationship among

current account deficits, domestic credit growth, and financial crises. In reality the

relationship seems to be complex. As Hume and Sentance (2009) point out, several large




                                              26
emerging markets have experienced credit booms without net inflows of capital. Japan’s

epic boom-bust cycle starting in the late 1980s occurred despite a current account surplus

(although the surplus did decline during the Japanese bubble period).

       Despite such counterexamples, there is evidence (stronger for emerging countries)

that net inflows of private capital may help generate credit booms and, in the presence of

potentially fragile financial systems, raise the probability of a crash. For example, Ostry

et al. (2011, p. 21) study panel data for an emerging-market sample over 1995-2008, and

(based on specific definitions of credit booms and crises, of course) they conclude, “one-

half of credit booms are associated with a capital inflow surge, and of those that ended in

a crisis, about 60 percent are associated with an inflow surge.” Mendoza and Terrones

(2008) find that most emerging-market crises involve domestic credit booms and that

elevated financial inflows often precede credit booms. An IMF study of 19 advanced and

28 emerging market economies over the years 1960-2010 concludes similarly that

financial inflows help predict credit booms (IMF 2011, pp. 47-50).

       Studies such as these do not directly address the link between credit booms and

the current account because the net inflow of private capital and the current account

deficit need not coincide: even a country with a current account surplus may experience a

net inflow of private capital if it is accumulating a sufficient volume of foreign exchange

reserves. Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2011, p. 372) examine the question more

directly, utilizing fourteen decades of data for a sample of advanced countries, and

conclude that “The current account deteriorates in the run-up to normal crises, but the

evidence is inconclusive in global crises, possibly because both surplus and deficit

countries get embroiled in the crisis.” Reinhart and Reinhart (2009) study a broad sample




                                             27
of emerging and advanced economies, differentiating among different types of financial

crisis. They argue that large current account deficits make emerging-market economies

more crisis-prone, while the evidence for advanced economies is mixed. The general

question merits further research.

        Obstfeld and Rogoff (2010) argue that for the United States, the big current

account deficit of the mid-2000s was not a cause of the crisis, but instead an endogenous

response to domestic and external factors, including credit and housing booms, that

indeed were unsustainable and that ended in tears.19 Indeed, a global credit boom

occurred in the years preceding the crisis, and it cannot be directly attributed to external

developments such as higher saving by Asian emerging markets and oil producers. As

Hume and Sentance (2009) observe, the net inflow of capital from emerging to advanced

economies is quantitatively far less than the amount of domestic credit those economies

generated in the run up to the global crisis. Empirically, bigger housing booms were

associated with bigger current account deficits. And where current account deficits were

large, they generally were a symptom of brewing financial instability.

        External deficits may not be the true source of a problem – nor is the problem

necessarily addressed most effectively by seeking directly to reduce the external deficit –

but it is nonetheless prudent to be vigilant. Looking at the current predicament of the euro

zone, it is easy to argue (unfortunately, with hindsight), that its members’ external

imbalances after 1999 were symptomatic of unsustainable trends – Greece’s government

deficit, housing and construction booms in Spain and Ireland, and excessive private


19
  The United States’ ability to borrow large amounts abroad on favorable terms, however, facilitated the
domestic asset boom. Otherwise, the dollar’s foreign exchange value would have been lower and domestic
interest rates higher.

borrowing in Portugal, with finance provided in large measure by European banks

(including banks in surplus countries) that now find themselves in trouble. A cautious

interpretation of the track record, it seems to me, is that large, persistent unexplained

deficits warrant careful policymaker scrutiny.

        This is not to say that large surpluses in current accounts may not also be

symptomatic of financial and economic distortions. China’s high surplus, for example, is

certainly linked to low levels of social insurance, to financial repression that keeps the

return to savings low, and to a corporate governance framework that encourages

excessive saving by firms.



                                B. Macroeconomic Implications



Being highly correlated with net exports, the current account also plays a role as a key

component of a country’s aggregate demand. Since current accounts throughout the

world necessarily sum to zero in theory – which is to say that world saving must equal

world investment absent measurement problems – shifts in patterns of current accounts

are also likely to be correlated with shifts in global real interest rates, especially at the

longer maturities where monetary policies presumably have less influence. Such shifts

also affect terms of trade and real exchange rates, with impacts on resource allocation

throughout the world. Bernanke’s (2005) celebrated (if sometimes disputed) account of

the “global saving glut” is a prime example of this implication of global imbalances.

According to this view, bigger surpluses by emerging market countries such as China




                                               29
pushed world real interest rates down, with repercussions in advanced-country asset and

housing markets.

       One obvious danger of running a large current account deficit is that in the

aggregate, an excess of spending over income necessarily must be sustained by sales of

foreign assets (privately owned or official reserves) or finance provided by foreigners. If

foreigners suddenly become unwilling to provide that finance, and if only limited

liquidity can be generated through domestic residents’ sales of their foreign assets, then

the current account necessarily must adjust abruptly through a collapse in domestic

demand. This is the “sudden stop” scenario discussed by Calvo and Reinhart (2000). It

can imply abrupt and painful adjustments in relative prices and resource allocation, along

with negative balance-sheet effects when foreign-currency liabilities are widespread.

       Current-account surplus countries have a much milder dependence on foreign

financial inflows. The individuals in surplus countries who are borrowing abroad could in

principle find domestic credit sources if foreign supply were cut off, all at an unchanged

aggregate current account surplus. Thus a strike by foreign lenders, other things equal,

does not necessarily force a current-account surplus country to increase its surplus.

       Nonetheless, an abrupt collapse of gross foreign inflows is likely in practice to

have significant economic effects even on a surplus country, including an increase in the

trade balance. A sharp global portfolio shift away from a surplus country’s assets requires

adjustments in rates of return and the exchange rate. Domestic rates of return need to rise

to divert domestic savings to domestic borrowers, while real currency depreciation

reduces imports and spur exports. But the size of the resulting trade balance increase is

perforce much smaller than the increase that a current-account deficit country must




                                             30
generate in the face of a complete sudden stop. Accordingly, the degree of

macroeconomic dislocation is much smaller for a surplus country as well. And naturally,

the surplus country’s lower vulnerability to disappearing gross foreign inflows also

makes it much less likely that those inflows do disappear.

       For a deficit economy, the nature of aggregate gross asset and liability positions,

and the distribution of different assets and liabilities among individuals, plainly affects

the way a sudden stop scenario plays out. Initial portfolio positions can make the

outcome less bad (if agents hold liquid foreign assets, or assets useful as collateral for

foreign loans), or much worse (if agents have extensive short-term foreign liabilities).

       Figure 7 illustrates the example of the United States over the two quarters of

intensive global deleveraging following the Lehman Brothers collapse in September

2008. (Figure 1 shows annual data.) Gross capital inflows, which in previous years had

been sufficient to more than cover even a 2006 net current account deficit of 6 percent of

GDP, went into reverse, as foreigners liquidated $198.5 billion in U.S. assets.20 In

addition, the U.S. financed a current account shortfall of $231.1 billion (down sharply

from the current account deficit of $371.4 billion over the previous two quarters). Where

did the total of nearly $430 billion in external finance come from? It came from U.S.

sales of $428.4 billion of assets held abroad – a volume so big that the dollar actually

appreciated sharply through March 2009. Had these resources not been available (as a

result of past gross financial outflows from the U.S.), foreigners would have been able to

liquidate fewer of their U.S. assets, the U.S. current account deficit would have been

compressed further, and the dollar would have slumped in currency markets. Of course,




                                              31
financial intermediation between U.S. resident individuals was disrupted during this

period, making it more difficult for those with foreign liabilities but not assets to finance

repayments. Hence the need for extensive intervention by central banks.21

         For a country with few liquid foreign assets, but substantial short-term liabilities

that foreigners refuse to roll over, a sudden stop in financial inflows opens up an external

financing gap even larger than the current account deficit, leading to a sharp and much

more painful adjustment. Emerging markets in the past were more likely to be in this

category, though they have been accumulating higher volumes of gross private foreign

assets these days, alongside copious international reserves. The results of such sudden

stop episodes can be quite painful.22 A current account deficit creates a basic

vulnerability to a sudden stop in financial inflows, but as noted above, the nature of gross

foreign asset and liability positions will be a critical determinant of the denouement.

Gross currency, liquidity, and maturity exposures determine which actors will encounter

financial stress, in turn stressing their creditors, their creditors’ creditors, and so on.

         Some argue that euro zone peripheral countries have been suffering a sudden stop

of gross financial inflows during the currency union’s debt crisis, with finance for the

   These data, from the Bureau of Economic Analysis website (accessed December 2011), are not
seasonally adjusted. Fortunately for my example, large errors and omissions in each of the two quarters I
discuss cancel when flows over the two quarters are summed.
21
   It is useful to keep in mind that all of the flows being discussed are endogenous. Some foreign
liquidations of U.S. assets were prompted by U.S. repayment demands on foreigners, and vice versa.
22
   Empirical studies suggest that the output and exchange rate effects of current-account reversals differ
across countries and need not always bring a sharp slowdown. See, for example, Milesi-Ferretti and Razin
(2000), Edwards (2002), and Freund and Warnock (2007). For a theoretical model of a sudden stop leading
to economic collapse, see Mendoza (2010). Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2011) argue that countries with initial
current account deficits adjusted more sharply in the 2007-09 crisis, and in particular, that a key correlate of
the extent of demand and output compression was the degree to which the deficit exceeded an empirical
benchmark based on economic and demographic fundamentals. Recognizing the growing divergences
between gross and net financial flows even for emerging economies, Forbes and Warnock (2011) develop a
50-country database and analyze extreme financial capital movements over the 1980-2009 period.


                                                      32
current account and financial outflows coming from IMF and EU lending and the ECB.23

The euro zone peripherals have, however, also been able to draw down stocks of foreign

assets. Furthermore, within the euro zone, a further source of finance (at least from euro

zone partners) is cash, net cross-border flows of which have given rise to the much-

discussed net national positions within the TARGET payment system.24

           A theoretical argument that current account deficits (as well as the surpluses of

creditor countries) may generally be too large comes from considering the externalities

that can arise when financial markets are incomplete (Korinek 2011). A sudden stop can

lead to a currency depreciation that, in turn, raises the real value of foreign liabilities and

thereby tightens financial constraints. Because individuals do not internalize this

pecuniary externality, borrowers borrow too much and lenders lend too much, so there is

a (global) welfare argument for reducing the size of external imbalances.

           Creditors can impose a sharp reduction in the current account deficit, but the

reduction also can arise from a fall in domestic demand, for example, due to household

deleveraging or a collapse in investment. In either case, the resulting fall in aggregate

demand is likely to have exchange rate implications, of the type modeled by Obstfeld and

Rogoff (2007). An unusually (and possibly unsustainably) large current account deficit

therefore will signal an empirical range of possible exchange-rate effects. However, a

sustainable level of the current account, like that of the public deficit, is difficult to define

in any objective way. Clearly some of the past euro zone current account imbalances

have raised repayment issues, with Greece, for example, borrowing to fund high levels of

government consumption, and Spain borrowing to finance investment in largely

     See, for example, Buiter, Rahbari, and Michels (2011).

nontraded goods such as housing, which cannot be used to pay off external creditors

through net exports as demanded by constraint (5).25

           Within a monetary union, an internal constellation of large current account

deficits driven by domestic spending can be especially problematic. Real currency

appreciation emerges as a deficit opens up, depressing the domestic real interest rate and

encouraging the deficit to grow even further. Eventually, however, the currency will have

to depreciate in real terms -- beyond even its intial, pre-shock level -- to generate net

exports sufficient to service a much high net external debt. (See Fagan and Gaspar 2007

for a formal model.) But how is the needed real depreciation to take place when the

nominal exchange rate cannot change? The process requires painful internal devaluation

unless there is substantial domestic real growth or substantial foreign inflation. In other

words, a national current account deficit can look like a major “asymmetric shock,”

precisely the type of development that makes currency union a bad idea. The experience

of the euro zone peripheral countries after 1999 illustrates the danger.

           Any problems associated with a given country’s external imbalance may

primarily hurt its home economy. But negative consequences from changes in one

country’s current account can also spill over into the global system. Blanchard and

Milesi-Ferretti (2011) emphasize the distinction between national and systemic

repercussions. In the latter category, a crisis in one deficit country, sparked by a sudden

stop in its own financial inflows, can spread through contagion effects (think of Mexico

in 1994, Thailand in 1997, or the euro zone now). Another example is related to the inherent

asymmetry between the pressures on surplus countries to move toward external balance and



25
     See the analyses of Giavazzi and Spaventa (2010) and Lane and Pels (2011).


                                                     34
the greater pressures facing deficit countries. If countries collectively target a pattern of

global imbalances that sums to a positive number rather than zero, world output and

employment will suffer, a possibility that has inspired recent calls for global policy

coordination. Proponents of the “global saving glut” account of the 2007-09 crisis hold

that bigger surpluses by China had adverse effects on richer countries’ current accounts

and financial markets.

       Debate over “currency wars” between recession-mired rich countries and faster-

growing emerging markets highlight another possibility. As rich countries such as the

U.S. seek export-led growth through loose monetary policies and currency depreciation,

emerging markets face a tradeoff between losing export competitiveness if they allow

their currencies to appreciate, and higher domestic inflation if they intervene to resist

appreciation. For many, the tradeoff is harsher because of China’s reliance on capital

controls to manage its own currency in the interest of export promotion. Over the longer

term, these international conflicts threaten to spread protectionism, which is yet another

reason to be wary of large and persistent global imbalances.

       Sometimes it is argued that the governments of countries with current account

surpluses – countries that do not depend on foreign economies for finance – are in a

better position to sustain large public deficits and debts. Japan is held up as an example.

If such a country adopted financial repression as in the historical episodes analyzed by

Reinhart and Sbrancia (2011), perhaps retracting capital exports so as to mobilize

national savings, then theory tells us that its real domestic interest rate would fall toward

its autarky level. This possibility is not open to deficit countries. Even if the Lawson




                                              35
Doctrine is false, perhaps its converse has some plausibility: government deficits and

debt are less of a concern if the current account is in surplus.



                    C. The Current Account and the Dynamics of the NIIP



Market assessments of solvency are to some degree subjective and an entity with liquid

liabilities may be pushed into bankruptcy even if it would be solvent in other states of the

world. Nonetheless, the NIIP is a key ingredient in the national solvency constraint, and a

deteriorating NIIP could well be the trigger for a sudden stop. To the extent that the

NIIP’s evolution is decoupled from the current account balance, however, the case for

considering the latter to be a key policy variable is weakened. As observed above, recent

data suggest a very loose relationship for the U.S. (recall Figure 8).

       Is it plausible that such decoupling occurs more generally over the long term? As

a lens on the issue I rewrite equation (1). Let lower-case versions of the symbols in

equation (1) denote ratios to nominal GDP, let g be the growth rate of nominal GDP, and

let the superscripts p and u refer, respectively, to predictable and unpredictable changes

(based on lagged information). Then the evolution of the NIIP, expressed as a ratio to

nominal GDP, is:



         a − l = ca − g × (a − l)
         + kg     A , p
                          − kg   L , p


         + kg     A ,u
                          − kg   L ,u
                                         ...........................................( 6 )


On the other hand, the ratio of cumulated current accounts to nominal GDP, c, follows:


         c = c a − g × c .............................................( 7 )

                                                36
Comparing equations (6) and (7), we see that unpredictable capital gains cannot

systematically drive the NIIP/GDP ratio and the cumulated current account c apart. Only

predictable capital gains can do so. But the likelihood that these are substantial is slim.

         Devereux and Sutherland (2010) argue that it is difficult to generate large

expected capital gains within a reasonably calibrated model based on individual portfolio

choice. In the case of the U.S., Gourinchas and Rey (2007b) show empirically that a

higher net export deficit predicts a relative return differential in favor of U.S. foreign

assets over liabilities, operating in part through capital gains due to exchange-rate and

other asset-price movements. These changes appear to play a significant long-term role in

mitigating the effects of net export deficits on the U.S. NIIP. For other industrial

countries, however, valuation changes appear much less important in the long-term

external adjustment to trade imbalances, and for emerging markets these effects play no

role at all (International Monetary Fund 2005, chapter 3).26

         A very important caveat about the U.S. case is that a sizable part of the

discrepancy in Figure 8 between the NIIP and the cumulated current account probably

results from inaccuracies in the data on financial flows across U.S. borders.27 NIIP data

for the U.S. are periodically updated based on surveys, yet the financial flow (and current

26
  Again, this is not to deny that valuation effects may play a role in international risk sharing. The question
whether the valuation changes in equation (6) are systematic or purely random is related to, but distinct
from, the question whether the U.S. systematically earns more on its foreign assets than it pays on its
foreign liabilities. The latter question concerns overall asset returns (including interest and dividend
payments, which are included in the current account), not just the capital gains components of returns.
(Overall returns are also the focus in the Gourinchas and Rey 2007b study.) Because U.S. foreign assets are
more heavily allocated to equity than are U.S. foreign liabilities, as noted earlier, an equity risk premium
should raise the relative return on the portfolio of U.S. foreign assets. However, it has also been conjectured
that even within asset classes the U.S. pays out less on foreign liabilities than it earns on foreign assets.
Curcuru, Thomas, and Warnock (2011) survey the evidence and conclude that there is a significant
discrepancy in this direction only for direct investments. They attribute it in part to tax considerations.



                                                      37
account) data are revised only slightly in the light of new information. For the U.S., the

trend of NIIP revisions has been upward, suggesting that existing data on financial flows

might overstate net financial inflows into the U.S. Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2009)

contend that over the past 25 years, existing BEA data may overstate U.S. net external

borrowing by up to 0.6 percent of GDP per year.

        All countries face challenges, of course, in accurately measuring international

transactions and positions. But the problems have generally received less intensive

scrutiny outside the United States. It is nonetheless striking that in the admittedly

imperfect data that are available to us, many major countries apart from the United States

display a visible long-run coherence between NIIP ratios to GDP and ratios of cumulated

current accounts to GDP. Figure 9 offers some examples. The biggest and most

protracted divergence occurs in the case of safe-haven Switzerland (panel c), where the

cumulated current account falls after 1970 and remains below the NIIP (all relative to

GDP) until the early 2000s.

        If national risks are being shared efficiently, the valuation gains in Figure 9 may

be arriving just when countries need them the most. Whether that is so is an open

question for future research (as is the question how, precisely, “efficient risk sharing”

would look in reality). It would not necessarily follow, however, that countries

persistently running down their external positions through current account deficits are

systematically rewarded with capital gains at foreigners’ expense. My take-home from

Figure 9 is that net windfall gains on gross foreign assets and liabilities cannot be relied

upon to offset the external wealth effects of the current account.

                                      IV. Conclusion


To my mind, a lesson of recent crises is that globalized financial markets present

potential stability risks that we ignore at our peril. Contrary to a complete markets or

“consenting adults” view of the world, current account imbalances, while very possibly

warranted by fundamentals and welcome, can also signal elevated macroeconomic and

financial stresses, as was arguably the case in the mid-2000s. Historically large and

persistent global imbalances deserve careful attention from policymakers, with no

presumption of innocence. They need not be the benign result of advances in market

efficiency, as is sometimes claimed. Valuation changes in NIIPs, while possibly

important in risk allocation, cannot be relied upon systematically to offset the changes in

national wealth implied by the current account.

       The same factors that dictate careful attention to global imbalances also imply that

data on gross international financial flows and positions are central to any assessment of

financial stability risks. The balance sheet mismatches of leveraged entities provide the

most direct indicators of potential instability, much more so than global imbalances,

though the imbalances may well be a symptom that deeper financial threats are gathering.

Thus, Germany itself experienced neither a current account deficit nor a housing boom in

the 2000s, yet flows from German banks to economies that did display those symptoms

led to problems later on. Unfortunately, the ways in which gross financial positions

propagated the recent global crisis across borders became obvious only after the fact.

       Recent proposals for international financial and monetary reform seek to limit the

global proliferation of hazardous gross financial positions and to contain the resulting



                                             39
damage when accidents nonetheless occur. A minimally effective financial “architecture”

would include further global cooperation in official liquidity facilities, in financial

regulation, in resolution (of both insolvent banks and sovereign debtors), in the

informational infrastructure for decision making, and in the fiscal resources needed to

back up these initiatives. Together, such changes would imply a higher level of global

economic government than currently exists. The political obstacles are daunting. But in

light of the recent financial turmoil, one must ask how far we can safely push globalized

markets beyond the perimeter of globalized governance.
