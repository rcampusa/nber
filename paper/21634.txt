This paper assesses whether legal systems that protect outside investors from corporate insiders increase
or decrease the rate of technological innovation. Based on over 75,000 industry-country-year observations
across 94 economies from 1976 to 2006, we find that enforcing insider trading laws spurs innovation—as
measured by patent intensity, scope, impact, generality, and originality. Consistent with theories that
insider trading slows innovation by impeding the valuation of innovative activities, the relationship
between enforcing insider trading laws and innovation is much larger in industries that are naturally
innovative and opaque, and equity issuances also rise much more in these industries after a country
starts enforcing its insider trading laws.

1. Introduction

       The finance and growth literature emphasizes that financial markets shape economic

growth primarily by boosting productivity growth (e.g., King and Levine, 1993a, b, Levine

and Zervos, 1998, Rajan and Zingales, 1998, Beck et al., 2000 and Levine, 2005), and this

literature has recently found a strong link between finance and the rate of technological

innovation (Amore et al., 2013, Chava et al., 2013, Fang et al., 2014, Hsu et al., 2014,

Acharya and Xu, 2015 and Laeven et al., 2015). Partially motivated by research on finance

and growth, the law and finance literature stresses that legal systems that protect the voting

rights of minority shareholders and limit the ability of large shareholders and executives to

expropriate corporate resources through self-dealing transactions enhance financial markets

(e.g., La Porta et al., 1997, 1998, 2002, 2006 and Djankov et al., 2008). What these literatures

have not yet addressed is whether legal systems that protect outside investors from corporate

insiders influence a crucial source of economic growth—technological innovation. In this

paper, we focus on one such protection. We examine whether restrictions on insider

trading—trading by corporate officials, major shareholders, or others based on material non-

public information—influences technological innovation.

       Theory offers differing perspectives on whether restricting insider trading would

accelerate or slow innovation. One set of theories suggests that restricting insider trading

enhances the valuation of and hence improves investments in technological innovation. This

view builds from the premise that technological innovation is difficult for outside investors to

evaluate (e.g., Holmstrom, 1989, Allen and Gale, 1999), so that improving incentives for

acquiring information enhances valuations, lowers the cost of capital, and improves

investment in innovative activities (Merton, 1987, Diamond and Verrecchia, 2012). One way

that restricting insider trading can increase incentives for acquiring information is by

reducing the ability of corporate insiders to exploit other investors, which encourages those

investors to devote more resources to valuing firms and improves the informativeness of

stock prices, as modeled by Fishman and Hagerty (1992) and DeMarzo et al. (1998) and

shown empirically by Bushman et al. (2005) and Fernandes and Ferreira (2009). Another way

that restricting insider trading can improve valuations is by boosting market liquidity
                                                                                              2


(Bhattacharya and Doauk, 2002). Greater liquidity can make it less costly for investors who

have acquired information to profit by trading in public markets (Kyle, 1984), which

encourages investors to devote more resources toward collecting information (Holmstrom

and Tirole, 1993). Furthermore, market liquidity can facilitate arbitrage trading activities and

correct the pricing of mis-valued stocks (Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam, 2008). Thus,

restricting insider trading can improve the valuation of and enhance investment in innovation.

       Other theories, however, suggest that restricting insider trading can deter effective

price discovery, with adverse effects on innovation. For example, Leland (1992) stresses that

insider trading quickly reveals that information in public markets, improving the

informativeness of prices and the allocation of resources. And, Grossman and Stiglitz (1980)

argue that when liquid markets immediately reveal information to the public, this reduces the

incentives for investors to expend private resources acquiring information on firms. From

these perspectives, restricting insider trading could slow innovation by increasing

informational asymmetries about novel endeavors.

       By influencing price discovery and market liquidity, insider trading can also affect

managerial incentives. To the extent that restricting insider trading enhances the efficiency of

stock prices, this can reduce the disincentives of investing in opaque and risky, albeit value-

maximizing, innovative endeavors, as suggested by the work of Manso (2011), Ederer and

Manso (2013), and Ferreira et al. (2014). In contrast, highly liquid markets can both (a)

attract myopic investors who chase short-run profits (e.g., Bushee, 1998, 2001), which can

incentivize managers to forgo profit-maximizing long-run investments in order to satisfy

short-term performance targets (Stein, 1988, 1989) and (b) facilitate takeovers (Kyle and

Vila, 1991), which can encourage managers to choose investments that boost short-run profits

instead of longer gestation investments in innovation (Shleifer and Summers, 1988). Thus,

theory suggests that restricting insider trading can either enhance or harm managerial

incentives, with correspondingly conflicting predictions about the impact of insider trading

on innovation.

       To provide the first assessment of whether legal systems that protect outside investors

from corporate insiders increase or decrease the rate of innovation, we exploit the quasi-
                                                                                                 3


natural experiment of the staggered enforcement of insider trading laws across countries.

Specifically, we use the date when a country first prosecutes a violator of its insider trading

laws, which is provided by Bhattacharya and Daouk (2002) for 103 countries starting with

the U.S. in 1961. This setting is appealing for three reasons. First, countries started enforcing

their insider trading laws for a variety of reasons, such as increased competition between

stock exchanges for trading volume, and differences in political ideologies (Beny, 2013).

Fortunately, there is no indication that technological innovation or the desire to influence

innovation affected the timing of when countries started enforcing their insider trading laws.

Thus, the potential effects of enforcement on innovation are likely unintended consequences

of these legal actions. Second, the cross-country heterogeneity in the timing of the

enforcement of insider trading laws allows us to employ a difference-in-differences strategy

to identify their impact on innovation. As discussed below, we conduct and report several

tests that support the validity of this strategy. Third, this setting allows us to test whether the

cross-industry response of innovation and equity issuances to restrictions on insider trading

are consistent with particular theoretical perspectives of how insider trading affects

innovation. For example, models stressing that insider trading discourages outside investors

from researching firms predict that restricting insider trading will have a particularly positive

impact on investment in informationally opaque activities, including innovation. By

conducting these evaluations, we contribute to theoretical and policy debates about how legal

systems that protect small investors influence on the rate of technological innovation.

       We use patent-based measures of innovation. Specifically, we obtain information on

patenting activities for industries (two-digit SIC level) in 94 countries from 1976 through

2006 from the EPO Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT) and compile a

sample of 76,321 country-industry-year observations. We construct and examine five patent-

based proxies for technological innovation, but focus on two—the number of patents and the

number of patent citations—since they gauge the intensity and impact of innovative activity.

We also study (a) the number of patenting entities to assess the scope of innovative activities

(Acharya and Subramanian, 2009), (b) the degree to which technology classes other than the
                                                                                              4


one of the patent cite the patent, and (c) the degree to which the patent cites innovations in

other technology classes (Hall et al., 2001).

        We begin with a simple difference-in-differences specification. Specifically, the

patent-based proxies of innovation, which are measured at the country-industry-year level,

are regressed on the enforcement indicator, which equals one after a country first enforces its

insider trading laws and zero otherwise. The regression also includes country, industry, and

year fixed effects and an assortment of time-varying country and industry characteristics.

Since we are concerned that the size of the economy and the level of economic development

might shape both innovation and policies toward insider trading, we control for Gross

Domestic Product (GDP) and GDP per capita. Since stock market and credit conditions could

influence innovation and the restrictions on insider trading, we also include stock market

capitalization as a share of GDP and credit as a share of GDP. Finally, factors shaping the

evolution of an industry’s export could also confound the analyses, so we control for industry

exports to the U.S. As mentioned above and described further below, we also examine

theoretical predictions concerning the differential impact of insider trading across industries.

Since we use U.S. data to categorize industries, we omit the U.S., though the results are

robust to including it.

        We find that (1) the enforcement of insider trading laws is associated with a material

and statistically significant increase in each of the five proxies of innovation and (2) several

tests support the validity of our econometric strategy. For example, the number of patents

rises, on average, 26% after a country first enforces its insider trading laws and the impact of

innovation, as measured by citation counts, increases by 37%. In assessing the validity of this

approach, we first test and confirm that neither the level nor the growth rate in the patent-

based measures predict the timing of the enforcement of insider trading laws. Second, we find

no significant pre-trends in the patent-based measures of innovation before a country’s first

enforcement action. Rather, there is a notable upward break in the time-series of the

innovation measures after a country starts enforcing its insider trading laws. Third, we

employ a discontinuity approach and assess whether other factors, such as trade, credit, real

output, etc. change in the same way after a country starts restricting insider trading as the
                                                                                              5


patent-based indicators change. We find that they do not, advertising the link between insider

trading and innovation per se. Fourth, we were concerned that other factors could be

changing at the same time as the enforcement of insider trading, confounding our

identification strategy. Consequently, we use a control function approach and include an

array of policy changes associated with international capital flows, securities markets, and

banks. Controlling for these policy reforms does not alter the results and has little effect on

the estimated coefficients.

       We next augment our approach to test whether the cross-industry response of

innovation to restrictions on insider trading are consistent with particular theoretical

perspectives of how insider trading shapes innovation. That is, we include an interaction term

between the enforcement indicator and industry characteristics to examine the heterogeneous

response of industry innovation to the enforcement of insider trading laws. In these industry-

level analyses, we control for country-year and industry-year fixed effects to condition out all

time-varying country factors that might be changing at the same time as each country first

enforces its insider trading laws and time-varying industry characteristics that might

confound our ability to draw sharp inferences about the relationship between insider trading

and innovation. By focusing on changes in the cross-industry patterns of innovation, these

analyses enhance the identification strategy and provide cleaner insights into the relationship

between insider trading and innovation.

       We differentiate industries along two theoretically-motivated dimensions. First, we

distinguish industries by their “natural rate” of innovation. If insider trading curtails

innovation by dissuading potential investors from expending resources valuing innovative

activities, then enforcement of insider trading laws should have a particularly pronounced

effect on innovation in naturally innovative industries—industries that would have

experienced rapid innovation if insider trading had not impeded accurate valuations. Given

that the U.S. is a highly innovative economy with well-developed securities markets that was

also the first country to prosecute a violator of its insider trading laws, we use it as a

benchmark to compute the natural rate of innovation for each industry. Using several

measures of the natural rate of innovation based on U.S. industries, we evaluate whether
                                                                                               6


innovative industries experience a bigger jump in innovation after a country starts enforcing

its insider trading laws.

        Second, we differentiate industries by opacity. If insider trading discourages

innovation by impeding market valuations, then the enforcement of insider trading laws is

likely to exert an especially large positive impact on innovation in industries with a high

degree of informational asymmetries between insiders and potential outside investors. Put

differently, there is less of role for greater enforcement of insider trading limits to influence

innovation through the valuation channel if the pre-reform information gap is small. We use

several proxies of opacity across industries, again using the U.S. as the benchmark economy

to define each industry’s “natural” opacity. We then test whether naturally opaque industries

experience a larger increase in innovation rates after a country first prosecutes somebody for

violating its insider trading laws.

        We find that the patent-based measures of innovation rise much more in naturally

innovative and naturally opaque industries after a country starts enforcing its insider trading

laws. For example, after a country’s first prosecution of insider trading, the number of patents

jumps 50% more in its industries that have above the median level of patenting activity in the

U.S. than it rises in its industries with below the median values. The same is true when

splitting the sample by the natural opacity of industries. For example, in industries with above

the median levels of intangible assets in the U.S., the patent-based measures of innovation

increase 30% more than they rise in industries with naturally lower levels of intangible assets.

Thus, enforcement is associated with a material increase in patent-based measures of

innovation and the cross-industry pattern of this increase is consistent with theories in which

restricting insider trading improves the informational content of stock prices.

        We further extend these analyses by examining equity issuances. One mechanism

through which enhanced valuations can spur innovation is by lowering the cost of capital for

investment in innovation. Consistent with this view, we find that both initial public offering

(IPO) and seasonal equity offering (SEO) rise much more in naturally innovative industries

than they do in other industries after a country first enforces its insider trading laws. In

particular, the value of equity issuances increases 40% to 63% more in naturally innovative
                                                                                               7


industries than it rises in other industries after a country starts enforcing its insider trading

laws. These findings further support the view that legal systems that protect outside investors

from corporate insiders facilitate investment in innovative activities.

       We also address several potential additional concerns. First, the results might be

driven only by the extensive margin, in which an industry in a country first applies for a

patent, or the intensive margin, in which already innovating industries intensify their

patenting activities. We find that innovation increases at both the extensive and intensive

margins after countries start enforcing their insider trading laws. Second, we were concerned

that the results might only obtain in some countries, so we split the sample by the level of

economic development, the level financial development, and whether the country has a

market-oriented political ideology. The results hold in each of these subsamples with very

similar coefficient estimates.

       Our findings relate to several lines of research. A considerable body of work finds

that laws and regulations that protect small investors by enhancing the transparency, integrity,

and contestability of markets enhance the quality of financial markets and institutions (e.g.,

La Porta et al., 2006, Barth et al., 2006). Consistent with these findings, we find that

restricting insider trading is associated with a material increase in innovative activity and a

sharp rise in equity issuances among firms in innovative industries. Similarly, our work

contributes to the debate on the regulation and social consequences of insider trading

(Fishman and Hagerty, 1992, Leland, 1992, Khanna et al., 1994, DeMarzo et al, 1998,

Acharya and Johnson, 2007, 2010). Although we do not examine each theoretical channel

through which insider trading might affect innovation, we do show that enforcing insider

trading laws boosts innovation and equity issuances in a manner that is consist with models

emphasizing that insider trading reduces the precision with which markets value innovative

activities and raises the cost of capital for such investments.

       The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the data, while section 3 presents

the empirical strategies and validity tests. Section 4 provides the main results and robustness

checks, and section 5 examines insider trading and equity issuances. Section 6 concludes.

2. Data
       In this section, we describe the data on the enforcement of insider trading laws and

patents. We define the other data used in the analyses when we present the regression results.



       2.1. Enforcement of insider trading laws

       Bhattacharya and Daouk (2002) compile data on the enforcement of insider trading

laws for 103 economies. They obtain these data by contacting stock exchanges and asking (a)

whether they had insider trading laws and, if yes, in what year were they first enacted and (b)

whether there had been prosecutions, successful or unsuccessful, under these laws and, if yes,

in what year was the first prosecution. We use the year in which a country first prosecutes a

violator of its insider trading laws, rather than the date on which a country first enacts laws

restricting insider trading, because Bhattacharya et al. (2000) note that the existence of

insider trading laws without the enforcement of them does not deter insider trading.

Furthermore, following Bhattacharya and Daouk (2002), and others, we use the first time that

a country’s authorities enforce insider trading laws because the initial enforcement (a)

represents a shift of legal regime from a non-prosecution to a prosecution regime and (b)

signals a discrete jump in the probability of future prosecutions. Based on the information

provided in Appendix A, 82 out of the 94 countries with complete data had insider trading

laws on their books by 2002, but only 36 of those 82 economies had enforced those laws at

any point before 2002. As a point of reference, the U.S. first enacted laws prohibiting insider

trading in 1934 and first enforced those laws in 1961.

       Enforce equals one in the years after a country first prosecutes somebody for violating

its insider trading laws, and otherwise equals zero. For those years in which a country does

not have insider trading laws, Enforce equals zero. Enforce equals zero in the year of the first

enforcement, but the results are robust to setting it to one instead.
                                                                                                                9

         2.2. Patents

         The EPO Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT) provides data on more

than 80 million patent applications filed in over 100 patent offices around the world. It

contains basic bibliographic information on patents, including the identity number of the

application and granted patent, the date of the patent application, the date when the patent is

granted, the track record of patent citations, information on the patent assignees (i.e., the

owner of the patent), and the technological “section”, “class”, and “subclass” to which each

patent belongs (i.e., the International Patent Classification (IPC)). 1, 2

         Critically, PATSTAT provides an identifier of each distinct “patent family”, which

includes all of the patents linked to a particular invention since some inventions are patented

in multiple patent offices. With this patent family identifier, we identify the first time an

invention is patented and we call this the “original patent.” PATSTAT is updated biannually

and we use the 2015 spring release, which has data through the end of the fifth week of 2015.

         We restrict the PATSTAT sample as follows. We only include patents filed with and

eventually granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) or by one of the patent offices in the

34 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development

(OECD) to ensure comparability across jurisdictions of intellectual property rights. We

further restrict the sample to non-U.S. countries because we use the U.S. as the benchmark

economy when characterizing industry traits for all countries (Rajan and Zingales, 1998). To


1
  For example, consider a typical IPC “A61K 36/815”. The first character identifies the IPC “section”, which in
this example is “A”. There are eight sections in total (from A to H). The next two characters (“61” in this
example) give the IPC “class”; the next character, “K”, provides the “subclass”; the next two characters (“36”)
give the “main group”, while the last three characters (“815”) give the sub-group. Not all patent authorities
provide IPCs at the main-group and sub-group levels, so we use the section, class, and subclass when referring
to an IPC. With respect to these technological classifications, there are about 600 IPC subclasses.
2
  IPCs assigned to a patent can be inventive or non-inventive. All patents have at least one inventive IPC. We
only use inventive IPCs for classifying a patent’s technological section, class, and subclass. Furthermore, if the
patent authority designates an inventive IPC as secondary (“L” in the ipc_position of the PATSTAT), we
remove that IPC from further consideration. This leaves only inventive IPCs that the patent authority designates
as primary (“F” in the ipc_position of the PATSTAT) or that the patent authority does not designate as either
primary or secondary, i.e., undesignated IPCs. In no case does a patent authority designate a patent as having
two primary IPCs. In our dataset, 19% of patents have multiple inventive IPCs (in which the patent authority
designates the IPC as either primary or does not give it a designation); where 6% have both a primary inventive
IPC and at least one undesignated IPC; and 13% have no primary IPC and multiple undesignated IPCs. In cases
with multiple inventive IPCs, we do the following. First, we assign equal weight to each IPC subclass. That is, if
a patent has two IPC subclasses, we count it as 0.5 in each subclass. From a patent’s IPC subclasses, we choose
a unique IPC section. We simply choose the first one based on the alphabetical ordering of the IPC sections.
                                                                                                             10


further mitigate potential problems with using U.S. industries as benchmarks, we only

include a country in the sample if at least one entity in the country has applied for and

received a patent for its invention from the United States Patent and Trademark Office

(USPTO) within our sample period because industries in these economies are presumably

more comparable with those in the U.S. This restriction excludes Zambia, Namibia,

Botswana, and Mongolia. The results, however, are robust to including these countries or the

U.S. in the regression analyses. Finally, since we use data from the United Nations

Commodity Trade (UN Comtrade) Statistics Database in our regression analyses, we exclude

economies that UN Comtrade does not cover (Taiwan and Yugoslavia). Throughout the

analyses, we follow the patent literature and focus on utility patents. 3 After employing these

restrictions and merging the patent data with the data on the enforcement of insider trading

laws, we have a sample of 94 economies between 1976 and 2006.

        Following the patent literature, we date patents using the application year of original

patents that are eventually granted. The literature uses the application year, rather than the

actual year in which the patent is granted, because the application year is closer to the date of

the innovation (Griliches et al., 1987) and because the application year avoids varying delays

between the application and grant year (Hall et al., 2001, Acharya and Subramanian, 2009,

Acharya et al., 2013). Moreover, we use the original patent—the first patent on an

invention—when defining the date, the technological section and subclass(es), the country of

the invention, etc. That is, if the same underlying invention has multiple patents, i.e., the

patents are part of a patent family, we choose the patent with the earliest grant date and call

this the original patent. We then use the application year of this original patent to (a) date the

invention, (b) define the technological section and subclass(es) of the invention (i.e., its

IPC(s)), and (c) record the country of residence of its primary assignee (i.e., owner) and the

country of the invention.
        When computing measures of innovation based on citations, we avoid double

counting of different patents within a patent family, by examining citations at the patent

3
 In addition to utility patents, the PATSTAT also includes two other minor patent categories: utility models and
design patents. As with the NBER database and consistent with U.S. patent law, we only include utility patents.
                                                                                                     11


family level. Thus, if another patent cites multiple patents in different patenting offices on the

single invention underlying a patent family “A,” we count this as one citation. In this way, we

focus on citations by inventions to inventions regardless of where and in how many offices

the inventions are patented.

        Since we conduct our analyses at the industry-country-year-level and merge different

data sources, we must reconcile the different industrial classifications used by the PATSTAT

and the other data sources and implement criterion for including or excluding industry-

country-year observations in which we find no evidence of patenting activity. With respect to

industry categories, we convert the PATSTAT IPCs into two-digit Standard Industrial

Classifications (SICs). 4 With respect to sampling criteria, our core sample excludes an

industry-country-year observation in which no entity in that country’s industry files for a

patent in that year. Thus, our core analyses focus exclusively on the intensive margin: Is there

a change in patenting activity in industries already engaged in innovation? In robustness tests

reported below, however, we also consider the extensive margin. We include those industry-

country-year observations in which we find no patenting activity and code those observations

as zero. All of the results hold when examining this large sample.

        We construct five measures of innovative activities for each industry-country-year.

        Patent Count in industry i, in country c, in year t equals the natural logarithm of one

plus the total number of eventually-granted patent applications belonging to industry i that

are filed with the patent offices in one of the 34 OECD countries and/or the EPO in year t by

applicants from country c. As emphasized above, we do everything at the invention—patent

family—level and then convert the PATSTAT IPCs to two-digit SICs.

        Patent Entities equals the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of distinct

entities in country c, that apply for patents in industry i in year t. Similar to Patent Count,

Patent Entities is also constructed at the IPC subclass level and then converted to the two-

  We first follow the mapping scheme provided by Lybbert and Zolas (2012) for converting IPCs into
International Standard Industrial Classifications (ISICs). The World Intellectual Property Office (WIPO)
provides the Lybbert and Zolas (2012) mapping scheme at:
http://www.wipo.int/econ_stat/en/economics/publications.html. We then convert the ISIC to SICs using the
concordance scheme from the United Nations Statistical Division, which is detailed at:
http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdnld.asp?Lg=1.
                                                                                                                   12


digit SIC level. Following Acharya and Subramanian (2009), we include Patent Entities since

it accounts for the scope of participation in innovative activities. While Patent Count and

Patent Entities measure the intensity and scope of innovative activities, respectively, they do

not measure the comparative impact of different patents on future innovation (Acharya and

Subramanian, 2009, Hsu et al., 2014). Thus, we also use measures based on citations.

         Citation equals the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of citations to

patent families in industry i, in country c, and in year t, where t is the application year. Thus,

if a patent cites two patents on the same invention filed in different patent offices, we only

count this as one citation. Similarly, if two patents in the same patent family each cites an

invention, we only count this as one citation. As emphasized above, we seek to measure

citations by inventions of other inventions and not double count such citations because of an

invention being patented in multiple offices. As an invention—a patent family—may

continue to receive citations for years beyond 2014, the last full year covered by the

PATSTAT, we adjust for truncation bias using the method developed by Hall et al. (2001,

2005). 5 Then, we sum the citation counts over all patent families within each IPC subclass
and convert this to the two-digit SIC level for each industry i, in country c, and in year t.

5
  More specifically, for patents granted in and before 1985 (when at least 30-years of actual citations can be
observed by the end of 2014), we use the actual citations recorded in the PATSTAT. For patents granted after
1985, we implement the following four-step process to adjust for truncation bias.
(1) Based on each cohort of granted patents for which we have 30 years of actual citation data (e.g., patents
granted in 1985 or earlier), we compute for each IPC section (K), the share of citations in each year (L) since the
patents were granted, where the share is relative to the total number of citations received over the 30 years since
the patents were granted. We refer to this share, for each IPC section in each year, as 𝑃𝐿𝐾 , where 𝐿 =
0,1, … , 29, and ∑29      𝐾
                    𝐿=0 𝑃𝐿 = 1 for each K. The year of the grant corresponds to year zero.
(2) We calculate the cumulative share of citations for section K from year zero to year L. We refer to this
cumulative          share       for       each      IPC        section        K     for         each       year       L
as 𝑆𝐿𝐾 , where 𝑆𝐿𝐾 = ∑𝐿𝜏=0 𝑃𝜏𝐾 , 𝐿 = 0,1, … , 29, and 𝑆𝐿=29
                                                         𝐾
                                                              = 1.
(3) After completing steps (1) and (2) for all patents granted before 1985, where 1985 is the last cohort in which
we have 30 years of actual citation data, we compute the average cumulative share for each 𝑆𝐿𝐾 over the ten
cohorts (1976-1985) to obtain a series of estimates 𝑆𝐿̅ 𝐾 . We use the average cumulative share 𝑆𝐿̅ 𝐾 as the
estimated share of citations that a patent receives if it belongs to section K and was granted L years before 2014.
Thus, 𝑆𝐿̅ 𝐾 equals 1 for patents granted in and before 1985.
(4) We then apply the series of average cumulative share, 𝑆𝐿=0             ̅ 𝐾 , to patents granted after 1985. For
                                                                   ̅ 𝐾 to 𝑆𝐿=28
instance, for a patent in section K and granted in 1986, we observe citations from L=0 to L=28 (i.e., for 29 years
                                                                                             ̅ 𝐾 of total citations of
till the end of 2014). According to the calculations in (3), this accounts for the share 𝑆𝐿=28
the patent in section K that was granted in 1986 over a 30-year lifetime. We then multiply the actual citations of
the patent in section K summed over the 1986-2014 period by the weighting factor of 1/𝑆𝐿=28       ̅ 𝐾 to compute the
adjusted citations for the patent in sections K and cohort 1986. As another example, consider a patent in section
K and granted in 2006. We observe actual citations from L=0 to L=8 (i.e., for 9 years till the end of 2014).
According to our calculations, these actual citations account for the share 𝑆𝐿=8̅ 𝐾 of total citations of the patent in
section K that was granted in 2006 over a 30-year lifetime. In this example, then, we multiply the actual sum of
                                                                                                                  13


         Generality is a measure of the degree to which patents by each particular industry in a

country are cited by patents in other types of technologies. Thus, a high generality score

suggests that the invention is applicable to a wide array of inventive activities. We construct

Generality as follows. We first compute a patent’s generality value as one minus the

Herfindahl Index of the IPC sections of patents citing it. This provides information on the

degree to which a patent is cited by different technologies, i.e., sections other than the IPC

section of the patent itself. We then sum the generality scores of all patents within each IPC

subclass, in each country, and each year. Finally, we convert the resultant values to SIC

industries using the method describe above and take the natural logarithm of one plus the

original value to obtain an overall Generality measurement at the industry-country-year level.

         Originality is a measure of the degree to which patents by each particular industry in a

country cite patents in other technologies. Larger values of Originality indicate that patents in

that industry build on innovations from a wider array of technologies, i.e., the patents in that

industry do not simply build on a single line of inventions. We construct Originality as

follows. We first compute a patent’s originality value as one minus the Herfindahl Index of

the IPC sections of patents that it cites. We then sum the originality values of all patents

within each IPC subclass, in each country, in each year. Finally, we map this IPC-based

indicator to SIC industries and take the natural logarithm of one plus the original value to

obtain an overall Originality measurement at the industry-country-year level. 6
         We also construct and use two variants of these measures. Specifically, Patent

Count*, Patent Entities*, Citation*, Generality* and Originality* equal the values of Patent

Count, Patent Entities, Citation, Generality and Originality respectively before the log

transformation. Furthermore, we also create country-year aggregates of the patent-based

measures of innovation, in addition to the country-industry-year versions discussed above.


citations over the period 2006-2014 by the weighting factor of 1/𝑆𝐿=8̅ 𝐾 to compute the adjusted total citations for
the patent in section K and cohort 2006.
  Generality and Originality are based on Hall et al. (2001), but we use the eight IPC sections, while they self-
6

design six technological categories based on the US Patent Classification System. Thus, we use the IPC section
to calculate the Herfindahl indexes of the generality and originality values of each patent. We then sum these
values for patents within each IPC subclass. There are about 600 subclasses within the PATSTAT, which
correspond closely in terms of granularity to the 400 categories (i.e., the three-digit classification) under the U.S.
patent classification system.
                                                                                               14


For example, Patent Count c equals the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of

eventually-granted patent applications in year t by applicants from country c. Patent Entitiesc,

Citationc, Generalityc, and Originalityc are defined analogously.

       Table 1 and Table 2 provide detailed variable definitions and summary statistics,

respectively, on all of the variables used in the paper, while Appendix A provides more

detailed information on the five patent-based indicators. In Appendix A, the patent-based

measures are averaged over the sample period. Patent Count* ranges from an average of 0.05

patents per industry-year in Bangladesh to 468 per industry-year in Japan. The average

number of truncation-adjusted citations for patents in an industry-year ranges from 0.06 in

Swaziland to 9,620 in Japan. Table 2 further emphasizes the large dispersion in innovation

across countries by pooling overall industry-country-years. On average, a country-industry

has 36 eventually-granted patents per year, while the standard deviation is as high as 204.

Citation* is also highly dispersed. In an average industry-country-year, the average value of

Citation* is 442 with a standard deviation of 3,526.



3. Empirical strategies


       3.1 Baseline strategy

       We begin with a standard difference-in-differences specification to assess whether

patent-based indicators of innovation rise after a country first prosecutes a violator of its

insider trading laws.

                                                 ′
        𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛾𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 .              (1)


𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 is one of the five patent-based measures of innovation in industry i, of

country c, in year t: Patent Count, Patent Entities, Citation, Generality, and Originality. The
regressor of interest is 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑐,𝑡 , which equals one in the years after a country first enforces

its insider trading laws, and zero otherwise. The regression includes country (𝛿𝑐 ), industry
(𝛿𝑗 ), and time (𝛿𝑡 ) fixed effects to control for unobservable time-invariant country and
                                                                                              15


industry characteristics, as well as all contemporaneous correlations across observations in

the same year. We use two-way clustering of the errors, at both the country and year level.

        The regression also includes time-varying country and industry characteristics (X).

We include the natural logarithm of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the natural

logarithm of GDP per capita (GDP per capita) because the size of the economy and the level

of economic development might influence both legal approaches to insider trading and the

degree to which entities file patents with patent offices in more developed OECD countries

(Acharya and Subramanian 2009, Acharya et al., 2013). We also control for stock market

capitalization (Stock/GDP) and domestic credit provided by the financial sector (Credit/GDP)

since the overall functioning of the financial system can influence both innovation and the

enforcement of insider trading laws. These country level control variables are obtained from

the World Development Indicators (WDI) database and the Financial Development and

Structure (FDS) database (Beck et al., 2009) via the World Bank. At the industry-country-

time level, we control for the ratio of each industry's exports to the U.S. over its country's

total exports to the U.S. in each year (Export to US), since economic linkages with the U.S.

might shape an industry’s investment in innovation. The sample varies across specifications

due to the availability of these control variables.

        The coefficient, 𝛼1 , on Enforce provides an estimate of what happens to the patent-
based indicators after the country first enforces its insider trading laws, conditioning on the

various fixed effects and other control variables specified in equation (1). As shown below,

the results are robust to including or excluding the time-varying country and industry

characteristics (X).

        There are several challenges, however, that we must address to use the coefficient

estimate, 𝛼1 , to draw inferences about the impact of insider trading laws on the patent-based

indicators of innovation. First, reverse causality could confound our analyses, i.e., the rate of

innovation, or changes in the rate of innovation, might influence when countries enact and

enforce their insider trading laws. Second, the patent-based indicators might be trending, so

finding patenting activity is different after enforcement might reflect these trends, rather than

a change associated with the enforcement of insider trading laws. Third, omitted variables
                                                                                              16


might limit our ability to identify the impact of change in the legal system’s protection of

potential outside investors from corporate insiders on innovation. For example, factors

omitted from equation (1) might change at the same time as the country starts enforcing

insider trading and it might be these omitted factors that shape subsequent innovation, not the

enforcement of insider trading laws. Without controlling for such factors, we cannot

confidently infer the impact of the enforcement on innovation from 𝛼1 .

       We address each of these concerns below. First, we find no evidence that either the

level or the rate of change in the patent-based measures predict the timing of when countries

start enforcing their insider trading laws. Second, we find no pre-trends in the patent-based

indicators before a country’s first enforcement action; rather there is a notable break in

innovation after a country starts enforcing its insider trading laws. Third, we provide different

assessment of the degree to which omitted variables affect the analyses: (1) we use a

discontinuity design and test whether other factors, such as international trade and financial

development, change in the same way that the patent-based indicators change after the

enforcement of insider trading laws; (2) we include an array of other policy changes

associated with international capital flows, trade, securities markets, and banks to assess the

robustness of the estimated value of 𝛼1 ; and (3) we augment the baseline strategy and assess
the differential response of industries to the enforcement of insider trading laws, so that we
can include country-year fixed effects to absorb any confounding events arising at the

country-year level. As documented below, the evidence from these tests supports the validity

of our econometric strategy.



       3.2. Industry-based empirical strategy

       We next assess whether the cross-industry response to enforcing insider trading laws

is consistent with particular theoretical perspectives on how protecting outside investors from

corporate insiders will affect innovation. To do this, we augment the baseline specification

with an interaction term between Enforce and theoretically-motivated industry traits,

Industry, and with more granular fixed effects:
                                                             ′
        𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑐,𝑡 × 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖 + 𝜆𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 . (2)
                                                                                              17


𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖 measures industry traits, which we define below, that are the same across all

countries and years. With the industry-based empirical strategy, equation (2) now controls for

country-time and industry-time fixed effects. The country-time effect controls for all time-

varying and time invariant country characteristics, while the industry-year effect absorbs all

time-varying and time invariant industry traits. We do not include Enforce, Industry, and all

of the control variables included in equation (1), except Export to US, separately in equation

(2) because they are subsumed in the fixed effects. The coefficient on the interaction term

(𝛽1) provides an estimate of the differential change in innovation across industries traits after

a country first enforces its insider trading laws.

       The first category of industry traits measures the “natural rate” of innovation in each

industry. More specifically, if the enforcement of insider trading laws promotes innovation by

removing an impediment to the market accurately evaluating innovations, then enforcement

should have a particularly pronounced effect on innovation in those industries that had been

most severely hampered by the impediment: “naturally innovative” industries. To measure

which industries are naturally innovative, i.e., industries that innovate more rapidly than other

industries when national authorities enforce insider trading laws, we follow Rajan and

Zingales (1998) and use the U.S. as the benchmark country for defining the natural rate of

innovation in each industry and construct and use two metrics based on the U.S. data.

       The first measure of the natural rate of innovation is High Tech, which is a dummy

variable that designates whether an industry is technology intensive or not. Based on the

work of Hsu et al. (2014), we first calculate high-tech intensiveness as the annual percentage

growth rate in R&D expenses for each publicly listed U.S. firm in each year. We then use the

cross-firm average within each two-digit SIC industry as the measurement of high-tech

intensiveness in a particular industry-year. We next take the time-series average over our

sample period (1976-2006) to obtain a high-tech intensiveness measure for each industry.

Finally, High Tech is assigned the value of one if the corresponding industry measurement is

above the sample median and zero otherwise. Throughout the analyses, we use similar zero-

one industry categorizations for values below or above the sample median. However, all of
                                                                                              18


the results reported below hold when using continuous measures of the industry traits instead

of these zero-one measures.

       The second measure of whether an industry is naturally innovative is Innovation

Propensity. To construct this variable, we follow Acharya and Subramanian (2009) and focus

on (eventually-granted) patents that are filed with the USPTO during our sample period.

First, for each U.S. firm in each year, we determine the number of patents that it applies for in

each U.S. technological class defined in the Current U.S. Class (CCL) system. Second, for

each U.S. technological class in each year, we compute the average number of patents filed

by a U.S. firm. Third, we take the time-series average over the sample period within each

technological class. Fourth, we map this to SIC industries using the mapping table compiled

by Hsu et al. (2014) and obtain each industry’s U.S. innovation propensity at the two-digit

SIC level. The indicator variable Innovation Propensity is set to one if the industry measure is

above the sample median and zero otherwise.

       The second category of industry traits measures the natural opacity of each industry,

i.e., the difficulty of the market formulating an accurate valuation of firms in the industry. If

the enforcement of insider trading laws boosts innovation by encouraging markets to

overcome informational asymmetries, then we should observe a larger increase in innovation

in those industries that had been most hampered by informational asymmetries. To measure

which industries are naturally opaque, we again use the U.S. as the benchmark country in

constructing measures of opacity.

       The first measure of whether an industry is naturally opaque is Intangibility, which

measures the degree to which the industry has a comparatively large proportion of intangible

assets. We use this measure under the assumption that intangible assets are more difficult for

outsider investors to value than tangible assets, which is consistent with the empirical

findings in Chan et al. (2001). To calculate Intangibility, we start with the accounting value

of the ratio of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) to total assets for each firm in each year,

where PPE is a common measure of asset tangibility (e.g., Baker and Wurgler, 2002; Molina,

2005). We then calculate the average of the PPE to total assets ratio across firms in the same

industry-year and take the average over the sample period (1976-2006) for each industry. We
                                                                                                               19


next compute one minus the PPE-to-total-assets ratio for each industry. Throughout the

construction, we use U.S. firms to form this industry benchmark. Finally, we set Intangibility

equal to one for industries in which one minus the PPE-to-total assets ratio is greater than the

median across industries and zero otherwise.

           As a second measure of the degree to which an industry is naturally opaque, we use

the standardized dispersion of the market-to-book value of firms in U.S. industries, where the

standardization is done relative to the average market-to-book equity ratio of publicly listed

U.S. firms in each industry. Intuitively, wider dispersion of the market-to-book values

indicates a greater degree of heterogeneity in how the market values firms in the same

industry. This greater heterogeneity, in turn, can signal more firm opaqueness as the other

firms in the same industry do not serve as good benchmarks. Following Harford (2005), we

calculate the within-industry standard deviation of the market-to-book ratio across all U.S.

publicly listed firms in each industry-year and take the average over time to measure market-

to-book dispersion in each U.S. industry. We then standardize the market-to-book dispersion

by dividing it by the average market-to-book value of each industry. Accordingly, STD of

MTB equals one for observations above the cross-industry median and zero otherwise.

           There might be concerns that the first category of industry traits that focuses on

naturally innovative industries is empirically and conceptually related to the second category

that focuses on opacity because of the comparatively high costs of valuing innovative

endeavors. However, in only 23% of industries are High Tech and Intangibility both equal to

one. 7 They are also conceptually distinct. For example, two industries might be equally
opaque, but one might be more naturally innovative. In this case, the enforcement of insider

trading laws would enhance the valuation of both industries but it would spur a larger jump in

innovation in the more innovative industry. Similarly, two industries might have equal

degrees of natural innovativeness, but one might be more opaque. In this case, enforcement

would have a bigger impact on valuations in the more opaque industry and therefore have a




7
    Only 35% of industries categorized as either innovative or opaque, are labeled as both innovative and opaque.
                                                                                                 20


bigger impact innovation in the naturally more opaque industry. Thus, we examine both

categories of industry traits, while recognizing that there is overlap.



       3.3 Preliminary evidence regarding the validity of these strategies

       In this subsection, we present four types of analyses that advertise the validity and

value of our empirical strategy. To assess the assumption that the initial enforcement of

insider trading laws is not driven by pre-existing innovative activities, we start by plotting the

year that a country first enforces its insider trading against (1) the patent-based measures of

innovation in the years before a country first enforced its insider trading laws and (2) the rate

of change of these patent-based measures of innovation before enforcement. Thus, Figure 1

provides two plots for each of the patent-based measures of innovation. We exclude countries

in which authorities started enforcing their insider trading laws before the start of the sample

period. As portrayed in Figure 1, neither the levels nor the rates of change in the innovation

proxies predict the timing of the initial enforcement of insider trading laws. While by no

means definitive, this mitigates some concerns about reverse causality.

       Second, we employ a hazard model to study the factors shaping when countries first

enforce their insider trading laws. In particular, we test whether patent-based measures of

innovation predict when a country first brings a prosecution against insider trading in a given

year conditional on the fact that no such prosecution had ever been initiated. We assume the

hazard rate follows a Weibull distribution and use the natural log of survival time (i.e.,

expected time to the initial enforcement) as the dependent variable, where longer time

indicates lower likelihood of being enforced. As the key explanatory variables, we use

country-year measures of innovation. Specifically, Patent Count c is the natural logarithm of
one plus the total number of eventually-granted patent applications filed in year t by

applicants from country c. Patent Entities c is the natural logarithm of one plus the total

number of distinct entities in country c that apply for patents in year t. Citation c, Generality c,

and Originality c are defined similarly.
                                                                                                         21


        As shown in Table 3, pre-existing patent-based measures of innovation do not predict

the timing of the first enforcement action. 8 We control for economic and financial

development (GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP, and Credit/GDP) and important

characteristics related to a country’s legal institution and political status. Specifically, we

include legal origin, i.e., whether the country has common law or civil law heritage, because

La Porta et al. (1998, 2008) and the subsequent literature emphasize how legal heritage can

influence an assortment of laws concerning financial contracting. We also include a score

measure of the extent of democracy in a country (Polity), which ranges from -10 (strongly

autocratic) to +10 (strongly democratic), legislature fractionalization (i.e., the probability that

two randomly-picked representatives in the legislature would come from two different

parties), and indicators of political orientation of the largest party in the government (Right,

Left and Central). 9 In all the five specifications, patent-based measures of innovation enter
the regression insignificantly. Thus, there is no evidence that a country’s rate of innovation

predicts when it will start enforcing its insider trading laws.

        Third, we examine the dynamic relationship between innovation and the first time that

a country enforces its insider trading laws. Following Beck et al. (2010), we augment the

baseline regression in equation (1) with a series of time dummies relative to the year of initial

enforcement of the laws (t=0) and use the following:

                               𝜏=𝑡+15                ′
    Innovationc,t = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1,𝜏 ∑𝜏=𝑡−10 Enforce𝑐,𝜏 + 𝜆𝑋𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐 + 𝛿𝑡 + ε𝑐,𝑡 , where τ ≠ 0.                (3)


Innovationc,t is either Patent Count c Citation c, which are our two, core patent-based
indicators of innovation. Enforce𝑐,𝜏 is a dummy variable that equals one if the observation at

time t is τ years away from the year of initial law enforcement. If τ is greater than zero, then

the dummy identifies the τth year after the initial enforcement of the insider trading laws; if τ

  Table 3 provides the results for the sample of countries in which the country did not enforce its insider
trading laws before the start of the sample period. This includes both countries that enforced their laws
during the sample period and those that did not enforce their insider trading laws during the sample period.
The same results hold when only including countries that enforced their laws during the sample period.

is smaller than zero, it represents the τth year before the initial enforcement. We include a

total of 25 dummies to trace out the year-by-year effect on innovation from at most 10 years

before the event to at most 15 years afterwards. At the end points, all the years over 10 years
before the initial enforcement are captured by the dummy Enforce𝑐,−10 while all the years

beyond 15 years after the initial enforcement captured by the dummy 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑐,+15 . The

year of initial enforcement is dropped from the regression. To center the figure, we subtract
the average value of the estimated values of 𝛼1,𝜏 in the pre-enforcement period from each

coefficient estimate. We then plot the estimated coefficients (minus this pre-enforcement

mean). We also include the 95% confidence interval, which is adjusted for country level

clustering. Thus, the confidence intervals evaluate whether each estimated parameter is

significantly different from the pre-enforcement mean. In terms of control variables, Xc,t
includes GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP, and Credit/GDP and the regressions also include

country and year fixed effects. Thus, if the enforcement of insider trading laws is simply

linked to innovation through its association with overall economic or financial development,

this will be captured by the control variables.

       Figure 2 illustrates two crucial findings. First, there is a significant increase in the

patent-based measures of innovation after a country starts enforcing its insider trading laws.

Consistent with the view that enforcement encourages innovative activities, Figure 2 depicts
a 27% increase in Patent Counts c after five years (from the centered value on the first

enforcement date) and an even bigger increase in Citation c. The second key finding confirms

the results from the hazard model: There is not a trend in the patent-based measures of

innovation prior to the year in which a country first enforces its insider trading laws. The

overall pattern suggests that enforcing insider trading has an immediate and enduring

simulative effect on the quantity (Patent Counts c) and quality (Citation c) of patenting.

       Fourth, we employ a discontinuity approach to assess whether there are similar

changes in other factors that might influence innovation when countries start enforcing their

insider trading laws, which may confound the interpretation of the results presented below.

For example, the work by Beny (2013) and others suggests that factors associated with

international trade and overall financial development have shaped and been shaped by insider
                                                                                            23


trading laws. Thus, we build on the dynamic specification in equation (3), and use

Credit/GDP or Trade/GDP as dependent variable. Credit/GDP measures the development of

domestic credit market; Trade/GDP gauges the intensity of international trade. As shown in

Figure 3, nether the credit markets or the international trade changes in the same way that the

patent-based indicators change after enforcement; indeed, neither Credit/GDP nor

Trade/GDP changes appreciably around the date when countries start enforcing their insider

trading laws. These findings reinforce the validity of our identification strategy.


4. Empirical Results
       In this section, we present results on the relationship between technological

innovation and the enforcement of insider trading laws. We first use the baseline specification

to evaluate what happens to patent-based proxies of innovation after a country first enforces

its insider trading laws. We then present the results from the industry-level approach, in

which we access the heterogeneous response of industries to enforcement.



       4.1 Baseline Specification

       Table 4 presents the regression results from the baseline equation (1) defined in

Section 3. The table consists of five columns, one for each patent-based proxy, and two

panels, where Panel A presents results in which the regressors besides Enforce are the

country, industry, and year fixed effects and where, in Panel B, the regressions also include

the time-varying country and industry characteristics defined above. Thus, Table 4 presents

the results from ten model specifications. In all of the regressions reported throughout the

remainder of the paper, the standard errors are two-way clustered at both the country and year

level, allowing for statistical inferences that are robust to correlations among error terms

within both country and year clusters.

       The results indicate that all of the patent-based measures increase materially after the

average country first enforces its insider trading laws. Enforce enters with a positive and

statistically significant coefficient in all ten regressions. The coefficient estimates also

indicate that there is an economically large increase in the innovation measures after
                                                                                              24


countries start enforcing their insider trading laws. For example, consider Panel B, which

includes the broadest set of control variables. The results indicate that the initial enforcement

of insider trading laws is associated with a 26% increase in Patent Counts (i.e., patenting

intensity), a 21% increase in the number of Patenting Entities (i.e., scope of patenting

activity), a 37% increase in Citations (i.e., impact), a 16% in Generality (i.e., breadth of

impact on other technologies), and an 18% increase in Originality (i.e., breadth of other

technologies cited).

       To address concerns that countries adopt packages of policy reforms at the same that

they start enforcing insider trading laws, potentially confounding our identification strategy,

we include an assortment of policy indicators in Table 5. Specifically, into the Table 4

regressions we now include (1) Credit Control, which is an index of the restrictiveness of

reserve requirements, existence of mandatory credit allocation requirements, and credit

ceilings, with greater index for fewer restrictions, (2) Interest Rate Control, which measures

the inverse of the extent to which the authorities control interest rates, (3) Entry Barriers,

which measures the ease of foreign bank entry and the extent of competition in the domestic

banking sector (e.g., restrictions on branching), (4) Bank Supervision, which measures the

degree of supervision over the banking sector, (5) Bank Privatization, which measures the

presence of state owned banks, (6) Capital Control, which measures restrictions on

international capital flows, and again with greater value associated with fewer restrictions, (7)

Securities Market, which measures the level of development of securities markets and

restrictions on foreign equity ownership, (8) Financial Reform Index, which is the sum of the

previous seven variables, (9) Liberal Capital Markets, which is defined as one after a country

officially liberalized its capital market and zero otherwise (i.e. formal regulatory change after

which foreign investors officially have the opportunity to invest in domestic equity

securities), where the official liberalization date is obtained from Bekaert and Harvey (2000)

and augmented by Bekaert, Harvey and Lundblad (2005) for 68 countries in our sample.

Table 1 provides detailed definitions of these variables.

       The results are robust to controlling for these indicators of policy reforms. Table 5

summarizes the results from 45 regressions, as we examine each of the nine policy reform
                                                                                             25


indicators individually for each of the five patent-based indicators of innovation. The

regressions continue to also control for country, industry, and year fixed effects along with

the time-varying country and industry controls. As shown, even when controlling for these

policy reforms, Enforce enters each of the regressions significantly. Indeed, when controlling

for these policy indicators, the estimated coefficient varies little from the estimates reported

in Table 4. These results help mitigate concerns that other policy changes that occur at the

same time as the enforcement of insider trading laws account for the close association

between enforcement and the uptick in innovation.

       We provide three additional robustness tests in the Appendixes. First, we control for

country-industry fixed effects and year fixed effects in assessing the relationship between

innovation and enforcement. As shown in Appendix B, we find that Enforce enters positively

and significantly in each of the patent-based regressions and the estimated point estimates on

Enforce are very similar to those reported in Table 4. This robustness check ensures that the

results are not confounded by any time-invariant characteristics specific to each industry in

each country.

       Second, we examine whether the results hold on both the extensive and intensive

margins. Specifically, as explained in the Section 2, our baseline sample excludes country-

industry observations in which we find no evidence of patenting activity. In this way, Table 4

focuses on the intensive margin. In Appendix C, we include those observations in which we

have no evidence of patenting and impose a value of zero for those country-industry

observations. In this way, Appendix C includes the extensive margin. As shown, all of the

results hold when using this large sample. Apparently, after a country starts enforcing its

insider trading laws, existing innovative industries start innovating more and formally non-

innovative industries start innovating.

       Third, we conduct a placebo test by examining the date that a country enacts insider

trading laws. As discussed, earlier work argues and finds that enforcement, not enactment,

curtails insider trading. Thus, if the reduction in insider trading stimulates innovation, we

should find that including the enactment date should neither affect the estimated impact of

Enforce nor should the enactment date provide much additional explanatory power. This is
                                                                                            26


what we find. As reported in Appendix D, the enactment of insider trading laws does not help

account for changes in the patent-based indicators and including the enactment date does not

alter the findings on Enforce.



       4.2 Heterogeneous Responses by Industry

       In this subsection, we evaluate cross-industry changes in innovative activity after a

country starts enforcing its insider trading laws and assess whether these patterns are

consistent with particular theoretical perspectives on how insider trading affects innovation.

In particular, one class of models emphasizes that the enforcement of insider trading laws

removes an impediment to the market more fully and accurately valuing innovative projects

and thereby encourages more investment in innovative activities that have positive net

present values (NPVs) when valued in a setting with no informational asymmetries between

corporate insiders and outsiders. From this perspective,, when a country starts enforcing its

insider trading laws, this should have a particularly positive impact on innovation in those

industries that had been most constrained by the absence of enforcement, such as (1)

naturally innovative industries that would have had much faster rates of innovation except for

the informational impediments created by the lack of effective limits on insider trading and

(2) naturally opaque industries that the market would have more precisely valued if there had

been effective restrictions on insider trading.



        4.2.1 Differentiating by the natural innovativeness of industries

       Based on equation (2), Table 6 presents our assessment of whether naturally

innovative industries experience larger increases in patent-based measures of innovation after

a country starts enforcing its insider trading laws than other industries. In each panel, there

are five regressions, where the dependent variable is one of the five patent-based measures.

The explanatory variable of interest is the interaction terms, High Tech*Enforce in Panel A

and Innovation Propensity*Enforce in Panel B, and the regressions also control for country-

year and industry-year fixed effects, as well as each country-industry’s exports to the U.S. in

each year.
                                                                                              27


       As shown in Panel A, the patent-based measures of innovation rise much more in

high-tech industries after a country first enforces its insider trading laws. For example, Patent

Counts increase by 43% more in high-tech industries than in other industries, where a high-

tech industry is one in which the average annual growth rate of R&D expenses over the

sample period is greater than the median (using the U.S. to make these calculations for all

industries). The large wedge between high-tech and other industries holds for the other

patent-based measures. After a country first enforces its insider trading laws, high-tech

industries experience larger increases in Patenting Entities, Citations, Generality, and

Originality than other industries. By controlling for country-year effects, these results cannot

be attributed to other changes that occur in the country at the same time as the first

enforcement of insider trading unless those other changes also differentially affect industries

in precisely this manner. Similarly, by controlling for industry-year effects, these results are

not due to international increases in the rates of innovation in high-tech industries.

       Panel B presents similarly strong results when differentiating industries by another

proxy for the degree to which an industry is naturally innovative—Innovation Propensity,

which equals one when the average number of patents per firm in the U.S. industry is greater

than the median. The interaction term, Innovation Propensity*Enforce enters each of the

regressions positively and significantly at the one percent level. The estimated effects are

large. For example, in an average industry in the subset of industries with Innovation

Propensity equal to one, Patent Count rises by 50% more than an average industry in the

subset of industries with Innovation Propensity equal to zero after a country starts enforcing

insider trading laws. These findings are also consistent with the valuation view of how the

enforcement of insider trading laws shapes innovation.



       4.2.2 Differentiating by the natural opacity of industries

       We next assess whether industries that are naturally opaque experience a bigger

increase in innovative activity after a country first enforces its insider trading laws. As

explained above, several models predict that enforcing insider trading laws will encourage

potential investors to expend more resources valuing firms, so that enforcement will have a
                                                                                               28


particularly positive impact on valuations—and hence innovation—in those industries in

which informational asymmetries had most severely impeded the full valuation of positive

NPV projects. As noted above, proxies for natural opacity might be correlated with the degree

to which an industry is naturally innovative. Thus, we do not claim to identify independently

the naturally innovative and opacity channels. Rather, we assess whether the enforcement of

insider trading laws has a more pronounced and positive impact on innovation in both

naturally innovative and opaque industries.

       As reported in Table 7, we find that more opaque industries—as proxied by

Intangibility = 1 in Panel A—experience a much larger increase in innovation after the

enforcement of insider trading laws than other industries. Recall that Intangibility equals one

if the proportion of intangible to total assets among firms in an industry is greater than the

median industry (using U.S. data to categorize industries). The interaction term,

Intangibility*Enforce enters positively and significantly at the one percent level in the Patent

Count, Patent Entities, Citation, Generality, and Originality regressions. Furthermore, the

effect is large. Across the different patent-based measures of innovation, innovation increases

by 26% to 30% more in opaque industries than in other industries after a country starts

enforcing its insider trading laws.

       Using the standard deviation of the market-to-book ratio, STD of MTB, as an

alternative proxy for informational opacity in Panel B, the results confirm the finding that

enforcement has a disproportionately large, positive effect on innovation in more opaque

industries. As defined above, STD of MTB equals one for industries in which the within-

industry standard deviation of the market-to-book ratio is above the median and zero

otherwise. The results indicate that industries in which STD of MTB equals one enjoy a bigger

increase in innovative activity after a country first enforces its insider trading laws than other

industries. In particular, STD of MTB*Enforce enters positively and significantly in the Patent

Count, Patent Entities, Citation, Generality, and Originality regressions, where the

regressions continue to control for country-year effects, industry-year effects, and Export to

US. These findings are consistent with theories emphasizing that the enforcement of insider

trading laws reduces the disincentives to expending resources on valuing projects and the
                                                                                                                29


reduction of these disincentives will have an especially big impact on naturally innovative

and opaque industries. 10

           We were concerned that the results might be driven by a particular group of countries.

For instance, perhaps the results are driven by either highly developed economies or highly

underdeveloped economies, in which a few additional patents after enforcement might have a

big impact on the estimated coefficients. We were also concerned the results could be driven

only by countries with highly developed or underdeveloped stock markets or only by

countries with market-oriented political ideologies. Thus, we conduct the analyses while

splitting the sample into several subgroup, including by the economic size of the economy

(median GDP), the level of economic development (median GDP per capita), the level of

stock market development (median Stock/GDP), and political orientation (, i.e., whether the

political orientation is more Right or more Center/Left). As shown in Appendix E, all of the

different patent-based measures of innovation rise appreciably in naturally innovative

industries after a country starts enforcing its insider trading laws across all of the subsamples



5. Equity Issuances
           One channel through which the enforcement of insider trading laws may affect

innovation is by facilitating the issuance of equity. In particular, several theories emphasize

that effective constraints on insider trading will enhance the valuation of innovative activities

and thereby facilitate equity issuances by such firms. This can occur in several ways.

           If innovators and investors can eventually capitalize on successful innovations by

issuing equity at prices that more fully value the innovation, this will foster investment in the

costly and risky process of creating those innovations. According to Aggarwal and Hsu

10
     In unreported robustness tests, we examine the sensitivity of the Table 6 and Table 7 results to including
additional controls. In particular, we interact High Tech, Innovation Propensity, Intangibility, and STD of MTB
with the policy indicators used in Table 5 and add those interaction terms to the regressions in Table 6 and Table
7. We confirm that all of the results in Table 6 and Table 7 when adding these interaction terms. Consistent with
the view that enforcing insider trading laws improves valuations and these improvements have a particularly
large effect on naturally innovative and opaque industries, we find that High Tech*Enforce, Innovation
Propensity*Enforce, Intangibility*Enforce, and STD of MTB*Enforce continue to enter the innovation
regressions positively and significantly with similar point estimates as to those reported in Table 6 and Table 7.
                                                                                             30


(2014), initial public offerings (IPOs) and acquisitions by other entities are two major exit

routes that provide financial returns to entrepreneurs and investors. For start-ups, enforcing

insider trading laws can incentivize innovative endeavors ex ante by improving the expected

valuation during future IPOs. Similarly, for entrepreneurs that exit via acquisitions,

particularly in the form of stock swaps, enforcing insider trading laws can also encourage

innovative endeavors ex ante by increasing the expected prices of such acquisitions, as

reflected, for example, in the terms of future stock swaps. More generally, to the extent that

public acquirers can issue new shares that correctly price the innovations owned by target

companies, this increases the expect returns to potential targets from investing in innovation

in the first place.

        Furthermore, the enforcement of insider trading laws can stimulate innovation by

facilitating seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). For publicly listed firms, effective insider

trading laws can increase the accuracy with which markets value innovative activities and

thereby facilitate SEOs. Having shown above that the enforcement of insider trading laws is

associated with a sharp increase in patenting activity in naturally innovative industries, we

now assess whether this is associated with a surge in equity issuances as well.

        Motivated by these predictions, we test whether firms in naturally innovative

industries issue more equity than those in other industries after a country starts enforcing its

insider trading laws. To distinguish naturally innovative industries from other industries, we

again use High Tech and Innovation Propensity. We use nine measures of equity issuances.

For each industry-country-year, we calculate the natural logarithm of one plus the number of

IPOs (IPO Number), the natural logarithm of one plus the proceeds of those IPOs in U.S.

dollars (IPO Proceeds), and the natural logarithm of one plus the average amount raised (in

U.S. dollars) per IPO (Proceeds per IPO). We calculate similar measures for SEOs (SEO

Number, SEO Proceeds, and Proceeds per SEO) and for total of IPOs and SEOs in each

industry-country-year (Total Issue Number, Total Proceeds, and Proceeds per Issue).
                                                                                              31


       Specifically, we estimate the following equation:

                                                          ′
𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑐,𝑡 × 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖 + 𝜆𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 ,     (4)


where Equity Issuancei,c,t is one of the nine measures of equity issuances and Industryi is

either High Tech or Innovation Propensity. We continue to include country-year and industry-

year fixed effects and to control for the ratio of country-industry-year exports to the U.S. as a

share of the country’s total exports to the U.S. in that year (Export to US). Table 8 provides

the regression results. Panel A provides the results from nine regressions in which the

interaction term is Enforce*High Tech, while Panel B provides the results in which the

interaction term is Enforce*Innovation Propensity.

       As shown in Table 8, equity issuances increase substantially more in naturally

innovative industries than in other industries after a country first enforces its insider trading

laws. Across the nine regressions in Panel A, the estimated coefficient on Enforce*High Tech

enters positively and significantly at the one percent level. The results are equally strong

when examining the interaction term of Enforce*Innovation Propensity in Panel B. In all

cases, the number of equity issuances, the amount raised through those issuances, and the

average size of the issuances all increase more in naturally innovative industries after insider

trading laws are first enforced. These results hold when considering IPOs, SEOs, or the total

number and value of issuances.

       The estimated magnitudes are large. For example, the Table 8 estimates indicate that

enforcing insider trading laws is associated with 38% larger increase in IPO Proceeds in

industries in which Innovation Propensity equals one than in industries in which Innovation

Propensity equals zero. As another example, the reported estimates in Table 8 suggest that

when a country starts enforcing insider trading laws, this is associated with a 32% larger

boost in SEO Proceeds in industries with a naturally fast growth rate of R&D expenditures

(i.e., High Tech =1) as compared with other industries. The results are consistent with the

view that the enforcement of insider trading laws facilitates equity issuances by naturally

innovative industries.
                                                                                            32

6. Conclusion

       In this paper, we provide evidence consistent with the view that legal systems that

protect outside investors from corporate insiders accelerate technological innovation. Based
on over 75,000 industry-country-year observations across 94 economies from 1976 to 2006,

we discover that patent intensity, scope, impact, generality, and originally of patenting

activity all rise markedly after a country first starts enforcing its insider trading laws.

Moreover, we find that the pattern of cross-industry changes in innovative activity is

consistent with theories emphasizing that when insiders can trade on non-public information

this dissuades other investors from expending the resources necessary for accurately valuing

innovative activities, which impedes the efficient allocation of capital to innovative

endeavors. In particular, several theories stress that the enforcement of insider trading laws

should have a particularly pronounced effect on (1) naturally innovative industries—

industries that would have experienced rapid innovation if insider trading had not impeded

accurate valuations—and (2) naturally opaque industries—industries that would experience

more investment if insider trading has not impeded accurate valuations. This is what we find.

The relationship between enforcing insider trading laws and innovation is much larger in

industries that are naturally innovative and opaque, where we use U.S. industries to

categorize industries by innovativeness and opacity.
       Moreover, our findings on equity issuances emphasizes that restricting insider trading

boosts equity issuances, especially among firms in naturally innovative industries. To the

extent that insider trading impedes the ability of markets to accurately value innovative

activities and the resulting informational asymmetry impedes the ability of such firms to issue

equity, we should find that restricting insider trading facilitates equity issuances by such

firms. This is what we find. We discover that industries that are naturally more innovative

experience a much bigger increase in IPOs and SEOs after a country starts enforcing its

insider trading laws than other types of industries.

       The results in this paper contribute to a large and emerging body of evidence

suggesting that laws, regulations, and enforcement mechanisms that foster transparency,

integrity, and broad participation enhance the functioning of financial systems with positive
                                                                                             33


ramifications on economic activity, as discussed in Barth et al. (2006), La Porta et al. (2008),

and Beck et al. (2010). We find that legal systems that impede insider trading and thereby

encourage investors to acquire information and value firms more accurately exert a material

impact on innovation. Since innovation is vital for sustaining improvements in living

standards, these results highlight the centrality of financial market policies for promoting

economic prosperity.

This table provides definition and data sources of all the variables used in the analysis. They are grouped into
five categories related to insider trading laws, patent-based measures of innovation, the economic and legal
development of each country, industry characteristics, and equity issuance activities.

                                        Patent-based Innovation Measures
Citation             The natural logarithm of one plus the total number of forward citations             PATSTAT
                     made to (eventually-granted) patents in industry i that are filed with                Database
                     patent offices in one of the member countries of the Organization for
                     Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and/or European
                     Patent Office (EPO) in year t by applicants in country c; if there are
                     more than one patent for a particular invention (i.e. multiple patents
                     being part of the same DOCDB patent family), either the citing
                     invention or the cited one, we only count one citation regardless of the
                     actual patent(s) citing or being cited between two patent families, and
                     we use the bibliographic information of the first patent in a patent
                     family to determine the year, the International Patent Classification
                     (IPC) subclass and the country of the invention; since citations beyond
                     the coverage of PATSTAT (i.e., the full years after 2014) are not
                     observed, we adjust for the actually-observed citation count of a patent
                     family granted after 1985 by dividing it by the weighting factor
                     corresponding to its IPC section (K) and the lag between its year of
                     grant and 2014 (L): 𝑊𝐾𝐿 , 𝐿 = 0, … , 28; 𝑊𝐾𝐿 = 1/𝑆    �𝐾𝐿 , where 𝑆�𝐾𝐿 is the
                     estimated cumulative share of citations having been received since the
                     grant of the patent in IPC section K for L years over a 30-year lifetime;
                     we calculate 𝑆𝐾𝐿 based on the patents granted in each of the ten years
                     between 1976-1985 respectively (1985 is the last year with 30 years’
                     observations) and define 𝑆  �𝐾𝐿 as the average across the ten estimates for
                     each K each L; citations to patent families granted on and before 1985
                     are not adjusted; then, the (adjusted) citation count is summed over all
                     the patent families in a particular IPC subclass, converted to
                     International Standard Industry Classification (ISIC) using the
                     concordance provided by Lybbert and Zolas (2012), and further to the
                     two-digit Standard Industry Classification (SIC) industry level using
                     the concordance by the United Nations Statistical Division.
                     Citation* is Citation before the log transformation.
                     Citation c is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of
                     citations to patent families that are filed in year t, in country c.

                     http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdnld.asp?Lg=1
Generality           The natural logarithm of one plus the sum of the generality score of all            PATSTAT
                     the (eventually-granted) patents in industry i that are filed with patent             Database
                     offices in one of the OECD countries and/or EPO in year t by
                     applicants in country c; the generality score of each patent is defined
                     as the one minus the Herfindahl Index of the IPC sections of patents
                     citing it; the higher the generality score, the more generally applicable
                     the patents is for other types of innovations; the score is first
                     aggregated at IPC level, then converted to ISIC using the concordance

                     generality score of all the patents that are filed in year t by applicants
                     from country c.
Originality          The natural logarithm of one plus the sum of the originality score of all     PATSTAT
                     the (eventually-granted) patents in industry i that are filed with OECD        Database
                     countries and/or European Patent Office (EPO) in year t by applicants
                     in country c; the generality score of each patent is defined as the one
                     minus the Herfindahl Index of the IPC sections of patents that it cites;
                     the higher the originality score, the wider range of technologies it
                     draws upon; the score is first aggregated at IPC subclass level, then
                     converted to ISIC using the concordance provided by Lybbert and
                     Zolas (2012), and further to the two-digit SIC industry level using the
                     concordance by the United Nations Statistical Division.
                     Originality* is Originality before the log transformation.
                     Originality c is the natural logarithm of one plus the sum of the
                     originality score of all the patents that are filed in year t by applicants
                     from country c.
Patent Count         The natural logarithm of one plus the total number of eventually-             PATSTAT
                     granted patent applications belonging to industry i that are filed with        Database
                     the patent offices in one of the 34 OECD countries and/or the EPO in
                     year t by applicants from country c; if there are more than one patent
                     for a particular invention (i.e. multiple patents being part of the same
                     DOCDB patent family), we count the first patent and use its
                     bibliographic information to determine the year, the IPC subclass and
                     the country of the invention; the total number is first calculated at IPC
                     subclass level, then converted to ISIC using the concordance provided
                     by Lybbert and Zolas (2012), and further mapped to the two-digit SIC
                     industry level using the concordance by the United Nations Statistical
                     Division.
                     Patent Count* is Patent Count before the log transformation.
                     Patent Count c is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of

                     export to the U.S. in each year; the data is provided at the Standard
                     International Trade Classification level (SITC Rev1) and we map it to
                     the two-digit SIC level via Harmonized System (H0) using the

                     U.S. public firms in each industry-year; then we use the time-series
                     average within each industry over the sample period (1976-2006) as
                     the measurement of high-tech intensiveness at industry level; High
                     Tech is set to 1 if it is above the sample median and 0 otherwise.
Innovation           An indicator variable based on the innovation propensity measure for            NBER Patent

                     in each year; we then calculate the time-series average within each
                     technological class over the sample period (1976-2006); after
                     obtaining the measurement at the three-digit technological class, we
                     convert it to the two-digit SIC level using the mapping scheme

                     item at) across all the U.S. public firms in an industry-year; we then
                     use the time-series average within each industry over the sample
                     period (1976-2006); we next compute one minus the PPE/Asset ratio
                     as the proxy for intangibility in each industry; Intangibility is set to 1 if
                     it is above the sample median and 0 otherwise.

                     year; we then compute the time-series average within each industry
                     over the sample period (1976-2006); we next divide the dispersion of
                     market-to-book ratio at industry-level by the average market-to-book
                     ratio in the same industry, where the denominator is firm-level market-
                     to-book ratio averaged within each industry-year and then across
                     industry-years; MTB_STD is set to 1 if it is above the sample median

This table presents the unweighted summary statistics across all the observations within the sample period 1976-
2006. Patent Count* is defined as the total number of eventually-granted patent applications belonging to
industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Patent Entities* is the total number of distinct
entities in country c, that apply for patents in industry i in year t. Citation* is the total number of citations to
patent families in industry i, in country c, and in year t, where t is the application year. Generality* and
Originality* are the sum of the generality and originality scores of all the patents in industry i that are filed in
year t by applicants from country c respectively. Patent Count, Patent Entities, Citation, Generality and
Originality are the natural logarithm of one plus the respective values of Patent Count*, Patent Entities*,
Citation*, Generality*, and Originality*. We restrict to patents filed and granted by the patent offices in one of
the 34 OECD countries and/or EPO and we work with patent families to define patent-based measures of
innovation. Country-level economic characteristics include GDP, GDP per capita (both in natural logarithm),
equity/credit market development (Stock/GDP, Credit/GDP), international trade (Trade/GDP), and a series of
measures of financial liberalization policies; country-level legal and political factors include legal origin
(Common Law), the extent of democracy (Polity), legislature fractionalization (Fractionalization), and political
orientation of the largest party in the government (Right, Central, Left). Industry-level variables include the
share of industry’s export over total export to the U.S. (Export to US) and a series of U.S.-based industry
indicators representing different natural rate of innovation (High Tech and Innovation Propensity) and
information opacity (Intangibility and STD of MTB). Industry-level equity issuance activities include the number
of equity issuance (IPO Number, SEO Number and Total Issue Number), total proceeds from equity issuance
(IPO Proceeds, SEO Proceeds and Total Proceeds) and proceeds per issuance (Proceeds per IPO, Proceeds per
SEO and Proceeds per Issue), respectively measured for total equity issuance (both IPO and SEO), IPO and
SEO, which are all transformed into the natural logarithm of one plus the original value. Except for country-
level variables, whose summary statistics are calculate over country-year observations, the summary statistics of
all other variables are calculated over all the industry-country-year observations. Table 1 provides detailed
definitions of the variables.

                                            Hazard Model Estimation
This table shows the estimated effect of country-level patent-based measures of innovation before the initial
enforcement of the insider trading laws on the expected time to the initial enforcement based on Weibull
distribution of the hazard rate. Patent Count c is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of eventually-
granted patent applications filed in year t by applicants from country c. Patent Entities c is the natural logarithm
of one plus the total number of distinct entities in country c that apply for patents in year t. Citation c is the
natural logarithm of one plus the total number of citations to patent families in country c, and in year t, where t
is the application year. Generality c and Originality c are the natural logarithm of one plus the sum of the
generality and originality scores of all the patents that are filed in year t by applicants from country c,
respectively. Counties that enforced the insider trading laws before 1976 are excluded from the duration model
analysis. Among the remaining countries, we treat those without law enforcement within our sample period as
always “at risk” of enforcing the law; for those with law enforcement within our sample period, they drop out of
the sample once the law was enforced. Control variables are grouped into economic, legal and political factors.
Measurements of economic development include GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP and Credit/GDP.
Measurements of legal and political environment include 1) an indicator variable for legal origins (Common
Law) that equals one if a country has common law origin; 2) the composite index of democracy and autocracy
(Polity), ranging from -10 (strongly autocratic) to +10 (strongly democratic); it is obtained from the Polity IV
Database; 3) legislature fractionalization (Fractionalization), defined as the probability that two deputies picked
at random from the legislature will be of different parties; it is obtained from the Database of Political Institution
(Beck et al., 2001); 4) three indicator variables representing political orientation of the largest party in the
government: right-wing / conservative / Christian democratic (Right), centrist (Central) and left-wing / socialist
/ communist / social democrat (Left), where Left serves as the base group; they are obtained from the Database
of Political Institution. Robust z-statistics are reported in parenthesis, which are based on standard errors
clustered at country level. ***, **, * denote significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10% respectively.

                     Table 4 Insider Trading Law Enforcement and Innovation: Baseline
This table presents the baseline panel regression results of the initial enforcement of insider trading laws on the
innovative activities measured at the industry-country level using the following specification: Innovation𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 =
𝛼0 + 𝛼1 Enforce𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛾𝑋′𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝛿𝑡 + ε𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 . Enforce is the key explanatory variable, which is equal to
one for years after the law is enforced for the first time in a country. The dependent variable, Innovation, is one
of the five patent-based measures of innovation. Patent Count is the natural logarithm of one plus the total
number of patent applications belonging to industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Patent
Entities is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of distinct entities in country c that apply for
patents in industry i in year t. Citation is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of truncation-
adjusted citations to patent families in industry i, in country c, and in year t, where t is the application year.
Generality and Originality are the natural logarithm of one plus the sum of either the generality or originality
score of all the patents in industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Control variables
include GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP, Credit/GDP and Export to US. Table 1 provides detailed definitions
of the variables. Robust t-statistics are reported in parenthesis, which are based on standard errors clustered at
the country and year level. ***, **, * denote significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10% respectively.

         Table 5 Insider Trading Law Enforcement and Innovation: Controlling for Policy Changes
This table presents the effect of the enforcement of insider trading laws on innovation, controlling for other
policy changes and reforms for financial liberalization (FL). We follow the following
                                                                       ′
specification: Innovation𝑖,c,t = β0 + β1 Enforcec,t + β2 FL𝑐,𝑡 + 𝜆𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑡   + δc + δi + δt + ε𝑖,c,t . We use an
assortment of FL measures from columns 1) to 9): 1) Credit Control evaluates the restrictiveness of reserve
requirements, existence of mandatory credit allocation and credit ceilings, ranging from 0 (i.e., fully repressed)
to 3 (fully liberalized); 2) Interest Rate Control measures the extent of interest rate liberalization, with 0, 1, 2, 3
indicates fully repressed, partially repressed, largely liberalized and fully liberalized, respectively; 3) Entry
Barriers captures the ease of foreign bank entry and the extent of competition in the domestic banking sector
(e.g., restrictions on branching), which also ranges from 0 to 3, indicating the least liberalized to the fully
liberalized; 4) Bank Supervision measures the degree of supervision over the banking sector, ranging from 0 (not
regulated) to 3 (highly regulated); 5) Bank Privatization proxies the presence of state ownership, ranging from 0
to 3, where 0 means the highest level of state ownership (i.e., full repressed), while 3 means the lowest (i.e.,
fully liberalized); 6) Capital Control evaluates the restrictions on international capital flow, ranging from 0 (i.e.,
fully repressed) to 3 (fully liberalized); 7) Securities Market evaluates measures to develop securities market and
restrictions on the foreign equity ownership, ranging from 0 (i.e., fully depressed) to 3 (i.e., fully liberalized); 8)
Financial Reform Index is the sum of the previous seven variables; Variables in columns 1)-8) are obtained from
IMF, available for a maximum of 71 countries in our sample ; 9) Liberal Capital Markets is defined as one after
a country officially liberalized its capital market and zero otherwise (i.e. formal regulatory change after which
foreign investors officially have the opportunity to invest in domestic equity securities), where the official
liberalization date is obtained from Bekaert and Harvey (2000) and augmented with Bekaert, Harvey and
Lundblad (2005) for 68 countries in our sample. Control variables include GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP,
Credit/GDP and Export to US. Table 1 provides detailed definitions of the variables. Robust t-statistics are
reported in parenthesis, which are based on standard errors clustered at the country and year level. ***, **, *

Innovation𝑖,c,t = β0 + β1 Enforcec,t × Innovation Propensity𝑖 + 𝜆𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + δc,t + δ𝑖,t + ε𝑖,c,t (Panel B). Enforce
is a dummy variable set equal to one for years after the law is enforced for the first time in a country. High Tech
is a dummy variable set equal to one if the measurement of high-tech intensiveness at the two-digit SIC is above
the sample median and zero otherwise; High-tech intensiveness is defined as the average growth rate of R&D
expense over the sample period in each industry benchmarked to the U.S. Innovation Propensity is a dummy
variable set to one if the measurement of innovation propensity at the two-digit SIC is above the sample median
and zero otherwise; innovation propensity is defined as the average number of patents filed by a U.S. firm in a
particular industry over the sample period. The dependent variable, Innovation, is one of the five patent-based
measures of innovation. Patent Count is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of patent applications
belonging to industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Patent Entities is the natural
logarithm of one plus the total number of distinct entities in country c, that apply for patents in industry i in year
t. Citation is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of truncation-adjusted citations to patent families
in industry i, in country c, and in year t, where t is the application year. Generality and Originality are the
natural logarithm of one plus the sum of either the generality or originality score of all the patents in industry i
that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Control variable is Export to US and other characteristics
are subsumed by the country-year dummies δc,t and industry-year dummies δ𝑖,t . Table 1 provides detailed
definitions of the variables. Robust t-statistics are reported in parenthesis, which are based on standard errors
clustered at the country and year level. ***, **, * denote significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10% respectively.

dummy variable set equal to one for years after the law is enforced for the first time in a country. Intangibility is
a dummy variable set to one if intangibility measurement at the two-digit SIC is above the sample median and
zero otherwise; we measure intangibility as one minus PPE/Asset ratio of each industry benchmarked to the
U.S. STD of MTB is a dummy variable set to one if the standardized valuation dispersion at the two-digit SIC is
above the sample median and zero otherwise; it is measured as the standard deviation of market-to-book equity
ratio over the average market-to-book equity ratio within each industry benchmarked to the U.S. The dependent
variable, Innovation, is one of the five patent-based measures of innovation. Patent Count is defined as the
natural logarithm of one plus the total number of patent applications belonging to industry i that are filed in year
t by applicants from country c. Patent Entities is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of distinct

                Figure 1 Timing of Insider Trading Law Enforcement and Pre-existing Innovation
The set of figures plot the average level of innovation and the average rate of change in innovation before the initial
enforcement of the insider trading laws against the year of the initial enforcement. Innovation takes one of the five
patent-based measures of innovation at country level: Patent Count c, Patent Entities c, Citation c, Generality c and
Originality c respectively. Table 1 provides detailed definitions of the variables. Only countries with enforcement of
insider trading laws within our sample period 1976-2006 are plotted in the figures.

Control variables include GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP, and Credit/GDP. Table 1 provides detailed definitions
of the variables. A 25-year window spanning from 10 years before to 15 years after the year of initial enforcement is
used in the estimation, with country and year fixed effects included. The dotted lines represent the 95% confidence
interval of the estimated effect where standard errors are clustered at the country level. The year of initial
enforcement is excluded and serves as the benchmark year.

                 Appendix A Country-level Information of Insider Trading Laws and Innovation
This table presents basic information on the enactment year (Exist Year) and enforcement year (Enforce Year) of the
insider trading laws, together with summary statistics of the patent-based measures of innovation by country. There
are a total of 94 countries in the full sample between 1976 and 2006 (U.S. is included for illustration purpose).
Patent Count* is the total number of eventually-granted patent applications belonging to industry i that are filed in
year t by applicants from country c. Patent Entities* is the total number of distinct entities in country c, that apply
for patents in industry i in year t. Citation* is the total number of citations to patent families in industry i, in country
c, and in year t, where t is the application year. Generality* and Originality* are the sum of the generality and
originality scores, respectively of all the patents in industry i that are applied in year t by applicants from country c.
We restrict to patents filed and granted by the patent offices in one of the 34 OECD countries and/or EPO and we
work with patent families to define the patent-based measures of innovation. When reporting the summary statistics
for each country of these patent-based measures of innovation, we take the unweighted average across industry-year
observations within the sample period 1976-2006. Industry-country-year without patent information is not included
in the sample. Industry is defined on two-digit SIC. Table 1 provides detailed definitions of the variables.

                              Robustness with Country-industry and Year Fixed Effects
In this table, we present the robustness test results of baseline analysis using country-industry and year fixed effects.
We use the following specification: Innovation𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 Enforce𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛾𝑋′𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐,𝑖 + 𝛿𝑡 + ε𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 . Enforce is
equal to one for years after the law is enforced for the first time in a country. The dependent variable, Innovation, is
one of the five patent-based measures of innovation. Patent Count is the natural logarithm of one plus the total
number of patent applications belonging to industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Patent
Entities is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of distinct entities in country c that apply for patents in
industry i in year t. Citation is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of truncation-adjusted citations to
patent families in industry i, in country c, and in year t, where t is the application year. Generality and Originality
are the natural logarithm of one plus the sum of either the generality or originality score of all the patents in industry
i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Control variables include GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP,
Credit/GDP and Export to US. Table 1 provides detailed definitions of the variables. Robust t-statistics are reported
in parenthesis, which are based on standard errors clustered at the country and year level. ***, **, * denote
significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10% respectively.

them. We use the following specification: Innovation𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 Enforce𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛾𝑋′𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝛿𝑡 + ε𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 .
Enforce is equal to one for years after the law is enforced for the first time in a country. The dependent variable,
Innovation, is one of the five patent-based measures of innovation. Patent Count is the natural logarithm of one plus
the total number of patent applications belonging to industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c.
Patent Entities is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of distinct entities in country c that apply for

variables include GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP, Credit/GDP and Export to US. Table 1 provides detailed definitions of the variables. Robust t-statistics are
reported in parenthesis, which are based on standard errors clustered at the country and year level. ***, **, * denote significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10%
respectively.

              Appendix E Insider Trading Law Enforcement and Innovation: Sub-sample Analysis
This table presents the sub-sample results of insider trading law enforcement and innovation. We first calculate the
median value of GDP, GDP per capita, and Stock/GDP for each country within the sample period and then split
sample into two groups based on the median, or by the political orientation of the largest party. We follow the
                                                                          ′

Control variables include GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP, Credit/GDP and Export to US. Table 1 provides
detailed definitions of the variables. Robust t-statistics are reported in parenthesis, which are based on standard
errors clustered at the country and year level. ***, **, * denote significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10% respectively.
