                    Have Black Labor Market Gains

               Post—1964 Been Permanent or Transitory?

                             ABSTRACT


        One of the most important questions regarding black economic

gains post—1964 is whether they are permanent or transitory. This study

examines the relative economic progress of black cohorts and of individual

black workers in longitudinal samples to evaluate the permanence of

changes. It finds that the preponderance of evidence runs against the

proposition that the post—1964 advances have br transitory or illusory.

Measured by earnings of workers and occupational attainment, blacks have

continued to make significant progress in the 1970s. Measured by the

increase in earnings of speciEic cohorts, black gains did not dissipate

due to slow growth of earnings.

           The question of whether the labor market gains of black workers

which followed in the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and diverse

governmental and private antibias activities are permanent or transitory

has recently begun to receive attention. Some claim that blacks have

experienced a drop in economic position in the sluggish economy of the
         1/
1970s.         Others assert that recent gains are illusory, transitory in thc

sense that as the young black cohorts for whOm gains have been most noticeable

age, they fail to obtain the same salary increases as whites, falling
                                                         2/
back to their previous relative economic status.

           To what extent are these claims supported by the data? How have black

workers, particularly the young cohorts of the late 1960s—early 1970s

who made unprecedented ecOnomic gains compared to whites in wages, occupational

attainment, and earnings (but not in the chances of being employed)

fared in the ensuing decade

              This study uses six   different   data sets: the Naticnal Longitudinal

Survey of Young Men ("Parnes" survey), the National Longitudinal Survey of

the High School Graduates in the Class of'1972, the March Current Population

Survey tapes, the May Current Population Survey tapes, the 1962 and 1973

Occupational Change in a Generation surveys, and the Michigan Panel Survey

of Income Dynamics to evaluate the cohort or longitudinal progress of

black workers post—1964. Since any evaluation of post—1964 changes depends

not simply on what happened after the antibias effort but also before, an

effort is made to contrast the longitudiLLal/cohort progress of blacks

post—1964 with progress in earlier dec&des. The paper concentrates on

young male workers for whom age—earnings profiles have historically been

steep, and for whom lack of earnings growth 'is potentially most severe.

              The major finding of the paper is that, while there are measures

of economic position and groups for whom retrogression is observed, the

preponderance of evideace runs against the proposition that the post—1964

                                                                of workers
advances have been transitory or illusory. Measured by earnings

and   occupational   attainment, blacks have continued to make significant

progress. in the 1970s.    Measured by the increase in earnings of specific

cohorts, black gains did not dissipate due to slow growth of earnings

so as to make the heralded progress 'illusory'.

         This is not to deny that in certain aspects of their economic position,

blacks encountered serious problems in the 1970s: because of continued

decreases in the proportion of black families with male heads of house—

hold, black family incomes did not rise relative to white family incomes;

in the 1970s, despite increases in black incomes relative to white incomes

among   irAividuals   an employment crisis did develop for young blacks, par-

ticularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds; and the earnings of some

black workers did not increase as rapidly as those of whites.

          Overall, however, the general picture that emerges from a wide

body of empirical analysis is of either continued progress, or at least

lack of retrogression in the gains accrued earlier.

          The paper first reviews the aggregate evidence on black labor

market progress in the 1970s, and as a benchmark for comparison, earlier

decades as well. After that, it examines the earnings position of persons

with specified characteristics and of persons in a given cohort in Census

of Population and Current Population Survey (CPS) data sets. Then the

paper presents a detailed analysis of cohort progress in the CPS and lon-

gitudinal data sets. There is a brief summary and conclusion.

Changes in the 1970s

the 1970s, Table 1 summarizes readily available evidence from the Census

of Population and Current Population Survey. It records ratios of black

to white incomes/earnings/occupational representation in the earlier post—

1978—79. The final column records the change in the relevant ratios in the

1970s period of concern. Due to differences between Census of Population

and CPS income data, comparisons should be limited to data from the same

source: accardingly, in several of the more detailed contrasts, I have

reported figures from both data sets.

          The table tells a clear story about the 1970s. If the black position

in the labor market deteriorated in the period, the changes in ratios in

Column 5 would be negative. They are not. They are, with one exception,
                                                                              4/
positive: in several cases, rather substantively so. As many have noted,

blacks traditionally suffer more in weak labor markets than whites. Since

the latter part of the 1970s, in particular, was a period of sluggish over1

economic performance, whereas 1969 was a peak boom year, the continued

positive trend in black economic position occurred despite cyclical forces

operating against blacks, which makes the 1970s trends particularly impressive

as indicative of substantial underlying economic changes.

          Qhile the Table 1 data tell a reasonably clear story about earnings

and occupational progress in the 1970s labor market, they do not tell the

entire story. In two important areas of economic position there were

serious problems.

          First, while individual black earners, both male and female had

earnings gains, black family incomes stabilized relative to white family in-

comes. In 1968 the ratio of black to white family incomes was 64%; in 1978,

it was 64%. The reason for this lack of improvement is, as noted by the
                    5/
Bureau of Census,        that the proportion of homes with male heads of house-

holds declined at a much thore rapid pace for blacks than for whites. Relative

family incomes,while important for. social reasons, are of course an erroneous

measure with which to judge changes in labor market discrimination over the

period.

          The second and equally serious change in black economic position
                                  -6-



has been the reduced labor participation and measured unemployment, par-

ticularly among the young. In 1964 the black male civilian employment/

population ratio stood at .73; in 1969, it was .73; in 1979 it was .64.

By contrast, for white males, the ratio went from .78 (1964) to .78 (1969)

to .75 (1979). As noted elsewhere, the youth unemployment problem of

the decade was one of increasing relative worsening in the black youth

position, for reasons that no one has yet satisfactorily explained.

        Fbr black workers with the same job over the year, particularly

full—time workers, however, the 1970s was a period of progress, as shown

in Table 1.

Cohort economic   advance
        That black/white income ratios rose for workers overall or with

given characteristics does not imply that the ratios improved for specific

cohorts as they aged in the 1970s. It is possible that particular groups

obtained sizeable gains in the late 1960s—early 1970s which, for what-

ever reason, dissipated thereafter. As with other period comparisons,

however, it is important to examine the 1970s changes in income ratios

for cohorts from the perspective of earlier cohort changes. It is possible,

for example, that black cohorts, particularly the youngest where the minimum

wage cuts most importantly, have traditionally experienced less rapid

increases in income as they age than white cohorts. If this pattern were

to weaken in the l970s, one would not want to misinterpret an improvement

in traditional cohort patterns as evidence of 'transitory' gains.

        Evidence on the economic progress of specific cohorts prior to the

1970s is exceedingly sparse with evidence on cohort advance prior to 1964

essentially limited to Census of Population data and the 1962 Occupational

Change in a Generation Survey. Accordingly, any analysis of data to obtain

a benchmark for comparison must be exceedingly circumspect. We can, per—.

haps, identify broad patterns but no more than that to use as a measuring
                                  —7—



rod for later, changes.

        Panel A of Table 2 sunnnarizes the relevant Census of Population

data on how specified age cohorts progressed in the 1950s and 1960s. It

tells a somewhat different story of cohort income progress in the two

decades, particularly for the youngest group considered. In the 1950s,

the general pattern for 14—24 year olds is for a decline in nonwhite/whi

income ratios as the cohort ages, whereas in the 1960s, the pattern shows

greater evidence of stability. In the older age groups, the differences

are smaller, with the evidence sufficiently mixed as to suggest a rough

stability in income ratios as the most reasonable generalization for the

pre—1970s pcricd, with the 1960s looking somewhat better for blacks aged

25—34 at the outset than the 1950s does for similarly aged blacks.

       What about the 1970s?
                                                                       7/
        Panel B suimnarizes available CPS median data on this question.

While any firm conclusion about differences with the earlier periods are

marred by differences in the sources and   in   the precise age groups covered,

the data yield a sufficiently clear picture as to sustain the following

conclusion about the 1970s itself: on the basis of published CPS data, there

is no indication of a retrogression in the positionof black cohorts relative

to whites, as the two groups aged. At the least, the seventies do not

look worse compared to earlier decades, which implies that the gains of

the period were relatively permanent.

Cohort Patterns in Current Population Survey Data Tapes

       To obtain a more refined measure of the changing economic position

of black cohorts, I have analysed data from the March and May CPS Surveys.

These surveys contain information on the yearly and weekly wages and salaries

and self—employment earnings of thousands of workers. They have the advantage

of covering a large population on an annual basis, which permits comparison

of cohorts over time, and the disadvantage of not following the same persons

Note:     14—24 and 25—34 incomes for both whites and nonwhites were calculated
          by taking number of people found in each sub—age group (14—17, 18—19,
          20—21,22—24, 25—29, 30—34) as weights for the median incomes of each

          were only reported by these sub—groups. Also,
          for each sub—age group was calculated as the (total males of the age
          and education group x the total males' median income) — (total nonwhite
          males of group x nonwhite males' median income) all divdided by (total
          males — nonwhite males), as only total and nonwhite figures were reported.

over time. I use the CPS data to estimate semi—logarithmic earnings functions

for the 1970s, with the March tapes covering 1968—1977 and the May tapes

covering 1969—1978. The one year difference in the years covered reflects

the fact that the March tapes in a year relate to earnings in the previous

year while the May      tapes     relate to pay in the same year.

             The earnings function estimates are given in Table 3. For com-

parability with other studies, the sample excludes farmers, farm workers,

or self—employed persons, and students. The dependent variables are

yearly earnings (wage and salary plus self—employment income of wage and

salary   non—farm workers) and weekly        earnings (yearly     earnings divided by
weeks worked) in the March tapes and usual weekly earnings in te MAy tapes.
Each regression      treats   the relevant age sample, with       dummy   variables for
education      groups and   for   individual age    (experience) as well, though only
the   coefficient    on the race duiy variable is reported in          the table. The

regressions      trace the age or experience cohort listed in the far left, as
it   ages.     The 1968 regression for 18—24 year olds, for example, shows the
difference in log earnings of black and whites (education and age fixed)
in 1968, whereas the 1978 regression shows            the   differences for the same
cohort nine years      later, when they are aged 27—31. By          following the dif-
ference in coefficients over time we can see how black cohorts fared relative

to white cohorts in the 1970s.

             The CPS data tell a mixed story about black cohort progress in the

period studied, with declines in the position of black cohorts in the

very youngest age or experience group but increases in the older age

or experience group. More precisely we             find drops   of 3 to 7 points among

18—24 year olds and of 5 to 13 points             amongthe 0—5   experience   group compared
to.no   change among 25—29 year olds and          some improvement for 30—34    year olds.

and those with 6—10 years of experience. As a result of the divergent patternE

there appears to be some          suggestion of   a convergence in racial income

      Earnings are wages and self—employment income; weekly and annual earnings/
      weeks worked. Experience is age minus completed years of education minus
       6.

      For the experience regressions, age group extended to 18—36 so that
      0—5 years of experience coefficients could be calculated. Experience
      dummies were included for each year within the experience group.

a)    For the March CPS tapes, the R2 for annual earnings, 1968 (with sample
      sizes in parentheses) were 18—24, .215 (4424); 25—29, .107 (3874);
      30—34, .176 (3489). The R2 for weekly earnings, 1968 were 18—24, .142;
      25—29, .103; 30—34, .172.

      The R2 for annual earnings, 1977 were 18—24, .080 (6648); 25—29, .120
      (3727); 30—34, .163 (3144). The R2 for weekly earnings, 1977 were
      18—24, .090; 25—29, .146; 30—34, .174.

      The R2 for anm.il earnings for 0—5 years of experience were 1968,
      .343 (4326); 1977, .107 (3952). The R2 for weekly earnings were 1968,
      .227; 1977, .107.

      The R2 for annual earnings for 6—10 years of experience were 1968,
      .269 (3807); 1977, .185 (3700). The R2 for weekly earnings were
      1968 .230; 1977, .197.

b)    For the May CPS tapes, the R2 for 1969 (with sample sizes in parentheses)
      were 18—24, .301 (4005); 25—29, .129 (3741); 30—34, .214 (3253).

      The R2 for 1978 were 18—24, .103 (5028); 25—29, .170 (2656); 30—34,
      .200 (2072).

      The R2 for 0—5 years of experience were 1969, .355 (3813); 1978, .108

Occupational Change in a Generation Survey
         Because of the difficulty in comparing cohort patterns over time
 due to survey differences, I have examined changes between first job and
 current job in the one data set that contains information pre—1964 and
 after 1964. This is    the Occupational Change in a Generation Survey first

             in 1962 and then conducted again    in 1975.   As a measure     of oc-
 conducted

 cupational progress in the two periods I have taken the change in Duncan

 SES scores between the   individual's     current job and his first job. I

 regressed this   on a race dununy variable and years of school:i.ng. The resultant

however, the data show blacká making less progress in the occupational
structure (defined by Duncan scores, not income) in the pre—1963 period

and in all but the youngest age group in the 1972 sample. More important

they show the difference in the occupational grading declines greatly in

the period. While occupation scores are not income levels, this evidence

clearly contradicts the hypothesis that the black gains post—1964 were

transitory through the early 1970s.

Longitudinal data

        Longitudinal data, which enable us to follow a single cohort through

time, provides a potentially superior picture of t6e changes in incomes

for specified grrups of workers. I have examined longitudinal changes

in three different data sets: the National Longitudinal Survey of Young

Men Aged 14—24 in 1966; the Michigan Panel Survey of Income Dynamics; and

the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972. In

contrast to other studies of black economic progress, I control in these

equations only for the education of workers in the base year; the host of

other factors which might affect racial income differentials,includirxg

such important factors as region and experience within an age group are

ignored to provide figures at least roughly comparable to the crude bench-

marks given earlier. Our   estimates   of the lii difference in earnings asso-

ciated with race is not to be interpreted as a discriminating differential

of the usual type for this reason.

        Table 5 presents the results for the three longitudinal data sets

which we have examined. Lines 1—4 present results from an analysis of

the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men Aged 14—24 in 1966. The

NLS is a sample of approzimately 5,000 young men aged 18—24 in 1966, inter—

viewed yearly until 1971 and then in 1973, 1975, and 1976. The advantage

 of this data set is that it provides an especially large sample of young

 n in the group for which some of the preceding analysis show a decline in

 the relative position of blacks.

         Lines 1 and 2 record calculations for the sample of persons reporting

The analysis shows a decline in the black disadvantage for the specified

cohort in both annual and weekly earnings.

        LInes 3 and 4 expand the sample to all persons, including those

who report in one year but not the other. The results are similar. In

this data set black cohorts improved their position relative to whites

as they aged.

        Lines 5—6 present results from an:analysis of the Panel Survey of

Income Dynamics. This is a survey of about 5,000 hcuseholds in 1962 and

subsequent years. Itis the largest available longitudinal file covering

the entire work force. Our analysis treats the sample of male heads

of households aged 20—24 and 25—29 (subject to the restrictions noted in

the table). The results show a pattern among age groups similar to that

found in the CPS: for the youngest group we obtain a decline in the ratio

of black to white earnings for the next group, a rise.

        Finally, lines 7 and 8 report the results of analysis of the National

Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972. This is a survey

based on a nationwide sample of high schools, stratified in such a way

that schools in lower socioeconomic areas were somewhat oversampled, and

includes three follow—up surveys in 1973, 1974, and 1976. It shows essentially

ito differential in in earnings in 1972 but a decline of 5 to 6 percentage

points in the black/white wage ratio thereafter, until blacks earned 94— /

95% of whites in 1976. Thus, these data confirm Lazear's analysis of the
                                   —20—



                                   when we note the level from which the ratio
the NLS Class, of 1972. However,

falls and the level to which it falls we obtain a very different perspective.

A differential of 5—67. between black and white is hardly a cause for nega—

tivism about the economic gain of the period. Indeed, Wise and Meyer's

assessment of the data is that there is essentially no discrimination
                                                             -



in the sample.

             with other studies

          There have been four other studies of the longitudinal progss

of black workers with which ours can be compared.

          Rãisianand Donovan analyzed the Panel Survey and found, in a
more   comple: r2gression analysis than ours, stronger evidence of an improve-
ment in the relative position of blacks. According to their calculations,
nonwhites obtained an increase in real average hourly earnings (other
factors   fixed) of 1.8% from 1967 to 1977    compared to a gain for whites

of    1.17.. Over a decade this implies a 7% improvement in the black position.

They also estimated that blacks with 0 years of experience, and 1—5 years

of experience but not other experience groups had more rapid increases

than whites.
                                          and weekly earnings of blacks and whites
           Daymont analyzed the annual

 in   the NLS of Men Aged 14—24 in 1966 over the period 1968—1976 and obtained

 results consistent with ours:. noticeable increases in the black/white

 earnings ratio. His calculations show that black incomes rose relative to

 white incomes by 1.5% per annum to 1.9% per annum, depending on the precise

 sample studied (see Table 8., p. 290). with addition of a cyclical- control,
                                                           more than those of whites.
 the incomes of blacks rose by 2.7% to 2.9% per annum

           Lazear's provocative analysis, to which we have referred earlier,

 found a decline in the black/white income ratio in the NLS 72, as we did:

 as noted, however, we believe that a drop from .99 to .94 isto be interret.d

 differently than he suggests. Like Dayinont we obtain quita different results
                                   —21—


for the NLS   of   Men Aged 14—24 than Lazear, presumably because of the larger

number of years covered.

        Malveaux has examined the occupational progress of black cohorts

from 1968 to 1977 and found, consistent with our analysis, an improvement

in the distribution of blacks relative to whites. Her analysis focused

on men arid women aged 25—34.

        Duncan and Hoffman analyzed wage and earnings ratios in the PSID

and found that there was a substantial increase in the relative wages

and earnings of blacks across cohorts and generally flat or slightly

falling within—cohort ratios, with no indication the within—cohort changes

wipd out the cross—cohort gains.

        Overall, we read the other studies (including Lazear's) as rejecting

the notion that the economic gains of blacks were, in fact, transitory or

illusory.

Conclusion and Assessment

        In this paper we have evaluated the claims that the post—1964

labor market gains of blacks disappeared in the l970s sluggish economy

and have rejected those claims. While there are definite areas in which

the blacks' position worsened, notably the employment/population ratio,

the preponderance of evidence shows continued economic advance. We have

also examined data pertaining to the progress of black cohorts and have

found a mixed picture. In cases where there was virtually no initial

black—white difference in economic position among young workers, the evidence

suggests the development of (larger) differentials as the individuals!

cohorts age. This decline appears, however, to be smaller than that found

in earlier decades and much too small to come close to restoring traditional

discriminating differences. In cases where there was a non—negligible

earnings differential between blacks and whites we have found blacks catchin

up with whites, not the reverse.
                                   —22—




            The question naturally arises as to why among the youngest workers

but not those in the next age bracket, studies have found virtual equality

in wages. The most plausible reason for the initial small wage ratios and

in one sense the ensuing drop is, I suggest, the effect of the minimum wage.

The minimum, particularly the more inclusive minimum exacted in recent

years can be expected to have a substantial compressant effect on wage

differentials of young workers, as has been documented by Wise and Meyer

(1981). Looked at from this perspective and in light of the increased

income ratios for blacks in the 25—29 age group, the observed declines

carry   a   very different connotation than one of transitory gains.

            Overall, the evidence rejects the claim that the gains of blacks

are transitory. It does suggest, however, that the virtual equality in

income ratios among the very youngest are unlikely to be maintained and
