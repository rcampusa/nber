                                             ABSTRACT



        This paper examines United States Steel’s acquisition by long-term lease of the iron ore

properties of the Great Northern Railway. This 1906 transaction, which significantly increased U.S.

Steel’s already substantial ore holdings, has been characterized      by contemporary    observers and

modem economists as an example of vertical foreclosure.       We present quantitative and qualitative

evidence to support an alternative view that the lease generated a net efficiency gain, resulting in

lower steel prices, as it promoted relationship-specific    investment in the exploitation   of the ore

properties.   Quantitatively, we examine the stock market reactions of U.S. Steel, the Great Northern

Railway, steel industry rivals, and the railroads, a major steel customer, to the announcement    of the

lease signing.   Strikingly, the railroads had a significant positive excess return. Qualitatively,   we

examine the terms of the lease and the performance of the parties to document the role of the lease

in encouraging relationship-specific   investment.

1       Introduction


Ronald       Cease     has criticized     those    industrid        economists      who frequently       overlook       the efficiency


attributes     of innovative      business practices        because their professional           training has predisposed         them


to identifying       antitrust    concerns. 1 In the context          of vertical relationships         within and among firms,


such economists          tend to view        novel contractual         governance       structures      as sophisticated       devices


designed      to stifle competition         rather than efficient         mechanisms          adopted   to overcome        bargaining


failures and to reduce transaction                costs.   Other economists         have followed       in the tradition     of Cease


by questioning         the advisability         of enforcement        actions     taken to discourage        vertical     integration,


whether      by merger or by contract,              on the grounds         that the advocates           of antitrust     enforcement


frequently     overestimate        the risk of anticompetitive           effect while underestimating            the potential      for


efficiency    gains.     Until recently,     this view has enjoyed              substantial    success as antitrust        authorities


have concentrated          their enforcement         resources      in other arew.       Over the past few years, however,


both    government        officials    and economists        have reconsidered         the issue of vertical        integration    and


its potential        for dampening       competition       through     market foreclosure.         This theoretical        and policy


reassessment         invites an empirical       inquiry to determine          whether these anticompetitive             consequences


exist and are widespread.


       This paper examines            the vertical foreclosure        debate in the context          of the particular       empirical


setting afforded        by the United States Steel Corporation’s                   acquisition    of iron ore properties        during


the first decade        of the twentieth        century.     In particular,      the paper focuses        on the most significmt


ore acquisition        of this period,     US Steel’s procurement               by long-term     lease of the rights to mine an


enormous       tract of land on the Western                Mesabi    Range controlled          by the Great Northern          Railway


(the “Great      Northern        Properties”)      and packaged       for lease by industrialist        James J. Hill’ (the “Hill
Ore Lease” ). This paper employs              quantitative     and qualitative        evidence       to argue that the Hill Ore


Lease was responsible         for a net increase in efficiency.           Quantitatively,          we apply the Eckbo-Stillrnan


event-study       methodology      to distinguish       between        two possible      effects of the ore acquisition:             (1)


vertical foreclosure     of US Steel’s current and potential               rivals in the final market for steel (the “fore-


closure    hypothesis”   ) and (2) efficiency          gains (the “efficiency         hypothesis”),       possibly    generated      by


contractual    governance       mechanisms      designed to promote          relationship-specific        investment        in exploit-


ing synergistic     economies.     Eckbo and Stillman tested and rejected                    the market-power        hypothesis       in


the case of horizontal        mergers by examining           the stock market reactions                of product    market rivals


to a set of merger and antitrust             announcements         under the assumption              of stock market efficiency.


Mullin, Mullin, and Mullin (1995) applied and extended                       this methodology           to examine the reaction


of downst ream customers.          The present paper applies the Eckbo-Stillman                       methodology     by analyzing


the stock market reaction          of customers        and steel rivals of US Steel to the public announcement                        of


the signing of the Hill Ore Lease. The reaction                of US Steel’s customers               provides   an estimate      of the


net effect of the vertical       transaction     on product       market (steel)         prices.


    The results of the event study suggest that the Hill Ore Lease had the net effect of lowering


the market price for steel.         We then analyze          the terms of the lease to uncover                  additiond      qualita-


tive evidence      of the efficiency       enhancing    features       of US Steel’s acquisition         of the Great Northern


Properties,    and to identify      the source of the efficiencies           created by the ore acquisition.                Moreover,


this historical    evidence     provides    support for the efficiency        rationale,      independent       of the event study


results.


    There are several reasons why the Hill Ore Lease presents an appropriate                               opportunity        for eval-


uating the foreclosure        hypothesis.      First, the foreclosure        hypothesis       possesses a surface plausibility


since contemporary        industry     observers,3       government        officials,4     and modern       economists,        such as



                                                                   2
Parsons       and Ray (1975)5       have dl emphasized            the importance        of US Steel’s     control    of iron ore6


in their analyses of the company’s             market power in steel .7 The acquisition                of the Great Northern


Properties      was of primary significance        both because the estimated             tonnage of raw ore made the Hill


Ore Lease US Steel’s most substantial                ore acquisition        since its formation       and because      the Great


Northern      Properties     were the last large bloc of the critically         important        Mesabi Range not already in


the hands of mining interests .8 Although             the Hill Ore Lewe was not a complete                vertical integration


of the Great Northern           Properties,     it was the effective       equivalent     since the lease was of indefinite


durationg      and the parties expected         the iron ore to be substantially           exhausted     upon reversion.


    In addition     to the historical      significance   of the Hill Ore Lease and its role in US Steel’s perceived


vertical    foreclosure     of rivals, analysis of the Hill Ore Lease may offer persuasive                    evidence      in the


contemporary        antitrust    debate.      According    to Robert        Bork, defenders        of the vertical    foreclosure


hypothesis      begin their industry       analyses with the artificial premise that both upstream                    and down-


stream firms enjoy market power,                It is therefore       unsurprising     that such analyses      “establish    some


possibility     of competitive     harm from the joining              of two vertically    related    monopolies.”      US Steel


appears to possess this characteristic            feature of significant       market shares in both the upstream             and


downstream        markets.      Thus, the Hill Ore Lease is a natural experiment                   for testing the foreclosure


hypothesis.      If US Steel’s acquisition        of the final large available          source of domestic        iron ore failed


to produce      vertical foreclosure,      it becomes     difficult to argue that vertical           mergers involving      much


less substantial     market shares pose such a danger,


    The final benefit of examining            US Steel’s acquisition        of the Great Northern Properties           is that the


Hill Ore Lease can be analyzed             as a case study in the choice of contractual                governance     structures.


The negotiations          over the lease involved     two sophisticated         parties 10 bargaining      over extraordinary


potential     gains in the face of potentially        debilitating       transaction    costs.    Consequently,      the terms of



                                                                  3
the contract    were carefully considered        by both parties over the course of several yearsll             and reflected


US Steel’s     accumulated      experience      in negotiating       leases for other      ore properties.       In addition,


unlike most contracts        between private parties, significant             terms of the Hill Ore Lease were publicly


disclosedlz     and contemporaneously           analyzed      due to the size of the transaction              and its overall


significance    in setting the terms of future ore acquisitions. 13 Strikingly,                 contemporary     critics cited


particular     contractual    terms of the acquisition            as evidence     of the lease’s    likely   anticompetitive


motivation     and effect.


    This paper      is organized       as follows.     Sections    2 and 3 introduce        the historical     and economic


foundations     of the analysis.   Section 4 presents the stock market evidence.                Section 5 offers additiond


qualitative    evidence from the lease and the performance              of the parties which supports the hypothesis


that efficient contractual      governance      mechanisms        explain the efficiencies      generated     by the Hill Ore


Lease. We also find evidence           against the foreclosure       hypothesis     from examining      similar contractual


arrangements      in which foreclosure       is implausible       and by evaluating      the terms of the Hill Ore Lease


from a foreclosure      perspective.      We conclude      in Section    6.




2     Historical             Background


From its inception      in 1901, US Steel was vertically            integrated,     with estimated     iron ore holdings       in


1901 of 700 million tons, forty-four           times its 1902 production            rate. 14 The estimated       ore holdings


of the Great Northern         Railway      (“Great     Northern”)     on the Mesabi        Range15 were second        ody      to


those held by US Steel through            its subsidiary, 16 Oliver Iron Mining           Company     (“US Steel”) .17 The


significance    of the Mesabi Range was due not only to the rich iron content                      of much of its ore, but


also because     the ore was perhaps         ideally   suited for low-cost        extraction.    Located     near the surface
where it could be mined cheaply            and efficiently     by the strip method,      the bulk of the ore was also


soft and could easily be loaded          directly   from the pit into railroad        cars for further shipment.         Such


attractive    features of the Mesabi ore were enhanced               by recent technological     innovations     which made


the stripping    method       less physically   cumbersome      and more energy efficient.ls


    In the years preceding        the Hill Ore Lease, both US Steel and the Great Northern                began preparing


their individual    Mesabi properties       for the large scale mining, handling,         and transportation         of ore.lg


Such preparations      were necessary       because    full exploitation      of the rich Mesabi ore lands had been


hampered      by the scarcity     of transportation     facilities    on some lines, particularly      those of the Great


Northern.zo      Dock facilities     also were in need of an upgrade             to handle greater      capacity,    a factor


which required      a long lead-time .21


    During     the years 1901-1906,        US Steel embarked           on a series of acquisitions      of iron properties


which included      lands on the Mesabi          Range.      These earlier additions,      however,     were “completely


overshadowed “ 22 in October          1906 when US Steel and the Great Northern                 finally announced      agree-


ment on the terms to the Hill Ore Lease after years of sporadic                 negotiations.     According      to the terms


of the lease, US Steel agreed to pay a base royalty rate of 85 cents per ton of ore with an automatic


increase     of 3.4 cents each year for the duration            of the lease. 23 The royalty         was adjustable      on a


sliding scale to reflect the quality of ore, aa measured                by the iron content.24      The royalty, however,


was only a portion        of the consideration.       Ore mined on the Great Northern               Properties      waa to be


transported     exclusively     on the Great Northern        Railway at the profitable         freight rate of 80 cents per


ton.25


    The lease included          a “take or pay”       provision 26 in which       US Steel committed           itself to mine


substantial     guaranteed     minimum tonnages of ore. The guaranteed               minimums       began at 750,000 tons


of ore in 1907 and escalated         by an annual increment           of 750,000 tons until the guaranteed          minimum



                                                               5
for 1917 was scheduled        to reach 8,250,000           tons. 27 In subsequent        years, the guaranteed         minimum


would      remain   at 8,250,000       tons.     Because      the vast majority        of the Great      Northern     Properties


was undeveloped        in 1906, 28 the parties anticipated              that US Steel would fail to meet its minimum


mining obligation      in the first few years of the lease and therefore                 US Steel was permitted          to make


up the difference in later years. 29 An indication               of the magnitude        of these requirements        is that the


1917 guaranteed       minimum       of 8,250,000 tons was forty-four            percent of US Steel’s Lake Superior ore


production     in 1905, and twenty-four            percent    of total Lake Superior ore production             in 1905.30


    A final lease term is that US Steel received the option to terminate                       the lease on January 1, 1915


upon giving two years notice.31


    From 1907 until 1911, US Steel and the Great Northern both fully performed                             on their contractual


obligations    under the lease.        Furthermore,        as will be discussed in Section            5, each party had made


substantial    investments    in mining and transportation                operations   on the Great Northern          Properties.


In 1911, however,       political   events in the form of intense antitrust                  scrutiny   intervened    to disrupt


their contractual      relationship.


    The formation       of US Steel and its subsequent            ore acquisitions     attracted      the unwelcome     attention


of the Bureau of Corporations             (the “Bureau”)        which conducted         an exhaustive      study of US Steel’s


position    in the Steel Industry.       The Bureau submitted             its initial report in July 1911, concluding         that


US Steel exerted a “monopolistic               influence”32   on the steel industry.      That influence reportedly        rested


chiefly on its iron ore holdings           in general,     and the Hill Ore Lease in particular.              The same public


concerns      which had motivated          the Bureau’s        investigation     into the concentration        of the iron and


steel industry      also drew the attention          of the House of Representatives             which established      a special


committee      in May 1911 chaired by Augustus                  Stanley    (the “Stanley      Hearings”)     to investigate    the


business practices      of US Steel for possible           violations     of the antitrust    laws.



                                                                  6
    In the shadow of the Stanley Hearings and facing an imminent                           dissolution   suit by the Depart-


ment of Justice, US Steel announced              in October      1911 that it would exercise its option            to terminate


the Hill Ore Lease at the earliest possible              date, January          1, 1915.    The announcement          came two


years before US Steel was contractually              bound    to provide      such notice.33       Most commentators          have


concluded       that US Steel’s cancellation       oft he lease was motivated         by fear of antitrust enforcement          ,M


reasoning     that cancellation      was the single act, “more         than any other the corporation              could    [take,


to] forestall     a possible    action under the Sherman law.” 35


    In spite of US Steel’s          eleventh     hour attempts       to avert an antitrust         enforcement      action,    the


Department        of Justice filed its dissolution      suit in October         1911 arguing that US Steel had monop-


olized the iron and steel industries.            US Steel responded         aggressively    to the suit, and after years of


testimony,      the district    court ruled in favor of US Steel,36 a decision             later firmed      by the Supreme


Court .37




3     Economic                 Background


Economic        analysis of vertical foreclosure      has developed        over time in response to increasingly           sophis-


ticated    understandings        of industrial    organization     and strategies      available     to market participants.


The following       discussion    briefly surveys the evolution         of the patterns       and theories    of market fore-


closure.     For the purposes       of this paper,    the critical    observation      is that the fundamental         effect of


any of these hypothesized           patterns     of successful    foreclosure     is a restriction     of output    in both    the


upstream      (iron ore) and downstream           (steel) markets with a corresponding               increase in price coming


at the expense       of customers     in the downstream          product    market.


    One theory of market foreclosure              is that incumbent        monopolists      will use vertical integration       as
a “barrier     to entry”     which compels        potential     rivals to enter at both levels of production.             In this


context,     the acquisition     by US Steel of a size able share of an essential input restricted                   entry.    As


the trade publication         Iron Age remarked,


    With     the Great Northern           ores in other hands the Steel Corporation’s             position    might one day
be disputed;      if they were held without            development      they might become         the basis of strong         new
competition.3s


    Closely     related    to entry barrier analysis is the strategy            of “raising   rivals’ costs,”      outlined    by


Krattenmaker       and Salop (1986).           Under this strategy, after acquiring      the Great Northern properties,


US Steel would restrict iron ore output by refusing to supply ore to other steel producers.                         Moreover,


the remaining       independent         ore producers      would     then be able to raise their prices as well.              The


resulting increase in iron ore prices, and hence in the marginal cost of US Steel’s actual or potential


steel rivals, would lead to reduced              steel output     and higher steel prices.      This theory     assumes that


the integrated     firm will forego profit opportunities              to sell inputs to its downstream        rivals.3g


    Finally, in recent work Salinger (1988),             Ordover,      Salop and Saloner (1990),       and Hart and Tirole


(1990)     have developed        models     of imperfect      competition     in which   vertical    integration     can have


anticompetitive      effects on downstream            competition.      The most recent and general of these models


is Hart and Tirole         (1990).    Bolton     and Whinston      (1991, 1993) study a complementary            set of issues


involving     not downstream          competition     but supply assurance       concerns .40


    In the Hart and Tirole setup, there are two upstream                      firms, U1 and UZ, and two downstream


firms, DI and Dz. The two downstream                  firms act as Cournot      competitors      in the final goods market,


while the two upstream firms produce                 a necessary intermediate      good at constant       marginal     costs c1


and C2. Each upstream            firm Ui may vertically          integrate   with the corresponding       downstream          firm


Di. After the integration            decision,   both upstream       firms offer simultaneous,      secret supply contracts


to each downstream           unit .41
    They present three varimts             of their basic model.         The most relevant in our context              is variant


one, ex post monopolization,         with iron ore upstream          and steel production            downstream.        Suppose


that U1 is more efficient than U2, i.e. c1 < C2. Under non-integration,                       U1 will produce        more than


the monopoly       output   of the intermediate        good,   because of its incentive       to sell to both downstream


firms 42 Under vertical       integration,      the merged      entity    U1 – D1 will be able to implement                profit


sharing, 43 and so U1 will no longer have the incentive              to supply Dz with more than the quantity                   of


the intermediate      good that is optimal for the vertical structure. 44 Vertical integration                    is motivated


by and has the effect of restricting          output    in the intermediate       goods    market.    This in turn directly


restricts   output   in the final goods market .45


    This is an appropriate         model    in which to consider          the vertical    relationship     between      US Steel


and the Great Northern         Ore properties.         First, it begins with an imperfectly              competitive     market


structure    both upstream     and downstream.          Second, the model not only predicts              vertical integration


and foreclosure,     but predicts    that it will be the lower cost upstream                firm that will be involved          in


this integration.     Since the Great Northern            Ore properties       were suit ed for low-cost         extraction,      it


would be represented        by U1, and US Steel by D1. This identification                 might seem at odds with one


feature of the transaction,        namely     that US Steel acquired         the Great Northern          Ore properties,       not


the other way around.        But in the Hart and Tirole model it does not matter whether the upstream


or downstream        firm makes the acquisition,          M long m the acquisition            takes place .46 Finally,         the


Great Northern       acquisition   did effect the requisite type of profit sharing, since after US Steel mined


the ore it was free to process it internally           or sell it to other steel manufacturers.


    Transaction      cost economists        provide    an alternative,      procompetitive      explanation       for complex


vertical    relationships   which otherwise       might be analyzed           as mechanisms       for vertical     foreclosure.


In contrast     to the proponents      of the market foreclosure            hypothesis,      transaction     cost economists



                                                                9
“mzintain[]     the rebuttable      presumption          that nonstandard        forms of contracting,         of which vertical


integration    is an extreme form, have the purpose                and effect of economizing          on transaction       costs .“47


Paul Joskow has succinctly           summarized          the contractual      governance     literature     as follows:



      When      specific    investments       represent     a significant    fraction     of the costs of consummat-


      ing an efficient       vertical   supply      arrangement,         the reliance     on simple     anonymous         spot


      market transactions          is likely to be an unsatisfactory            governance      mechanism          for induc-


      ing the parties to make the specific                 investments      necessary     to yield a least-cost        supply


      relationship .4s



    The source of the failure of the spot market is that relationship-specific                     investment        transforms     an


ex ante competitive         market into an ex post bilateral              monopoly      with the potential         for opportunism


by one or both of the parties.               Unless this potential         is ameliorated,     the parties     will under-invest


in the relationship.        A logical   alternative       to relying on the ex-post          spot market would be to write


a long-term      contract    ex-ante,       specifying    explicitly     the investment      levels and other actions            to be


taken by all parties to the exchange              in all states of the world.           It will not be feasible to write such


a complete,     contingent      contract,     however.     As Cease (1937)        and Williamson          (1975)    emphasize,     the


transaction     costs involved      in attempting         to write and enforce           such a contract      are so severe that


contracts     are necessarily     incomplete,       “containing        gaps and missing provisions.           In particular       [the


contract]     will be silent about      the parties’       obligations     in some states of the world and will specify


these obligations      only coarsely        or ambiguously       in other states of the world.”49


    In light of the hazards          of the spot market           and contractual         incompleteness,      transaction       costs


economists     predict     the parties will adopt appropriate              contractual     governance      structures     to prevent


ex post opportunism           and thus promote            an efficient level of investment.           Thus,    transaction       costs




                                                                  10
economists      would encourage      antitrust    officials to be attentive       to the efficiency     enhancing       features


of contracts     which may initially       appear to pose antitrust        concerns.


    Just as US Steel’s         high market     share in steel and ore production             makes vertical          foreclosure


a plausible     explanation    for the Hill Ore lease, the importance             of relationship-specific          investments


in this environment       makes efficient contractual         governance     a plausible    alternative     explanation.       Of


Oliver Williamson’s      (1983) four categories        of relationship-specific     investments       susceptible     to ex post


opportunism,       the two most prominently        featured in the acquisition         of the Great Northern         Properties


were physical      asset specificity-investments         in durable      assets which involve        design characteristics


specific to the transaction;       and site specificity-investments         in relatively    immobile      assets located      to


minimize      transportation    costs.    Moreover,    the Ore lease included       provisions      to address the issue of


contractual     incompleteness,     for example       giving US Steel the unilateral         option     to cancel the lease.


We will develop      this analysis more fully in section five.


    Hart and Tirole (1990)         analyze a more involved         model of ex post monopolization             that incorpo-


rates investments      by both upstream       and downstream        firms. These investments           are industry-specific


rather than relationship-specific,         however.     The issue of relationship-specific        investments        is featured


more prominently       in Bolton    and Whinston         (1991,1993).     Their work is complementary           to Hart and


Tirole    since they choose     to assume away any downstream                competitive     effects of vertical        integra-


tion in order to isolate the effect of ownership             structure    on investment      incentives.     In their (1993)


article, there is a single upstream          firm, U, and two downstream            firms, D1 and D2, which are not


product     market competitors.          Each downstream       firm has a customer         with (at most)      unit demand


for the final good.     The customer’s       valuation    for Di’s product     is v;(l; ,s) for i = 1,2, where Ii is the


non-contractible      investment    undertaken        by Di, and s is the random         state of nature.     Investment       Ii


generates     a private, non-contractible        cost Ci(Ii) to Di .50 The find        customer’s     realized valuation       vi



                                                              11
can be fully extracted         by the downstream        firm if it makes a sale.


    Production       of the final good by Di requires one unit of the input produced                      by U, but no other


inputs.    Supply    assurance     problems      are modelled    starkly:    with probability        A, U can only produce


one unit.     Otherwise,      U can produce       two units, one for each downstream              firm.    After investments


are sunk and uncertainty           is resolved,     the sale of the input is determined              by a bargaining          game


patterned      on Rubinstein       (1982).      Under integration,       however,     the owner      can transfer     the input


between      divisions    unilatera~y.


    Following       Grossman     and Hart (1986),       contracts      are assumed      to be incomplete.         In fact,    only


spot contracting         is assumed to be feasible.      The integration       or ownership       decision,    and with it the


allocation    of residual rights of control,        affects private and social welfare through                changing   ex-post


bargaining      payoffs    and therefore     ex-ante   investment      incentives.     As Bolton      and Whinston        (1991)


explain,     “Ownership      thus provides      both a protection      against the misappropriation            of returns and a


stronger     future negotiating      position    whenever    future trade and production             decisions    involving    the


use of the asset have to be made.            When the ownership          of an asset changes hands, the new acquirer


sees his future returns better protected,            in particular     his marginal contribution        to his future returns


is better protected. ”51


    One result is that non-integration             leads both downstream            firms to under-invest        relative to the


social optimum.          The reason for this under-investment            is that through the bargaining           process there


is ex-post     expropriation     of part of the return from investing.              This parallels    Grossman      and Hart’s


result in a bilateral        setting. 52 Bolton      and Whinston        find that vertical     integration       increases    the


investment      of the downstream        integrated    firm and decreases        the investment        and the payoff of the


downstream       independent      firm. These effects provide the private motivation                 for vertical integration.


The shift in investment         patterns that accompanies            vertical integration    also gives rise to an increase



                                                                12
in self-supply,    i.e., the upstream       firm is more likely to supply its downstream                      division   than when


that downstream         unit was independent         .53


    But not all the results from a bilateral                setting carry over exactly           to this multilateral        setting.


Strikingly,    Bolton    and Whinston        find that vertical          integration     leads the integrated        firm to over-


invest relative    to the social optimum.            This over-investment          occurs     because     in some states of the


world, the integrated        firm earns a positive marginal return on its investment                     even though the social


return is zero.     To illustrate,       suppose    that U1 and D1 are integrated.                    Consider   the state of the


world in which there is only one unit of the input,                    and V2 > VI. Ex-post            bargaining    will result in


D2 receiving      the input     at a price of WI. As a result, the integrated                  firm receives     a private return


to its investment       in increasing     VI in this state of the world,               even though      there is no gross social


benefit to this investment        (since D1 does not receive the input ).


    Bolton     and Whinston       are not able to make global comparisons                     about    the social desirability      of


the ownership      structures,    but they find situations            in which there are private incentives              for vertical


integration    to arise although     non-integration         would be socially preferable.             On the other hand, they


do find other situations         in which vertical         integration     is socially    preferable     to non-integration.        In


particular,    if the probability     of an upstream          shortage     is zero (A = O), then vertical            integration    is


optimal.      Both the efficiency       and foreclosure       effects operate      in their model         through    the effect on


investment     incentives.


    The Bolton      and Whinston         results suggest that one should not immediately                    identify transaction


cost concerns     in vertical    integration       with efficiency-enhancement.               Nevertheless,      there are several


reasons why such an identification             seems warranted           in the acquisition       of the Great Northern            Ore


properties     (Upstream)     by US Steel (Downstream).


    First,    their model     predicts     that vertical       integration     is efficient     if there is no probability          of



                                                                 13
an exogenous       upstream       shortage.      Since the Great          Northern        Ore properties      were so vast,        any


shortage    was years if not decades in the future. 54 The Hill lease could lead to restriction                               of iron


ore production,      of course, but that type of endogenous                  “shortage”     is more consistent        with the Hart


and Tirole model than the Bolton               and Whinston         assumption.


    Second,     the conditions        required   for an overinvestment             effect appear     to be extremely          limited


or absent.      In particular,        if we identify    US Steel as D1, what                can we say about           D2?    Ln the


cent emporary      trade press, no other steel manufacturer                    was identified     aa a possible        developer    of


the Great Northern           Ore properties.      Rather,        it was thought       that J .J. Hill himself or some other


entrepreneur      might enter the steel industry,            using the Great Northern               properties        as a source of


inputs.     Moreover,       because   of US St eel’s pre-lease          holdings   on the Mesabi,         there were particular


synergies generated         by consolidating      and exploiting         those properties      jointly.    These are all reasons


why the costs of supplying            the ore to US Steel would likely be lower than supplying                        the ore to any


other steel manufacturer.             In the parlance     of the model,         it is likely that V1 > V2 for most states


of the world.      As a result, the overinvestment                effect would be unlikely         to arise, since it operates


through     those situations      in which V1 < W2and so the independent                      downstream       firm, D2, receives


the input.      Absent      this overinvestment        effect,    vertical    integration     is both     privately     and socially


optimal.     Intuitively,    if D2 is a sufficiently     inferior competitor          to D1 in the input market, then the


Bolton     and Whinston        model mimics the bilateral            setting explored       in Grossman       and Hart.


    Finally, Bolton and Whinston              assume that vertical integration             has no effect on the prices charged


to final consumers.         A chief concern      of cent emporary         observers    was that the lease would affect the


competitiveness       of the steel market.        It seems much more plausible                 that any foreclosure          effect of


the Hill Ore lease would be captured              in the ex post monopolization               result of Hart and Tirole,           and


therefore    would be reflected in higher prices for steel.



                                                                   14
    For these reasons,         and for the sake of economy             of language,     we will refer to the efficiency      and


transaction     cost hypotheses          interchangeably,      and distinguish       those hypotheses        from the “vertical


foreclosure”    hypothesis.      Bolton     and Whinston’s        theoretical     results should still serve as a caveat to


such an identification        in other settings,       however.


    Empirical     evidence      of vertical     foreclosure     has been limited.          Allen   (1971)    finds that vertical


integration    of cement and ready-mix              concrete   firms was justified      by executives       by reference to fore-


closure concerns .55 Grimm,              Winston,    and Evans (1992)       analyze railroad        route structures    that are


isomorphic     to vertical integration,         and find some foreclosure          effects. 56 Chipt y (1995)      studies verti-


cal integration    between      program       channels and cable system operators .57 She finds that foreclosure


occurs;   integrated      cable operators      exclude    rival channels.       But she also finds that consumers          never-


theless benefit from integration.            Snyder (1995a)       and (1995b)       utilized the event study methodology


to assess vertical        foreclosure     in the beer and petroleum             industries.5s      He finds some evidence      of


foreclosure    effects.    His studies are distinguished          from the present one in that he did not examine


the stock market reactions              of any firms that were final product           customers.




4     Stock Market                   Evidence


The principal      quantitative         approach    of this paper is an application             of the Eckbo-Stillman       event


study methodology           that has been used to analyze the competitive                   effect of mergers.      We examine


the abnormal      stock market returns of firms theoretically                   affected   by US Steel’s acquisition       of the


Great Northern         Properties.       The stock market reactions         of these firms to the acquisition          shed light


on the competing          hypotheses.


    Under the foreclosure         hypothesis,       a steel market competitor         could either be hurt by its exclusion




                                                                  15
from a source of supply, particularly                if the company       lacked substantial    ore holdings,       or helped by the


exclusion       of pot entid       competitors.     59 Under the efficiency       hypothesis,    however,     vertical integration


would lower US Steel’s production                    costs thus making it a more effective              competitor.      Steel rivals


would therefore be hurt, unless they could replicate                      the results of US Steel’s contractual          innovation.


This latter possibility        appears unlikely since there were particular                 synergies between US Steel’s pre-


1906 Mesabi holdings               and the Great Northern           Properties.


       Examining      only the response            of rivals is not very informative,        because     both hypotheses        would


explain       a negative    excess return.         This shortcoming        may be addressed       by examining        the abnormal


stock market returns of steel customers.                  The foreclosure      hypothesis      implies an increase in customer


costs and thus a negative                return.     In contrast,     the efficiency      hypothesis     predicts     more   vigorous


competition        and thus a price benefit             which would partially        be transmitted        to the customers.       As


outlined,      the “foreclosure”        and “efficiency”     hypotheses      are not mutudy        exclusive,   a possibility    frdly


acknowledged         by the recent foreclosure            literature. 60 But the stock market reactions                of customers


will represent       the net effect of the acquisition           on steel market prices.          Thus a positive       response   by


steel customers        will be sufficient          but not necessary       to establish    that the transaction         was welfare-


enhancing.


       These    stock market reactions              can be estimated        in an event study.         This paper computes         the


expect ed or “normal”              return to a security i at time t according             to the CAPM,       and so the resulting


regression       equation    is:




                                       Rit – Rft = ai + ~;(&t             – Rjt) + ~fi,~st      + ~it                              (1)



fort    =1,     . . . T, in which




                                                                     16
      Rit = return from holding        one share of firm i’s stock for week t


      Rft = risk free rate at time t


      Rmt = return on the market portfolio            in week t


      D.t = a dummy         variable with a value of one if an event occurs in week s, and zero otherwise


      ~it = a serially uncorrelated      random     disturbance



4.1      Sample       and    Data


This paper uses weekly data from December                 2, 1905 to November             3, 1906, 49 weeks yielding         48


weekly returns .61


      The reactions     of four sets of firms are analyzed:            US Steel, the Great Northern             Preferred,        a


portfolio   of independent       steel producers     representing     US Steel’s rivals (“Rivals”),         and a portfolio


of 39 railroads,     excluding     the Great Northern,     representing      US Steel’s customers         (“Railroads”)      .62


      The railroads     were by far the largest        consumers      of iron and steel during          this period,a       and


steel was a substantial       input cost for the railroads,         constituting     approximately      10 percent      of their


operating      costs. 64 Ideally, responses    of other customer       groups would be included           to compare       their


response    to that of the railroads,      but such groups could not be used due to data limitations.                       The


most significant      shortcoming    from using the railroads as a steel customer            group is the complex         inter-


relationship     between     steel companies    and railroads.      In particular,      steel companies     were important


customers      of the railroads,    with railroad charges representing             a large portion    of the cost of st eel.65


Yet as we argued in a related context,             these other relationships         should not bias inferences         derived


from this event study. 66 In particular,           the Great Northern         Ore acquisition        could indirectly     tiect


railroad    profitability    either by affecting    the quantity      of steel transported       by the railroads,        or by


affecting the quantity       of ore transported     by the railroads.     The former effect, which we have dubbed



                                                            17
the “railroad- (as) -supplier”     effect,    “simply      constitutes     another    transmission     mechanism      through


which the quantity     of steel production       positively     tiects     railroad profits. ” As a result, it still allows


one to infer the net effect of the Ore acquisition               on steel industry      output,      and hence prices.    The


latter effect, involving     the transportation         of ore, is unimportant         in the present      context   since the


Hill Ore Lease provided       for exclusive     transportation       by the Great Northern,           the returns for which


have been excluded        from the railroad portfolio.


    A further complication       is that since steel was a durable input for the railroads,                    an increase in


the price of steel would raise not only the cost of future railroad expenditures                      on steel, but also the


value of the railroads’    existing capital stock.         As long as this capital effect is not too strong, however,


this would lower the magnitude           but not change the sign of the railroads’                 stock market response.


There are several reasons to believe that the effect on future expenditures                     would be the main effect.


First, the railroads   could reap benefits        from the enhanced           value of their capital only if they could


sell off the steel. But recovering       steel rails, for example,          would involve considerable         direct expense


and leave the railroads       with the choice of replacing           the recovered      steel rails with an inferior non-


steel rail, or abandoning       the track.67     Second,      at this time the rtilroads          were continuing     to make


substantial   expenditures     on steel for track and equipment.                This was both to replace          depreciated


items and to expand their capital stock.           The railroads were not to become               a declining industry    for a


decade or more in the future, 68 Total railroad mileage was expanding                      through     double-tracking     and


yard-trackage,    and wood freight cars were being replaced                  by steel cars.69 Finally, results from our


previous   study (Mullin,     Mullin,   and Mullin (1995))          on the US Steel dissolution            suit are consistent


with our claim that the railroads            can serve as an appropriate             customer     group.    In that study we


found   that the railroads      experienced      positive     (negative)     excess returns to a series of events from


the dissolution   suit that increased        (decreased)     the probability     that US Steel would be dissolved.          Of



                                                               18
course, it is possible     that railroads      are not an appropriate         customer      group,   and so our inferences


in that previous     study were incorrect.          But it nevertheless      constitutes     a consistent   pattern   from a


related but not identical       setting.


      For the market portfolio,        we formed an equally weighted portfolio             of the 50 stocks composing     the


New York Times index, with returns corrected                 for dividends        and stock splits .70 Half of the stocks


in this index were railroads,          reflecting   the railroads’     prominence      in the stock market during this


period.    As a result, unmodified         use of this market return wotid          create the problem       of endogeneity.


As a result, in the estimation           we employ    instrument d variables.         One instrument        is the return on


an equally    weighted     portfolio    of the nine stocks which were judged               to be nonsensitive    to changes


in the steel industry. 71 A second instrument            is the deseasonalized        percentage     change in the volume


of bank clearings,        since bank clearings,       seasonally      adjusted,    were an important        macroeconomic


indicator .72


      For the risk free rate of return,        we employ     the imputed          weekly rate on 60 day time loans, as


reported    by the Financial      Review.73



4.2       Event   Selection


A common        problem    of event studies is that an event candidate               may have been anticipated        by the


stock market.     The Eckbo- Stillman methodology              solves this problem       by conditioning     on the reaction


of the parties directly involved         in the transaction.        If one or both of those parties have a significant


response,    then that indicates        that the event brought        news to the stock market.


      The hypothesized       event is LEAS ESIGN,          the formal      announcement        of the signing of the Hill


Ore Lease, which occurred          during the week ended October              6, 1906. We examined           several reports


on the steel industry      during this period from the weekly trade publication,                 The Iron Age magazine,



                                                               19
and daily editions       of the New York Times            and The WaH Street Journal              to determine      the event


window.       The Hill Ore Lease was subject to extended             negotiations     and many of the general terms of


the contract     were publicly      known prior to the announcement           of the signing. 74 Contemporary             news


accounts      suggest, however,      that the formal announcement           did release news to the stock market.


    A second       obvious     event candidate,      which we do not explore           further,    is US Steel’s    1911 an-


nouncement        of its cancellation     of the Hill Ore Lease.        In a prior study, cancellation           of the lease


generated      an 18 percent negative excess return for the beneficiaries              of the lease, the Great Northern


Ore Certificate      Holders.75     The source of the loss is indeterminate,          however,    because the excess neg-


ative return could signify either the forfeiture            of a share of future monopoly           rents pursuant       to the


foreclosure     hypothesis,      or a capital   loss incurred     on sunk relationship-specific         investments       under


the efficiency     hypothesis.      Moreover,      the source of the stock market           reactions    of US Steel, steel


rivals, and the railroads         is also indeterminate     because    of the circumstances         under which US Steel


surrendered      control of the Great Northern         Properties.     The lease cancellation       had multiple,     possibly


conflicting    market power effects:       (1) it brought    about a short-term         reconcentration      of the iron ore


market;      (2) it may have released information           to the stock market about             the probability       that US


Steel would face a dissolution          suit and (3) it may have reduced             the probability    of that dissolution


suit and thus increased          the probability    of long-term     concentration     in iron and steel markets.


    A final comment           on our choice of weekly stock return data and a weekly event window.                         Our


initial reason for employing          weekly rather than daily data was due to the high time-cost                       in hand


collecting     this historical    stock market data.       Moreover,     we believe     that although      the use of daily


return data would likely result in more efficient estimation,                 that any increase         in efficiency    would


not be substantial.


    Since there were six trading           days each week during this time period,                one might assume that



                                                             20
daily data would simply multiply            the sample size by six, and so the relative efficiency           of using daily


rather than weekly data would be 2.45.               This must be considered          an upper bound,       however,     since


it ignores the serial dependence          of the daily observations.      Moreover,     there is a cost associated       with


using high frequency       data and a narrow event window.              As Ellison and Mullin (1995) note, “When


the precise timing of an event is uncertain,            there is a trade-off      in the choice of event window.         Two


issues arise. The shorter the window,             the more precise will be the estimates           of the event response.


However,    the shorter     the window,         the more likely that the news, and hence the stock                  market’s


response,   will fall out side the event window.”76             Contemporary       accounts    suggest that news about


the Hill Ore lease w=        released on several days in the week of LEAS ESIGN, leading up to the day


of the formal announcement             of the lease. 77 Of course, with daily data one could estimate                  a daily


market model and compute              and cumulate     abnormal      returns for several days surrounding          the event


day.   But the simulation           results by Dyckman,     Philbrick,     and Stephan        (1984)   indicate   that when


there is event-date      uncertainty,     cumulating    residuals from a daily market model             “gives results that


are essentially     equivalent”      to using a longer estimation       period,   such as a week. 78 Intuitively,       if one


can observe   abnormal       performance        only at a weekly frequency,        then the efficiency     gain from using


higher frequency       data is considerably       attenuated.




4.3    Results


Table 1 at the end of the paper presents the stock market reactions                   to LEAS ESIGN,         Focus initially


on the excess returns of U.S. Steel and the Great Northern                   Railway.    The economically         meaningful


and statistically     significant    positive   4.1 percent excess return by U, S. Steel indicates           that news was


released to the stock market.




                                                                21
    Although      the economically      meaningful     (but not statistically       significant)    negative excess return


for the Great Northern Preferred is initially troubling,             closer examination        reveals several satisfactory


explanations      for the result.    First, note that the ret urn analyzed            is for Great Northern          Preferred


stock.     The private    holders    of Great   Northern      common       stock    rather than the public          holders     of


Great     Northern   Preferred      would be the principal         beneficiaries    of excess profits.        The division      of


profits from     the Hill Ore Lease in favor of the common                 stockholders        is particularly     pronounced


because     it was generally     understood     at the time of the announcement                 that the Great Northern


Properties     would be spun off and distributed         to the common       stockholders.7g       Nevertheless,     the Great


Northern      Preferred enjoyed a robust positive        1.4 percent daily return on the day the lease agreement


was announced,        a return      which contemporary        market     observers     attributed      to the agreement .m


Presumably       the primary     source of this positive      return was the benefit           the Great Northern           would


continue      to derive from the royalties      paid on the freight of ore shipped              from the Great Northern


Properties.     Finally, it appears that the announced             terms were slightly more favorable              to US Steel


than had been expected. 81 These              circumstances        cumulatively      provide     persuasive      evidence     that


news was communicated            to the market when the lease agreement              was announced        because     although


the terms were less favorable         to the Great Northern          than expected,     such negative information             was


overwhelmed       on the day of the announcement           by the positive news that a find agreement                 had been


reached.


    Having established        that news was conveyed         to the market by the LEASESIGN                   event, it is now


appropriate      to examine    the abnormal        returns of the railroads        and the steel rivals. The right hand


side of Table 1 shows the average responses of the railroads                  and the steel rivals.


    The most suggestive          result of the event study is the economically                 meaningful      positive     excess


ret urn of nearly      1 percent     experienced     by the railroads.        This is consistent        with the efficiency



                                                              22
hypothesis.      We cannot flatly rule out the foreclosure                hypothesis,        although    the results suggest that


any foreclosure      effects on steel prices were anticipated             to be more more than offset by the efficiency


gains passed onto steel customers.              In interpreting          the magnitude          of this effect,     recall that steel


purchases      represented    only      ten percent      of the railroads’         total    operating     costs.    Thus   a modest


excess return on railroad equity implies a far greater expected                            effect on steel prices.


    This excess return of the railroads is statistically              significant      at the 5 % level against the one-sided


alternative,     and significant     at the 10 70 level against the two-sided                   alternative    of zero effect.     The


one-sided      alternative   may be more appropriate            in this context;           the striking feature of these results


may be the failure to find a significant negative response by the railroads.                            There are some sources of


concern     about this precision,       in particular     our use of the standard             normal distribution       to assess the


significance     of the t-statistics.     Since our estimation        involves two-stage            least squares in a relatively


small sample, we cannot readily invoke the asymptotic                     properties         of this estimator.     Moreover,    stock


market returns are known to be distributed                   non-normally,         with fat tails, suggesting          that the true


significance     level for our results is higher than 5 YOor 10              YO.    This non-normality         is replicated     in our


sample;     we can reject the normality              of the railroads’     realized returns based on the Shapiro- Wilk


W-test    ‘2    However,     we cannot      reject    the normality       of the residuals from our CAPM                   regression


model;    we cannot reject the hypothesis              that excess railroad returns are distributed                 normally,    based


on the Shapiro- Wilk W-test. 83 Since our inferences                  are based on the distribution                of excess returns,


we are confident       in labelLing the railroads’         results as st artistically significant.


    The negative        excess return      suffered      by the steel Rivals is also consistent                with the efficiency


hypothesis,      but the result is neither st atisticdly        significant nor can it be used to distinguish                between


the efficiency     and foreclosure      hypotheses,      The foreclosure      hypothesis         also predicts a negative return


for the rivals if relatively       unintegrated       steel rivals are foreclosed           from a source of supply.



                                                                 23
5     Efficient           Contractual                Governance             Structures


The results in Section          four substantially      undermine      the foreclosure        hypothesis     as the sole expla-


nation for US Steel’s acquisition             of the Great Northern         Properties      while supporting      the efficiency


hypothesis.     The evidence       from the stock market data, however,               is unable to identify       the source of


the gain in efficiency.        In this Section,      we offer additional      qualitative     evidence     supporting      the effi-


ciency hypothesis        by analyzing      the Hill Ore Lease in search of the source of its efficiency                 enhancing


features.     First,    we analyze      the synergies    and cost efficiencies        US Steel and the Great Northern


sought to achieve by uniting their productive                 capacities    and committing        their combined          resources


to relationship-specific       investment      in the Great Northern          Properties.     Second, we compare           the gov-


ernance     structures     of the Hill Ore Lease with those used by the parties in similar transactions                           in


which market foreclosure          is an implausible      explanation       for the selection     of such structures.        In par-


ticular, after the Hill lease was cancelled,            the Trustees for the Ore Properties              signed contracts      with


smaller firms with terms similar to the US Steel lease.                      Third,   we examine         the parties’     choice of


contractual     governance      structures     and evaluate the effectiveness         of such structures      in producing      the


desired outcomes         by examining       the motivation       and effect of individual       contractual     terms.      Fourth,


we examine      the individual         contractual   terms in light of the foreclosure          hypothesis.




5.1     Durable,          Relationship-Specific            Investments


The Hill Ore Lease presented               US Steel with an attractive          investment      opportunity     because      of the


complementary           relationship     between     the Great     Northern     Properties      and US Steel’s          preexisting


ore properties         on the Western      Mesabi    Range.    US Steel determined            that by uniting the two most


substantial     tracts on the Western          Mesabi it could generate         cost-saving     economies     by taking charge




                                                                 24
of the properties         from the beginning        and developing        the lands according         to its long-term     mining


strategy    wit bout being hampered             by previous   occupiers     and outside or adverse interests ,84


    As an illustration        of the relationship       between      the ore lands of the Great Northern                 and those


of US Steel, consider          Figure    1, which presents        a map of part of the Western                Mesabi     near Col-


eraine 1 Minnesota.85         The map identifies        the holdings      of the Oliver Mining           Company,      a US Steel


subsidiary,     and the Great Northern           Railway, as of February        1906. Almost          all the property    between


the Northern      and Southern       boundaries       of the range were held by one of these two parties, or held


jointly.    Moreover,      these properties       were intermingled,       so that unified control         could allow for the


development       of a large, stripped     open pit mine for a group of adjacent                properties.


     Exploitation       of the synergies    arising from unified development               of the Western       Mesabi      Range,


however,      first required the parties to agree to a governance               structure     which would provide          both of


them with optimal          performance     incentives     over the life of the lease. Efficient extraction               of the ore


required both US Steel and the Great Northern                  to make relationship-specific            investments,     resources


the parties would not commit unless ex post opportunism                      could be averted with ex ante contractual


governance      structures.      Of Williamson’s        four categories      of relationship-specific         investments,     two


categories,    physical     asset specificity     and site specificity,    loom large in this context.          There is a third


element of asset specificity        in this environment,        that of dedicated         capacity.


     The need for both physical asset and site specificity                in developing     the Great Northern         Properties


was diet ated by exogenous          circumst mces–that         is, by the best available methods              to extract the ore


at minimum        cost.    US Steel’s fundamental          approach       to the Mesabi      ore lands was to plan its ore


developments        for the indefinite rather than the immediate              future,s6 and thus “to prepare for a long


continued      period     of cheap mining        [so] that an entire ore body        [could] be extracted           at minimum


expense. ”87



                                                                25
    Due to the long lead-time           in the investments        made by US Steel, and to a lesser extent those


made by the Great Northern,            there was an initial delaygg in the extraction          of ore. By the end of 1908


US Steel had spent approximately               $4 million on preparing        the Great Northern           Properties        before


ext ratting    any ore, 89 We estimate         that US Steel spent at least another             $4 million     in developing


mines    in the next       several years. w     If we take $8 million         as our estimate        of US Steel’s           direct


development      costs, this would amount to $84 million in 1994 dollars. 91 This $8 million investment                           is


overshadowed         when compared      to US Steel’s total capitalization       of $1.4 billion.     But this investment


was substantial        when comparing      to the existing      investments     in ore properties.         In April     1901 US


Steel’s total book investment          in improvements     in all iron ore properties          was about     $9 million.g2


    Moreover,        the wide variety of asset specific preparations          made on the part of US Steel drew the


attention     of contemporary       commentators     who noted,



        ...[US Steel is determined]        to open these mines on the most improved                   and scientific


        principles     possible,   and to prepare itself for a vast product           at the lowest cost per ton.


        Vast sums have been spent, and this expenditure              is continuing,    in the preparation       for the


        beginning      of mining operations     in the Western      Mesaba,     enormous       stripping    operations


        are in progress,       model   towns    are building,     investments    of hundreds        of thousands        of


        dollars are being made simply to assure the company                that its employees        shall be of the


        character     desired and shall be reasonably        permanent .93



    These constitute        only those investments     directly involved in the mining of iron ore. But US Steel


could and did make specific investments             in its steel manufacturing        operations     to take advantage           of


a large, assured supply of ore. An additional            motivation     for site specific assets was the significance


of transportation        costs in the production       of steel.     Consequently,      soon    after the signing         of the



                                                             26
Hill Ore Lease, US Steel began plans for constructing                    a large iron and steel plant in the vicinity


of Duluth     Minnesota      to supplement      its Gary Indiana plant and to save on transportation                      costs.w


Clearly, the entire value of this investment            was not specific to US Steel’s relationship              with the Great


Northern,     since the Steel Corporation         did control       a substantial     portion     of the Mesabi range on its


own,      Nevertheless,     it is striking   that US Steel did not purchase             land for the Duluth           plant until


1907, (shortly)     after the signing of the Hill lease.             Plant expenditures          totfled     nearly $6    million


by the cancellation        of the Hill lease. 95 Construction          continued,     and the plant began operations            in


1916 after total undiscounted            expenditures     of $24.1 million. 96 The completed                 Duluth    plant had


“an annual capacity         of 360,000 tons of finished steel products.”g7


    Clearly, US Steel bore the greater responsibility               to invest in completion         of the mining operations.


The Great Northern,           however,   was also responsible         for making      nontrivial     relationship-specific     in-


vestments      pursuant to their freight duties. 98 These latter investments                    involved   both site specificity


and dedicated      capacity     as the Great Northern        expanded       its dock and track facilities          to accommo-


date the ore shipments. 99 In particular,             the Great Northern      constructed         track branches to the edge


of new mines, so that ore could be loaded                directly    into the freight cars. 100 The rolling stock was


obviously     mobile,     but specialized    as well.    The freight      cars moved      the ore from the mines to the


docks on Lake Superior.           James J. Hill testified       that the freight       “cars are such cars as cannot           be


used for any other purpose.           They are a peculiar       car. They are short, and are made to fit the old


docks . . . the hatches of the vessels were made to fit them.’’l”l                  The locomotives        were also somewhat


specialized     to ore traffic, with a Mallet engine, optimized             to pull very heavy loads but at relatively


low speeds.loz


    As Williamson         and the other transaction         cost economists         have observed,         transactions   charac-


terized    by significant     relationship-specific     investments      will require special        contractual      governance



                                                              27
mechanisms       to prevent the danger of opportunistic               behavior    which is characteristic      of spot market


exchanges      involving    prior relationship-specific       investments.        Analysis   of the overall structure         and


specific    terms of the Hill Ore Lease will show that the very terms which attracted                         the condemna-


tion of antitrust     officials as insidious    instruments      of market foreclosure,1°3          were actually       efforts to


encourage      an efficient level of relationship-specific          investment     by the parties.




5.2        Lease terms       in comparable             transactions


Before analyzing        the likely effects of particular      contractual        terms, we should note that comparable


transactions     implemented        a similar contractual       scheme in situations         in which market foreclosure


is an implausible       hypothesis.     For example,       US Steel used many of the same terms applicable                      to


the Hill Ore Lease when negotiating               much smaller iron ore acquisitions.                  US Steel consistently


sought to extend        leases which were due to expire to a new term of 50 years or longer.                            In return


for a modest      royalty    rate, US Steel would          agreed to a take or pay provision              guaranteeing      large


annual minimums.1°4          In addition,    US Steel employed          similar contractual     terms in its relationships


with suppliers      of coal. 105 The extraordinary           abundance      of coal makes foreclosure          an implausible


explanation     for the governance        structures    used in US Steel’s coal acquisitions .106 The feature these


contracts     do share with the Hill Ore Lease, however,                 is the requirement       that both      parties make


relationship-specific       investments     to create an efficient supplier-producer           ~sociation.1°7


      Even more significant       evidence    is provided     by the experience        of the Hill lands after the termi-


nation of the lease by US Steel. Soon after the announcement                        of cancellation,     the Great Northern


Trustees     (the “Trustees’’)lOs     began making arrangements             for continued     mining of the ore lands,log


to a great extent benefiting           from US Steel’s sunk investment               in improving      the facilities    both on


the mines US Steel had developed                and those of adjoining            properties. 110 Initially,     the Trustees



                                                               28
sought to open these lands directly              on behalf of the Trust mining the land on its own account .111


While continuing        to work some mines, the Trustees later reverted                 to leasing a majority     of the ore


properties,llz      seeking reimbursement           from lessees for improvements          made by the lessors on the


lands.113


      Advocates      of the enforcement         actions    taken against US Steel cite the reconcentration              of the


Great Northern        Properties      as evidence    that US Steel’s ownership        of such properties     was a substan-


tial barrier to entry for competing             iron producers      and smaller, integrated      steel firms ,114 The leases


such smaller firms entered into, however,                 contained   terms similar 115 to those conttined        in the Hill


Ore Lease including          guaranteed     minimums116        and mandatory        investments.117     This suggests    that


such terms were designed to safeguard                genuine efficiencies    created by vertical integration.


      This provides fairly compelling           evidence that US Steel was motivated          by concerns of contractual


governance       rather than market foreclosure            in signing the Hill ore lease. Now to consider           how this


motivation       is illustrated    by the terms of the lease




5.3       Specific Lease Terms


The     terms    of the ore lease bear striking            resemblance     to the terms of contracts         studied   in the


transaction       cost literature.      As a result,      an examination      of these individual       terms recapitulates


much of the scholarship            on contractual    governance       undertaken    in the past two decades.



5.3,1       Take    or Pay        Requirement


Critics   of the Hill Ore Lease appeared               particularly    alarmed     at the substantial     minimum      mining


requirements       and annual escalation          in the royalty,     suggesting   that the only plausible      justification


for such overcompensation             would be an anticompetitive          intent to foreclose    the ore properties     from




                                                                 29
competitors.     lls This mechanism,          however, has a benign justification         of providing     optimal incentives


to both parties.      For example,       US Steel’s    “take or pay”      commitment         to mine an annual minimum


tonnage     of ore ensured US Steel would fulfill its obligations               to develop     the land.llg


    Consider      how the “take or pay” obligation          affected US Steel’s incentives          in the execution      of the


lease, and how that in turn affected the Great Northern’s                   incentives.      Ex-post,    US Steel’s marginal


acquisition     cost of ore up to the “take”           quantity      is zero,   since the royalty        payment    is sunk at


that point ,120 so us         Steel h~   an incentive    to undertake       investments       to develop      the ore land and


actually    take delivery of ore that it has already paid for. The Great Northern                       Railway, on the other


hand, knows that it can undertake              specific investments     to accommodate         this anticipated      ore trtic,


since even if this ore traffic does not materialize,            US Steel is still obligated        to pay for at least some


of the specific    costs the Railway has incurred.


    US Steel would have the incentive               to prepare for substantial        mining over the course of years,


abandoning      their sunk investment         only if their resources could be put to better use at another site.121


From prior experience,          US Steel recognized      annual minimums          committed      them to make significant


investments       in their mines      so that it could      produce      enough    tonnage      to satisfy     its contractual


obligations .122 This prediction         was confirmed     over the course oft he many take or pay contracts                  US


Steel had executed.         As a result of such contracts,       even during periods of industry-wide              contraction,


US Steel continued          its Mesabi   operations. 123 This commitment             to exploit     the acquired       property


is directly    contrary     to the foreclosure    hypothesis,     which would predict         that US Steel would simply


stockpile     unexploited     ore reserves.




                                                                30
5.3.2       Royalty   Rate


The Bureau       of Corporations         considered     the 85 cent royalty      for the Hill ore lands to be “abso-


lutely unprecedented.’’124        Some other numbers          serve as a basis for comparison.          From 1902-1906,


the average royalty        on all Mesabi      ore was 26 cents per gross ton,           as reported     by the Bureau     of


Corporations.125      The Bureau         also reported     other components        entering into the cost of ore deliv-


ered at lower lake ports.       The average book cost per ton at mine, including                 the roydt y, was 78 cents


for Mesabi     range ores.      Rail freight from the mine to Superior,             Wisconsin,      or some other appro-


priate port averaged         80 cents.    Lake freight from Superior           to a lower lake port such as Clevelmd


averaged     77 cents. With the addition         of taxes and general expenses,         the total book cost of Mesabi


ore at a lower lake port averaged            $2.45. 126 Strikingly,     this was below the book         cost of ores from


other ranges in the Lake Superior             region:    $2.62, $2.93 and $3.09 for the Marquette,           Menominee,


and Gogebic      range ores, respectively. 127 The extraction             costs on the Mesabi were lower, ~d            this


was only partially        offset by the higher transportation         costs.    Moreover,   these total book costs were


below    the prices delivered      ore commanded.          The base price for delivery        at lower Lake Erie ports


in 1906 was $4.00 for Mesabi Bessemer                 and $3,50 for Mesabi non-Bessemer.           128 So although   an 85


cent royalty     was very large, it could still be paid profitably              if the lease enabled    the Mesabi   to be


exploited    on a larger and lower cost scale.


    Note that the royalty was specified in terms of a nominal dollar amount per ton, rather than on


a percentage     basis.    This appears to have been a common              feature of contemporary        iron ore leases,


and so this aspect of the Hill lease did not receive considerable                    attention. 129 One may speculate


on the reasons for this arrangement.              The alternative      of specifying    a royalty    based on a “market


price”   at the point of ore production           would have been untenable,           because      that market was very




                                                              31
thin.   Ore from the Lake Superior              region,   which included          the Mesabi     range, was “sold chiefly at


the lower Lake ports, hundreds of miles from the place of production.”                          lW Perhaps        US Steel could


have had undue influence on the market price for such ore, since even before the Hill deal it mined


56 percent       of the total Lake Superior        ore production.        131 Furthermore,       there may have been scope


for manipulating        a market price by the railroad            precisely      because    transportation     was required    for


the ore to reach the relevant market.


    The royalty rate of 85 cents per gross ton was due to rise by 3.4 cents per year, which represented


a 4 percent        annual increase     in the royalty     rate.        Such a provision      was probably      not designed    to


account      for expected    economy-wide        inflation,     since prices had recently         stabilized   after decades    of


deflation.       The stipulated     4 percent    interest on ore in the ground              further encouraged       US Steel to


frontload       its investment    and extraction     efforts.132


    Assuming        that US Steel was paying an “above                 market”    rate for the Hill ore, why was the lease


structured       to require US Steel to pay a royalty rate above the opportunity                       cost of the ore?     Such


a wedge could generate            distortions   in behavior      ex-post,     and therefore     lower the total value of the


transaction       to both parties.     One possibility y is connected         with the take or pay provision.          Since the


payments        due on the take level were sunk, US Steel’s ex-post                  marginal    acquisition    cost went from


zero (up to the take level) to the 85 cent royalty                     rate, which included       a premium       for the Great


Northern.        Thus if US Steel subsequently            decided       to mine and deliver ore in excess of the take


level, it would have to compensate               the Great Northern           ex-post      on this margin.     This additiond


compensation        might reflect a capacity       constraint     on the Great Northern,         even beyond the expansion


of facilities    that would be involved         in executing      other elements of the lease.


    Support       for this interpretation       comes from another lease term,                The Great Northern        Railway


was required       “to furnish adequate equipments            and facilities for receiving,       transporting,     and docking



                                                                  32
all the ores to be mined by the lessee.”         This requirement       had the following        proviso.     The lessors, the


Great Northern,      would not be required to furnish “tracks or facilities in any year for transporting                      or


delivering    a greater tonnage than the minimum            herein fixed for such year, except               upon reasonable


notice in writing first given by the lessee to the trustees .“133 The requirement                           of advance    notice


suggests the need to expand transportation              capacity    even further for ore levels beyond             that year’s


take level.


    There is no indication          of a maximum     quantity    specified in the lease, although            perhaps because


the guaranteed       minimums        were so substantial,    they were thought          to be effective        maximums,      so


that once US Steel put its mining operation              fully into place, it was anticipated               that there would


be only relatively     small year to year fluctuations          in deliveries    around the take level.



5.3.3    Freight      rate


The royalty      rate was not the only consideration               the Great      Northern      received.     Ore w=       to be


transported      exclusively   on the Great Northern        at the rate of 80 cents per ton.                The freight of 80


cents was the current market rat e for Mesabi transport,               but the estimated         cost of transporting       such


ore was approximately          30 cents per ton, with costs expected              to decline further over the duration


of the lease.134 This seemingly          excessive   freight charge promised          the Great Northern          may have a


procompetitive      justification    serving as a “performance        bond.”      One available mechanism             to prevent


opportunistic     behavior     is to offer the potential    opportunist         a future premium,       a price sufficiently


over spot market to assure income that would exceed the benefits of opportunistic                            renegotiation.135


k   the present     case, the freight charges can be understood                 as a variable    premium       which tied the


interests of the contracting         parties together   throughout      the life of the contract.


    In fact, the need for a performance          bond was magnified         by another contractual            term,    The take



                                                            33
or pay provision          might have encouraged          opportunism            by the Great      Northern.      Why    should    the


railroad incur the costs of expanding             its facilities?        After all, although      such a decision would reduce


the tonnage       mined,     US Steel was still obligated           to pay for the annual minimum.               Significantly,   the


take or pay provision         applied only to the royalty rate on ore, not to the freight rate.lw                    Furthermore,


the lease provided         that if the Great Northern        did not furnish the necessary                tracks, equipment,      and


facilities,    then after reasonable       notice, the Great Northern              would be placed in default on the lease,


and US Steel would be allowed to make other transportation                                 arrangements     for the period     of the


default.       So the freight       rate may have played            an important           role in assuring     Great    Northern’s


performance.


     These provisions         also illustrate    the mutually       reinforcing     features of the lease, carefully         aligning


and balancing          both sets of interests to facilitate         optimal      ex-post     execution    by both parties.


     Of course, if the stipulated          freight rate was above the marginal                 cost of transportation,       it could


lower the value of the transaction               by inducing        distorted     choices    e-post.     For example,    one might


wonder        about    US Steel’s     decision   to build a steel plant in Duluth,                Minnesota.      Since Duluth        is


on Lake Superior,           the plant     was designed      to receive        ore afler it had been           transported     by the


Great Northern           from the Mesabi range.        Since alternative          steel production        was located    in Gary or


Pittsburgh,       the Duluth      plant was sited to save on the cost of transporting                      ore to these alternate


locations.      The Duluth plant was planned to produce                     steel for markets west and north of the Great


Lakes.137 Because the transportation               cost savings that motivated               the Duluth plant largely involved


Lake freight          and railroads    other than the Great           Northern,      it is unlikely      that the lease’s    80 cent


freight rate played a significant           role in this investment           decision.




                                                                    34
5.3.4     Sliding      Scale     Royalty



One lease term which has been largely                    overlooked    is the sliding    scale of royalty    prices    for the


mining of ore of lower grade.            This pricing structure       encouraged   US Steel to internalize     the gains on


exploitation    of an additional         synergy resulting from combining          the Great Northern       Properties   with


US Steel’s preexisting         Mesabi holdings.      Although     the Mesabi ore was known to be of generally high


quality, a substantial         portion   of the range was of lesser grade.         During the years leading up to and


immediately      following      the Hill Ore Lease, US Steel worked on perfecting               devices for concentrating


the immense      quantity      of sandy ores on the Western            Mesabi Range .138


    Following two years of intensive experimentation,                  US Steel made a significant site specific invest-


ment in 1908 as it erected a permanent               washery and concentrating          plant on the Western Mesabi,         at


Coleraine,     Minnesota,      at a total cost of $1.4 million.139        US Steel anticipated      that the concentrating


plant would process ore with an iron content as low as 36 percent,                      producing   concentrated      ore with


iron content     in the neighborhood            of 57 percent. 140 By 1911, the plant was operating             near its full


capacity.141     The sliding scale feature           of the lease made the lean ores a relative             bargain    for US


Stee1142 which could therefore             internalize   the gains resulting from its investments         in concentrating


technology,     plants, and equipment.           US Steel ultimately      failed to realize the maximum        benefit from


the sliding scale, however,           because    it terminated    the lease prior to the time when it could extract


a substantial     tonnage      of low grade ore from the Great Northern              Properties.143



5.3.5     Unilateral         Option      to Terminate


These apparent efficiency benefits from the lease raise the question of why, if the lease were so clearly


beneficial,    did US Steel insist upon receiving             an option    to cancel the lease in 1915.        One possible


explanation     is that the uncertainty          involved    in the ore acquisition in 1906 was so substantial            that


                                                                 35
prudence      dictated   reevaluation      of the economics       of the transaction       prior to committing        to meet the


annual minimum of 8.25 million tons for the duration of the lease. In addition to this business factor,


there is an additional         potential   efficiency   concern.        The principal     difficulty   posed by uncertainty        in


the presence      of relationship-specific         investment     is that contractual        gaps tend to be larger and the


occasions     for sequential        adaptations     (and thus for opportunistic            behavior)      increase   concurrently


with the increase in uncertainty.


    Uncertainty      clearly     was a significant      factor    in US Steel’s       evaluation       of the Hill Ore Lease in


1906. The parties had to make rough estimates                      of the magnitude        and quality of the ore holdings,


estimates     that varied dramatically. 144 In addition,                the value of the lease over time would depend


on the relative      scarcity       of available    iron ore both        domestically      and internationally.145         Finally,


future   demand      by US Steel and the steel industry                   as a whole     could not be precisely         predicted.


The unilateral      option      to terminate       the relationship        is an easily enforceable        feature    which   could


foster efficient adaptation          as these uncertainties        were resolved over time.146 It is difficult to assess


the efficacy    of the lease cancellation          option    w an enforcement           mechanism,      however,     both because


the mechanism        would      likely be exercised         privately     and because      the threat      of the government’s


dissolution     suit prompted        US Steel to cancel the lease prematurely              before it could serve its intended


business purpose.


    The lease did not give the Great Northern                   Railway a similar option to terminate              its obligations.


The benefits      from such an option            would have been relatively           low, since as indicated         most of the


uncertainty     about the value of the lease was on the side of US Steel. Moreover,                          the costs of adding


such an option       could     have been substantial.            If both    parties   to an exchange        have the option        to


terminate      the arrangement,          then such an option            can be used as a threat           to renegotiate      terms


opportunistically        ex-post.      Ex-post     bargaining,     and its attendant          threat    to relationship-specific



                                                                  36
investments,     would have been encouraged.            Of course, US Steel might have used its sole possession


of this option    to extract rents from the Great Northern            ex-post, but the Great Northern’s           position


was protected      by other lease terms, in particular        the take or pay requirement.


    Because      US Steel did exercise     its option    to terminate,   we can examine        the implementation         of


that option.     In particular,     was there a “settling     up” of specific investments        by the parties before


control   was surrendered?        We have been unable to find what          lewe terms governed the settling up

of specific investments.       We know a little bit more about how settling up occurred.

    US Steel permitted       the Trustees    to begin preparing mines which US Steel did not plan to work

prior to 1915. In return for permission           to begin developing       the properties,     the certificate    holders


agreed to assume payment of taxes on such properties,               which were turned      over on March 1, 1912.147

    At the termination         of the lease on December          31, 1914, the Trustees       for the Great Northern


Ore properties      took possession     of all eight mines that had been developed              by US Steel.       Five of


those mines had been nearly exhaust ed, but three                cent ained considerable      unexploited     tonnage.    In


1914 “the railway tracks, head frames, boiler and engine houses, and considerable                     other equipment

of [these] mines,     were purchased,       in place”    from the Steel Corporation        by the Trustees.14s           The


purchase price for these assets was not disclosed in the annual reports of either the Trustees                       or the

Steel Corporation. 149 There is no indication             that US Steel made any additional           payments       to the


Great Northern       Railway      to cover the Railway’s     investments.     This is unsurprising,         since the high


take or pay requirements           served in part as payment        for those investments.        Moreover,       since the


lease termination     resulted in the ore lands reverting          to the Great Northern’s       control,    the Railroad


ww better positioned       than US Steel to recoup its investments            after the lease period.




                                                            37
5.3.6       Lease    vs.     Sale


We examine          one other lease      “term,”     namely   the lease structure          itself.   The parties       decided    to


structure    the transaction        as a lease rather than as a sale of the Great Northern                 Properties.     This is


striking, since much of the transaction              cost literature     emph~izes        the potential    for opportunism        in


the execution       of long term cent racts.         The choice of a lease structure           may have been a concession


to the economic         reality     that the Great     Northern       ww not the fee owner of all the properties.150


Yet there are suggestions             that a lease arrangement           might     have been preferred        to an ownership


relationship.       As modelled       by Grossman      and Hart (1986),          ownership     is the acquisition      of residud


rights of control.      The acquisition       of these rights by one party deprives those rights from the second


party, and this can adversely            affect the second         party’s   incentives    to undertake     investments.         The


lease structure       was chosen to establish         the comparative         duties of the parties,      both of whom were


important       to the success of the venture.         As we have noted, both US Steel and the Great Northern


had to make investments              in executing     the lease.     Thus, even if sale in fee of the Great Northern


Properties      had been possible,        the need to preserve          incentives      ex post for kth      parties    may have


made a long-term           contracting   structure    preferable.151


    The problems           with an outright     ownership     arrangement         can be illustrated      by considering     what


would   have happened             had US Steel purchased           the Great      Northern     Ore lands directly.         It then


would have needed to contract            with the Great Northern             railroad   (or some other railway) for freight


services.    Although       railroad freight rates were regulated            in this period,   there is potential      for ex-post


opportunism         by both parties.     If US Steel attempted           to negotiate     a freight agreement        after it had


sunk investments           on the land, part of the value of this investment              could be expropriated        ex-post    by


the Great Nort hem.            On the other hand, once the Great Northern                  sunk the required        expansion     of




                                                               38
track and loading       docks to handle the expanded            ore traffic, those site specific assets were not going


to be moved.       Hence, US Steel could then attempt               to renegotiate    more favorable       freight terms.     The


problems      of bilateral   monopoly       emphasized    in the transaction         cost literature   loom large,


      Nevertheless,    it is reasonable     to inquire whether the problem            is created by the governance          struc-


ture (ownership       versus lease), or whether it is created by the sequential                  rather than simultaneous


timing of agreements.          One might imagine         that a sde agreement           could include      a clause indicating


that ore would be carried on the Great Northern                     Railway   at pre-specified    terms.      Such a clause, if


enforceable      ex-post,    could constrain     both    parties’   ex-post   bargaining     flexibility    and hence reduce


opportunistic      behavior.     Clearly,    some of the lease terms could have been replicated,                  for example


agreeing to high freight charges to serve as a performance                    bond for the Great Northern.             But other


features seem unique to the lease arrangement.                 For example,        US Steel’s unilateral      option   to termi-


nate gave it both flexibility       to adapt to changed external circumstances                 and a threat to use against


non-performance        by the Great Northern.




5.4      Are lease terms consistent                 with vertical          foreclosure?


Although      the foregoing      has outlined      the efficiency      rationale     for these various      lease terms,     it is


worthwhile       to step back and consider        which terms were or were not compatible                   with the alternate


hypothesis      of vertical foreclosure.      In particular,   if bringing    the Great Northern           ore lands under the


control of US Steel would generate vertical foreclosure,                 then that would create private value for the


contracting      parties.    That private value would be from the monopoly                    profits created     or defended


by this lease, and so one might expect              that the lease would share these monopoly                   rents with the


Great Northern        Railway.


      Although     not couched     precisely    in that language,        that is clearly the intuition         underlying      the



                                                               39
Bureau      of Corporation’s      condemnation       of the high royalty        and freight rates the Great Northern


interests    were to receive in the lease.          The Great Northern’s         profitable     arrangement        was taken as


evidence     of anticompetitive      effect.    The presence      of profits or a premium          for the Great Northern


is consistent     with vertical    foreclosure;      the precise        form of this arrangement        is more      difficult   to


reconcile     with the foreclosure    hypothesis.      In particular,      why was the Great Northern              compensated


based on royalties and freight rates, in other words, based upon the quantity                         of ore extracted       from


the property?       As an alternative          arrangement,      US Steel could      have bought       the Great       Northern


lands outright,     or at least all those lands held in fee by the Great Northern.                   If a lease arrangement


w=   necessary,     US Steel could have contracted             to lease the land for a fixed charge per year, or an


increasing     charge over time.


     The one advantage of the royalty arrangement                 was in sharing risk between the parties concerning


the total amount of ore in the Great Northern                  lands.    Because this was unknown         to both parties, a


royalty rate would provide         better insurance      than a fixed annual charge.             For example,      if the ore on


the Hill properties     turned out to be unexpectedly            low, US Steel’s royalty and freight payments              would


fall. But from a foreclosure         perspective,     this was very expensive        insurance,     since under foreclosure


the value of the transaction         comes from keeping the ore out of production.                   So the actual lease, by


generating      incentives for the properties       to be exploited       ez-post, directly undermined        any foreclosure


motivation.


     This is related     to another     point     that has been raised earlier.          The take or pay provision,              by


inducing      US Steel to exploit the properties       ex-post,      is directly contrary     to the foreclosure    hypothesis,


which would have left these ores unexploited.              Of course, hypothetically           US Steel could have reduced


its exploitation     of its other ore lands to more than offset its exploitation                    of the Great Northern


properties.      But the historical       record    suggests     otherwise.     First,   because     US Steel had sizeable



                                                                40
annual minimums          on its other ore leases, it was committed                to exploit   those properties    as well.


Second,     US Steel’s total iron ore production          rose in the aftermath       of the Hill lease, increasing     from


18,486,556     tons in 1905 to 25,245,816       tons in 1910.152


    US Steel’s unilateral       option    to terminate     the lease is problematic         for some models     of vertical


foreclosure    but not for others,    In the early work on foreclosure,           up through models by Krattenmaker


and Salop (1986)      and Ordover,        Saloner, and Salop (1990),         successful    foreclosure   requires that the


integrated     firm commit    not to supply its unintegrated          rivals with the input,        or alternatively,   that


the integrated     firm commit       not to supply its unintegrated          rivals except     at a very high price.     An


option    to terminate     the vertical    relationship    is the opposite        of a commitment,       since it preserves


some flexibility y.   This is not a problem           for the Hart and Tirole         (1990)   model,    since they derive


foreclosure    effects from profit sharing within the integrated             firm rather than from commitment.


    Nevertheless,     the cancellation      option,    when coupled       wit h the other terms of the lease, poses a


problem      under any of these theories       of foreclosure.     Because     the other lease terms committed           US


Steel to develop      the properties,     if they surrendered      these properties        they would leave rivals with


enhanced      access to iron ore. That possibility        was recognized     by Iron Age in 1907,153 and subsequent


experience     bore out that concern.      Strikingly, the leases made by the Trustees immediately                following


US Steel’s     cancellation    of the Hill Ore Lease involved             those    mines   which    had been    previously


developed     either by US Steel or the Trustees. 154 Admittedly                  > US Steel cancelled     the lease under


antitrust pressure.      But whatever      the motive,     cancellation    after investments       were sunk would bring


about an outcome         opposite   of foreclosure.
6     Conclusion


The quantitative      and qualitative   evidence   presented in this paper supports         the hypothesis       that the


Hill Ore Lease was an efficient governance          structure    designed   to overcome      the problem       of ex post


opportunism    that typically    arises in contracts    involving   significant   relationship-specific     investment.


Conversely,   the evidence seriously undermines         the conventional    foreclosure    explanation      of US Steel’s


acquisition   of the Great Northern       Properties,   a view which has enjoyed          widespread      acceptance.


    Beyond    the historical    significance   of these findings,    the data has shown that US Steel, a firm


with greater than 50 percent        of the market share in both the iron ore and steel markets,                 acquired


the final significant independent       source of iron ore, and yet generated        a positive   efficiency    sufficient


to generate an implied lowering of steel prices.        This astonishing     result forces serious reconsideration


of the advisability    of the recent attention     directed    at vertical relationships    among firms with much


lower levels of market share and industry          concentration.

    2James J. Hill was President,         founder,       and principal   stockholder     of the Great Northern         Railway.


His entrepreneurial       efforts were primarily           responsible   for the acquisition        of the Great       Northern


Properties.      Dwight   E. Woodbridge,           “The     Hill Iron Ore Properties,”          The Iron Age,       January    4,


1906, 26-28.



   3The editors       of the industry        trade journal,     The Iron Age,       considered      the ore situation      to be


an example       of “competitive     pre-emption         of mineral resources      for use in the distant future. ” “The


Pre-emption      of Mineral Reserves ,“ The Iron Age, October                   4, 1906, 876; “The Question         of Capital-

and practically      unlimited     capital.” ).



    4US Steel and its ore acquisitions            were closely scrutinized        by the Bureau of Corporations            in its


Report      on the steel industry,     by the House of Representatives             in the Stanley Committee            Hearings,


and ultimately      by the courts in the Department              of Justice’s    dissolution     suit filed in 1911.

       ‘As   to the lands owned in fee by the Great Northern,             the lease was to run until the mines were


exhausted        of ore with an iron content of 49 percent or more.            US Steel could then continue the lease


at its option.       As to the leasehold     properties,     the term of the subleases was three months                 shorter


the term of the original lewes.           Report    of the Commissioner        of Corporations      on the Steel Industry,

   1°US Steel was the nation’s         leading industrial       corporation.     On the other side of the transaction


was industrialist      and railroad developer        James Hill, one of the nation’s      wealthiest     individuals.     “Hill

   11One indication        of the significance      of the contract    is its enormous    length,    running in excess of


1000 printed pages.         “The Great Northern          Iron Ore Lease,”      The Iron Age, October        19, 1911, 854.

   131t was thought        that the royalty        charged in the Hill Ore Lease would have a significant                 effect

the bulk of US Steel’s mining operations               on the Mesabi,     and the Great Western          Mining    Company

In 1906, the Wdl        Street Journal       reported    that the Great      Northern      had Mesabi      ore holdings     of


500,000,000     tons in the ground,      US Steel had 600,000,000         tons, and all the other interests combined


had 200,000,000      tons.    Industry   observers,     however,    discounted    such estimates      because     of the lack


of definitive   exploration     of the Mesabi.      “The    Exact     Quantity   of Ore in the Hill Properties ,“ The

  41This assumption         on the contracting       process varies in other variants of their model that we do


not discuss.



  421n the equilibrium        under non-integration,          U1 supplies both D1 and D2 with the Cournot              quan-


tity corresponding       to c1.



  43The authors argue that profit sharing cannot be accomplished                       under non-integration.



  441n particular,      if C2 is infinite, so that U1 is a monopolist,           then under integration      U1 will supply

the monopoly       output    to D1 and sell nothing           to D2.    If C2 is finite, but still larger than c1, then


under integration       U1 will supply D2 with the quantity that U2 would supply, but at a slightly lower

price.


                                                               52
     An alternative        contractual    arrangement       that might accomplish          the same end as vertical integra-


tion would be exclusive dealing.           Hart and Tirole argue that exclusive dealing may not be enforceable


without     integration,     and moreover      that it would not be optimal             in certain circumstances.



  45As pointed       out by Hart and Tirole,             the model      of Ordover,     Salop, and Saloner       (1990)     can be


considered     as essentially    a special case of the variant discussed here, except with identical                    upstream


firms (cl = Cz). One weakness of the Ordover,                   Saloner, and Salop model is that they assume that


vertical   integration      enables     U1 – D1 to commit             not to supply     D2 below       some price F chosen by


the merged entity. In equilibrium,             this commitment           raises Dz’s marginal         cost, and thereby creates


profits    for U1 – D1 and the incentive               for vertical    integration,     This commitment         is not credible,


however.     In the Hart and Tirole model,               under vertical integration         there is no need for such an ex


ante commitment            since profit sharing ensures that U1 – D1 will not “oversupply”                     D2 ex post.



  46Hart and Tirole,          217.     Here we identify       the long term lease with acquisition,              although       later


we distinguish     between      these governance         structures     when discussing      the importance      of relationship


specific   investments.       Hart and Tirole          assume that profit       sharing enables investment             costs to be


internalized    within the merged firm (p. 216).

  49There are three broad transaction                  costs involved.      First, it will be costly if not impossible            for


the parties to think about             all the possible     future     contingencies.     Second,      it will be costly for the


parties to negotiate         and specify     all those contingencies         in a written     contract.     Third,     monitoring

and enforcing      the contract     will be costly,      especially    if enforcement        is by a third party such as a


Court      that possesses   much worse information             about    the transaction        than the parties themselves

  501n contrast     to Hart and Tirole,          these investment       costs are not subject           to profit-sharing,     even


under integration.



  51Bolton      and Whinston,      1991, 211.



  52The intuition     is simpler in a bilateral         rather than a multilateral           setting.    So consider     a special


bilateral    case of Bolt on and Whinston.             Both   downstream         firms are under a common            ownership,


what they dub horizontal          integration.     Assume      that V2(12,s)      = O for all values of 12 and S. So the


only relevant investment        decision   is choosing        11, and ex-post      trade will always take place.             When


the upstream      and downstream        assets are under separate            ownership,      the downstream         unit’s gross


payoff to investing is ~.       Since the downstream           firm receives only 50 cents for every dollar of social


value it creates, there is underinvestment.



  53There is no inefficiency        in the trading        decisions.     Rather,     the increase        in investment       by the


integrated     downstream     firm Da raises vi and so leads to more occasions                          in which vi > Vj and


there is only one unit of the input.          The reduction          in investment     by the remaining          non-inte~ated


downstream       firm Dj reinforces     this effect.



  54As noted in an earlier note, the Wall Street Journal estimated                       that the Great Northern              prop-


erties contained     500 million tons of ore, an estimate              thought     imprecise     by industry      observers.     In


1906, the year the Hill lease was signed, the entire Lake Superior region, which included                            the Mesabi

  74“The       Enhancement       of Lake Ore Values ,“ The Iron Age, April 19, 1906, 1340.                      The editors of


The Iron Age commented            that discussion of the transaction          from time to time had been a significmt


stock market factor.       The editors referred specifically        to the stipulation      of an 80 cent royalty and the


guaranteed       minimum    tonnage.    In the journal’s     September       20, 1906 edition,       the editors commented


that “although       it would be premature         to consider     the pending     arrangement         a ‘contract,’    it.. long


has been such in effect because            the Hill interests     [have] refused to entertain         proposals      from other


potential      suitors. “ “The Lake Superior       Ore Situation,”         The Iron Age, 742.



     The consummation            of the deal was not a certainty,            however.      Stories    periodically     reported


hitches or breakdowns         in negotiations.     The Iron Age, May 31, 1906; “Hitch in Ore Lease to Steel

event candidates       but they did not produce            statistically     significant    results for the Great Northern


Preferred      or US Steel, possibly     because the reports of negotiation                breakdowns     could be interpreted


as posturing      by the parties for bargaining           benefit.     As part of the Eckbo-Stillman              methodology,


these event candidates         were therefore     not considered       as events.



   75These certificates     were not created until after the lease was signed, and so they cannot be used


in the earlier analysis.

   77This leakage should not be surprising,              given the need for meetings            between the participants         to


hammer      out terms of the agreement.



     For example,       the Wall    Street     Journal     headlined        on Thursday,       October     4, 1906,    “Hill   Ore


Properties:      Announcement       of Terms a Question           of a Few Days Only.”            (p.    4).   This followed    on


reports    earlier in the week on the progress            of the deal.       The lease terms were formally            announced


on Friday, October       5, at 4 pm. So this news was available to the market for its half day of trading


on Saturday.       “Ore Ded     Closed,”     Wall Street Journal,          October    6, 1906, p. 1.



   78Specifically,   they allowed the true event response to occur on one of three days, so the event-date


uncertainty      was limited    to a three-day        period.    They then compared            the results from estimating

Great Northern     and related properties.      We do know, however,         that US Steel developed        eight mines


on the Hill lands, and other reports indicate        a conservative     development       cost of $1 million per mine.


We consider our estimated        additional   expenditures     of $4 million conservative        since US Steel clearly


made exploration       expenditures   throughout     the leased lands, and not merely on these eight mines.

 115One difference      between   the character       of the leases was that a few of these leases were entered


into as a partial     joint   venture    so that the royalty       consisted     of a percentage      of the ore mined.

the Great Northern       Ore Properties,     but it may have been a necessary            innovation      because many of

annual escalation     clause to be “absolutely        unprecedented       in the Lake ore trade,”      an above market


rate with the “only reasonable          explanation     [being] that the Steel Corporation            desired to prevent


this ore either from being mined and sold to independent                   producers,    thus possibly    depressing    the


price of ore, or from being utilized by the Hill interests to build up a new and dangerous                    competitor


in the iron and steel business. ” Report         of the Commissioner,           Part I, 48. Finally, the Department


of Justice   argued    the royalty      was “unprecedentedly        large”     when filing its brief on the issue of


anticompetitive     intent.   US Government         Brief, United States vs. United States Steel, Filed 1912 in

 119During the early years of the lease, US Steel fell behind on its guaranteed                              minimums     obligation,


but ultimately      caught up to receive full value before cancellation                   of the lease in 1915. “Ore Mining

relied upon the economic           incentives   established       by the principal        terms of the lease to motivate           US


Steel to invest adequately          in the property,      the lease also include           specific obligations        for continued


exploration    including    minimum drilling requirements.                “The Great Northern           Output ,“ The Iron Age,

overall incentive     structure.      Great Northern        Iron Ore Properties,              Annual    Report      of the Trustees

Properties],     however    moderate,      are more than guesses .“ Furthermore,           the uncertainty      associated


with new explorations           was substantial.     “If one in fifty of the explorations       undertaken     on lands of

that the bulk of the iron ore in the United               States that can be carried           at reasonable   freights   to


advantageous      assembling       points for fuel and ore is known today. ”            “The   Transfer of the Hill Ore


Lands ,“ The Iron Age, October             11, 1906, 950. Although       the cost of transportation        is a significant


factor, the parties also had to consider international            ore discoveries.     For example,     a major discovery


of Cuban ore in 1907 was described           as the most important       ore discovery    since the Mesabi range itself


in 1891. “The New Cuban Iron Ore Deposit,”                 The Iron Age, August         15, 1907,438.     Unsurprisingly,


the enhancement        in lake ore values signaled by the Hill Ore Lease accelerated                  the search for new


foreign   supplies   of ore.      “Heavy   Iron Ore Imports       to the United       States in 1910,”     The Iron Age,

have generated      diseconomies,     however.

 154The Trustees for the Great Northern              Iron ore Properties         reported     new leases each year in the


annual report.      In 1917, the Trustees         commented        that plans for the wholly        undeveloped     mining


lands had not yet been determined.           Great Northern         Iron Ore Properties,        Eleventh Annual Report

the years 1918 through         1927 make no mention           of additional     development     or leases of undeveloped


territories.
