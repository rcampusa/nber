                                           ABSTRACT


       The purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of mental health and substance

abuse treatment in reducing crimes committed by juveniles. The observed high correlations between

crime, substance abuse and poor mental health suggests that factors which reduce substance abuse

and improve mental health may also be effective in reducing criminal activities. This paper uses

detention data in conjunction with substance abuse and mental health treatment data for youth

enrolled in the Colorado state foster care program. We analyze the impact of treatment in delaying

or preventing this group of at-risk youth from engaging in criminal behavior. Results show a

negative effect, i.e., longer duration before detention, for youth who receive treatment and for youth

in areas with high treatment rates.

1. INTRODUCTION

       Criminal behaviors are highly prevalent among adolescents. In 2000, teenagers aged 13

to 19 accounted for 10 percent of the population, but 25.8 percent of all arrests, 23.8 percent of

arrests for violent crime, and 40 percent of arrests for property crime (FBI, 2000). There is a

large body of literature examining the determinants of juvenile crime, which concludes that

factors such as gender, education, socio-economic status, and family environment are all strong

correlates of criminal behavior. Two factors, substance abuse and mental illness, have received

less attention in the crime literature, but are also potentially important. This paper examines the

effectiveness of mental health and substance abuse treatment in reducing crimes committed by

juveniles.

       A number of studies have shown that youth with substance abuse or mental health

disorders consistently have higher offending rates than those without disorders (Elliott and

Huizinga, 1984; Elliott and Huizinga, 1989; Elliott et al.,1989; Elliott et al.,1986). For example,

Vander Stoep et al. (1997) show that youth enrolled in a public mental health system had three

times as many police referrals to the juvenile justice system as those in the general child

population. Others have shown higher rates of violence and aggression among youth with

mental health problems (Ellickson et al.,1997; Arseneault et al.,2000). Some evidence suggests

that mental illness contributes in part to youths’ illegal behavior (Loeber et al.,1998; Lynam,

1996; Loeber et al., 2000; Link and Stueve, 1995).

       Similarly, a number of studies have shown that children in the juvenile justice system

experience substantially higher rates of mental health and substance abuse disorders than youth

in the general population (Garland et al.,2001; Randall et al.,1999; Myers et al.,1990;

Wasserman et al., 2002; Friedman et al., 1996). For example, Wasserman et al. (2002) studied
past-month mental health diagnoses among a group of male youth in secure placement facilities

and found expectably high rates of disruptive diagnoses (33 percent), but also high rates of

substance abuse diagnoses (50 percent), anxiety disorders (20 percent) and mood disorders (10

percent). By comparison, estimates for youth ages 18 and under from the nationally

representative National Comorbidity Survey show a much lower past year prevalence of

substance abuse disorders (11 percent), but similar rates of anxiety disorders (25 percent) and

mood disorders (13 percent). The use of different instruments and survey time frames across

studies makes comparisons difficult, but a review of impairment studies among general

population youth reported the median rate of any disorder to be 15 percent (Roberts, et al., 1998).

       Studies of substance abuse and crime, whether violent or nonviolent, show a strong

positive relationship (see Miczek et al.,1994, and Forrest and Gordon, 1990 for reviews of the

literature). Regarding violent crime, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (1998) states that a higher

proportion of violent male inmates in local jails report drinking at the time of the offense than

property crime inmates. Among all state prisoners under the influence of alcohol at the time of

the offence (about 33% of prisoners), the average blood alcohol content (BAC) is 0.27, which is

almost 3 times that of the legal limit for driving under the influence. In comparison, the average

BAC for intoxicated drivers involved in fatal accidents is about 0.17 (BJS 1998). Other studies

comparing violent and non-violent criminals also find high rates of alcohol use among violent

offenders (Roslund and Larson, 1979; Myers, 1982; Myers, 1986).

       In considering violence by youths, Rossow et al. (1999) and Bernburg and Thorlindsson

(1999) show that when violence is measured as a specific act, such as beating or threatening to

beat someone or having been in a fight with a weapon, frequent intoxication will lead to

increased violence, as will the use of marijuana or other drugs. Salts and Lindholm (1995) find



                                                     2
that alcohol and marijuana use are highly correlated with increased violent behaviors in both

black and white adolescent males. Similar findings hold for teens of both genders when

examining drug use and violence in school (Furlong et al., 1997).

       It is important to note that the studies showing the high correlation between mental

illness, substance use, aggression, and crime do not establish causality. There could exist

unobserved individual, familial, or situational confounders driving these relationships (see Fagan

1990 for a review of the theories on intoxication and aggression). However, if having a mental

illness or substance abuse disorder causes crime, for example, due to aggression or lack of

impulse control, then targeting the disorder through health care treatment may reduce the

likelihood of subsequent offense and contact with the juvenile justice system. As a result,

increased availability of mental health and substance use treatment programs may be an effective

means by which to reduce crime. Among substance users, if consumption directly causes crime,

then another way to lower crime would be to lower consumption. Indeed, a number of studies

have shown that crime can be reduced by raising price of drugs or alcohol (Chaloupka and

Saffer, 1992; Cook and Moore, 1993; Markowitz, 2000; DeSimone, 2001; Markowitz, 2001).

       Using data on a group of at-risk teenagers in the Colorado child welfare system, we

examine the effectiveness of mental health and substance abuse treatment in reducing juvenile

crimes. This study also focuses on the effectiveness of increased access to treatment for

substance abuse and mental illness and higher alcohol prices in reducing crime. As described in

detail below, we focus on improved access to treatment and higher alcohol prices since policy

makers can easily manipulate the demand for treatment and the demand for alcohol through

policy changes, for example, through changes in public health insurance programs or higher

excise taxes on alcohol.



                                                    3
       Using duration models to examine the determinants of the time spent out of detention, we

find that mental health and substance abuse treatment reduce detention hazards for all offenses

and violent offenses, as do higher prices for alcohol. The effect of alcohol prices is particularly

strong among violent offenses. Increased availability of treatment services will also lower

detention hazards for all offences, but appear to have no effect on violent offenses.

       The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the relevant literature. Section 3

addresses the data and methods used in the study, while Section 4 reports the results. We

conclude with Section 5.



2. RELEVANT LITERATURE

       There has been very little research examining the effectiveness of mental health treatment

in preventing crime by youths, although one form of intensive treatment, multisystemic therapy

(MST), has been shown to have beneficial effects and reduce rates of subsequent arrests,

psychiatric symptomatology, and drug use for youth with serious antisocial behavior (Henggeler,

1994; Henggeler et al., 1996). The MST intervention provides highly coordinated and organized

services whereby therapists involve parents, teachers, and friends to focus on environmental

change. Although MST has been tested in randomized trials, thereby dealing with the problem

of sample selection, these studies have been limited to small study populations with serious

disorders in controlled environments. Broader effectiveness of less intensive mental health

services on youth crime has not been established.

       There are however, a number of studies focusing on substance abuse treatment in

reducing crime, but this literature applies mostly to adults. There are a number of different kinds

of treatment programs for substance abuse, although most evaluation studies have focused on



                                                     4
four primary types: methadone maintenance, therapeutic communities, outpatient drug free

programs, and civil commitment programs. Methadone maintenance programs provide

methadone to drug-dependent individuals as an oral substitute for heroin. These types of

programs seem to be successful in reducing both drug consumption and crime (Anglin and Hser,

1990). For example, Hser et al. (1988) show that for heroin addicts, time spent involved in

property crimes decreased from 18 percent of the time when not in treatment to 11 percent

during treatment. Hunt et al. (1984) compared clients at a methadone maintenance clinic with

narcotic users who were not in treatment. They find that those in treatment are less involved in

burglary, robbery and drug dealing. Maddux and Desmond (1979) find that crime rates in San

Antonio, Texas decreased as methadone treatment rates increased, and that crime rates increased

when budget cutbacks forced the premature discharge of patients.

       Therapeutic communities are residential drug and alcohol treatment facilities designed

with the goal of helping the individual maintain a drug-free lifestyle. Programs include

encounter group therapy, and education sessions. In a study of one such community, DeLeon et

al. (1979) tracked males who entered the Phoenix House program in 1970-1971, and found that

the percent arrested fell from 72 prior to treatment to 41 after treatment. DeLeon (1984) shows

similar reductions.

       Outpatient drug-free programs, which provide counseling and training in social skills,

seem to be less effective in reducing crime than other types of programs. Hubbard et al.

(1984)report that the same proportion of clients engaged in illegal activities before and after

treatment.

       In a more general study that does not focus on a specific treatment, Saffer et al. (2001)

look at the impact of state-level expenditures for drug treatment facilities on illicit drug



                                                      5
consumption and finds that higher levels of expenditures are associated with reduced drug use.

These expenditures include money spent on hospital facilities operated by state or local

governments, and payments to private facilities. Saffer (2001) examine the impact of state-level

expenditures for drug control activities on crime. Drug control activities include police, courts,

prosecution, public defense, education, and drug treatment. He finds that states which spend

more per capita on drug control activity have lower arrests, lower reported property damage and

fewer individuals selling drugs.

       Jofre-Bonet and Sindelar (2002) also examine the impact of unspecified types of drug

treatment programs in reducing crimes. This study follows a sample of inner-city drug users

through treatment for drug and alcohol addiction, and relates the changes in drug use to changes

in income-generating crimes. They find that reductions in drug use are strongly related to

reduction in crime, and suggest that treatment which lowers drug use may be an effective tool for

reducing crime.

       Finally, a number of researchers have examined the effectiveness of civil commitment

programs. Typically, a drug addict will be ordered by the court to complete one of these

programs as an alternative to prison. McGlothlin, et al. (1977) compared addicts who completed

a court ordered program to those addicts who did not complete the court ordered program.

Results show the former group reduced their criminal activity by 18.6 percent as compared to a

6.7 percent reduction by the latter group. Van Steel et al. (1994) look at recidivism to the

criminal justice system for criminals who entered Wisconson’s Treatment Alternative Program

(TAP) over a one year period. They find that offenders who completed TAP were less likely to

be rearrested during the follow-up period than offenders who did not complete TAP. Sealock et

al. (1997) use data from offending youths assigned to substance abuse treatment in a resident



                                                     6
facility in Maryland. Results show that youths in residential treatment facilities were no less

likely to be arrested during the follow-up period than those not receiving treatment. However,

the treatment youths remained arrest-free longer.

       In short, substance abuse treatment programs appear to be effective in lowering crime.

However, the existing literature tends to focus on limited samples of adults or restricted

geographic areas. The studies primarily fall into two main types: those which look at rates of

criminal behavior by substance abusing individuals before and after treatment, and those

comparing a control group of criminals to a treatment group of criminals. One drawback to the

first type of study design is that it is difficult to attribute behavioral changes to the program or

the passage of time. Both types may also suffer from biases in sample selection, and the results

may not be applicable to a larger youth population.



3. Methods

   3.1. Data

       The above literature review suggests an empirical model where crime is determined in

part by drug and alcohol consumption and poor mental health. If treatment for substance abuse

or mental health problems is successful, then such treatment may also reduce criminal activities.

We test this hypothesis by estimating a model of crime for a group of at-risk teenagers who are

in the Colorado child welfare system (i.e. foster care). We then test a separate model for violent

crimes only. The child welfare population is an interesting and relevant population to study

because the majority of the children in foster care programs across the country come from

abusive or neglectful homes, and as a result, these children exhibit more chronic medical,

emotional, and psychological problems than other youth (DosReis et al. 2001). These children



                                                       7
are considered at-risk for criminal behaviors because of the link between mental health and

substance abuse problems and crime as discussed above.

       Our sample consists of youth in the child welfare system over a three-year period. The

child welfare encounter data come from the Colorado Division of Child Welfare and contain

records for all youth who received child welfare services in Colorado between July 1994 and

June 1997. These data include date of entry, age, gender, race, ethnicity, and county of

residence. Our sample consists of youth between the ages of 13 and 18 who were in the child

welfare system or entered it during the study period.

       Data on crime come from the Department of Youth Corrections (DYC), which collects

information on all youths who are detained. Crime in this study is measured by youth who are

arrested and specifically detained by the Colorado Division of Youth Corrections. Their cases

are not necessarily adjudicated and may not lead to sanctions. Therefore, our measure of crime

is more restrictive than arrests, but less restrictive than sanctioning or commitment. The DYC

data contain date of detention and release, as well as offense type. A wide range of offenses is

recorded in the system, including violent crimes, property crimes, drug crimes, sex crimes, minor

crimes, and status offenses. We exclude detentions due to status offenses. For analyses of

violent crime, we use detentions for murder, rape, assault, and robbery offenses. In our sample,

20.1 percent of youths are detained by the department of corrections at least once during the

three-year sample period, and 3.2 percent are detained for violent offenses. When an individual

was observed to have multiple detentions, only the initial spell up to the first detention was

included in the analysis. Consequently, we do not address the issue of recidivism in this study.

       Children in foster care are entitled to benefits under Medicaid, and these benefits include

treatment for substance abuse and mental health problems. Medicaid claims and encounter data



                                                     8
provide the information on mental health and substance abuse treatment for the teenagers in our

sample.1 These data include dates of treatment service and treatment type. Treatment type

includes outpatient treatment (including individual and group therapy, crisis and evaluative

services, case management, day treatment programs) and services in therapeutic residential

treatment facilities.

        All datasets contain individual-level, encrypted identifiers. Teenagers in the child

welfare system during the study period were matched to their Medicaid and detention records

using the identifiers. The sample is composed of 6,073 youth. The mean characteristics of the

sample are shown in Table I.

    3.2. Measures

        Dependent Variable. Our dependent variables are indicators for whether a youth was

detained for any offense and whether a youth was detained for a violent offense only. Data for

each individual are aggregated to monthly discrete observations. Consequently, the detention

variable takes on a value of 1 if that individual was detained in the respective month and zero if

not. Similarly, we aggregate detention for violent offenses by month. Individuals are assumed

to occupy only two states, detention-free and detained. The transition rate from one state to the

other is the probability of leaving the detention-free state at any time period, given that the

individual is not detained up to that time period.




        1
            Services that are reimbursed through the state’s behavioral health managed care contracts are reported

using “encounter data,” while services reimbursed under fee-for-service contracts are reported using claims. The

Medicaid encounter and claims data were analyzed over a year after the state submission deadline, allowing time for

delayed records to be processed.


                                                               9
       Key Independent Variables. The provision of mental health and substance abuse

treatment is our primary explanatory variable of interest. Treatment is defined as equal to one if

the individual was treated in a given month and zero otherwise. Treatment includes outpatient

treatment or treatment in a therapeutic residential treatment facility. Any youth hospitalized as

an inpatient (in acute, general and psychiatric hospitals or state mental hospitals) is considered

censored at the time of admission as they are not at risk of being detained while in the hospital.

None of the treatment visits recorded in this data results from a court-ordered sentence.

       Estimating this model will show the propensity of treatment to reduce crime, although a

problem will arise if the decision to receive mental health or substance abuse treatment is

influenced by the same individual characteristics as the decision to commit a crime. In this case,

treatment will be endogenous and its coefficient will be biased. In order to correct for this

potential endogeneity, we use an estimation strategy which accounts for unobserved individual

heterogeneity (described below).

       A second method of avoiding the problems associated with the endogeneity of treatment

is to estimate a model of crime that substitutes for treatment those variables that are correlated

with treatment, but not crime directly. This is in the same spirit as the crime and substance use

papers by Cook and Moore (1993) and DeSimone (2001) that relate the prices of drugs and

alcohol directly to crime. In our case, ideally the price of treatment would serve as such a

variable given that a number of studies have shown that the demand for mental health and

substance abuse services is responsive to price (Frank and McGuire 2000). However, since all

children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid, the monetary price of treatment faced by each

individual is zero and does not vary. Instead, we use a measure of the full price of treatment,

which includes travel and waiting times. This can be represented by county-level treatment



                                                     10
rates, calculated as the proportion of the sample treated in the given month, that capture the

supply of treatment available. We expect that as county treatment rates rise, the full price of

treatment falls.2

         In a model where crime is determined in part by alcohol consumption, treatment may not

be the only determinant of alcohol consumption. A number of studies have shown that the

consumption of alcohol varies with its price (Leung and Phelps, 1993; Cook and Moore, 2000).

We include the price of beer in all models to gauge the effectiveness of higher beer prices in

reducing crime, holding treatment constant. Beer prices are available for a number of different

cities across Colorado. These data are published quarterly from the American Chamber of

Commerce Research Association. Each individual in the sample is assigned a beer price based

on the county of residence.

         Control Variables. Explanatory variables that do not change over time include

demographic variables. Age by category (age 13 to 14, age 15 to 16, and 17 or older) is defined

as the age when the individual is first observed, that is, at entry into the child welfare system.

We also control for race (whether the individual is white, black, with other races as the omitted

category) and for whether the individual is Hispanic or not.



    3.3. Estimation Strategy

         Duration models are used to examine the structural determinants of detention. These

models analyze the decision to make a transition from one discrete state to another. We estimate



         2
             Treatment rates are calculated based on the entire sample of youth, not just those detained by the

department of Youth Corrections. The county rate serves as a valid measure of availability of services since it is

unlikely that any one individual’s behavior will influence the county treatment rate.


                                                                11
the conditional probability that an individual observed in the first period (month) will be detained

in a subsequent period (month). In particular, we estimate the extent to which characteristics of

the individual, alcohol prices, and treatment affect the length of time spent detention-free.

Therefore, these methods will quantify the impact of changes in the determinants of detention on

the conditional probability of being detained. The starting hazard rate is the probability of being

detained in period t, conditional on not being detained prior to t. The starting hazard should rise

and fall over time in response to different stimuli. In particular, the results will show how

changes in prices of alcohol and the provision of treatment affect length of time an individual

remains detention-free.

        We model duration using several specifications. The unit of analysis is a spell, which

may be right-censored. Right-censoring occurs if we do not observe an individual being

detained during the study period, if the youth is treated as an inpatient in a hospital, or turns 18.

Within each spell we observe from 1 to 36 spell months. Conditional exit probabilities in each

spell month depend on observed fixed and time-varying covariates. We use maximum likelihood

estimation whereby the log likelihood is given by Eq. (1):

                                 n
        (1)             log L = ∑ {yi log h( Xi ) + (1 − yi ) log[1 − H ( Xi )]},
                                i=1

where yit is an indicator variable equal to one if person i exits the state during the interval [t-1,t],

h(.) is the density function and H(.) is the cumulative distribution function. The first term is the

contribution of an individual who is detained during the study period and the second term is the

contribution of an individual who is not detained.




                                                         12
       We use a semi-parametric estimation procedure, the complementary log-log specification

of Prentice and Gloeckler (1978).3 This is a semi-parametric model, where we estimate a fully

non-parametric baseline hazard with a separate parameter for each duration interval. That is, we

assume the form of the baseline hazard is a step function with a step at each interval. Unlike a

parametric approach, such as a Weibull specification, in this method it is unnecessary to make

parametric assumptions concerning the hazard’s time dependency that can lead to inconsistent

coefficient estimates if the parameterization fits the data badly.

       In addition, we estimate a model that incorporates unmeasured heterogeneity, also called

frailty. Unmeasured heterogeneity leads to overstated duration dependence (i.e., underestimates

of the extent to which the hazard rate increases with duration) and attenuates the magnitude of

the impact of covariates on the hazard rate (Lancaster, 1990; Kiefer, 1988). Without accounting

for unobserved heterogeneity, the results may be biased. We incorporate a gamma mixing

distribution to capture unobserved heterogeneity as proposed by Meyer (1990).

4. RESULTS

       Table II presents the effect of treatment, beer prices and other covariates on the duration

hazard. The result table shows exponentiated coefficients or hazard ratios. Values greater than

one indicate that the covariate increases the exit probability (increase the likelihood of being

detained) while values less than one decrease the exit probability. Column 1 shows that black

youth have significantly higher probabilities of exiting into detention (i.e., their detention-free

spells are shorter) than other races, as do Hispanic youth and youth who are older. In addition,

males have higher exit probabilities than females. The demographic patterns are consistent with

evidence from FBI arrest data (Snyder, 1998). The key policy variables in this analysis also



       3
           It is implemented using pgmhaz command in Stata (Version 7).

                                                           13
behave as predicted. Youth who receive mental health or substance abuse treatment have

significantly lower probabilities of exiting into detention (i.e., their spells are longer). Receiving

treatment is associated with a 72 percent decline in the detention hazard. Beer prices also have

significant, negative effects on exit into detention, lowering the hazard by 42 percent for every

dollar increase in the beer price. Note that a dollar increase in the price of a six-pack of beer

represents a 24 percent increase in the average price.

       Column 2 uses county treatment rates, the proxy for price of treatment, rather than

individual treatment. Coefficients on the demographic variables are similar to Column 1. The

hazard rate is less than one and is statistically significant. This implies that youth in counties

with higher treatment rates have lower conditional exit probabilities consistent with the

theoretical model’s prediction that increased availability of treatment improves access and

lowers crime. The coefficient on beer prices remains statistically significant and implies a lower

probability of exit (a longer period detention free).

       Columns 3 and 4 of Table II present estimates from models that incorporate unmeasured

heterogeneity. We compare the models with and without heterogeneity terms by testing the

significance of the variance parameter in the gamma distribution and by the likelihood ratio test.

We find that introducing the heterogeneity terms improves the model fit. The estimated Gamma

variance has a t-value of 5.17 (p-value <0.01) and 4.53 (p-value <0.01) in each model, while the

likelihood ratio statistic for testing the models is 38.05 (χ2<0.01) and 28.01 respectively

(χ2<0.01).

       The magnitude of the effect of individual treatment is slightly greater in the model with

heterogeneity. Having received treatment lowers the hazard by 75 percent. Omitting the

heterogeneity terms leads to attenuation of the treatment effect. The demographic patterns are



                                                        14
similar in the two models. Results that including unobserved heterogeneity show that males and

youth of older ages have higher detention exit rates. In both models, beer prices reduce the

detention hazard.

       Similarly, in column 4, when accounting for unobserved heterogeneity, treatment rates

and beer prices both are statistically significant and lower the probability of exit into detention.

In all four of the above models, the coefficients on the duration dummy variables (not shown)

indicate that the pattern of variation of the baseline hazard with duration is not monotonic.

       The effect of covariates on the hazard of detention for a violent offense are reported in

Table III. We find that receipt of treatment has statistically significant attenuating effect on

detention hazards (column 1), while beer prices have a larger effect than in previous models.

Treatment is associated with a 75 percent decline in the hazard, while a dollar increase in beer

prices is associated with an 82 percent decline. In contrast to previous models, in models of

violent offenses only, the effect of treatment rates is no longer significant (column 2). The effect

of beer prices remains statistically significant in column 2.

       As for all offences, we find that introducing the heterogeneity term improves the model

fit of violent offences. The estimated Gamma variance has a t-value of 2.83 (p-value <0.01) and

2.45 (p-value <0.01) in each model, while the likelihood ratio statistic for testing the models is

13.04 (χ2<0.01) and 9.07 respectively (χ2<0.01). Models of detention for violent offenses that

incorporate unmeasured heterogeneity also show negative effects of mental health and substance

treatment and beer prices on the detention hazard for violent offenses (column 3). In contrast to

models of all offense types models, the effect of county treatment rates is not significant for

violent offenses, although the effect of beer prices remains negative and significant (column 4).

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

       This study examines the effectiveness of mental health and substance abuse treatment in

reducing detention rates for juveniles in the Colorado child welfare system. This is a important

group of youth to study since they are particularly at risk for engaging in criminal behaviors.

The majority of the children in foster care programs across the country come from abusive

homes and as a result, these children exhibit more chronic medical, emotional, and psychological

problems than other youth. Indeed, our analysis shows high detention rates among this group.

Consistent with other youth studies we also find that among youth in child welfare those who are

male, black, Hispanic and older were likely to be detained earlier than other youth.

       Using duration analyses, we find that substance abuse and mental health treatment can be

used effectively to delay or prevent youth detention. Specifically, the analysis finds that

individuals who receive treatment have lower probabilities of being detained for any offence.

Similarly, those youth who live in areas with a greater supply of treatment services also have a

lower probability of exiting into detention. Accounting for the unobserved heterogeneity makes

the magnitude of these effects larger. Also consistent with our theory, higher beer prices lower

the detention hazard.

       In examining the determinants of detention for violent offences, we show that individuals

who receive treatment have lower probabilities of being detained, however, the supply of

treatment in the area does not impact the length of time out of detention. The effect of higher

beer prices is negative and particularly strong. Given the often cited high correlation between

alcohol use and aggression, this last result is not surprising and implies that higher beer prices

will reduce both consumption and violent criminal behaviors.




                                                     16
       The results of out study are limited by the fact that we can not identify the effectiveness

of specific mental health or substance abuse treatment components. In addition, the analysis is

conducted on a specialized sample of foster care youth in Colorado and results may not be

generalizable. However, this group has a high rate of criminal involvement and may be

relatively easy to target for public policies because they are already in a public system. Results

of this study suggest that expansion of health services targeted at these youth may be effective at

reducing crime. For violent crime, where the literature shows that substance abuse plays a

significant role, stricter alcohol-regulatory policies may also be highly effective.
