Factor Incomes in Global Value Chains: The Role of Intangibles

                                         ABSTRACT

Recent studies document a decline in the share of labour and a simultaneous increase in the share
of residual (‘factorless’) income in national GDP. We argue the need for study of factor incomes
in cross-border production to complement country studies. We define a GVC production function
that tracks the value added in each stage of production in any country-industry. We define a new
residual as the difference between the value of the final good and the payments to all tangibles
(capital and labour) in any stage. We focus on GVCs of manufactured goods and find the residual
to be large. We interpret it as income for intangibles that are (mostly) not covered in current
national accounts statistics. We document decreasing labour and increasing capital income shares
over the period 2000-14. This is mainly due to increasing income for intangible assets, in
particular in GVCs of durable goods. We provide evidence that suggests that the 2000s should be
seen as an exceptional period in the global economy during which multinational firms benefitted
from reduced labour costs through offshoring, while capitalising on existing firm-specific
intangibles, such as brand names, at little marginal cost.

1. Introduction

The long-run decline in the income share of labour in GDP since the 1980s is one of the most
debated macro-economic trends in recent years. Various studies have documented that the trend is
widely shared across industries and countries. While it has been particularly strong in the US, it
has also been observed for other advanced countries, and perhaps surprisingly, also for various
emerging and poor countries.1 Recent research zooms in on potential drivers. Barkai (2017) and
Karabarbounis and Neiman (2018) document a large increase in so-called ‘factorless income’ in
the US: a residual that remains after subtracting payments to labour and cost of capital from GDP.
Karabarbounis and Neiman (2018) argue that it can be alternatively interpreted as economic
profits, arising from firms’ pricing power; as income that accrues to forms of capital that are
unmeasured in current national accounts statistics or as a wedge between imputed rental rates for
assets and the rate that firms perceive when making the investment. They argue that it is likely a
combination of the three, concluding that the latter is most promising in explaining long-term
trends.in U.S. GDP income shares.


So far, the discussion on factor incomes is around shares in GDP of single countries. This paper
argues the need for a multi-country approach in better understanding the drivers of increasing
‘factorless income’. In today’s world, goods are typically produced and distributed in intricate
networks with multiple stages of production and extensive shipping of intermediate goods, services
and information. We refer to this as global value chain (GVC) production.2 So-called ‘factory-free
goods producers’ like Apple provide an iconic example: they sell and organise the production of
manufacturing goods without being engaged in the actual fabrication process (Bernard and Fort,
2015; Fontagné and Harrison, 2017). They capture a major part of the value as compensation for
provision of software and designs, market knowledge, intellectual property, systems integration
and cost management, as well as a strong brand name. These assets are key in the coordination of
the GVC and in the creation of value. Yet, we have no way to directly infer the income that accrues
to these ‘intangibles’ due to their non-physical nature such that their use cannot be attributed to a

geographically location. In contrast, tangible assets (such as machinery) and labour have a physical
presence and their use is recorded in the national account statistics of the countries where they are
located. A further complication is the fact that GVC production opens up the possibility for profit-
shifting of multinational enterprises across countries.3 More generally, increased cross-border
sharing of intangibles is undermining the very notion of country-level factor incomes and GDP.
This problem of income attribution is not new and has been discussed in the context of the system
of national accounts for quite some time. The twenty-six percent jump in Irish GDP in 2015
brought this ‘statistical problem’ also to public light and scrutiny.4 Guvenen et al. (2017) find that
US multinationals have increasingly shifted income from intellectual property rights to foreign
jurisdictions with lower taxes, suggesting an understatement of the labour share decline in U.S.
GDP.

The presence of GVC production suggests that there is a need to complement conventional factor
income studies (at the country-industry level) by study of global value chains (that cross borders).
Factor income analysis in GVCs will not be affected by the attribution problem, and offers a unique
opportunity to track the payments to intangible assets. This paper is the first to provide such a
study at the macro-economic level.5 To fix ideas, consider a firm selling shoes using local labour
L and tangible capital K. This requires two activities: fabrication and marketing. Both activities
require firm-specific knowledge B (e.g. market intelligence on consumers’ preferences for
particular types of shoes). Next suppose the fabrication stage is offshored to country 2. In this case
the (vertically integrated) production function is: Y=F(K1, L1, K2, L2, B). To infer payments to B,

  Through profit shifting, including transfer pricing and other tax strategies, transnational companies can
allocate the largest share of their profits to subsidiaries (Dischinger et al., 2014). A firm might not be fully
free to do so, as it is bound by cost-pricing rules. Yet, in practice profit shifting is abundant, involving
complex IP arrangements, and this practice is not restricted to affiliated firms only, see Neubig and Wunsch-
Vincent (2017). Tørsløv, Wier, and Zucman (2018) estimate that close to forty percent of multinational
profits are shifted to tax havens globally each year.

discussions in (inter)national statistical organizations.

  Studying factor incomes in GVCs has a much longer history in case study research going back at least to
Gereffi (1994), see Kaplinsky (2000) for an overview. Studies in that tradition are typically more qualitative
and analyse how interactions between buyers and sellers in the chain are governed and coordinated. In a
seminal case study, Dedrick et al. (2010) apply the residual income approach to the value of an Apple iPod,
using technical ‘teardown’ reports to trace inputs. They find that Apple retains up to halve of the iPod value.
                                                       3
we calculate residual profits in the chain as the sales of a good minus the payments to tangible
factor inputs needed in any stage of production:


                               rB = pY – Σn wn Ln – Σn rn Kn ,

with wn the wage rate and rn the rental rate of tangible capital used in country n. pY is the output
value of the final good. rB is measured as the residual after subtracting the sum of payments to
labour L and to tangibles K across all countries involved in production. We will refer to this
residual as payment for intangible assets in the GVC.

It should be noted that, given the residual approach, we measure the combined income to all
intangible assets used in a chain and do not attempt to measure the stock of intangibles and their
rates of return separately. In seminal work, Corrado et al. (2005, 2009) showed how stock estimates
for certain types of intangibles that are currently not treated as investment in the national accounts
(such as market research, advertising, training and organisational capital) could be derived. This
requires data on intangibles’ investments as well as additional information on their depreciation
rates and asset prices. Corrado et al. (2013) provide updated analysis, expanding measurement to
a large set of countries. Yet, the industry detail currently provided is too aggregate for our
purposes. At this stage we therefore remain agnostic about the type of intangibles, their separate
stocks and returns. This is left for future research. Our main aim is to establish the overall
importance of payments to intangibles compared to tangible assets and labour.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we outline our GVC accounting
methodology. The main measurement challenge is the fact that GVCs are not directly observable
in the data and need to be inferred from information on the linkages between the various stages of
production. We will build upon the approach to measuring value added in global production
networks as introduced by Los et al. (2015). They showed how one can derive the value added
contributions of country-industries in a given GVC. This allows for a decomposition of the ex-
factory value of a final product into the value added in each stage of production. We use
information from so-called global input-output tables that contain (value) data on intermediate
products that flow across industries as well as across countries. These are published in the World
Input-Output Database (WIOD, see Timmer et al., 2015). This is combined with information on


                                                   4
factor incomes in each stage as discussed in section 3. We collected additional information from
national accounts statistics on industry-level wages and investment in tangible assets in a wide set
of countries. We built capital stocks using the perpetual inventory method and imputed the income
payments to tangible capital by multiplying with a standard Hall-Jorgenson type of rental rate.
Crucially, we use an ex-ante rate of return such that a residual remains.

Throughout the paper we will study factor income distribution in the global production of
manufacturing goods. Worldwide consumption of manufactured goods (at purchasers’ prices)
makes up about a quarter of world GDP (in 2000). This includes value that is added in
manufacturing industries as well as non-manufacturing, such as in transport, communication,
finance and other business services, and also raw materials production. These indirect
contributions will be explicitly accounted for by using information on input-output linkages across
sectors. Section 4 provides main results on trends in factor incomes in GVCs over the period 2000
to 2014 (the begin and end points of the analysis are dictated by data availability in the WIOD
2016 release). Our main finding is that the share of intangibles in the value of final goods has
increased, in particular in the period 2000-07. Its share is generally (much) higher than the tangible
capital income share. This is found at the aggregate as well as for more detailed manufacturing
product groups. Nevertheless, there is clear heterogeneity in the pace of the increase. For some
non-durable products such as textiles or food the intangible share in GVCs increased only
marginally. In contrast the share increased rapidly in durable goods’ GVCs such as of machinery
and electronic equipment products. We provide suggestive evidence that this variation is linked to
variation in the speed of international production fragmentation. Taking the results together, one
could consider the 2000s as an exceptional period in which global manufacturing firms benefitted
from reduced labour costs through offshoring, while capitalising on existing firm-specific
intangibles, such as brand names, at little marginal cost. Section 5 provides a discussion of the
robustness of the main results, concluding that the current system of national accounts is likely to
still miss out on a large range of intangible assets, confirming Corrado et al. (2005). Section 6
offers concluding remarks. The measurement framework puts high demand on the data and our
results should thus be seen as indicative only. This study is explorative and mainly aimed at
stimulating further thinking about the interrelatedness of factor incomes across industries and
countries.

2. Accounting for factor incomes in global value chains: method


In this section we outline our empirical method to slice up incomes in global value chains (GVCs).
The basic aim is to decompose the value of a final good into worldwide factor incomes. By
representing the global economy in an input-output account in the tradition of Leontief, we can
use his famous insight to map consumption value of products to value added in industries.6 We
first outline our basic accounting framework and intuition (section 2.1). Next, we outline how we
trace value added in production stages of the GVC building upon the method of Los et al. (2015)
(section 2.2). We extend this approach by including the distribution stage (section 2.3). This stage
is ignored in all previous input-output based studies. Yet, by overlooking distribution one might
miss out on up to half of incomes generated in GVCs. This is particularly the case for non-durable
goods where retailers capture a major part of the value in delivery from producer to consumer, as
shown in section 4. This way we are also much more likely to fully capture intangible income in
the production of goods, particularly in the case of factory-less goods producers (FGPs). In the
current U.S. statistical system FGPs might be classified in wholesaling, and their output is recorded
as a wholesale margin, rather than as manufacturing sales. See also contributions in Fontagné and
Harrison (2017) on this topic.


2.1 Preliminary notation and intuition
We illustrate our empirical approach in Figure 1. We distinguish three sets of activities in a global
value chain. These are activities in:
    - the distribution of the final product from factory to consumer (D). This includes transportation,
warehousing and retailing activities.
    - the final stage of factory production (F). This can be thought of as a low-value added activity
such as assembly, packaging or testing, but might also involve high value-added activities such as
placing an engine in a car body.


6
  This approach of mapping final demand to value added is also used in related settings by Johnson
and Noguera (2012), Valentinyi and Herrendorf (2008), and Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013).
It should be noted that this type of analysis does not depend, nor presumes, that the production process is
linear (“chain”). It is equally valid in any network configuration that can be described by individual stages
of production that are linked through trade. To stick with commonly used terms, we refer to all fragmented
production processes as “chains”, despite the linear connotation of this term.
                                                     6
      - all other stages of production (O). This might include the manufacturing of parts and
components as well as business services (e.g. legal advice, finance or consulting) and raw material
production (e.g. mining and agriculture).


The sum of value added across the production stages makes up the value of the product at basic
(ex factory) prices. When one adds the value added in the distribution stage plus (net) taxes payed
by the final consumer, one arrives at the value of a final product at purchasers’ prices (see first
pillar in Figure 1). Subsequently we decompose the value added in each stage into income
payments to labour, tangible and intangible assets (second pillar in Figure 1). Income to labour
and tangible assets can be tracked in the data, and we define income to intangible assets residually.

The three activity sets (D, F and O) are mutually exclusive and together cover all activities that
contribute to the value of the final product. More formally, let p be the consumer (purchaser’s)
price of a good (adjusted for net product taxes), Y the quantity consumed and Vx value added in
stage x then we can state the following accounting identity:


(1)             𝑝𝑌 ≡ 𝑉𝐷 + 𝑉𝐹 + 𝑉𝑂 .
                                                 7
In each activity factor inputs are being used and we will distinguish between labour (L), tangible
capital (K) and intangible capital (B) inputs. Using this notation, we can write the production
function of the final good as:


(2)            𝑌 = 𝑓( 𝐵𝐷 , 𝐾𝐷 , 𝐿𝐷 ;   𝐵𝐹 , 𝐾𝐹 , 𝐿𝐹 ;   𝐵𝑂 , 𝐾𝑂 , 𝐿𝑂 )
                       DISTRIBUTION    FINAL STAGE      OTHER STAGES



The corresponding cost equation is given by multiplying the factor quantities with their respective
prices:


(3)            𝑝𝑌 = ∑𝑥∈𝐹,𝑂,𝐷(𝑟𝑥𝐵 𝐵𝑥 ) + ∑𝑥∈𝐹,𝑂,𝐷(𝑟𝑥𝐾 𝐾𝑥 ) + ∑𝑥∈𝐹,𝑂,𝐷(𝑤𝑥 𝐿𝑥 )
                       INTAN CAPITAL           TAN CAPITAL           LABOUR



with w the wage rate and r the rental price for capital. This is our basic decomposition of the output
value of a final product into three elements: the income to intangible capital, to tangible capital
and to labour. Some of these variables are observable in the data, while others need to be imputed.
In brief, 𝑉𝑥 , 𝑤𝑥 𝐿𝑥 and 𝐾𝑥 can be observed for each stage, 𝑟𝑥𝐾 will be imputed based on an ex-ante
rate of return, and 𝑟𝑥𝐵 𝐵𝑥 will be derived residually in each stage as 𝑉𝑥 − 𝑟𝑥𝐾 𝐾𝑥 − 𝑤𝑥 𝐿𝑥 (see section
3 for more explanation). Our main variable of interest will be the income share of intangibles in
the GVC:
                                       ∑𝑥∈𝐹,𝑂,𝐷(𝑟𝑥𝐵 𝐵𝑥 )
(4)
                                              𝑝𝑌



to be compared with similarly derived shares for tangible capital and labour. The three shares
add to one by construction.


2.2 Factor incomes in production stages
Stages in GVCs can be inferred from information on the linkages between the various stages of
production. A GVC is defined for a country-industry where the final stage of production is taking
place, e.g. the GVC of cars finalised in the German transport equipment manufacturing industry.
We use information from so-called global input-output tables that contain (value) data on
                                                   8
intermediate products that flow across industries as well as across countries. An example is the
delivery of inputs from the steel industry in China to the automobile industry in Japan. More
formally, our decomposition method builds upon the approach outlined in Los, Timmer and de
Vries (2015). It is a multi-country extension of the method suggested by Leontief (1936).


Leontief started from the fundamental input-output identity which states that all products produced
must be either consumed or used as intermediate input in production. This is written as q=Aq+c,
in which q denotes a vector of industry-level gross outputs and c is a vector with final consumption
levels for the outputs of each of the industries. Both vectors contain SN elements, in which N stands
for the number of countries and S for the number of industries in each country. A denotes the
SNxSN matrix with input coefficients which describe how much intermediates are needed from
any country-industry to produce a unit of output. The identity can be rewritten as q=(I-A)-1c, in
which I represents an identity matrix. The matrix (I-A)-1 is famously known as the Leontief
inverse. It can be used to derive output that is generated in all stages of the production process of
one unit of a specific final product. To see this, let z be an SN column vector with a one for the
element representing say iPhones assembled in China, and all other elements are zero. Then Az is
the vector of intermediate inputs, both Chinese and foreign, that are assembled, such as the hard-
disk drive, battery and processors. But these intermediates need to be produced as well and A2z
indicates the intermediate inputs needed to produce Az. This continues until the mining and drilling
of basic materials such as metal ore, sand and oil required to start the production process. Summing
up across all stages, one derives the gross output levels for all SN country-industries generated in
the production of iPods by (I-A)-1z, since the summation over all rounds converges to this
expression.7


To find the value added by a particular factor, for example labour, we additionally need wages
paid per unit of output represented in an SNxSN diagonal matrix H. The elements in this matrix
are country- and industry-specific: one element contains the wages paid per dollar of output in the
Chinese electronics industry, for example. To find the income of all labour that is directly and



7
 This is under empirically mild conditions. See Miller and Blair (2009) for a good starting point on input-
output analysis.
                                                    9
indirectly involved in the production of a z, we multiply H by the total gross output value in all
stages of production given above such that


(5)             L=H(I-A)-1z.


A typical element in the SN vector L indicates the wages of labour employed in country i and
industry j in the production of z. A similar procedure can be followed to find the incomes of
tangible and intangible capital with a suitable chosen requirement matrix (see next section on data).
Following the logic of Leontief’s insight, the sum over incomes by all factors in all countries that
are involved in the production of this good will equal the output value of that product at basic
prices. Thus we have measures for production stages F and O in decomposition equation (3).


2.3 Factor incomes in the distribution stage
The Leontief method can be applied to decompose value added in various stages of production. It
remains silent on the value added in distribution of the final product to the consumer however.
This is due to the nature of the data used: the distribution sector is represented in input-output
tables as a so-called margin industry. This means that the goods bought by the distribution sectors
(to be resold) are not treated as intermediate inputs. The gross output of the distribution sector is
measured in terms of the ‘margin’, that is the value of goods sold minus the acquisition value of
those goods. Accordingly, we define the value added in the distribution stage by a margin to sales
ratio (m), such that:


(6)             𝑉𝐷 ≡ 𝑚(𝑝𝑌).


We use the factor shares in the wholesale and retailing industries to derive the factor
requirements in the distribution stage.

3. Data sources


For our empirical analysis we use three types of data: world input-output tables, information on
distribution margins and data on factor incomes of industries. The input-output tables and data on
labour compensation and value added are derived from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD),
2016 release and have been extensively described in Timmer et al. (2015). Important to note here
is that the WIOD contains data on 56 industries (of which 19 are manufacturing) in 43 countries
and a rest of the world region such that all value added in GVCs is accounted for. In this section
we provide more information on two new pieces of empirical information that are needed
additionally: the income shares of tangible (and intangible) capital and data on distribution
margins.


Capital income shares at the country-industry level
Gross value added (V) and labour compensation (wL) can be derived from national accounts
statistics (with appropriate adjustment for the income of self-employed) and this information is
taken from the WIOD. As in Karabarbounis and Neiman (2018) we impute the income to tangible
assets and derive intangible income as the residual for each industry i as :

(7)             𝑟𝑖𝐵 𝐵𝑖 ≡ 𝑉𝐴𝑖 − 𝑤𝑖 𝐿𝑖 − 𝑟𝑖𝐾 𝐾𝑖 .

Tangible asset income for industry i is derived through multiplying tangible capital stock 𝐾𝑖 with
an (ex-ante) rental price 𝑟𝑖𝐾 . According to neo-classical theory, the rental price (user cost) of capital
consist of four elements: depreciation, capital taxes (net of subsidies), (expected) capital gains and
a (net) nominal rate of return (Hall and Jorgenson, 1967). For want for data we abstain from capital
taxes in our empirical analysis. The rental price is then given by

(8)             𝑟𝑖𝐾 = (𝛿𝑖𝐾 + 𝜌𝑖𝐾 )𝑝𝑖𝐼

with depreciation rate 𝛿𝑖𝐾 , the real (net) rate of return 𝜌𝑖𝐾 and tangible investment price 𝑝𝑖𝐼 . The
rate of return is ex-ante such that a residual remains in (7) which is the income for intangible
capital. The rate of return reflects the opportunity cost of capital in the market. We set it to 4 per
cent for all tangible assets, following long standing practice (at least before the financial crisis in
2007). We show in additional robustness analysis that using time-varying rates based on

                                                   11
government bond yields, or other alternative, instead will have no significant impact on our main
results (reported upon in section 5).


Our definition of tangible capital assets follows the tangible asset boundary in the System of
National Accounts (SNA) 2008, including buildings, machinery, transport equipment, information
technology assets, communication technology assets, and other tangible assets. Country-industry
tangible asset stocks are derived from the EU KLEMS database December 2016 release (Jäger,
2016) for Australia, Japan and the United States and twelve major European countries (Austria,
Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain,
Sweden and the United Kingdom). For the other countries we only have stocks by industry, but
not by asset type. These countries are mostly reporting under the rules of SNA93 which means
that the industry-level asset stocks may include some intangible assets, most notably software.
They typically constitute a small share though, as most countries still reporting in SNA93 are poor.
Geometric depreciation rates for detailed asset types are taken from EU KLEMS. These rates take
into account the differences in the composition of capital assets both across countries, industries
as well as over time. We carefully distinguish between various data environments across countries.
The appendix in Chen et al. (2017) provides elaborate discussion on a country-by-country basis.


Value added in distribution stage
To measure the value that is added in the distribution stage, we need to have information on the
margin to sales ratios for final manufacturing goods (m). We derive this from the ratio of output
valued at basic and at purchaser’s prices. The purchaser’s price consists of the basic price plus
trade and transport margins in the handling of the product and any (net) product taxes. Put
otherwise, the margin is the difference between the price paid by the consumer and the price
received by the producer. Margins are calculated from information on final expenditures at
purchaser’s and basic prices as given in national supply and use tables. This data can be found for
most countries in the WIOD (under the heading of national SUTs). For China, Japan and the U.S.
only data at producer prices is given in WIOD however. We complemented this with data from
detailed retail and wholesale sector censuses. We adjust purchaser’s prices for (net) taxes on the
products as these are paid for by the consumer to the government and do not constitute payment
for factor inputs in any stage of production.

4. Main results

In this section we will present our main findings on the factor income shares in global value chains
of manufactured goods. As background it is useful to note that consumption of manufactured goods
(at purchasers’ prices) makes up about 27.9 per cent of world GDP (in 2000, derived from the
WIOD). This high number might be surprising given that gross value added in the manufacturing
sectors, aggregated across all countries in the world, is only 18.4 per cent of world GDP. This is
because consumption value of manufactured goods also includes value added from primary goods
and services sectors (including distribution).8 We will map the consumption value of final
manufactured goods into income generated for labour and capital in all countries that contributed
to production and distribution of these goods. We will do this for nineteen detailed manufacturing
product groups and also present aggregate results.


The production processes of goods have been fragmenting across borders with major impetuses
from the NAFTA agreement in the early 1990s, and China’s accession to the WTO in 2001.
Previous work on manufactured goods, reported on in Timmer et al. (2014), found that the share
of labour income in final output was declining over the period from 1995 to 2007. Surprisingly,
this was the case not only in those stages carried out in advanced countries, but also in stages
carried out in less advanced regions. The former was expected, given that offshored stages are
typically labour-intensive, but the latter finding was not. This highlighted the increased importance
of capital in production, as its income share increased in virtually all GVCs. Timmer et al. (2014)
hypothesised that this was related to the increased importance of intangibles. With our new data
we are in the position to test this hypothesis, distinguishing between tangible and intangible
incomes. We can also investigate trends in the period after 2007.


Finding 1: Declining share of labour income in GVCs
The GVC decomposition results, aggregated across all manufacturing goods, are given in Table 1.
It shows the income shares for labour, tangible and intangible capital as defined in equation (4).

 And not all manufacturing value added ends up in final manufacturing goods (e.g. when used in production
of final services). See Herrendorf et al. (2013) for results from a similar exercise mapping consumption to
sectoral value added for the U.S. economy.

Figure 2 charts the cumulative changes in factor income shares with the year 2000 as base. We
find a strongly increasing capital share, and a concomitantly declining trend in the share of labour.
The labour share dropped from 56.4 per cent in 2000 to 51.8 per cent in 2007. This resonates well
with previous findings (Timmer et al., 2014).9 It stabilized afterwards: in 2014 the share was 51.2
per cent. We conclude that the declining trend in labour share did not continue after 2007, but also
did not reverse. This is suggesting that the decline was not a temporary phase in some kind of
business cycle pattern.

Notes: Share of factor income in worldwide output of final manufacturing products valued at purchaser’s
prices, before product tax (in percentages). Labour income includes all costs of employing labour, including
self-employed income. Tangible capital income includes gross returns to tangible assets based on a 4 per
cent real (net) rate of return. Intangible capital income is calculated as a residual (gross value added minus
labour and tangible capital income). Own calculations based on the WIOD 2016, extended with data on
tangible capital stocks and distribution margins as described section 3.



9
  The 2014 study used a previous version of the WIOD (the 2013 release) and did not include distribution
activities but only production stages (F and O), that is, it decomposed output at basic prices. Our extension
to output at purchaser’s prices did not appear to have a major impact on factor income distribution.

Finding 2: Increasing share of intangible income share up to 2007, but not after.
A novel finding of this study is that the increasing share of capital after 2000 is mainly due to
increasing incomes to intangibles. The income share of tangible capital grew only slowly, from
15.8 per cent in 2000 to 16.3 per cent in 2007. The low volatility of the tangible share is partly by
virtue of its measurement: it is based on a stock estimate multiplied by an ex-ante rental rate and
both variables move only slowly over time. The decline in the labour share was thus mainly
mirrored by an increase in the intangible share, which is measured as a residual after subtracting
labour and tangible capital incomes. Its share jumped from 27.8 per cent in 2000 to 31.9 per cent
in 2007. This increase was not sustained however, and even reversed in 2011, declining to 30.7
per cent in 2014.

Note: see Table 1.




Finding 3: Income share of intangible assets in GVCs is (much) higher than of tangible assets
Another interesting, and perhaps most surprising finding is the high income share of intangibles
relative to tangible assets. For all manufacturing goods combined, intangible income was 27.8 per
cent of final output value in 2000 relative to only 15.8 per cent for tangible assets, so about 1.8



                                                 15
times as high (Table 1).10 The ratio reached a peak in 2007 at 2.0 and gradually declined again to
1.7 in 2014. Similarly high ratios are found for more detailed product groups. In Table 2 we provide
an overview of the factor income shares in 2014 for twelve major manufacturing product groups.

Factor income shares are informative on the factor intensity of production. Traditionally, products
are classified as labour or capital intensive depending on the factor intensity of production in the
parent industry. With production fragmentation this classification is less straightforward as factor
intensities of all contributing industries need to be considered. The intangible income share is
shown to be more than double the tangible share for pharmaceuticals, chemical products and oil


10
   In related research Karabarbounis and Neiman (2018) find what they call the “factorless” income share
to be 15 per cent of value added in the 2000s in the US private business sector. This is the share that is not
attributable to labour or measured capital stocks, using the asset boundary of the SNA 2008 (thus including
IPP). Factorless income is found to be larger than measured capital income. In a different exercise, Bhandari
and McGrattan (2018) also find a high ratio of intangible to total assets: their estimate of what they call
“sweat equity” (firm-specific intangibles) is close to the estimate of marketable fixed assets used in
production by private businesses.
                                                     16
refining products (see last column in Table 2). The high ratio for petroleum products is likely
related to the importance of brand names, tightly controlled distribution systems and restricted
resource access generating supra-normal profits that end up in our residual intangible measure.
Pharmaceuticals are known to be highly R&D and patent intensive which is reflected in the high
intangible to tangible income ratio. Perhaps more surprising is the finding that the ratio is also high
for textiles and wearing apparel and ‘other’ manufacturing products, which includes amongst
others furniture and toys. These products are mainly produced in extensive international supply
networks and value added generation relies on chain orchestration, as well as strong marketing and
branding of the products. The ratio between intangible and tangible incomes is lower, but still well
above one, for electrical equipment (not including electronics), non-electrical machinery and other
transport equipment. Their production is characterised by large tangible investments with high
minimum efficient scales. The ratio is lowest for metal industries that are characterised by heavy
reliance on tangible assets in the form of large-scale smelters and metal processing plants. The
ranking of product groups is rather stable of time (not shown).

What type of intangible assets might be responsible for the large income share found in GVCs?
One might suspect that intellectual property plays a major role. In the 2008 System of National
Accounts (SNA08), investment in intellectual property products (IPP) is tracked. This includes
computer software and databases, research and development, mineral exploration and artistic
originals. Thus we can carry-out a simple back-of-the-envelope exercise to impute the income
accruing to IPP, using information on IPP capital stocks (from national accounts statistics, as
reported in EU KLEMS) and proxy the rental price by the IPP depreciation rate (taken as 30 per
cent) plus a real (net) rate of return of 4 percent, as we did for tangible assets.11 Doing so, we find
that the income share to IPP in manufacturing GVCs would amount to 2.4 per cent in 2000,
hoovering between 2.2 and 2.7 per cent during the period 2000-14. It thus can explain only a minor
part of the intangible income share that stood at 27.8 per cent in 2000. We conclude that there must
be a major set of intangible assets that is still outside the asset boundary currently covered in the
SNA08. This reinforces the findings of Corrado et al. (2005, 2009, 2013). They provide estimates
for market research, advertising, training and organisational capital that are currently not treated

11
  Not all countries have implemented the SNA08 however (most notably China, India and Japan), so we
are not able to carry out a full exercise, but it seems plausible that the majority of IPP is in Europe and the
US.
                                                      17
as investment in the national accounts. Yet, the industry detail currently provided is too aggregate
to be used for analysis of GVCs of manufacturing products. “Aggregate manufacturing” is the
lowest level of industry detail for which data is given.12 This is a fruitful avenue for future research.


Finding 4: Increase in intangible income is driven by international production fragmentation
In Table 3 we provide an overview of the changes in intangible income shares for twelve
manufacturing product groups. They are ranked according to the change over the 2000-14 period.
There is clear heterogeneity. For some products such as pharmaceuticals, textiles and food the
intangible share barely increased over the whole period 2000-14. An initial increase up to 2008
was almost nullified in the period after. In contrast the share increased over 2000-14 by 4.0 per
cent or more in electrical machinery, chemicals, vehicles, metal products and non-electrical
machinery. For some of these product groups, the intangible income shares increased strongly until
2008, followed by a moderate decline afterwards. Yet, the share continued to increase in the
production of chemicals, and barely declined in production of vehicles.

electronics and computers (comp) and fabricated metal products (fab met) are indicated.


The variation in intangible income shares across products invites further investigation into possible
drivers. One possible hypothesis centres around the speed of international production
fragmentation. The period from the mid-1990s until 2008 is characterised by a strong process of
fragmentation across borders, speeded up by the opening up of China and its joining the WTO in
2001. Yet, the impact varied across product groups (Timmer et al., 2016). International
fragmentation was for example high in the production of electronics (including computers),
electrical machinery and metal products in the 2000s. But production of textiles and furniture was
already quite fragmented before 2000. Other products are arguably less susceptible to international
fragmentation trends, such as food manufacturing (which has strong domestic supply links for
intermediate inputs) and pharmaceuticals manufacturing. To test this hypothesis more formally,
we combine our estimates of intangible income shares with information on international
fragmentation of production processes. Timmer et al. (2016) provide a new measure that tracks all
imports that are made along the production chain and argue that this is a good indicator for
international production fragmentation. In Figure 3 we plot the change in this indicator for our 19
manufacturing product groups against the change in the share of intangible income in those GVCs
from Table 3 for the period 2000-08. We find that there is a clear positive correlation (0.52), which
                                                    19
fits our conjecture. Yet, unexplained variation is still high, and further investigation into the drivers
of intangible income shares is warranted.


Finding 5 Increasing importance of intangibles in upstream production stages.
So far, we reported on income for factors aggregated over all stages, and remained agnostic about
the division across stages. Yet, our methodology allows one to also to track in which stage of the
GVC the returns to intangibles are recorded, using a straightforward disaggregation of equation
(4) by stage: distribution stage, final stage of production and other upstream stages of production.
Results are reported in Table 4. We find that in 2014 about one quarter of the intangibles income
is accounted for in the distribution stage. One quarter is accounted for in the final production stage
and about halve in other upstream production stages. There is a clear shift away of intangible
income recorded in the final production stage (minus 4.2 %-points over the period 2000-2014), to
the other production stages (plus 5.5 %-points). This shift mainly occurred before the crisis of
2008. This finding is consistent with a story of offshoring of final production stages (such as
assembly, testing and packaging) from advanced to low-wage economies such that the incomes in
this stage decline rapidly compared to the other stages that remained.


Interestingly, the aggregate trend is not shared across all product groups which might be related to
the type of governance in the chain. Gereffi (1999) proposes a distinction between what he refers
to as buyer-driven and producer-driven GVCs. GVCs are governed by so-called ‘lead firms’ that
have a large share of control over the activities that take place in the chain. The lead firm in a
buyer-driven chain is typically a large retail chain or a branded merchandiser and often has little
or no goods production capacity. The lead firm in a producer-driven chain is a manufacturer that
derives bargaining power from superior technological and production know-how.13 We find that
for buyer-driven GVCs like textiles, furniture, toys and other manufacturing the returns to
intangibles are mostly realised in the distribution stage, up to 50 per cent (see Table 4). In contrast,
in producer-driven GVCs like vehicles, fabricated metal and other transport equipment, intangible


13
   Most GVCs are governed in complex ways and combine elements of both governance modes.
Governance modes are not necessarily product-group specific. An electronic gadget can be produced in a
chain driven by an international retailer, e.g. in the case of a generic not-branded product, or in a producer
driven chain, e.g. in the case of a high-end branded product.
                                                     20
returns are mostly realised in the upstream production stages (up to 60 per cent). All products share
the trend of a declining share of the final production stage in intangible income, with the notable
exception of vehicles production.

4.2 Interpretation
So far, we have interpreted the residual income share in GVCs of goods as payments to intangible
assets. Other interpretations are possible. For example, Barkai (2017) suggests that the increase in
the residual in US GDP is related to a decline in competition.14 On our view, competition and the
build-up of intangible assets are interrelated. More specifically, we prefer to think of the global
market for manufacturing goods in the following way. Final goods are supplied by large firms that

14
   Karabarbounis and Neiman (2018) contend that the residual, which they dub ‘factorless income’, also
contains a possible wedge between imputed rental rates for assets and the rate that firms perceive when
making the investment. In the robustness section that follows, we show that this wedge needs to extremely
large in order to explain away the residual.
                                                     21
organise production in vertically integrated processes spanning across borders. The market
structure for final goods is monopolistic competition: each firm supplies a differentiated good and
is able to charge a price higher than average costs.15 A firm derives monopoly power from
investment in intangible assets that are specific to the firm. Conceptually, they differ from other
factor inputs because, by and large, companies cannot freely order or hire them in markets. Instead,
these assets are produced, and used, in-house: they are not reported in balance sheets and not
tracked as investment in national accounts statistics. Viewed this way, intangible capital is the
firm-specific “yeast” that creates value from hired labour and purchased assets. The residual that
remains can thus be interpreted as income to own-account intangibles.


The ‘yeast’ perspective on residual income has old antecedents harking back at least to Prescott
and Visscher (1980). See Cummins (2005) for further analysis on firm-level data. It is also related
to the concept of sweat equity, defined as the time that business owners spend in building up firm-
specific intangibles, see Bhandari and McGrattan (2018) for recent work. They emphasize the
importance of organizational capital that is typically build at own-account and not (adequately)
picked up as investment in national account statistics. In the Appendix we show through a
capitalization-of-intangibles exercise as in Corrado et al. (2005) that residual income in a GVC is
equal to the income for own-account intangibles when (part of the) workers are assumed to build-
up firm-specific capital. Under a ‘steady-state’ assumption such that the creation of intangibles in
each period is equal to depreciation, the intangible income is shown to be a net measure. So in
terms of disposable incomes (Bridgman 2017, Rognlie 2015), intangible earnings might be even
larger relative to tangible earnings as the latter is inclusive of depreciation. Yet, this is only under
the steady-state assumption which cannot be verified through direct observation.


Taking our findings together, we argue that the 2000s was a unique period in the global economy
where supra-normal returns to tangibles were (temporarily) captured, based on firm-specific
intangible assets that went largely unrecorded in national account statistics. Our results support a


15
  Romalis (2004) provides a many-country version of a Heckscher-Ohlin model with a continuum of (final)
goods, produced under monopolistic competition and with transport costs. Mark ups might of course also
be the result of a natural monopoly or government regulation. This situation is less likely to be relevant for
manufacturing goods that are heavily traded worldwide (with the exception of petroleum products).

story in which global manufacturing firms benefitted from increased opportunities for offshoring.
Changes in the global economic environment in the early 2000s, in particular China’s ascension
to the WTO, and developments in ICT made it profitable to develop extensive global production
and distribution networks. Multinational firms built-up firm-specific coordination systems,
benefitting from increased opportunities for offshoring of labour-intensive activities to low-wage
locations. The income accruing to labour in the GVC declined due to wage cost savings. This
matches our finding that incomes in final production stages (such as assembly, testing and
packaging) declined rapidly compared to upstream production stages. If the production
requirements (and prices) for tangible capital remain unaltered, the share of intangibles must go
up by virtue of its definition as a residual.16 In addition, the growth in purchasing power in the
global economy (such as growing consumer demand in China) might have benefitted incumbent
multinational firms that were able to capitalise on existing intangibles such as brand names and
distribution systems at little marginal costs. Apparently, this process was interrupted by the
financial crisis in 2007, likely related to subsequent heightened uncertainty on future global
demand.




5. Discussion of robustness of main findings


How robust are our main findings presented in section 4? Gross value added and the income
payments to labour are recorded in the national accounts. The payments to tangible assets are
imputed based on asset stocks and a rental price that includes a chosen rate of return. The higher
this rate is set, the higher the tangible income will be and the lower the intangible income which
is measured residually. Setting the real (net) rate of return to tangible assets is not straightforward:
from theory it depends on the opportunity cost of capital in the market as well as the expected
inflation. It was set at 4 per cent in our analysis so far, but alternative choices can be defended as
well.


16
  This is true only under the assumption that factor substitution possibilities between labour and capital are
limited. See Reijnders et al. (2016) for an econometric analysis of factor substitution and technical change
in global value chains. They find wage elasticities to be well below one.
                                                     23
To have an idea about the sensitivity of results, one might ask what rate of return to tangibles
would exhaust all non-labour income such that no residual remains. The physical capital to output
ratio is about 1.3 (that is value of the tangible asset stock relative to final output) in 2000. It follows
that the real (net) rate of return to physical capital needs to be as high as 25 per cent to exhaust
final output, clearly well outside the boundary of plausible rates. For example, Barkai (2017, Fig
1) shows that debt costs in the U.S., set to the yield on Moody’s Aaa bond portfolio, declined from
about 7 per cent in 2000 to 5 per cent in 2014. He calculated expected capital inflation as a three-
year moving average of realized capital inflation, and found it to oscillate around 2 per cent. This
suggests a small, but steady, decline in the real rate of return from 5 per cent to 3 per cent over our
period of analysis (2000-14). Rognlie (2015) took the 10-year Treasury bond yield, subtracting the
lagged 5-year rate of change of the GDP deflator as a proxy for inflation expectations. This real
rate was about 4 per cent in 2000, gradually declining to just above 0 per cent in 2014. These
alternative estimates are relatively close to our chosen 4 per cent, so our findings on relative levels
of tangibles and intangibles incomes appear robust. Moreover, the findings of a declining rate of
return over the period considered suggests that, if anything, we are underestimating the importance
of intangibles in later years. For example, using a 0 per cent real rate of return instead of 4 per cent
would indicate that in 2014 the tangible income share is only about 12 percent, and the intangible
share more than 36 per cent: a ratio of 3 rather than barely 2 as we reported. These results suggest
that using plausible time-varying instead of a constant real (net) rate of return to tangible assets is
strengthening our conclusions on the increased importance of intangibles in manufacturing GVCs.


Yet, one might argue that we nevertheless overestimate intangible incomes as we are using gross
value added statistics that are measured according to the 2008 system of national accounts
(SNA08). Gross value added is defined in the SNA as the value of output less the value of
intermediate consumption. In the SNA08 expenditures on intellectual property products (IPP) is
treated as capital formation, not intermediate consumption.17 This increases the value added but
not the tangible capital stock. Thus if we take value added statistics recorded in SNA08, gross
value added might be overestimated for our purposes, and so will be our intangible income measure

17
  IPP covers R&D, computer software and databases, mineral exploration and entertainment and artistic
originals. See Koh et al. (2016) for more information on treatment of IPP by the U.S. BEA.
                                                    24
through its residual nature. 18 To have an upper limit estimation of the bias, we assume that all IPP
is bought in the market and recorded at cost.19 Costs of IPP can be proxied by multiplying IPP
stocks with the sum of the IPP depreciation rate (taken as 30 per cent) plus a real (net) rate of
return of 4 percent (as we did before). Doing so, we find that value added (and hence intangible
income) in the GVC is overestimated within a range of 2.2 to 2.7 per cent during the period 2000-
14. This shows that our main results on the relative levels and growth rates of intangible income
are robust to this data issue.


A potentially more serious issue is the asset boundary of tangible capital. We follow the convention
of the SNA08 and include fixed assets (such as machinery, equipment and buildings), but not land
and inventories. Yet, both land and inventories tie up capital and their use entails an opportunity
cost. Estimating stocks of inventory and of land is fraught with difficulties however. The SNA
tracks changes in inventories, but not necessarily their value. Land is even more problematic as
land improvement expenditures do fall within the SNA asset boundary, in particular when they are
tied with (improved) buildings or infrastructure. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics tries to take
into account these assets when constructing their multi-factor productivity statistics along the lines
of Jorgenson (1995). They find for the manufacturing sector that capital compensation for
inventories and land adds about a quarter to the income of the tangible assets covered in the SNA.
This can go up to 65 per cent in retail and even 100 per cent in the wholesaling sector, due to the
important role of inventories in these sectors.20 Yet, these numbers are based on calculations that
use an ex-post rate of return which exhaust value added, rather than an ex-ante rate as required. As
such, the reported incomes contain also all income by assets that are not covered in the analysis.
Corrado et al. (2005) argued forcefully that many intangibles are still outside the SNA asset
boundary, echoed in our finding of a large residual income. In that case, the ex-post rate of return
will be overestimated and likewise the rental price of land and inventories, the more so because

18
   For countries that still publish national accounts according to SNA93 these imputations will be only
small, including an imputation for own-account software at best. More discussion of this overestimation
can be found in Chen et al. (2017).
19
   This is clearly an extreme assumption as a major part of IPP is own-account and not purchased. In the
US, the share of purchased is about two-third and own-account is about one-third, while half-half in the
U.K. (from additional info in national account statistics).
20
   The data is taken from Bureau of Labor Statistics, Office of Productivity and Technology, Division of
Major Sector Productivity, published on line March 21, 2018 at http://www.bls.gov/mfp/.
                                                  25
their depreciation rates are zero by nature. We conclude that the capital compensation numbers for
income to land and inventories as in the BLS statistics are not suitable for our purposes. It does
highlight however, that more information on these asset types, in particular on their stocks, is
desirable.


A particular caveat is needed for our findings on intangible incomes in each stage (finding 5). For
a proper interpretation of the results, one should realise that what is measured here is the stage
where the intangible income is recorded. This does not necessarily imply that the income is also
captured by the firms that operate in that stage. For example, compare a situation in which Apple
charges the iPhone assembler for its intellectual property with a situation in which it does not. The
ex-factory price of the iPhone would be higher in the former case and the measured return to the
intangibles consequently lower in the distribution stage. But the measured return to intangibles
would be higher in one of the earlier stages of production as it would include a payment for use of
Apple´s intangibles. The division of intangible incomes across stages is thus sensitive to
accounting practices by lead firms, as discussed in the introduction. Results that are based on
aggregating across all stages (which underlie findings 1 to 4) are not sensitive to these shifts.


As a final remark, it should be clear that the validity of all the findings relies heavily on the quality
of the database used. Data can, and needs, to be improved in many dimensions. For example, the
WIOD is a prototype database developed mainly to provide a proof-of-concept, and it is up to the
statistical community to bring international input-output tables into the realm of official statistics.
For example, one currently has to rely on the assumption that all firms in a country-industry have
a similar production structure, because firm-level data matching national input-output tables are
largely lacking. If different types of firms, in particular exporters and non-exporters have different
production technologies and input sourcing structures (i.e. exporters import larger shares of
inputs), more detailed data might reveal an (unknown) bias in the results presented here. 21 From
the perspective of measuring intangibles’ returns, one of the biggest challenge is in the concept
and measurement of trade in services (Houseman and Mandel, 2015). Fortunately, there are
important developments in the international statistical community. Recently, the UNUCE

published its Guide to Measuring Global Production (UNUCE 2014). Building on this are new
initiatives, most notably the initiative towards a System of Extended International and Global
Accounts (SEIGA). In the short run this would involve mixing existing establishment and
enterprise data (in extended supply and use tables) as well as expanding survey information on
value-added chains and firm characteristics. In the longer term this would entail common business
registers across countries, increased data reconciliation and linking as well as new data collections
on value-chains beyond counterparty transactions (Landefeld, 2015).




6. Concluding remarks


Recent studies document a decline in the share of labour and a simultaneous increase in the share
of residual (‘factorless’) income in national GDP. We argue that study of factor incomes in global
value chains (GVCs) is needed to better understand this residual. This is the first paper to do so.
We show how to measure income of all tangible factor inputs (capital and labour) in a GVC. We
define intangible capital income residually by subtracting the payments for tangible factors (capital
and labour) from the value of the final product. Importantly, these factors are identified in all stages
of production (final and upstream stages) as well as in the distribution stage. This is important as
a large share of value might be added in the delivery of the good to the final consumer, rather than
in the production stages.


We focus on GVCs of manufactured goods and find a declining labour income share over the
period 2000-14, and a concomitantly increase in the capital income share. Our main finding is that
this increase in capital income in GVCs is mostly due to the increase in income for intangible
rather than tangible assets. This is found at the aggregate as well as for more detailed
manufacturing product groups. Yet we also find clear heterogeneity: for some non-durable
products the intangible share increased only slightly, contracting later on. In contrast the share
increased rapidly in durable goods (such as machinery and equipment products). We provide
suggestive evidence that this variation is positively linked to variation in the speed of international
production fragmentation. Taken together, our results suggests that the 2000s should be seen as an

                                                  27
exceptional period in the global economy during which multinational firms benefitted from
reduced labour costs through offshoring, while capitalising on existing firm-specific intangibles,
such as brand names, at little marginal cost.


We discussed robustness of these results to issues like missing information on land and inventories,
value added imputations for some intangibles in the SNA08, and choice for (ex-ante) rate of return
to tangible assets. We argued that the level of intangible income might be overestimated, but the
trend over time is likely to be underestimated, if anything. In any case, there is a robust large
residual income in GVCs that cannot be attributed to tangible assets, nor to the wider asset class
considered in the SNA08 (which includes intellectual property products). We reinforce the claim
made by Corrado et al. (2005) that national account statistics are missing out on a sizeable set of
intangible assets. Our conjecture is that most of these are own-account. To bring this hypothesis to
the data, one would need information on investment in assets that are (or can be) purchased in the
market, to be distinguished from ‘own account’ investment that is firm specific. Unfortunately,
investment statistics from the national accounts typically do not separate own-account and market-
mediated investment flows, although company balance sheet might provide information. (Peters
and Taylor, 2017). Hopefully this type of information will be systematically collected and
separately reported in future national account statistics. We also emphasized that the measurement
framework puts high demand on the data and our results should thus be seen as indicative, rather
than definitive.


The main aim of this study was to stimulate further thinking about the interrelatedness of factor
incomes across industries and countries. We showed that it mattered in an accounting sense, as the
use of intangibles is blurring attribution of incomes to particular geographical locations and
industries in national accounts statistics. In addition, it invites further investigation of the role of
governance in global value chains. Gereffi (1994, 1999) highlighted the crucial role of
multinational lead firms in the generation and division of value in the chain. In particular the
importance of internationally operating retailers highlights the need to consider the distribution
stage alongside production stages that are the traditional confines of empirical GVC studies based
on input-output tables. Further research is also needed to identify various types of intangibles, their
investment flows, prices and depreciation rates in macro-work following Corrado et al. (2005,

                                                  28
2009, 2013) as well as firm-level research, such as in Peters and Taylor (2017). At the minimum,
we hope to have convinced the reader that a deeper understanding of global value chains is needed
before our measurement systems will adequately capture the importance of intangibles, and their
incomes, in today’s global economy.

APPENDIX Linking ‘factorless’ income to intangible assets: an accounting model


In this appendix we will outline a simple accounting model that points to a straightforward
interpretation of the factorless (residual) income measure in GVCs as reported upon in the main
text. We will show how, under steady-state condition, this residual can be interpreted as net income
payment to intangible assets. We analyse the case in which the intangible is produced by the firm
for own account (that is, in house). To do so, we follow the capital accounting approach to
intangibles as pioneered in Corrado et al. (2005).


To fix ideas, we use the example of a multinational firm that sells goods, but does not produce
them. This firm imports a good, say shoes from an affiliate, and sells them (at a premium) under
its brand name. The firm only employs marketing staff that work on branding. We model the
production function of this firm as 𝑌(𝐿𝐵 , 𝑆), with Y sales of shoes, 𝐿𝐵 number of workers and S
imports of shoes. Let 𝑝 denote prices, with superscripts indicating the output or input to which it
refers.22 Gross profit of the firm in the distribution stage, 𝜋 𝐵 , is then given by:


(A1)            𝜋 𝐵 = 𝑝𝑌 𝑌 − 𝑤 𝐵 𝐿𝐵 − 𝑝 𝑆 𝑆

𝜋 𝐵 can be observed in the data, yet how should it be interpreted? The brand name is created with
a view of generating profits over a longer time period and hence should be considered as a capital
input as argued by Corrado et al. (2005). In their capitalization approach, the firm is using an
intangible asset input, namely the intangible capital stock B (for “brand”). This stock is generated
by the usual accumulation of investments:

(A2)    𝐵𝑡+1 = (1 − 𝛿 𝐵 )𝐵𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡𝐵 ,


where 𝛿 𝐵 its depreciation rate and 𝐼𝑡𝐵 the investment flow. The firm is producing the brand using
its own workers (producing for own account in the jargon of the System of National Accounts).
Viewed this way, nominal output of the firm should now also include the value of the assets



22
  We only use the time subscript in cases where its omission might generate confusion. Otherwise it will
be suppressed for expositional simplicity.
                                                   33
created, namely 𝑝𝐵 𝐼 𝐵 with 𝑝𝐵 the investment price. Factor input costs go up as well: by 𝑟 𝐵 𝐵 with
𝑟 𝐵 its user cost, as the brand stock is used. As in the main text, we simplify and write the user cost
as


(A3)    𝑟 𝐵 = (𝜌𝐵 + 𝛿 𝐵 ) 𝑝𝐵 ,


where 𝜌𝐵 is the (net) real rate of return to intangible capital. This rate is pinned down by the
requirement that the sum of all factor incomes exhausts output, as we now have included all factors
of production. Put otherwise, 𝜌𝐵 is determined using an ex-post endogenous rate of return such
that


(A4)    𝑝𝑌 𝑌 + 𝑝𝐵 𝐼 𝐵 = 𝑤 𝐵 𝐿𝐵 + 𝑟 𝐵 𝐵 + 𝑝 𝑆 𝑆.


It is obvious, but important, to see that the measured returns to intangibles depend crucially on the
price the firm is paying for the imported shoes. Suppose the shoes are produced by an affiliated
firm, opening up the possibility for profit shifting. In that case, returns to intangibles cannot be
identified by studying the last stage only. The solution is to consider the profits in the two stages
together.


To see this, we also model the fabrication stage (F) of shoes. Assume shoes are fabricated with
labor (𝐿𝐹 ) and tangible capital (𝐾 𝐹 ), say machines. We can then write:


(A5)    𝜋 𝐹 = 𝑝 𝑆 𝑆 − 𝑤 𝐹 𝐿𝐹 − 𝑟 𝐹 𝐾 𝐹 ,


where 𝜋 𝐹 is the residual profit measure after subtracting cost of tangible inputs from gross output
in the fabrication stage. The particular division of the profits in the selling and fabrication stages
will depend on the price of the shoes which is an endogenous variable to be set by the lead firm
for accounting purposes. However, the overall profit in the chain, (𝜋 𝑅 + 𝜋 𝐹 ) is independent of
this choice. It equals sales minus cost of tangible inputs in the integrated production process.
Combining (A5) and (A1) we derive


                                                  34
(A6)    (𝜋 𝐵 + 𝜋 𝐹 ) = 𝑝𝑌 𝑌 − (𝑤𝐵 𝐿𝐵 + 𝑤 𝐹 𝐿𝐹 ) − 𝑟 𝐹 𝐾 𝐹 .


(A6) shows how (𝜋 𝐵 + 𝜋 𝐹 ) can be measured in the data. The method to do so is outlined in the
main text. How can we interpret it? Using (A4) and (A5), we have:


(A7)    (𝜋 𝐵 + 𝜋 𝐹 ) = 𝑟 𝐵 𝐵 − 𝑝𝐵 𝐼 𝐵 .


The left-hand side is observable in the data, but none of the right-hand side variables are. In
practice many alternative combinations of 𝑟 𝐵 , 𝐵, 𝑝𝐵 and 𝐼 𝐵 are possible that satisfy the accounting
restrictions set by the observable data. To simplify, let us consider two extreme cases. First,
suppose a start-up firm produced the intangible, but is not producing and selling shoes yet. In that
case 𝑤 𝐵 𝐿𝐵 = 𝑝𝐵 𝐼 𝐵 and 𝑟 𝐵 𝐵 = 0. Alternatively, when the firm stops to produce its intangible, but
continues selling, it can be said to “exhaust” its brand name. In that case (𝜋 𝐵 + 𝜋 𝐹 ) = 𝑟 𝐵 𝐵 as
𝑝𝐵 𝐼 𝐵 = 0. An intermediate situation is when the firm is in a steady-state such that in each period
depreciation of the intangible is equal to new investment:


(A8) 𝛿 𝐵 𝑝𝐵 𝐵 = 𝑝𝐵 𝐼 𝐵 .


Substituting (A8) in (A7), and using (A3) we find that in this case


(A9)    (𝜋 𝐵 + 𝜋 𝐹 ) = 𝜌𝐵 𝑝𝐵 𝐵.


Under a steady-state assumption, the observable profit in the GVC is measuring the returns to
intangible assets, net of depreciation. It is thus a net income measure.


A number of characteristics of this measure need to be noted. First, 𝜌𝐵 is an ex post rate of return.
It is calculated to exhaust output minus tangible costs, such that all value added is allocated to
factors of production. This ex post rate contains a ‘normal’ rate of return to capital, 𝜌̅ , which is the
opportunity cost of the invested capital. This rate is by definition similar to the rate for tangible
capital assets. Any returns above this can be referred to as ‘supra-normal’ such that the rate of
return for intangibles can be split into normal returns and supra-normal returns: 𝜌𝐵 = (𝜌𝐵 − 𝜌̅ ) +

                                                   35
𝜌̅ . There are many reasons why the rate of return to intangibles might be different from the rate
of return to tangible capital. Beyond the standard business risk, it may include additional
compensation for its unusual risk-profile (Hansen et al., 2005). Second, for simplicity we abstained
from tax and capital gain considerations in the discussion above, as in our empirical work reported
on in the main text. This is not to say that they are unimportant, but simply unknown and further
work is needed in this direction. Third, equation (A9) shows that intangible income measured by
(𝜋 𝐵 + 𝜋 𝐹 ) can increase because of an increase in its rate of return 𝜌𝐵 , or because an increase in
the nominal stock, 𝑝𝐵 𝐵. Without quantifying the stock, we are not able to distinguish between the
two. More generally, the firm might not be in a “steady state”, driving a wedge between
depreciation and new investment. This wedge will also be absorbed in (𝜋 𝐵 + 𝜋 𝐹 ). Without further
information on intangible depreciation, prices and quantities (𝛿 𝐵 , 𝐼 𝐵 and 𝑝𝐵 ) we will not be able
to separate changes in stocks and in rates of return. Corrado et al. (2005, 2009, 2013) provide stock
estimates for intangible assets that are currently not treated as investment in the national accounts.
This is a fruitful avenue for future research .
