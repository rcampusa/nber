Using variation in crop prices induced by large swings in demand World War I, we examine the
fertility response to increases in crop revenues during the period 1910-1930. Our estimates from
samples utilizing both complete count decennial census microdata and newly collected county-
level data from state health reports indicate that a doubling of the agricultural price index reduced
fertility by around 8 percent both immediately and in the years following the boom. We further
document that this effect was more pronounced in more agrarian areas and where the labor
intensity of agriculture was more intense. Extensive robustness checks and analysis of potential
mechanisms indicate that the decrease in fertility was driven by increased female opportunity
costs which dominated any household income effects resulting from the price boom.

1. Introduction
       A recurring theme in economics and demography is that as economies develop, a
demographic transition will occur, whereby declining fertility rates accompany rising
incomes (Galor, 2005; Jones and Tertilt 2009; Galor and Weil, 2000, Bruekner and
Schwandt, 2015). Theory makes sharp predictions regarding the relationship between
fertility, income shocks, and changes in the opportunity cost of time (Becker, 1960;
Becker and Lewis; 1973; Becker and Tomes, 1976; Rosenzweig, 1977), however,
empirical evidence is needed to understand whether pure income shocks or changes in
the opportunity costs of time dominate in specific contexts. A recent literature has
developed that takes advantage of exogenous variation in income, employment, or
wealth to identify their impact on fertility (Lindo, 2010; Ananat et al., 2013; Huttunen
and Kellokumpu, 2017, Black et al., 2013, Yonzan et al., 2020; Fishback, Haines, Kantor,
2007; Lovenheim and Mumford, 2013; Dettling and Kearney, 2014; Bailey and Collins,
2013; Lewis, 2018; Fujii and Shonchoy, 2020; Wanamaker, 2012; Schaller, 2016). This
literature has broadly shown that increases in the male wage or income leads to
increases in fertility, while increasing female wages result in reductions in fertility.
Much of the recent literature focuses on identifying the impacts of these shocks in
advanced economies, however, developing nations are the most likely to experience
demographic transitions in the near future given their reliance on agriculture. In the
developing context it has been more challenging to utilize aggregate shocks to identify
the impacts on fertility, although there are several notable exceptions (Schultz, 1985;
Alam and Portner, 2018; Corno, Hildebrandt, and Voena, forthcoming). One challenge
in predicting what will occur in developing nations is the lack of quality data over a long
time horizon. History provides one avenue to better understand how individuals and
families adjust to large aggregate shocks, both in the immediate aftermath and following
a period of adjustment (Collins and Margo, 2007, Hornbeck, 2012, Hornbeck and
Naidu, 2014; Hanlon, 2017; Feir, Gillezeau, and Jones, 2019; Kantor and Whalley, 2019;
Boustan, Kahn, Rhode, and Yanguas, 2020).
   In this paper we draw on rich, historical data from the United States to understand
how fertility responds to aggregate shocks that change both incomes and the relative
opportunity costs of women. Specifically, we take advantage of a period of significant
agricultural price variation, the agricultural commodity boom and bust in the United
                                              -2-
States surrounding World War I (WWI). During the period we study, 1910-1930, both
the General Fertility Rate and Crude Birth rate fell by approximately 29 percent (Figure
1), which is as large a decline as the Baby Boom was a boom. The agricultural price
variation induced by international events combined with large changes in fertility make
it an ideal setting to explore the link between income shocks and fertility. The
agricultural commodity boom in WWI was entirely unexpected as fields in Europe were
destroyed. Additionally, the magnitude of the shock was massive. U.S. agricultural
exports doubled in the second half of the 1910s, in some cases prices more than doubled,
and agricultural receipts increased by 70 percent (Henderson et al., 2011). Farmers
expected the boom to persist, as documented by rising land prices, and the agricultural
bust following the Treaty of Versailles also came as a surprise as Europe rapidly
recovered post war. 4 Finally, female wages in agriculture were impacted by the crop
price boom-and-bust, which we argue makes changes in female opportunity costs,
rather than household income, the driving mechanism for the fertility response.

                   Figure 1 - United States Fertility Rate 1909-2015




        Notes: National Vital Statistics System data (NVSS, 2017). The general fertility rate
        is the number of births per 1,000 women aged 15-44. The crude birth rate is the
        number of annual live births per 1,000 people in the country's population.




4 In the years following WWI, significant price volatility remained, at least in part as a result of
increased international competition and new domestic policy (i.e., Capper-Volstead Act, 1922,
Fordney-McCumber Tariff, 1922).

                                                    -3-
       The first few decades of the 20th Century United States have generally been
understudied due to limited data availability. The federal government did not begin
recording births until 1915 with the creation of the Birth Registration Area (BRA), which
was not complete until Texas joined in 1933. To gain insight in the pre-war period, we
digitize annual county-level birth tabulations from available state health reports prior to
a state's entry into the BRA to push back the series to 1910 for twenty-six states. The
longer panel enables us to capture any variation in pre-trends that might confound our
estimate of the fertility-income relationship. Additionally, we turn to the complete count
Population Census for the years 1910, 1920, and 1930 to compare birth outcomes for
women who would have been differentially exposed to the agricultural boom and bust,
netting out common locational and cohort effects.

       To empirically identify the relationship between changes in fertility and changes
in agricultural income, we complement our birth data with a measure of annual county-
level agricultural crop revenue. Specifically, we follow Rajan and Ramcharan (2015) and
Jaremski and Wheelock (forthcoming) to construct a county-level agricultural price
index. The index combines pre-war crop production bundles at the county-level with
aggregate crop specific price shocks to generate our key source of spatial-temporal
variation. We use the index as our measure of agricultural income because annual
county-level crop receipts are otherwise unavailable. We then estimate the relationship
between the agricultural price index and fertility, controlling for a rich set of covariates,
location specific fixed effects, and time fixed effects. Under the assumption that that the
initial crop specialization patterns are driven by agro-climatic variables and that
national crop specific prices are driven by international events and climate shocks,
variation in the agricultural price index is exogenous to the measures of birth and
fertility, thus permitting a causal interpretation for our estimates.

       Our estimates consistently show that the agricultural boom reduced fertility in
the short-run, measured by annual county-level births, as well as in the medium and
long-run, measured by counts of children from the population census. In the short-run,
we estimate that annual county-level births fell by 4-8 percent when crop prices
doubled. Evaluated at the average value of the agricultural index, this 2.9 percent
decline in births indicates that agricultural price variation explains about 10 percent of

                                             -4-
the overall decline in fertility between 1910 and 1930. This estimate is robust to a variety
of potential confounds, including county-level WWI induction rates and exposure to the
Spanish Influenza Pandemic. Turning to the complete count census samples, we
estimate that doubling the price index reduced the number of children under the age of
5 for women in prime child bearing years by 0.189. This estimate translates to an 8.9
percent relative decrease when evaluated at the mean number of children and mean
agricultural index value. Using a proxy for long-run fertility, we estimate a 6 percent
relative decline in the total number of children in the home, indicating that fertility was
not merely delayed or retimed. Combined, these results suggest that in our context, the
increased opportunity costs that women faced more than offset any potential income
effects.

       After documenting the net decline, we further explore the underlying
mechanisms. In particular, we examine mechanisms that explore variation in
opportunity cost and the direct costs of raising children. Dettling and Kearney (2014)
document differential effects for renters (who experience real price increases) and
property owners (who experience wealth shocks). We explore owner/renter
heterogeneity in our setting by interacting the 1910 county level farm owner-operator
rate with the agricultural price index and find that ownership contributes to increases in
fertility, although not enough to offset the overall decline. Given recent work in
development economics that explores differential child investment based on the labor
intensity of crops (Kruger, 2007; Cogneau and Jedwab, 2012), we also explore how the
labor intensity of agriculture impacts our estimates. We document that price shocks in
areas with higher labor intensity of agriculture lead to larger declines in fertility,
supporting the conclusion that the primary driver of our findings is the increased
opportunity cost of women's time. Further, we show that young women delayed
marriage in response to the price boom and that the delay is increasing in the labor
intensity of agriculture.

       Our paper contributes to multiple strands of literature. First, our paper
complements the aforementioned body of work that seeks to understand the causal
relationship between economic shocks and fertility. Second, we view our work as
contributing to the broader modern development economics literature that relates

                                              -5-
agricultural and natural resource shocks on families and family structure (Beegle,
Dehejia, and Gatti, 2006; Kruger, 2007; Akresh, 2009; Cogneau and Jedwab, 2012).
Our estimates show that agricultural commodity price shocks can also affect the size of
the family, which closely relates to Schultz (1985) and Corno, Hildebrandt, and Voena
(forthcoming). Finally, our work contributes to a recent historical literature that seeks
to understand the economic impacts of WWI, joining a growing body of work that
explores family formation in Europe (Abramitzky, Delavande, and Vasconcelos, 2011;
Vandenbrouke, 2014; Gay, 2019; and Boehnke and Gay, 2020). In the US context, our
work joins that of Rajan and Ramcharan (2015) and Jaremski and Wheelock (2018) who
study expansions of credit and banking during the interwar period, as well as work by
Moser and Voena (2012) who study the future path of innovation following wartime
policy changes to intellectual property rights.

       Improving our understanding of how aggregate shocks affect income and the
opportunity costs of women remains a particularly important goal for researchers and
policy makers alike. Interactions between shocks and opportunity costs can impact the
efficacy of programs that are designed to encourage family formation and can have
lasting impacts on entitlement programs which are based on multigenerational
demographic projections. While our estimates are time and place specific,
understanding how changes in gender-specific opportunity costs and the relative
substitutability of production inputs impact family formation are undoubtedly no less
relevant in the 21st century.

2. World War I Agricultural Boom and Bust

       WWI created an unprecedented demand shock for American agricultural
products. As war raged in Europe, wheat production fell by over 50 percent in both
France and Italy, oat production dropped 59 percent in Germany, and livestock
plummeted to a quarter of their prewar levels in Denmark (Nourse, 1924). Distress in
ocean shipping further increased demands for US products that were less exposed on
ocean shipping lanes than goods originating from more distant sources, such as
Argentina and Australia. In response, prices for American goods rose sharply. In Figure
2, we highlight the annual variation in crop prices for 11 major crops in the United


                                            -6-
States, relative to their price in 1910. 5 In some cases, prices for crops such as potatoes
and tobacco increased over 300% during the period 1914-1919.

       As a result of the rapid increase in agricultural prices, production on the home
front ramped up. Between 1914 and 1919, 30 million new acres of land were brought
into production (a 9 percent relative increase). 6 Given the sharp increase in prices and
the increased production, the aggregate the value of crops harvested in the United States
more than doubled over the same time horizon. 7

       The rapid increase in production strained input markets. Labor was particularly
scarce in rural areas as people flocked to cities to take advantage of the wartime
manufacturing boom. While America's war effort was modest in WWI relative to World
War II in terms of manpower, over 4 million young men were drafted to become
doughboys, further tightening the labor market.

       Here we provide two examples of programs that were initiated to address the
farm labor shortage during the war years, the Women's Land Army and the Boys
Working Reserve. At its peak, the Women's Land Army recruited upwards of 20,000
women from colleges and universities work on farms while living in camps (SSA, 1942).
The USDA also developed programs in conjunction with states to send young boys to
work on farms during the summer months. In 1917, the U.S. Department of Labor
created the Boys Working Reserve. In 1918 for example, the Boys Working Reserve
placed 210,000 16-20 year-old boys on farms for summer employment (US. Dept. of
Labor, 1919). In Massachusetts during the summer of 1918, Boys Working Reserve
camps provided 9,226 weeks of labor, with an average of 651 boys working each week.

5 We follow Rajan and Ramcharan (2012) and Jaremski and Wheelock (forthcoming) in the selection
of crops that will form the basis of our agricultural price index. These crops include: Corn, Wheat,
Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Flax, Cotton, Tobacco, Potato, and Sweet Potato.

The program also placed an additional 1,600 boys on individual farms (Committee on
School Boys, 1919). Finally, there were also efforts to employ idle urban labor in nearby
farms.

         Carter et al. (2006). Prices are relative to 1910 baseline.

         Despite these programs initiated by the USDA, the labor shortage led to increases
in the nominal wages for agricultural workers. Between 1914 and 1919, farm wages
increased from $22 a month to $43 a month (US Dept. of Labor, 1945). While no
aggregate data are reported by the Census Bureau or the USDA regarding gender
specific wages, there are anecdotes of women making wage advances. First, the USDA
explicitly pushed for wage equality between men and women at the peak of the war
(USDA, 1918). In California, women working under the direction of the Women's Land
Army were paid a minimum wage of $2/day or the market wage, whichever was greater
(Appendix Exhibit 1). Based on reports by the USDA, published in newspapers across
the country in 1918, the wage paid to the Women's Land Army was equivalent to the
daily wage that included room and board (Appendix Exhibit 2). To the extent that there


                                                  -8-
were real wage increases for women in agriculture, this would tend to increase the
opportunity cost of child bearing, at least in the short-run.

       As a result of high wages, farmers looked to mechanize. Between 1913 and 1930,
tractor adoption rates were most rapid in 1918 and 1919. In these years, the number of
tractors in service grew by 66 and 85 percent respectively. There has never been another
period in US history with such rapid tractor diffusion. Even in levels, the growth in
tractors at the end of WWI rival any other period in the first half of the 20th Century
(Carter et al., 2006). 8 While early tractors were not the general purpose machines they
are today (Gross, 2018), they allowed farmers, especially those in the upper Midwest, to
substitute capital for labor. The diffusion was indeed concentrated in the grain belts. For
example, over 9,000 tractors were put into service in 1919 in Iowa alone, accounting for
approximately 10 percent of all tractors nationally (New York Times, 1919). In Ohio, the
number of tractors on farms doubled between 1918 and 1919 (Chicago Daily Tribune,
1919). In some cases, such as in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Committee on Public
Safety and Defense purchased 40 tractors to ensure that the labor supply shortage
would not interfere with planting corn and oats (Adams County Independent, 1918).
Theoretically, how mechanization impacts fertility is ambiguous (Rosenzweig, 1977).

       The agricultural boom in the US was short-lived as it was followed by an abrupt
and unexpected bust. The fields of Europe recovered quickly following the signing of the
Treaty of Versailles. For example, Buyst and Franaszek (2010) report that crop specific
yields recovered for most of Europe by 1922. Even Russia, in the midst of a civil war,
was able to increase its agricultural output to pre-war levels by the mid-1920s
(Markevich and Harrison, 2011). Throughout the 1920s, agricultural commodity prices
continued to fluctuate, although to a lesser extent than the WWI period.

3. Data

       To estimate the relationship between the WWI agricultural boom/bust cycle and
fertility, we combine data from the county-level agricultural Census with two different

samples detailing fertility. First, we construct a newly digitized dataset of county-level
birth counts that predate the Federal Birth Registration Area (BRA), sourced from state
health reports between 1910 and 1930 for 26 states. Second, we turn to the complete
count public use data from the US Population Census for the years 1910, 1920, and 1930
(Ruggles et al., 2020).

Population and Agricultural Data

        To create the agricultural price index at the county-level, we follow Rajan and
Ramcharan (2015) and Jaremski and Wheelock (forthcoming). We begin by collecting
county-level output for 11 crops (corn, wheat, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, flaxseed,
cotton, tobacco, Irish potatoes, and sweet potatoes) from the 1910 Census of Agriculture
(Haines, Fishback, and Rhode, 2018). We then multiply each county's 1910 crop output
,,1910 , by the crop's annual national price, , , drawn from Carter et al. (2006) to
compute the annual county-level crop revenue. 9 Finally, we normalize the annual
county-level crop revenue by the average county-level revenue for the period 1908 and
1914, using the average crop price,  .


                                                    11

By fixing the output at the 1910 value, and using national prices, we ensure that the
variation we exploit is exogenous to the decisions of local farmers. For instance, we do
not have to be concerned with the potential of endogenous crop mixes in response to the
movement in prices.

        In Figure 3, we highlight the time variation in the index. Beginning in 1915, the
time when agriculture began to collapse in Europe, crop prices begin to rise
dramatically, reaching a peak in 1918, with prices increasing by over 250 percent.
Following the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, agricultural prices fell
dramatically, yet remained above their pre-WWI level. Given prewar agricultural

(1991) style variables, noting that their validity depends on the exogeneity of the initial shares, in our
case ,,1910. In our context, agricultural productivity and crop choice was largely driven by agro-
climatic variables, such as precipitation, temperature, soil type, and the biological pest environment.

                                                   -10-
production and crop specialization patterns, there was significant heterogeneity across
space in terms of the local intensity of the agricultural boom. Cotton, Irish Potatoes,
Tobacco, and Flaxseed all experienced price increases exceeding 300%. Thus, areas such
as the Southeast, where cotton and tobacco are grown, experienced relatively larger
shocks than the Midwest or West. Similarly, portions of Minnesota and North Dakota,
experienced relatively larger price spikes due to their production of flax. In Figure 4,
Panels A-C, we highlight the spatial temporal variation in the index for the years 1914,
1919, and 1930.

        In addition to the data from the Census of Agriculture, we also merge several
county-level economic and demographic variables from the 1910 population census
(Haines, 2010). The primary variables we use include the population, percent non-
white, percent urban, percent aged 6-14, percent illiterate, and the value of
manufactured goods per capita.

Annual County Level Birth Data

        Our first measure of fertility is comprised of county-level birth counts
constructed from a combination of Birth Registration Area data and State Board of
Health Reports sources. We begin with county-level birth data reported by the Federal
Birth Registration Area (Eriksson, Niemesh, and Thomasson, 2018). The Federal Birth
Registration Area (BRA) was formed in 1915, and, at its inception included 10 states,
primarily in the Northeast and upper Midwest. States joined the BRA following an
application and certification process, whereby the US Census Bureau verified that the
state in question accurately recorded 95 percent of births. The BRA was not complete
until 1933, when Texas joined. To supplement these data, we collected and entered
county-level birth data using a combination of state health department annual reports,
state vital statistics annual reports, and state board of health monthly and quarterly
bulletins published prior to a state's entry into the BRA back to 1910. To appear in the
sample, a state must not have missing data for more than 1 year between 1910 and its
entry into the BRA. We are able to construct a county-level birth panel covering 26
states between 1910 and 1930 (see Appendix Figure 2). 10 In Appendix Table 1 we report
the year that each state in our sample entered the BRA and the years for which we
collected and coded the state-level reports.

        The advantage of the county-level data are that they allow us to test for
instantaneous responses in fertility associated with the WWI boom and bust. However,
these data also have limitations. First, the states that appear in our sample tend to be
located in the northeast, upper Midwest, and Pacific Coast. Thus, our county-level
sample does not use the most extreme variation stemming from large swings in cotton

10Each state set their own policy in regards to the tracking of vital statistics. In many cases, states did
not pass enabling legislation early enough to begin the certification process to enter the Census Birth
Registration Area or Death Registration Area during our sample period.

and tobacco prices. Secondly, given the reporting accuracy requirements to enter the
BRA, an obvious concern with the use of pre-BRA data is its reliability (i.e.,
measurement error).

        Eriksson, Niemesh, and Thomasson (2018) point out that even after states
entered the BRA, there are discrepancies between the US Population Census and the
BRA birth counts. They also document that the most sever discrepancies occur in the
South, which is largely missing from our sample. To examine the quality of reporting in
our sample, we aggregate the county-year observations to the state-year level and
correlate the state-year totals to the state-birth cohort totals from the complete counts of
the population Census. In Figure 4, Panel A, we highlight the correlation between the
state health report sample (x-axis) and the 1920 complete count Census (y-axis). The
correlation between these two data sources is 0.988. Similarly, in Figure 5, Panel B, we
highlight the correlation between the state health report data the 1930 Census. In 1930,
the correlation is 0.992. 11

11These data reflect a correction made to the Eriksson, Niemesh, and Thomasson (2018) data. In the
original data, the birth counts for New York City are underreported by an order of magnitude. We
have corrected these drawing on data from Fifty-First Annual Report of the State Department of
Health for the Year Ending December 31, 1930: Volume 2 Division of Vital Statistics. Burland
Printing Co. New York. 1931. In Appendix Figure 3, we highlight how this correction affects the
correlation.

       While there is a strong correlation between the county-level data and the Census
data, there still may be a lingering concern that the reporting quality is suspect. Our
estimates would be biased if measurement error is systematically correlated with
movements in agricultural commodity prices. To alleviate these types of measurement
concerns, our regressions include a variety of county-level covariates, county fixed
effects, year fixed effects, and state-year fixed effects.

       Our county-level dataset consists of 27,969 county-year observations. In several
specifications, we restrict this sample, dropping counties with populations above the
90th percentile of the 1910 population. We do this to ensure that our estimates are
driven by changes in agricultural commodity prices and are not driven by other
economic consequences of WWI such as industrial growth in urban centers. Table 1
includes summary statistics of the county-level dataset. Unsurprisingly, removing the
right tail of the population distribution reduces the mean number of annual births per
county, manufacturing output per capita in 1900, and the fraction of the population
classified as urban in 1910. Otherwise, the restriction does not drastically affect the
variable means. As mentioned above, we supplement the available control variables with
extensive fixed effects.

Individual Level Dataset

       Given the trade-offs of the county-level dataset, we turn to the complete count
microdata from the 1910, 1920, and 1930 Census (Ruggles et al., 2020). In this sample,
we focus on women aged 14-49, not living in group quarters. Across the three waves of
the census, this amounts to over 49 million woman-year observations. In several
specifications we will limit our attention to women who were more likely of child
bearing age (under 35), of which there are approximately 25 million observations in the
sample. As would be expected, women in the under 35 sample have more children under
the age of 5 and less total children than the full sample. We will further consider similar
population restrictions, dropping women living in the most populated counties based on
1910 population counts. The rural, under age 35 sample contains just over 12 million
women. Importantly, restricting the sample to rural areas increases the probability that
a woman is living on the farm from 25 percent in the under 35 sample to 46 percent in
the rural sample. Women under the age of 35 living in less populated counties have
more children and are less likely to be white, likely reflecting both the importance of
child labor on farms and our pre-Great Migration period of analysis.

4. Empirical Strategy
         In what follows, we seek to estimate the reduced form relationship between a
measure of fertility and the agricultural index. A naïve regression of births on income

                                                       -16-
would likely produce biased results for two reasons. First, births may have a causal
impact on income. This is particularly a concern in agriculture where children provide
labor for the family. Second, omitted variables which affect both income and fertility
could bias the estimates in a naïve regression; health and productivity are two examples
of important characteristics which cannot be directly measured yet surely play a role in
determining births and income.
     To address these concerns, we exploit exogenous variation in the prices of different
crops. The primary specification when using the county-level dataset derived from state
health reports is:
                           
              , =  + ,-1 +  ,  +  +  +  , .                                           (1)

The dependent variable is the log number of births in county c and year t. The primary
coefficient of interest is  which should capture the lagged effect of the previous year's
crop index on county births. We use the lagged value of the index rather than the
contemporaneous value given the nine month gestation period. Year () and county ()
fixed effects account for national differences over time and stationary differences
between counties, respectively. The vector X is comprised of interactions between the
year fixed effects and various baseline county-level characteristics. These controls are
measured in 1910 and include the fraction of the population who is non-white, between
the ages of 6 and 14, illiterate, and living in urban areas with over 2500 residents. We
also interact year fixed effects with county-level manufacturing output per capita in
1910. By interacting these baseline observable characteristics with year fixed effects, this
specification should net out differential trends in these dimensions which may otherwise
be picked up by the lagged crop index.

        Estimating the impact of the crop index on births using decennial census data
requires alternative specifications due to the timing of the data collection and variable
availability. Ideally, we would be able to use a measure of completed fertility, however
this variable is not available in either the 1920 or 1930 Census. 12 The two primary
dependent variables we use from the complete count data are the total number of


12We are primarily interested in how agricultural prices affected fertility, making the "children ever
born" variable another relevant outcome. Unfortunately, this variable is only available in the 1910
and 1940 censuses.

                                                 -17-
children in the household and the number of children under age 5. Given the available
data, our specification compares women of the same age across Census years, netting
out time specific and county specific effects. Because the available variables represent
the cumulative fertility response over multiple years, each woman must be assigned a
cumulative or average crop index. When investigating the impact on children under the
age of 5, we use the average county index over the last 5 years. When focusing on the
total number of children we use the average county index over the previous decade. The
general specification when using the census data is:

            ,, =  +  ,, + ,,  +  +  + ,, .                                    (2)

The observations are at the mother (i), county of residence (c), and census year (t) level.
The index variable is one of those described above and is assigned to each mother based
on her age and county of residence. Census year fixed effects () and county fixed effects
() are included, as are fixed effects for age, marital status, race, size of residence
location (based on total population), and whether the mother lives on a farm. The
dependent variable is either the woman's total number of kids at the time of the census
or the number of children under age 5 at the time of the census.

   Both equation (1) and (2) are intended to address the same underlying question: how
did the agricultural commodity boom (and subsequent bust) impact fertility decisions?
A priori, it is unclear whether the estimates from both specifications should point in the
same direction. For instance, fertility could immediately fall during the war time boom
due to increased labor scarcity and increased opportunity cost of childbearing. However,
at the war's conclusion, as labor demand subsides, and the supply constraint is lessoned
as men return from Europe, women may simply retime children, resulting in no net
change in total children in the long-run. Similarly, the sudden wealth shock could lead
to an immediate increase in child bearing, while in the long-run there is no change in
the total number of children born.

5. Estimates

   Below we present our estimates from several different empirical specifications. We
proceed by discussing our estimates in the short-run by examining the county-year


                                             -18-
sample and the complete count sample that focuses on children under 5 in the
household. We then discuss several robustness checks that address many of the
potential confounds. After describing the short-run estimates, we outline our estimates
over a longer time horizon (10 years), where it is possible for families to adjust along
multiple dimensions. After highlighting our main empirical estimates, we explore some
of the underlying mechanisms and heterogeneity along key dimensions: the cost of
children and labor intensity.

5.1 Short-Run Fertility Effects of Agricultural Boom

       In Table 3, we report our estimates from equation (1) and equation (2). In Panel
A, we report the baseline results using the county-level birth sample. Panel B includes
the estimates using the number of children under age 5 as the outcome of interest. In
each case, we report standard errors in parenthesis, clustered at the county level. 13
Using the county-level sample, we find that on average, a doubling of the agricultural
price index results in 4.4 percent fewer births in a county. After dropping urban
counties, we find that births fall by 5.2 percent for a doubling of agricultural prices.
When we include our set of county level covariates, the magnitude our estimate
increases to a decline of 8.03 percent. Given an average of 412 births per rural county,
our estimates suggest that there were between 21 and 33 fewer births per county-year
given a doubling in agricultural prices. Evaluating at the average agricultural index value
throughout the period, our estimates suggest a 2.9 percent reduction in fertility. Given
the 29 percentage point decline in aggregate fertility, 1910-1930, the agricultural price
volatility explains about 10 percent of the overall decline. In Appendix Table 2, we
document heterogeneity in the fertility response by focusing on subsamples of the data
that are increasingly agricultural. There we show that the magnitude of the decline is
increasing in the share of the county acreage in farms.




13We have also computed Conley (1999) standard errors for the county sample using a distance
cutoff of 100 miles. The main result of Panel A remains statistically significant at the 10% level
despite larger standard errors. We use county-level standard errors in order to be consistent across
datasets. For the complete count estimates we have also computed the more conservative state level
standard errors and find no meaningful differences.

     Notes: Panel A estimated using the county-level birth records. Panel B uses the complete count for 1910-1930.
     Every regression includes county and year fixed effects. Panel A controls include separate interactions between
     year fixed effects and baseline fractions of population who are non-white, between the ages of 6 and 14, and
     living in an urban area, as well as interactions with a baseline manufacturing output per capita. Panel B controls
     include dummy variables for age, race, marital status, farm status, and population size of place of residence. The
     population restriction drops the counties which are in the top 10 percent of population in 1910. The age
     restriction in Panel B is for women under the age of 35. Standard errors clustered at the county level: *** p <
     0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1



       The instantaneous decline in births could simply reflect retiming due to the war
disruption. Indeed, a model that allows for household savings would predict that the
number of children born should fall in the current period when female wages rise, but
the increase in savings would result in more children in the future. We now turn to the
complete count data samples in Panels B. In Panel B, we report the estimated impact of
the average agricultural price index over the previous 5 years on the number of children
under the age of 5 in the household. We estimate that a doubling of the price index over
a 5-year period results in 0.113 fewer children under the age of five in the home. During
our sample period, the average 5-year price index was 1.44 and the average number of
children under age 5 was 0.61. Thus, on average, we estimate that the agricultural boom
reduced the number of young children by about 8.1 percent relative to the mean. For
younger women, who are more likely to be of child bearing age, we estimate a larger
effect. For an average doubling of the index over 5 years, the coefficient increases to


                                                            -20-
0.203. Given slightly higher rates of young children in the home (0.85), the relative
decline in young children among women under age 35 is 10.5 percent. For these same
young women living in rural areas, the effect is similar, we find an 8.9 percent decline in
children under age 5. Thus, in the intermediate run, there seems to be no evidence that
the estimates from the county-level data reflect retiming alone.

       One caveat to interpreting the estimates between panels A and B is that the
complete count data include more states, and in particular, regions of the country where
the agricultural boom was much more pronounced (i.e., the South). To ensure
comparability between the complete count sample and the county sample estimates, we
restrict the complete count sample to only include states that appear in our annual
county-level panel. We report these estimates in Panel B, Column (4). When the sample
is restricted, we find that the coefficient remains negative and statistically significant (-
0.029), however, the magnitude falls. Still, the smaller estimate implies a 1.3 percent
reduction in the relative fertility rate. There are two likely explanations for the
difference in coefficient magnitude. The first is that the counties in our restricted sample
are those who experience less severe swings in crop prices. The second is that the labor
intensity of agriculture is lower in the restricted sample, which may dampen the
opportunity cost channel.

       Our findings are strikingly similar to those reported by Schultz (1985), who
examines the impacts of commodity price shocks to crops that utilize gender specific
labor in Sweden (butter and grain). Our estimates are also similar in magnitude to those
reported by Aaronson, Lange, and Mazumder (2014) for cohorts who were completely
exposed to the rollout of Rosenwald schools (7.2-9.5 percent) during roughly the same
era in the American South. The estimates are also similar to those reported by Bleakley
and Lange (2009), who explore the impact of hookworm eradication in the American
South. Our findings depart from that of recent work by Black, Kolesnikova, Sanders, and
Taylor (2013), who document increases in fertility during the Appalachian Coal Boom,
however in our agricultural setting, the opportunity cost of women's labor is likely
changing relative to the male wage, as documented anecdotally in the case of the
Women's Land Army, whereas increases in male earnings were the main driver of
income in the coal boom. Relative to recent work, our findings are consistent with work

                                             -21-
by Schaller (2016) who shows that fertility in increasing in the male wage, but
decreasing in the female wage.

5.2 Robustness ­ Complete Count Migration Sample Restrictions

       In the complete count sample, our model implicitly assumes that individuals
experience the intensity of the boom/bust based on where they are enumerated.
However, this assumption may be dubious, for instance, because of internal migration
or from immigration (although during and after WWI there were additional
immigration restrictions under Immigration Acts of 1917 and 1924). To ensure our
estimates are not driven by either internal migration or immigration, we restrict the
sample to individuals living in their state of birth. Further, we also estimate regressions
where we drop women who were born in a foreign country, given that we do not know
when they arrived to the United States. In each case, we maintain the restriction that
women are under the age of 35 and are living in non-urban areas. In Table 4, we report
the estimates from these specifications, standard errors are reported in parenthesis and
are clustered at the county level. In Column 1, we report our baseline estimate of -0.189
from Table 3, Panel B for comparison. In Column 2 we show that restricting the
population to individuals who have not left their state of birth has a minimal impact on
the estimate, which increases in magnitude to -0.193. In Column 3, we restrict the
sample to individuals who were born in the United States. Imposing this sample
restriction, we estimate a coefficient of -0.191. In both cases, the estimates are similar to
our baseline.

5.3 Robustness ­ Other Potential Confounds

       Given the time period, there are several potential confounds that raise concern.
First and foremost, our estimates could be the byproduct of a reduction in the
availability of prime age males as a result of WWI. Furthermore, as men returned from
Europe, America experienced the Spanish Influenza Pandemic (Almond, 2006; Beach et
al., 2018) which hit prime age males especially hard, which may have also impacted
fertility patterns. If the spread of the flu were correlated with the boom, then our fertility
estimates would be biased. Our time period also contains several secular movements
that likely alter the returns to children, either through changes in the underlying health
risk, or through their future labor market returns. For example, the period we examine
is squarely in the middle of the public health and high school movements.

       The United States drafted over 4 million men during WWI. Therefore, our
estimates could be the result of fewer available partners and not due to the agricultural
boom/bust. Further, local draft boards had significant discretion in the administration
of deferments, which could be given on the basis of occupation. Thus, it's possible that
the agricultural boom and draft were correlated with one another. To limit the impact of
the draft on our estimates, we have collected and coded the Final Report of the Provost
Marshal General (1920), that reports the number of men drafted in each draft precinct


                                                          -23-
(smaller than counties). We aggregate the WWI precinct level draft numbers to the
county-level and directly control for the number of men inducted.

        To address the potential impact of the Spanish Influenza we include a measure of
county-level exposure. To construct the Spanish Flu exposure measure we return to the
state health report sources and county-level vital statistics (Eriksson, Niemish, and
Thomasson, 2018) to construct an annual county-level panel of all-cause mortality. The
growing literature that assesses the impacts of the Spanish Flu in the United States
(Almond and Mazumder, 2005; Almond, 2006; Clay, Lewis, and Severnini, 2018;
Beach, Ferrie, and Saavedra, 2018; Brown and Thomas, 2018; Corriera, Luck, and
Verner, 2020) has thus far relied on either a cohort exposure design or a measure of
excess mortality derived from a sample of cities in the Census Death Registration Area.
Our all-cause mortality sample enables us to construct a measure of excess county-level
deaths with much greater geographic coverage (as described in Beach, Ferrie, and
Saavedra, 2018). We then interact the excess mortality measure with year fixed effects
for counties in the 25/26 states for which we were able to collect mortality statistics. The
county-level mortality sample and is new to the literature. 14,15 We highlight the spatial
variation in excess deaths in Appendix Figure 4.

        Following the end of WWI and the subsequent expansion of the franchise to
women, federal funds flowed to states via Sheppard-Towner to fund women and infant
care. With few exceptions, states accepted the federal funds (Moehling and Thomasson,
2012). Often time these funds were funneled through the states by recently formed or
expanded State Health Departments. As a result of the expanded public dollars, as well
as privately funded public health efforts that were underway, there was a rapid rollout of
County Health Offices (CHO) that administered a variety of preventative care measures,
educated the public, invested in clean water, and treated communicable disease. Hoehn-
Velasco (2018, 2019) documents that the rollout of CHO's reduced infant mortality and
increased later life earnings for treated boys. Outside of the public sector, there were


14 Iowa does not report county-level mortality until 1916, thus we omit Iowa from the sample.
Additionally, we also correct the Eriksson, Niemish, and Thomasson (2018) death counts for New
York City.
15 As an alternative, we directly control for the number of deaths in the county-year instead of using

the measure of excess mortality.

also major private interventions led by the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission (RSC) that
began before the breakout of WWI. In the South in particular, the RSC provided funding
and human resources to aid in two eradication campaigns, first hookworm, and then
malaria. Bleakley (2007, 2010) and Bleakley and Lange (2009) study how the RSC
campaigns affect the returns to schooling and changes in fertility.

          To ensure that our estimates isolate the impact of changing agricultural prices
rather than a combination of various health initiatives, we specify several robustness
checks. First, we estimate a set of regressions controlling for the opening of a CHO at the
county level and alternate measures of CHO efforts in the county using the data from
Hoehn-Velasco (2019). 16 We have also collected and re-coded the RSF hookworm
campaign data at the county level and include measures of the pre-eradication
hookworm infection rate, and interact that measure with year fixed effects. To address
the potential impact of malaria eradication, we have collected county-level malaria
mortality data from a combination of state health reports and state vital statistics
reports in 1937. One drawback of measuring malaria intensity in 1937 is that public
health efforts ramped up in the early 1930s (Kitchens, 2013), however, the measure is
collected before the arrival of DDT and subsequent eradication. The key benefit of
measuring malaria in 1937 is that it varies at the county-level, whereas prior work has
relied on either state-level measures of malaria (Bleakley, 2010) or imputed data relying
on variation in climatic variables when relatively few weather stations existed (Hong,
2007, 2011, 2013), which are effectively collinear with specifications that include state-
year effects. In Figure 5, we highlight the spatial variation in malaria and note that our
coverage is highly correlated with the implementation of the Malaria Control in War
Areas program (precursor to the CDC, see Appendix) 17 and the USPHS's DDT residual
spraying program carried out in the post WWII era (Centers for Disease Control, 1948).

       from state health reports and state vital statistics.

       Outside of health interventions, there were also targeted education interventions
during the period. One major change in the education system was the high school
movement and changes to state compulsory education laws. To address any potential
changes in the returns to children as educational opportunities change, we include
Goldin and Katz's (2008) measure of compulsory schooling. In addition to changes in
compulsory schooling laws that varied at the state-year level, there were also targeted
interventions that vary at the county-year level. One notable example is the creation of
Rosenwald Schools that targeted blacks in the South. There is evidence that these
schools improved educational attainment for blacks (Aaronson and Mazumder, 2011)
and subsequently impacted fertility and long-run mortality (Aaronson, Lange, and
Mazumder, 2014; Aaronson, Mazumder, Sanders, and Taylor, 2017). To ensure that our
results are not driven by changes in the returns to education in the South via Rosenwald
Schools, we directly control for their presence.

       In Table 5, we report the estimates when controlling for these additional
confounds. In Panel A, we include the additional controls to our regressions that
examine changes in the annual number of births at the county-level, while in Panel B we
report estimates using the complete count sample of women under age 35, living in rural
areas. In Column 1 we replicate our preferred baseline estimates from Table 3. In
Column 2 we report the estimate when restricting to the 26 states in the state health
report sample. Column 3 adds controls for the number of men drafted into WWI. In
Column 4 we include controls for the exposure to the Spanish Influenza. In Column 5 we


                                                -26-
include controls that account for the rollout of County Health Organizations. In Column
6, we add controls for the Rockefeller Foundation's Hookworm eradication campaign. In
Column 7 we include controls to account for the possible impact of malaria. In Column 8
we report our estimates when controlling for the presence of a Rosenwald School, and in
Column 9, we add controls to capture changes in compulsory schooling laws. Moving
across the columns, it is clear that the inclusion of these additional controls has little
impact on our estimate of the agricultural index on the number of births the following
year. Similarly, in Panel B, we report our estimates using the complete count sample
with the number of children under age 5 as the outcome of interest. In general, the
estimates are qualitatively similar to our preferred specification. When comparing the
impact of the Spanish Influenza controls, it is important to compare the coefficient in
Panel B, Column 4 to the coefficient reported in Panel B, Column 2, given the
underlying differences in the states included in the two main samples. If anything,
stronger educational requirements in the form of compulsory schooling laws may
reduce the magnitude of the coefficient slightly.

5.4 Long-Run Fertility Effects of Agricultural Boom

       We now examine how variation in the price index over the prior 10 years impacts
the number of children in the household. A priori, it is not clear if fertility will rise or fall
in response to elevated agricultural prices over an extended period. In the long-run,
elevated levels of income may allow farmers to adopt new technologies or increase
capital intensity to alleviate the strain on labor markets. Alternatively, savings from the
boom period may allow families to retime and replace or expand. To the extent that
children are complements (substitutes) to the farm capital, the number of children may
increase (decrease). Likewise, if farms are more profitable, or pay higher wages, it may
influence the decisions of children to stay on the farm longer as they mature, as
highlighted by Rosenzweig (1977). Therefore, a change in the number of children in the
household could reflect changes in when children exit the household rather than
changes in the number of children born.

Notes: Panel A uses the county-level birth records (N = 23,216) while Panel B uses the 1910-1930 complete count (N = 12,037,770). Every regression includes county and year fixed
effects. Panel A controls include separate interactions between year fixed effects and baseline fractions of population who are non-white, between the ages of 6 and 14, and living in an
urban area, as well as interactions with a baseline manufacturing output per capita. Panel B controls include dummy variables for age, race, marital status, farm status, and population
size of place of residence. The population restriction drops the counties which are in the top 10 percent of population in 1910. The age restriction in Panel B is for women under the age
of 35. Each robustness control variable is measured at the county-level. Total WWI inductions are interacted with year fixed effects. Spanish Flu Exposure is measured by the excess
mortality from trend, interacted with year fixed effects. In Panel A, (N=21244) due to the loss of observations from Iowa. In Panel B, (N=5,604,615) due to the restricted 25 state
sample. CHO is the annual expenditure by County Health Organizations. The Rockefeller Foundation control interacts the percent hookworm infections between 1912-1914 with year
fixed effects. The malaria control is described in the text and interacted with year fixed effects. Rosenwald School expenditure is measured annually. Separate dummy variables are
used to control for the age at which children could work and how many years of schooling were required for children to receive work permits (Goldin and Katz, 2003). Standard errors

       Measuring the long-run fertility effects with the complete count data
recommends slightly different sample restrictions. We would ideally observe completed
fertility or the total number of children ever born, but the closest variable collected in
each of the Census years from 1910-1930 is the total number of children in the
household at the time of the survey. Younger women have not yet finished having
children while older women will no longer have all of their children still living at home.
For the long-run fertility regressions, we restrict our analysis to women between the
ages of 30 and 40. We selected this age window because it will better capture the total
fertility of women than the under 35 group. Furthermore, we limit the influence of
endogenous household exit of children on our estimates by excluding women who are
older than 40. The final two columns of Table 2 show that women between the ages of
30-40 have more total kids in the household but fewer children under the age of five
than the under 35 group. They also have more children of any age than the full sample,
reflecting the influence of household exit. While the summary statistics suggest that the
total number of children for women aged 30-40 is the closest measure to completed
fertility reported in the Census, children may have already exited the household at the
time of enumeration and some women in the sample have not completed their fertility.

       In Table 6, we report estimates that use variation in the average agricultural price
index over the previous 10 years, related to the total number of children in the home.
Here we find that for a doubling in prices over a 10-year period, there is a 0.29 reduction
in total children relative to a sample mean of 2.19 children. Given an average 10-year
price index of 1.24, this suggest that on average, there was a 3.17 percent reduction in
children. Focusing on women who were between the ages of 30-40, we estimate a
negative coefficient of 0.466. Evaluated at the mean number of children and the average
price index experienced by women aged 30-40, this implies a 6.05 percent decline in
children. Further restricting to rural areas, we estimate a negative coefficient of 0.447,
which translates to a 4.97 percent decline in total children. In Column (4), we report the
estimate restricting the sample to include the same states used in the county-level
annual birth sample. Here the coefficient changes signs, which may be due changes in




                                             -29-
the composition of the sub-sample or unobservable changes in state policy. 18 Later in
the paper we explore sources of heterogeneity some of which may be related to the
change in sign. Finally, in Columns (5) and (6), we report estimates from samples that
restrict to people living in their state of birth (Column 5), or to mothers born in the
United States (Column 6). These restrictions have little impact on the estimated
coefficient, alleviating concerns that our results reflect selective migration.

6. Mechanisms

         Models of fertility and agricultural production point to a few key mechanisms
that would drive our estimated net decline in fertility. First and foremost, a change in
the agricultural wage increases the opportunity cost of women's time. While there are no
known gender specific wage data for our period, we can at least test for changes in the
agricultural wage bill directly and examine two indirect measures that that are strongly
correlated with the female wage. First, we can explore how the labor intensity of
agriculture in a given location interacts with the fertility response. Second, we can
explore how the agricultural shock impacts the timing of marriage.




18The estimated coefficient in Table 6, Column 4 is sensitive to the specification. For
example with the inclusion of State x Year Fixed effects we estimate a coefficient of -
0.274 with a standard error of (0.135).
                                                                 -30-
       Fertility would also decline if capital investments were substitutable for child
labor. Using data on the value of farm implements at the county level from the
agricultural census, we test for changes in capital adoption. Additionally, changes in the
costs of raising children could affect the fertility rate. As Dettling and Kearney (2014)
and Lovenheim and Mumford (2013) note, housing is one of the largest costs of child
rearing. Because the WWI agricultural boom had large impacts on land markets, we
explore the potential for heterogeneous impacts for farm owner/operators and renters.

6.1 Agricultural Wages

       The Census of Agriculture provides information regarding farm wage bills (which
may reflect changes in labor hired or the wage), making it possible to understand how
the boom impacted labor costs. Here we test whether the agricultural boom led to higher
wage bills for farmers. We construct a county-level panel for the years 1909, 1919, 1925,
and 1930 drawing on Haines, Fishback, and Rhode (2018). We consider two different
specifications, the first regresses the log of the wage bill on the average agricultural price
index over the previous 5 years, while the second regresses the log of the wage bill on a
10-year average of the agricultural price index. In the regressions we control for a
variety of important controls interacted with year fixed effects, including: the percent
non-white in 1910, share of children in 1910, percent illiterate, percent urban, the value
of manufacturing per capita, and, in some specifications, 1910 cotton acreage. We
control for cotton acreage in some specifications because cotton was hand-picked during
this era and relied on long term relational labor contracts (Alston and Ferrie, 1993),
thus, the wage effects may differ.

          Notes: Data from the 1909, 1919, 1925, and 1930 agricultural census. Each regression has N =
          9,745 and includes county and year fixed effects. Each regression includes separate interactions
          between year fixed effects and baseline fractions of population who are non-white, between the ages
          of 6 and 14, and living in an urban area, as well as interactions with a baseline manufacturing output
          per capita. Baseline fraction of crops comprised of cotton controlled for in even columns. Standard
          errors clustered at the county-level: *** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1



       Our estimates in Table 7 document a sharp rise in the wage bill, ranging from an
increase of 30- 34.8 percent nationwide. When we control for cotton acreage, the
estimated coefficients increase to 40.3-43.6 percent. While these estimates may sound
extreme, anecdotally, they are consistent with backward looking reports by the US Dept.
of Labor (1945) that document a doubling of nominal agricultural wages during WWI.
While the agricultural wages reported by the Census are not gender specific, these
estimates set the stage for increased female labor participation, which would in turn
increase the opportunity cost of child bearing.

6.2 Labor Intensity

        Until the 1950s cotton and tobacco were primarily hand-picked, while many
grain crops were partially or fully mechanized. Women and children played an
important role in the cotton harvest, and were often times just as productive as their
male counterparts (Olmstead and Rhode, 2018; Logan, 2015). In the spirit of Shultz
(1985), this may suggest that the relative wage increase for women working in cotton
and tobacco was larger than women working in grain production. Therefore, women in
labor intensive locations should experience a larger increase in their opportunity cost of
child bearing, resulting in fewer children.

       To test this potential mechanism, we construct an index of labor intensity per
acre in production. We take the quantities produced of each of the 11 crops that
comprise our agricultural price index and multiply them by the number of labor hours


                                                          -32-
used to produce a given quantity, which we draw from the USDA's Labor Used to
Produce Field Crops, Statistical Bulletin No. 346 (USDA, 1964). We then normalize the
number of labor hours by the number of acres in production, based on reports in the
1910 agricultural census (Fishback, Haines, Rhode, 2018). 19,20 In Figure 6, we highlight
the variation in the labor intensity index. Not surprisingly, places such as the
Mississippi River Delta, upper Piedmont of South Carolina, and Tobacco Row in North
Carolina exhibit the highest measures of labor intensity per acre in production. To better
understand the impact that labor intensity in agriculture has on fertility outcomes, we
modify equations (1) and (2) by adding an interaction between the labor intensity
measure and the agricultural index.

          In Table 8, we report the estimated impact of the agricultural price index and the
labor intensity agricultural price index interaction term. As in our baseline, we find that
fertility is negatively related to increases in the agricultural price index. We also find
that when holding constant the agricultural price index, that there is a further decline in
fertility as the labor intensity of agriculture increases. While this is not direct evidence
that increases in female opportunity costs are the main mechanism contributing to our
estimated decline, it is consistent with the potential mechanism.




                                                                     11

19   Formally, we define the labor index as follows:   ,1910 =                ,1910

20   Related work from the modern development literature also highlights the heterogeneous impacts
that the labor intensity of crops can have on child investments. For example, work by Kruger (2007)
documents that price spikes in raw coffee beans lead to declines in child education. On the other
hand, positive price shocks for other crops have been shown to increase the education investments in
children (Cogneau and Jedwab, 2012).

              Notes: The labor intensity index is constructed by taking 1910 output quantities from
              the Agricultural Census for the 11 crops used to produce the agricultural price index. We
              then multiply the output by the labor hours required to produce the output using values
              from the USDA's Labor Used to Produce Field Crops, Statistical Bulletin No. 346 (USDA,
              1964). Finally, we normalize the index by the acres in production in each county in 1910.

6.3 Delayed Marriage

        A large literature in labor economics explores the impact that positive wage
shocks have on the age of marriage for young women. Increases in the relative wages of
women result in marital delay (Becker, 1981; Blau, Kahn, and Waldfogel. 2000; Hankins
and Hoekstra, 2011; Jensen, 2012; Salisbury, 2017). Delayed marriage also reduces
fertility (Bharadwaj, 2015) by delaying sex or changing the incentives to acquire
education. Marriage delay may also lead to changes in intra-household bargaining
resulting in smaller families (Ashraf, Field, and Lee, 2014; Hahn et al., 2018).

        To test whether the agricultural boom delayed marriage, we take advantage of a
question in the 1930 Census that asks women their age at first marriage. Using this
measure, we estimate the relationship between the agricultural price index, 1910-1919,
and age of first marriage for the subset of women who were of marital age and
unmarried at the outbreak of WWI. More specifically, our sample consists of women
who were at least 15 years old in 1915. The regressions control for a set of age, race, size
of place, and farm status indicator variables.

   Notes: The age of first marriage is taken from the 1930 complete count. The average index over 1910-1919 is interacted
   with a dummy variable for not being married in 1915; each column is restricted to women who were 15 or older in
   1915. The population restriction drops the counties which are in the top 10 percent of population in 1910. Column 3
   restricts the sample to women who were married by 1930. Standard errors clustered at the county-level: *** p < 0.01,
   ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.01



        In Table 9, we report our estimates that relate the agricultural price index to the
age of first marriage. Column 1 reports the estimate for all women who were at least 15

years old and unmarried as of 1915. Across the entire population of women, there is no
statistically significant delay in marriage. However, many of the young women in this
sample are living in cities. In Column 2, we restrict the sample to women living in rural
areas and estimate a positive and statistically significant, 4.668 year delay in marriage.
During the period 1910-1919, the average of the agricultural index was 1.47, thus, for
every year exposed to the average boom, marriage is delayed by 0.22 years. In Column
3, we restrict the sample to women who married by 1930. 21 When we make this
restriction the estimated delay in marriage increases to 5.419 years. Scaling the
coefficient based on the mean boom 1910-1919, suggests that for every year a women
was exposed to the average boom, they delayed marriage by 0.25 years. Our finding of
delayed marriage stemming from agricultural shocks is consistent with recent work by
Corno, Hildebrandt, and Voena (forthcoming). If increases in opportunity costs are the
main driver of marriage delay, marriage should be delayed more in places where
agriculture is more labor intensive. In Column 4, we report the estimates of a triple
interaction between the agricultural labor index, the crop price index, and an indicator
for being unmarried as of 1915. From this specification, it is clear the marriage is
delayed even further in places where agriculture is more labor intensive.

6.4 Capital Adoption

       While rural areas traditionally lacked credit to finance fixed capital investments,
both Rajan and Ramcharan (2015) and Jaremski and Wheelock (forthcoming) point out
that the WWI Boom increased the availability of lending and new unit banks opened to
fund land and capital purchases during the boom. Indeed a doubling of agricultural
prices increased lending by approximately 24 percent. Given the tight labor markets,
availability of cash, and expanded access to savings, it is possible that farmers were able
to increase the rate of capital adoption. As we described previously, the interwar period
is the era of most rapid tractor diffusion in the 20th Century. The adoption of additional
capital could partially explain the decline in fertility if farm capital substitutes for labor.
From the agricultural Census, we take a measure of farm capital, the value of farm
implements, and regress it on the average agricultural price index over the previous 5

21Non-responses or never-married women are coded as zeros, which explains why the delay
increases when they are removed from the sample.

and 10 years. The baseline regressions include controls for county and year fixed effects.
In additional specifications, we also control for 1910 cotton acreage, interacted with year
fixed effects. We do this because cotton had one of the largest boom/bust cycles,
however, due to the available technology, was unable to mechanize until the 1950s.

       In Table 10, we report our estimates using the log value of farm implements as
the dependent variable. In Column (1) and Column (3) we report the estimates
excluding the cotton acreage control. We find that on average there is no statistically
significant relationship between the agricultural price index and the value of farm
implements. However, when the cotton acreage controls are included in Column (2) and
Column (4), the estimated coefficient is positive and statistically significant. The
estimate suggests that a doubling of agricultural prices over a 5 and 10-year period
increases capital investment by between 36.7 and 42.5 percent. These estimates suggest
that outside of the South, capital was rapidly adopted.

         Notes: The value of farm implements is taken from the 1909, 1919, 1925, and 1930 agricultural
         census. The first two columns use the average agricultural price index over the previous decade while
         the last two columns use the average index over the previous five years. Each regression has N = 9,751
         and includes county and year fixed effects. Each regression includes separate interactions between
         year fixed effects and baseline fractions of population who are non-white, between the ages of 6 and
         14, and living in an urban area, as well as interactions with a baseline manufacturing output per capita.
         Baseline fraction of crops comprised of cotton controlled for in even columns. Standard errors
         clustered at the county-level: *** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1



       Earlier in the paper, we found that in our complete count samples, when
restricting the sample to the same states that appear in the annual county-level sample,
that the estimated magnitudes were smaller (5 Year Average) and at times became
positive (10 year). Our estimates regarding the value of implements may suggest that
when possible, capital substituted for child labor and alleviated the labor supply
shortage in the medium run.

6.5 Ownership Effects

       To test for the differential impact that owners and renters experienced during the
agricultural boom, we modify equations (1) and (2) by including an interaction term that
measures the share of farms that are owner-operated in the county in 1910. We report
the results of this modified specification in Table 11. Starting with the county-level birth
sample in Panel A, we continue to estimate a negative relationship between the
agricultural price index and fertility. Focusing on the interaction term, our estimates
using the annual county level sample are small and statistically insignificant.

   In Panels B and C, we report our estimates from the complete count samples that
focus on the number of children under age 5 and total children. As before, we continue
to estimate a negative and statistically significant relationship between the agricultural
index and fertility, but farm ownership effects appear to be important in these lower
panels. The coefficients in Panel B indicate that a move from zero percent owner-
occupied farms to 100 percent owner-occupied firms would cut the decline in fertility by
between half and two-thirds. This suggests that the wealth/income effects are partially
offsetting the dominant substitution effect. Similarly, in Panel C, we find that moving
from zero to complete ownership also reduces the magnitude of the decline in fertility,
however, its effect is smaller over the 10-year time horizon.

7. Conclusions
      Identifying the causal relationship between income and fertility continues to be
an important goal for economists, one with substantial implications for demography
and policy design. In this paper, we presented evidence that income shocks with the
potential to disproportionately change the opportunity costs of women can have
significant impacts on fertility decisions. The agricultural boom-and-bust of WWI,
which differentially affected the output prices of farms across the US based on their

                                                           -39-
preexisting composition of crops, provided the necessary exogenous variation to study
how families responded to income shocks. Analysis using newly-digitized annual birth
records revealed that counties with larger price shocks experienced larger fertility
declines in the short-run. This pattern was confirmed using an alternative measure of
short-run fertility (children under the age of 5) in the complete count Census data. An
important follow-on question is whether women simply retimed their fertility to take
advantage of temporary wage increases. This does not appear to be the case: results
focusing on the total number of children in the household from the complete count
support the conclusion that these price shocks lowered the long-run fertility of affected
women.

       In addition to the main analysis of how the price index affected fertility, we
investigated potential mechanisms which could partially explain the estimates. The
most direct channel is arguably farm wages, which we found to increase the most in
counties most affected by the price shock. As discussed above, there is anecdotal
evidence of considerable wage equality in agriculture during this time period, meaning
women in our sample faced higher wages, and therefore higher opportunity costs of
childbearing, directly. We also found that places with higher labor intensity and lower
ability to mechanize had larger negative fertility responses, consistent with the
opportunity cost theory. Pushing in the other direction, locations with higher rates of
owner-operated farms had relatively weaker negative responses to the price shocks. One
way of interpreting this pattern is that the income effect generated by the price shock
has a positive impact on fertility but that the substitution effect is overwhelmingly
dominant. Lastly, we found that the price shocks led to modest delays in marriage,
another possible explanation for lower fertility across multiple time horizons.

       Much of the literature on fertility and family size focuses on the theoretical
tradeoff between quality and quantity or how costs, both opportunity and explicit, have
changed over time. When children are also inputs to the household production function
rather than merely inputs to the parental utility function, the decision to have additional
children becomes more complex. This additional dimension is still present in
agricultural societies today even if many other factors (cultural, institutional, etc.) differ
from those in the US in the early 20th century. Although the roles and expectations of

                                             -40-
children have changed substantially over the last century, parents still consider
economic opportunities when deciding how many children to have. As policymakers
consider potential responses to the many challenges that declining fertility presents to
existing social programs, the results of this paper serve as a reminder that gender-
specific changes to opportunity costs are central to the discussion. Put another way,
there is more to the relationship between income and fertility than just income effects.

      Notes: Estimates using county-level birth records. Restrictions moving from left to right are based
      on the fraction of land used for farming in the county. Each regression includes county and year
      fixed effects as well as separate interactions between year fixed effects and baseline fractions of
      population who are non-white, between the ages of 6 and 14, and living in an urban area, as well as
      interactions with a baseline manufacturing output per capita. Standard errors clustered at the
      county-level: *** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1




  Appendix Figure 1 - US Fertility and Crude Birth Rate, 1910-1930




   Notes: National Vital Statistics System data (NVSS, 2017). The general fertility rate
   is the number of births per 1,000 women aged 15-44. The crude birth rate is the
   number of annual live births per 1,000 people in the country's population.

                    Panel A: Correlation without NYC Correction




                     (a) 1920                                     (b) 1930




                     Panel B: Correlation with NYC Correction




                     (b)    1920                                  (b) 1930
  Notes: Newly digitized birth counts from state health reports compared to complete count
  census data. The New York City correction accounts for changes in how the populations of
  NYC boroughs were recorded across the different datasets. The results are similar with or
  without this correction.

Influenza




Notes: We follow Beach, Ferrie, and Saavedra (2018) to construct the excess mortality from trend
1918-1920 to capture the local intensity of the Spanish Influenza. The underlying mortality data is
drawn from a combination of newly digitized all-cause mortality death county level counts from
various state health reports in 25 states and Eriksson, Niemesh, and Thomasson (2018).
