                 PRICING TO MARKET IN JAPANESE MANUFACTURING



                                  ABSTRACT



        This paper investigates pricing by Japanese manufacturing

firms    in   export and domestic markets.     The paper reports

equations explaining the margin between export prices in yen and
domestic prices for a wide range of final goods including many of

the electronic and transport products which have figured so

prominently in recent trade discussions.           Evidence is presented

showing that Japanese firms respond to changes in real exchange
rates by "pricing to market", varying their export prices in yen

relative to their domestic prices.           The empirical specification

makes it possible to disentangle planned changes in the margin

between export and domestic prices from inadvertent changes in

this margin due to unanticipated changes in exchange rates.               The

degree of pricing to market varies widely across products, but
there is strong evidence that pricing to market occurs.             The

paper also investigates whether pricing to market has increased
in scale in the period since 1985 when the yen began a sustained

appreciation, but finds that only five of seventeen products

experienced a shift in price behavior over that period.

     In the last ten years, exporting firms in the industrial

countries have had to cope with unprecedented changes in real

exchange rates.    In order to remain competitive, many firms in

these countries are said to have followed pricing policies

designed to keep export prices competitive despite changes in
exchange rates.    In response to an appreciation of the domestic

currency, for example, these firms have reduced the domestic

currency prices of products destined for export markets in order
to limit increases in the foreign currency prices of these

products.   Such pricing behavior, because it opens up a margin

between export and domestic prices of the same product, has been

termed "pricing to market" by Krugman (1987) and others.1

     This paper examines the pricing to market behavior of

Japanese manufacturing firms during the 1980s usIng an unusually
detailed set of export and domestic price data published by the

Bank of Japan.    The paper reports equations explaining the margin
between export and domestic prices for a wide range of final

goods including many of the electronic and transport products
which have figured so prominently in recent trade discussions,

For each product, pricing to market elasticities are estimated

which show how changes in real exchange rates lead to variations

in the ratio of export to domestic prices.   The empirical

specification makes it possible to disentangle planned changes in
the margin between export and domestic prices from inadvertent

changes in this margin due to unanticipated changes in exchange
rates.
    Most previous studies of foreign pricing have focused on

exchange rate pass—through rather than pricing to market.      The

two phenomena are closely related, as will be seen below, but

estimates of pass—through elasticities depend more critically on

the specification of cost functions. Estimates of pricing to

market elasticities, which measure how the ratio of export prices

to domestic prices respond to exchange rates, are less sensitive

to errors in specifying cost functions, since under most

conditions costs have little if any effect on this price ratio,

     The first section of the paper develops a model of pricing

to market based on the markup behavior   of exporting firms.

Markup behavior is crucial because it is through varying markups
that firms limit the impact of exchange rates on their

conpetitivemess.   Although the model allows for different types

of demand and cost behavior, it leads to a simple pricing to

market equation which specifies the margin between export and

donestic prices as a function of real exchange rates, real wages,

and other factors.   The second section investigates how the

margin between export and domestic prices may be temporarily
affected by unanticipated changes in exchange rates,    If firms

set prices in foreign currency for more than one period, then an

unanticipated depreciation or appreciation will change price
                                                     One of the
margins even in the absence of pricing to market.
                                                     to separate
challenges of empirical work on pricing to market is
out these unanticipated effects from planned changes   in pricing.

The third section then presents empirical evidence   on pricing to
market for seventeen manufactured products.              A final section
summarizes some of the principal findings of this study.


I.   A Model   of Pricing to Market

       Pricing to market behavior can be seen most clearly if we
consider the case of a monopolist firm in the ith industry

producing in the domestic country but selling in both domestic
and export markets.      The firm    sells   in the domestic market at a

price Pit and in the export market at a price             Qj, with       Qt
being expressed in foreign currency.           If there is effective

arbitrage between the two markets, then the two prices are tied

together by the law of one price;         P    =   St   Qt   where   5    is the

domestic currency price of foreign currency; commodity arbitrage

prevents any pricing to market from occurring.               If commodity

arbitrage by third parties is ineffective,2 however, then the
firm   will    in general set different prices in the two markets even

when expressed in domestic currency.          And the firm     will      vary the
relative price of export to domestic goods,
                              =
                        X±t        (5t   Qit)/it,
in response to changes in either demand or cost conditions.                   It

is this ratio of the export to domestic prices of the same good

which is termed the export—domestic price margin.


A. Demand and cost behavior

       This section describes how demand and cost behavior interact

to determine this margin          Let domestic and foreign demand be

described by the following functions:


                                                                                    3
(1)                      h    (          1t)                f( Qit,     2t)
where          t are the general price levels in the domestic and
foreign countries, respectively, and                           i,      Z   are the levels of

real income in the two countries                            The elasticities of demand in



                                                                             Iit
the domestic and foreign markets are given by:


(2)            5    =                                   U      =
                                  h(S)   t                                 f(J       Q
where h1, f1 are the derivatives of the demand functions with
respect to their first arguments, relative prices. The; cost
function expresses costs in tens of        output and factor
prices:
(3)                      c ( [hL)              f(.fl,   Wt,        L
where: Wt   is the           nominal wage and           P is the price of                raw materials
ned in production                prices crc expressed in domestic
                                     Both factor
currency since all production is assumed to be done at hone.
     The profit function of the firm is also expressed in
domestic currency as:

(4) St     =       Pt    h(       t/t t)              + St             f( Qit/Qt Zt)

Notice that revenues from foreign sales are expressed in domestic
currency       (using the exchange rate, St).                          The    first order
conditions         for the two markets are:


(5a)               (pit h1)/Pt                 h(.)          (C1 hi)/Pt
                                                                                 =   C,


(Sb)               (5t   Qit l)/Qt                S     f(.)       —
                                                                        (C1    l)/t        =
where C1 is marginal cost.3                These first order conditions can be

written in terms of two markup functions:


(6a)         Pit    =   C,(.)   M(    it/t,      vt)'

                        =
(6b)         St    Qt       C1(.)     N(   Qit/Qt   Zt).


N(.)    is the markup of the domestic price over marginal cost,

while N(.) is the markup of the foreign price (expressed in

domestic currency) over marginal cost.                  Each markup is a function

of the same variables as the corresponding demand function.                           The

markup function can be written in terms of the elasticities of
demand:


(7)          M(.)   =           (E   —
                                         1),    N(.)    =        /    (i-i 1).


If the demand elasticities are constant (case 1 below), then the

markups will be constant as well.               In more general cases, the

markups may rise or fall as the price of the good rises.
        The price   in one market is generally not independent of the

price in the other because each is tied to a common marginal
cost.     That is, since marginal cost is a function of total

output, changes in one price may induce changes in the other

price indirectly through changes in marginal cost,                        ifl   order to

determine the effects of demand and cost factors on relative

prices, the first order conditions are totally differentiated and
solved for the domestic and export prices.                  In       the next two
sections the elasticities of these prices with respect to the

independent variables are described in detail.
B.   EajgifltQlirket: the Effects                   of   a±flepreciatiociation

       This section examines the effects of a depreciation of the

domestic currency on the foreign and domestic prices of a good

produced at home,            As shown below, the depreciation directly

lowers marginal costs expressed in domestic currency (C1/St), so

the foreign price of the good (Qt) must                         nfl.      The domestic
price of the good, in contrast, changes only if the depreciation
leads to changes in marginal costs expressed in domestic

currency.      Finally, the ratio of foreign to domestic prices may
rise or fall depending on demand and cost behavior.

       Consider first the foreign currency price of the good

destined for the foreign market ("the foreign price").                                 The

elasticity of this price with respect to the exchange rate is

given by:


(B)      Pj    =    (d Qit/Qit)/(d         St/St)
                                                         =       (H11 5t) /       H!     <   0,

where H11      =    1    —                           (M(.) C11 hi)/Pt,4
                              (C1 Ni)/Pt
               =
         H22        St         (C1 N1)/Qt                (N(.) C11       l)/Qt'
               =    Hn   H22             M(.)                (C11)' f1   ha.)/(Pt Qt)'


and where H11, H22,            HI    > 0 by the second order              conditions,5            The

elasticity     is   negative        indicating      that      a depreciation of the

domestic currency must              jgg the price             of this good in foreign

currency       This elasticity is often called the "pass—through

coefficient" since it measures the extent to which a change in

the exchange rate is passed-through to the foreign price.

       The elasticity of the price of the good destined for the
                                                                                                    €
hone market ("the domestic price") with respect to the exchange

rate is:


(9)                   (d Pit/Pit)/(dst/St)                             [(•)       C11   1/Qt]/L
The crucial term           in      this expression is C11, the derivative of the

marginal cost with respect to output.                                 The depreciation may

change the dorestic price, but only if the marginal cost
increases or decreases with output.                                  That is,


         d    t/•it                 0                as                      0.
                               <
         dSt/St
if marginal costs are constant                            (C11
                                                                 =    0),   then the foreign price

alone absorbs the impact of the depreciation
       The "pricing to market"                        (or PTh) efrect concerns the

relative price of domestic goods destined for the two markets, or

Xj.     The response of                 X        to a depreciation can be expressed in

terms of the PTM elasticity,                          0:

(10)     01       =     d Xit/Xit
                        d St /          5t
                                                 =    1          l     —



                       (r St       Rn)                    N()    C11       i)/Qt    /    Hj,

where   & and r are            the elasticities of the domestic and foreign

markups with respect to prices:


              &          M1        it        ,
                                                           r          N1    Qt
                         M(.)       t                                 N(.) Qt


These markup elasticities can be positive, negative, or equai to
zero since they reflect the curvature of the respective denand

curves.6             So the PTM elasticity can alsc take a variety of

values.             In order to focus on denand behavior, assune that

marginal costs either increase or renain constant as output

expands (C11                 O).      Consider the following cases:


               :   Constant Markups (6 =         r =    0)
              The markups of prices over marginal cost are               a function of

price elasticities alone, as is evident fron the narkup
expression            (7)   above.      If both demand curves     have   constant price

elasticities,               as   with a loglinear demand curve, then the markups

are       constant and the                     elasticities are   equal to zero (or         6


=    r0). In that case, the export and domestic prices are tied
          =

to a common marginal cost in (Ga) and (6k), and the ratio of
these prices is therefore constant:

                                  =
                                        it
                                      St Qit    =
                                                    M(.)

sc       the PTM elasticity (°l) is zero.

              Consider the case where marginal cost is constant                  (Cu = 0),
A depreciation of the domestic currency (St > 0) leaves the
domestic price unchanged (i.e.,                     2
                                   = 0), but leads to a reduction

of the export price expressed                    in foreign currency by        the same

proportion as the change in the exchange rate ($1 =                        -    1)   With

complete           pass—through       of the exchange rate depreciation into the

foreign currency price, the export price expressed in                          jtjp
currency           remains constant:
                                                                                                8
          d (St Qjt)/(St        Qt)    =         +        =    a.
               d St / St

Thus not only is        Xj   constant, but so also are the prices of both

domestic and export goods in domestic currency.

     In the case where marginal costs are increasing, a

depreciation leads to a rise in the domestic price and in the

export price expressed in domestic currency equal to the rise in

marginal costs.         So the export price expressed in foreign

currency falls less than proportionally (-1 <                       <   0),   and pass—

through is only partial.          But as long        as markups     are constant,
the ratio of export to domestic prices, both expressed in
domestic currency, is constant and the PTM elasticity is again

Z&t2 (°i =   0).

Case 2: Variable Markups with         6,   r <   0.
     In order for pricing to market to occur, markups must vary

with prices.       In   the case of any demand curve which               is less

convex than a constant elasticity curve, a rise in prices reduces

the markup of prices over marginal costs and                  a fall in prices

increases this markup.          This case encompasses a wide range of

demand curves including any demand curve more linear than the
constant elasticity curve such as the linear curve itself.8
     Consider first the pass—through effect.                  Since a

depreciation of the domestic currency lowers the foreign price

(in foreign currency), it increases the               markup of this price over
                                                               So the foreign
marginal cost expressed in foreign currency.

                                                                                          9
price falls less than the rise in the exchange rate cr the pass-

through is less than complete (l$jj <               I).   When this price is

converted back into domestic currency, moreover, it necessarily

increases (i.e., by (1 + $1) > 0 in percentage                 terms).

     If   marginal   costs   are constant,     then       the domestic price      is

constant as well, so the margin between foreign and domestic

prices (expressed in domestic currency) must widen, and the PTM

elasticity is positive (ai >        0).      If marginal costs increase with

output, the domestic price increases with a depreciation of the
domestic currency (i.e., $2 >        0), but        the markup of this price

over marginal ccst               So the margin between foreign and

domestic prices still widens (a1 >            0).     In fact, regardless of

whether marginal costs increase or.remain constant, the PTM

elasticity is between zero and unity (i.e., 0 <                 a   <    1).    So the

margin between foreign and domestic prices increases by a
fraction of the rise in the exchange rate.

     Consider the example of Japanese goods destined for the U.S.

market.    If the yen depreciates, the prices of U,S.-destined

goods fall in terms of dollars.           But because Japanese firms

increase their markups, the "pass—through" is less than
                                                in terms of yen
proportional to the depreciation, so the prices
must rise. That opens a gap between the prices of goods destined

for the Japanese and U.S. markets.             The increase       in the       export
domestic price margin can be anywhere between zero and 100

percent of the depreciation.         Similarly, if the yen appreciates,

as it has since 1985, then the prices of U,S.—destined goods rise

                                                                                        10
in dollars, but the increase is less than proportional to the

exchange rate because the yen prices of these goods fall.                   As   a
result, Japanese goods become less expensive abroad than at hone.
        This second case with varying markups will be of central

interest in the empirical work below.            To complete the discussion
of markup behavior, however, a third possible case should be

mentioned where demand curves are more convex rather than less

convex than the constant elasticity case.            Then markup
elasticities are positive rather than negative           (6,   r   >   0), and
PTM    elasticities are   negative (°i <   0).    An appreciation of the

yen leads to an increase in the foreign currency prices                of

exports that is more than proportional to the appreciation.                  This
third case is inconsistent with PTh behavior as usually

described, but it is possible that such behavior nay characterize
some industries.


C     Influence of Other Factors on Foreign-Domestic Price Margins

        Any factor influencing costs or demands in either country
can potentially affect the ratio of export to domestic prices.

But as this section shows, cost factors influence export—

domestic price margins only under certain demand conditions.                     And

general price levels influence export—domestic price margins in
a symmetric fashion which allows these margins to be expressed in

terms   of      rather than nominal exchange rates.

(i)   Cost factors:

       According to the cost function (3), both wages and raw
material prices can influence costs, and indirectly influence

                                                                                 11
prices, in both foreign and domestic markets.                   In order to affect
                                                           must
export—domestic price margins, however, these cost factors
have a differential impact on prices in the two markets. The

elastioities of Xft, •the ratio of export to domestic prices,

with respect to wages and raw material prices are given by the

following expressions:


(lla)         02
                    =   dEit      Wt   =   C12 Wt St              —
                                                                               >     0,
                         d Wt                c1        Tiff

                              m                    m
                    =   d Xj I't       =   Cl3    Pt 5t           —    6   3         o.
(llh)                                                                          -.
                         d t Xj              C1         •H1



Both      and 03 can be expressed in terms of the markup
                                                     the markups
elasticities, 6 and r, which measure the response of
to changes in prices, but it is only the difference between these
elasticities that matters. If the demand curves in the two

markets have constant price elasticities, then the markup

elasticities are equal to zero (6 = r =                0),    so a rise in wages or

raw material prices has no effect on the export—domestic price

margin.      But this is also true in the more general case where

markup behavior is identical in the two markets                   (6
                                                                       =   r),      which

would    be the case    if the demand curves have the same curvature.9
Then a    rise in   wages   or       prices has nnffiject on the
                                 raw material

export—domestic price margin because it increases prices in both
markets by the same percentage, Even              if    markup behavior             is
different,    the margin changes only in proportion to the

difference in the markup elasticitiesj0 So cost factors are not

a major influence on export—domestic price margins unless demand
                                                                                            12
behavior differs substantially in the foreign and domestic

markets.

(ii) General price levels:

        General price levels influence export—domestic price

margins through the respective demand functions.                            The
elasticities of            Xj       with respect to the two general price levels,

Q   and            are expressed as follows:


                          d    Xt               d          St   =
(12a)                                                                 a1,
                           dQtXit                   dStxit
(12b)
                           d t 1it          =
                                                     01
                                                            —   5t    [     5
                          dPtXit
A rise       ingeneral price level in the foreign country has the
                  the
same effect on      as a rise in the nominal exchange rate. And a
rise    in   the general price level                 in the domestic country has a

larger       or smaller effect than a rise in St by a factor which
depends       like a2 and 03 on the difference between the markup

elasticities,           r —    5.       In fact, the last term in (l2b) can be

rewritten         in terms of the factor price elasticities as follows:12-

(l2b)             ____              =     0l    —
                  d   t   x                           02        03.



This transformation allows factor prices to be expressed in real

terms below.

(iii)    Income Effects:

        Since demand functions in both domestic and foreign narkets

are a function of income in that market, the ratio of their

                                                                                     13
prices are a function of both income variables, Yt and Zt.                                                  But

under plausible conditions,                X   may be unaffected by changes in
either variable.            Consider the elasticity of                     X         with respect to

each income variable:


(13a)        04
                  =     d   Xj   t
                        d

             =    t
                  TTT
                        (—N2
                              t  ,C1 H22      St   Cnbii
                                                        t
                                                                      +    St    C11 h2        c   i-   —




(l3b)        05
                        d
                        -
                            X    Zt
                            Zt Xft

             =          { N2     E_H11 —       C11 f1                      St   C11 f2
                  TT                Qit            Qt                           C1


These two income elasticities depend once again on the difference

between the markup elasticities,                    r   —    .       If              ,   however, the
incone elasticities can still be non-zero if markups are directly

sensitive to income (as measured by the derivatives of the markup

functions, N2 and           N2).      But this requires that the price

elasticities of the demand curves be a function of income, since

        N2              y/     (E     1)2 ,        N2
                                                            =    —
                                                                     /i1   /    (L   —
                                                                                         1)2

If   the demand curves              are linear or log—linear, for example, these
elasticities are equal to zero.                     So changes in income could very

well have no effect on export—domestic price margins.


D.   nmarofNarkuehavior:
        The model of markup behavior shows                        Xt       is influenced by

seven demand and suppiy variables, but the reduced form equation

                                                                                                              14
for Xit    can be simplified by expressing it in terms of several

relative prices:


        Rt =    (Qt St)/Pt = the ratio of general price levels
                expressed in domestic currency or the 'real exchange



                t
               rate",

        Wt /        =       the   real wage (expressed in terms of domestic

               prices),

          / Pt      =       the   real price of raw materials.


The percentage change in                  X       is given by the following

expression:


(14)
          d             =
                                    Rt
                                         +    a       Wt

                                                                              t
                                                                                  d'Dt

                                                                                   t
                             +           t         05 dZt

where     dRt    =          dQt +       dSt   -    dPt
                                         St
The ratio of export to domestic prices, the export—domestic

price margin, can be expressed as a function of the real exchange

rate,    the real wage, the real price of raw materials, and two

output series.               The crucial coefficient in this equation is          a,
the PTM elasticity showing how the margin between export and

domestic prices changes when the domestic currency depreciates or

appreciates.
        The empirical counterpart of this equation involves

variables expressed in logs.                      If the log of a variable is denoted
by    a small—case letter, then the log version of (14) can be

written as follows:


(15)    Xit    =    01 rt      +    02 rwt         Pt]      +    ° £P        —
                                                                                 Pt]   +   °
                    +    05   Zt.

In    the estimation described below, all variables are expressed as

changes in the logs.

II.

        If firms    set export prices in domestic currency, or                             if they

set export prices in foreign currency and there are no lags in

price-setting, then the estimation of PTM elasticities is
straightforward, But if firms         export prices in foreign

currency, observed variations in the ratio of export to domestic
                                                        in
prices may reflect the effects of unanticipated changes

exchange rates rather than pricing to market.-2
        Consider the case of a firm setting export prices in foreign

currency (and domestic prices in domestic currency) for period
                                                               t

on    the basis of information available                    at    tl.       The firm will

attempt to set export and domestic prices so that Xjt is equal to
the expected value            of expression (15).                That is, the firm sets

qit      Pit such that


(16)     q±t
               -
                   Pit        Et.1 (qit
                                              —    Pit)
                         =    Oi Et_1 rt               00   Etl        bt
                                                                             —
                                                                                  Eti st,
where    o bt       =    02 [wt
                                    -   Pt]       a3   [p   -
                                                                 Pt]        04   Yt  0 Zt,     and

                                                                                                     6
where Et_i denotes the expected value of                        a   variable based on

information available at t—1.                 The actual value            of      will

differ from its expected value because of exchange rate

surprises, St —     E_1s:
(17)     Xjt   =   E_(q        —
                                   Pit)       +        St

               =   (t   —   Et_iSt)       +       ai    E_1r        +   00 Et_ibt.

With a price-setting lag of one period, a depreciation of the
domestic currency in period t will raise Xjt not because of

pricing to market, but simply because                       5   is free to     vary while
       and Pit are preset.

        Empirical evidence suggests that both nominal and real
exchange rates follow random walks, at least to a first

approximation)-3        If   5 and     rt are assumed to follow random

walks, then xit can be written as follows:14


(18)     Xit   =   (t   —
                             st—i)    +       01 rt_l       +       a   Et_ibt.

The interpretation of this equation is quite interesting.
                                                  = 0). Then Xit
Suppose that no pricing to market occurs (°o
is positively related to the current exchange rate surprise.                                But

if no further surprises occur,                the export—domestic price margin

returns to its original level one period later since, in the
absence of PTM, changes in            5 have no             effect on the desired level

of Xit.

        If pricing to market occurs, in contrast, the ratio of

export to domestic prices in industry i is related to the                            ge
in the spot exchange rate and to the level of the real exchange

rate lagged one period as well as other lagged variables.

Nominal and real exchange rates are usually highly correlated, so

it is normally difficult to separate their effects.                         But because

it is the   ghgjn        the nominal exchange rate rather than its

level which enters the equation, it is possible to distinguish

empirically between the effects of exchange rate surprises and
PTM behaviorj5

       The price series employed in the study represent goods

disaggregated into product groups such as color televisions and
sash     passenger cars rather than homogeneous commodities.
Because pricesetting patterns can differ across the goods in
these groups, the observed movements in Xit may reflect prices

set contemporaneously as well as prices preset on the basis of

past expectations.       Suppose that a fraction       k—i       of   the prices are
set at period    tj    so that the observed Xit consists of a weighted
                                                                  =   0) and those
average of prices set contemporaneously (vith                j

preset on the basis of t-j information (vhere                j    can vary from      1

to N).    Then Xit is given by the following expression:



         Xit =
                                —
(19)             E1    kj(st        t—j)    +
                                                Eo j    °lj           rtj

                 E0 kj    Ooj       Etjbt       uit.



In this equation, a change in the nominal exchange rate between

t-j   and t leads to   a rise in Xit by a fraction,               k,    of the

exchange rate change, where            reflects the fraction of goods

                                                                                         18
subject to a price-setting lag of    j   periods.     If the nominal

exchange rate term includes several lags, the sun of the
coefficients for this term gives the fraction of goods subject to
                                  1.6
price-setting lags of any length.
      Both current and lagged real exchange rates enter the

equation, with their respective coefficients reflecting the
relative weight of contemporaneous and lagged pricing.         Since

goods with prices set with a j period lag may have different PTM
elasticities than those with some other lag, it is necessary to

specify a different PTM elasticity, a1j, for each lag length, j.

a1 can then represent the weighted average PTh elasticity for the

product group as a whole:    a1 =   E0 k1    alj.'7    Similarly, in

the case of the bt term, representing other independent variables
in this equation, the sum of   the coefficients of this term

represents the weighted average elasticity of xjt with respect to

bt.   An error term,   Ut, represents random factors affecting
industry pricing which are unobserved by the econonietrician,

III. Estimation of   the Price Equations
      This section reports equations explaining export-domestic

price margins for seventeen Japanese products.         The data are

first described (with further detail provided in the data

appendix), then the empirical results are discussed.
A. Description of the Data

      The Bank   of Japan reports prices for a large number of

disaggregated prodUcts.1-8   This paper focuses on seventeen final

products for which both export and domestic prices are available.
                                                                       19
The domestic prices are those reported at the primary wholesale
level for sale in Japan, while the export prices are FOB export

prices expressed in yen.   The products are listed in Tables    1   and
2.   Most of the products are drawn fron the electrical machinery

and transport industries. All of the products have significant

export markets in the United States and other industrial
countries, and most are products which have figured prominently
in recent trade discussions.

      These products are exported to a wide range of countries.

Thus the noninal and real exchange rates appearing in (19) should

be   efqgve exchange   rates defined over prices and exchange

rates for a number of countries which import Japanese products.
The foreign output variable, similarly, should be a weighted

average of foreign outputs.    The United Nations repcrts export

shares by product with categories roughly corresponding to those

in Tables 1 and 2,19   These export shares are used to form

weights for     ggt—segjfic series for the nominal and real
exchange rates and foreign industrial production.    For example,

there are series for the nominal and real exchange rates and

industrial production used in the equation for color televisions

based on export shares for color televisions,

      To form the nominal exchange rate series for each product,

the export shares for that product are used to weight the

corresponding bile teral exchange rates forming a product-

specific, nominal effective exchange rate.   To foro the real

exchange rate series for each product, wholesale prices are first

                                                                     20
converted into dollars using monthly average exchange rates.

When wholesale prices are not available, consumer prices are used
instead.20    The series for prices and bilateral exchange rates
are reported in the International Monetary Fund, International

Financial Statistics.     To obtain product—specific series for the

real effective exchange rate, weighted averages of these national

prices are formed using as weights the export shares for that

product category.     The real effective exchange rate is than equaL

to the weighted average of foreign prices converted fran doi3arr

into yen and deflated by the Japanese wholesale price index

Twenty—two countries in all are represented in the exchange rate
series.     These countries account for between 64 percent and 93

percent of total Japanese exports depending on the product
involved.

       The industrial production series are based on seasona1y

adjusted national series drawn fran the OECD            Ma   Econonic

Indicp.         The aggregate series    f or    each product are fanned by

weighting the national serses oy       the     export shares for that

product.     Thirteen countries in all are represented an tne

aggregate series.
       The other independent variables         in the estimation are alL

Japanese variables:     The real wage, wt -        Pt   is defined as the

nominal wage in Japanese manufacturing deflated by the            Jpacsc
wholesale price index.     The relative price at raw materaals,
   —   Pt   is defined as the price of imported materials ar            yen
deflated by the Japanese wholesale price index.              Finally,

                                                                              21
Japanese output,        Yt   is represented by industrial production

since GNP data are not available monthly.             These independent

variables did not prove to be statistically significant in nost

of the equations, although in several equations one or            more were

statistically significant.
B. Estimation Results

     Tables I and 2 report equations explaining the export-

donestic price margin for seventeen Japanese final products.              The

equations are estinated over the period from February 1980 to
December 1987, so there are a total of 95 monthly observations.

     To reduce spurious correlation between variables, each

variable is expressed as the firstdiffereng of its log value.
The dependent variable in each equation is the export-domestic

price margin for that product (expressed as the first-difference
of its log value), defined as the price of exports in yen

relative to the domestio price of that sane product.             The

independent variables consist of distributed lags for the first-
                                              and the other independent
differenoes of        (t     t-j)'   rt...j
variables.        s     is the log value of the noninal effective

exchange rate with weights based on export shares for that

product; rt is the log value of the real effective exchange rate
with the sane export shares.

     The tables report the sun          of the coefficients for each

variable, with the t—statistio in parentheses below, and indicate
the length of the lag         if any.   The tables also report the

adjusted R2   ,   the   Durbin-Watson statistic, and the serial

                                                                           22
correlation coefficient (Rho) when it is statistically

significant.
       Table 1 presents the equations for eight products consisting

of transport and tractor equipment.          The first column of the
table gives the sum of the coefficients for         (t   —
                                                             st-i)'   with the
sum representing the share of that product subject to price—

setting lags of at least one period (as explained above),              The
second column gives the sum of the coefficients for
                                                               rtj. the sue
representing the weighted average PTM elasticity, c3.             The third
column gives the coefficients of any other independent variables

that   are   statistically significant. explained in Section 1,
                                             As
these variables enter the equatIon only if markup behavior
sufficiently different for the two markets.
     In six of the eight equations, them arc price—setting ags
ranging      from one to three months in length.     WIts lags in price-

setting, some changes in export—domestic price margins are
unintended and are therefore later reversed,          In the case of

small passenger cars,       for example, the first coefficient of

0.332 indicates that a rise in the nominal exchange rate by one

percent leads to a temporary increase in the export—domestic

price margin for small cars as a whole by over 0.3 percent (or

equivalently,     that   over 30   percent of that product category has
the export-domestic price       margin   rise temporarily due to prIce-

setting lags>.      The second term     in that equatIon gcves the ?TM

elasticity, the sustained effect on export—domestic price margins
of a rise in the real exchange rate.          For small posoenger cars,


                                                                             23

that PTN elasticity is .517 indicating that a rise in the real

exchange rate by one percent raises the export price relative to
the domestic price by over 0.5 percent.

        The PTN elasticities are significantly greater than zero in

all equations except the equation for small trucks.         The
coefficients range in size from 0.406 in the large truck equation

to 1.14 in the tire and tube equation (a coefficient which is

insignificantly different from one).       So PTM behavior takes the
standard form described in case 2 above:       When there is a

depreciation (appreciation) of the yen, Japanese firms raise

(lower)    their export prices relative to their domestic prices in

order to limit changes in the foreign currency prices of their

products,23-    The exception is the equation for small trucks where
the PTM elasticity is small and insignificantly different         froia

zero.

        For several of the products, changes    in trade restrictions

may have altered PTM elasticities,       so additional equations were

estimated to investigate this possibility.       The most promnent

restriction may have been the voluntary export restraint or

Japanese cars exported to the United States.       This restraint was

imposed beginning in April 1981,    so   in each of the   passenger car
equations a second PTM elasticity was estimated defined over the

period starting in that month.22     This variable had no :nfuence

on export—domestic price margins in the (large) passenger car

equation, but had a t—statistic of 1,63 in the equataon for         smi
passenger cars (with engine displacement of 2000 cc or lover,,
That equation is the second one reported in Table 1.       Similar

                                                     and trucks
attenpts to model tariff restrictions on motorcycles

proved to be unsuccessful.23
     In Table 1, other independent variables play some role in

determining export—domestic price margins.       In the case of snail
                                                     industrial
passenger cars and small trucks, changes in Japanese
                                                              car
production increase this margin, while in the small passenger
                                               the margin.24 In
equation foreign industrial production reduces
the equation for motor cycles, a rise in the real wage decreases

export-domestic   price margins.
     Table   2 reports equations for nine consumer products.      The

results parallel those of Table    I   although price-setting lags
                                            In five cf the nine
play less of a role than in Table
                                       I.

                                                    of at least
equations, there is evidence of a price—setting lag
one period indicating that exchange rate surprises lead to
                                                        But in

between zero and one, and in the amplifier equation the

coefficient is insignificantly different fron one.                 Like in

Table 1, the PTM elasticities in this table indicate strong

evidence of pricing to market behavior of the conventional type:

variations in the exportdonestic price margin help to dampen the

effects of exchange rate changes on export prices in foreign

currency,      The exception   is   the equation for cameras where the
PTM elasticity is small and insignificantly different from zero.

The evidence suggests that in the case of cameras Japanese               fins
have not priced to market, presumably because there are few

procucers of this product cutside Japan. in none of the
equations in this table did the other independent variables prove
to   be statistically significant.

       Most of the equations in Tables I and         2   explain   a relatively

high percentage of the variation in export-domestic price
margins, particularly considering the fact that the equations are
estimated in firstdifference form. The reel exchange rate
series provide most of the explanatory power, as would be
expected     on the basis of the theoretical discussion in Section           1.

C.   getries       irn         to Market Behavior
       The                          that Japanese firms vary
             evidence strongly suggests
their export prices relative to their domestic prices in response
to   changes in real exchange rates.        It   may be the case, however,
that Japanese firms follow different pricing behavior depending

oh whether the yen appreciates or depreciates.             More

specifically, in periods when the yen appreciates, these firms

                                                                             28
may vary the relative price of their exports           than when the

yen depreciates.     This asymmetric pattern would hold if firms

try to maintain market share by reducing export prices       in   yen
when the yen appreciates but try to increase market share by

holding export prices in yen constant when the yen depreciates.
     In this section, the paper investigates the hypothesis that

PTM elasticities are larger      in periods when the yen

appreciates.25     The period of study contains only one period of
sustained appreciation, February 1985 to December 1987.           So the

equations reported above were reestimated with an additional term

representing     the real exchange rate variable defined only over

the period from     February   1985 until the end of the sample period.

The t—statistic for that additional term will ipdicate whether
there is significantly greater price responsiveness in the period

of the yen's appreciation.

     Table   3   reports the equations where the additional PTM term
was statistically significant.       The table includes the PTM

elasticities measured over the entire period as Well as over tne

subperiod, together with the adjusted      R   and DW statistics.26

     There are five products which have statistically significant

PTN elasticities defined over the period of the yen's

appreciation.      10 the case of three products, small trucks,

microwave ovens, and cameras, the PTM elasticity defined over tOe
whole period is statistically insignificant in the equation          ho
the elasticity for the recent period       is estimated,   So :t appears

that prior to 1985 Japanese firms did not vary toe relative

                                                                           29
prices of these products.      Two   of    these products, small trucks

and cameras, were the only ones which failed to show
statistically significant PTM behavior in Tables          I    and   2.   In   the

case of the third product, microwave ovens, the pricing to market

behavior reported in Table 2 is evidently just reflecting

behavior since 1985.

        For the other two products in Table 3, small passenger cars

and motor cycles, both PTM elasticities are statistically

significant.      In these Industries, Japanese firms evidently

priced to market throughout the sample period, but varied their

prices more sharply when the yen appreciated after 1985.               In the

case of small passenger cars, for example, the PTM elasticity              is
only    .355 defined over the entire sample period since 1980, but

the PTM elasticity defined over the period since February 1985                 is

.725 (.355 + .370).

                    the twelve other products in Tables 1 and 2,
        In the case of

there is no evidence of higher PTM elasticities in the perioc
since February 1985; the coefficients of the PTM terms defines

over the period since February 1985 are statistically
insignificant at the five percent level. Thus pricing to narket

appears to be invariant with respect to the Jirection of exchange
rate changes except for those five products reported in Tate 3.
IV.    Concluding Remarks

       This   paper    has investigated pricing to market by Japanese

firms over the last eight years.           The sairpla period includes a

depreciation of the yen in real terms in the early l980s
followed by a sharp appreciation.           The paper studies how

Japanese firms        responded   to shifts in   the   real exchange rate by

varying the     prices of their exports relative to prices of

products destined for the domestic macset.
       The paper provides strong evidence that export-donestic
price margins are varied systematically in ways consistent with
the theoretical model outlined above.   The most important

influence on these margins is the real exchange rate, with PTM

elasticities being significantly greater than zero in all but two

of the seventeen equations.   There is some evidence that PTM

elasticities are higher in periods when the yen appreciates,

although this is true only in the case of five of the seventeen

products.   The estimation distinguishes between inadvertent but

temporary changes in these margins due to exchange rate surprises
and planned changes associated with PTh behavior, So the PTM
elasticities which are estimated represent variations in this

margin planned by Japanese firms to keep their products
competitive abroad. The PTh elasticities vary widely across

products, but there is overwhelming evidence that export-
domestic price margins are systematically varied to help Japanese

firms protect their competitive position.   Without PTM behavior,

recent variations in real exchange rates would have placed a much

greater burden of adjustment on Japanese output and employment.

phenomena of currency pass-through include Baldwin (1988),

Mann (1986), Ohno (1988), and Schenibri (1988).
2. The firm's pricing policy might be undermined by third parties
who buy in the low price market and sell in the high price
market, but there are usually official and unofficial barriers to
third party arbitrage for the types of products studied in this
paper, Kruqman (1987) cites the example of German automobiles
whose prices in the United States greatly exceeded prices in
Germany (expressed in dollars). A gray market developed for
automobiles bought by third parties in Germany and shipped to the
United States, but this gray market never eliminated the large
margin between prices in the two markets.
3. C1 is the derivative of the cost function with respect to its
first argument, total output.
4. M1, N1 are the derivatives of the markup functions with
respect to their first arguments, relative prices. C11 is the
derivative of marginal cost (C1) with respect to total


                            [(
output. Similar notation is used for other derivatives,
5. For example, H11 =       Pt)/(Cl h1)] J11 where [J) is the
matrix of second derivatives of the profit function. Since the
second order conditions imply that (J] is negative semidefinitc,
    < 0. So H11 > 0 since C1 > 0 (i.e., marginal cost is
positive) and h1 < 0 (the demand curve is negatively slcped).
6. The domestic markup elasticity can be written in terms of the
elasticity of the demand curve as follows:
                6   =   —
                            (Cp   t)/(   (c—I)   t)
The derivative of the demand elasticity with respect to prices,
,   depends on the curvature of the demand curve.
7. As Krugman (1987) points out, the dependence of PTM effects on
demand behavior parallels the tariff effects in the recent
theoretical literature on protection under imperfect competition.
For a similar analysis of pass—through effects, see Feenstra
(1987).

8. Feenstra (1987) describes this case as the "normal" case,    H
shows that the pass—through elasticity is between zero and minus
one in this case.



                                                                  34
9. As discussed above, the markup elasticities depend on the
derivatives of the demand elasticities with respect to prices, so
it is curvature of the demand curves which matters, not just the
elasticities themselves,
10. If both markup elasticities are negative (case 2 above), for
example, but the markup elasticity is greater in the foreign
market (r < 5 < 0), then a rise in either cost factor reduces the
ratio of foreign to domestic prices.

Il. Since C1 is homogeneous of degree one in factor prices, by
Euler's law,

                    C12   W       C13   P   =    C1.
The expression      02    a-,   therefore, can be written as follows:

12. Giovannini (1988) analyzes a fin's decision about whether to
ret prices in domestic or foreign currency. He is one of the
tow other authors to distinquish between the effects of
unanticipated changes in exchange rates and pricing to market,
although his model of pricesetting and approach to estination
differ from this paper's

13  For evidence on the random walk behavior of nominal and real
uxohange rates, see Heese and Rogoff (1983 and 1988) and Adler
and Lehmann (1983). To the extent               that
                                        exchange rates
approximate random walks, changes in exchange rates oan be
vagarded as permanent. For a model  in which temporary and
narmanent changes in exchange rates have different effects, see
Froot   and Klemperer (1988).

14. For example, 5t is assumed to follow               a random walk process   of
the   form:
                          =
                               5ti + vt,
xhere   vt is a random variable with
                                     an expected value of zero, so

15. The correlation between changes in the nominal and reai
exchange rates between the yen and dollar is 0.969 over the
sample period. But the correlation between the level of the
real exchange rate and the change in the nominal exchange rate is
only 0.289.
