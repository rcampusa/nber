                                  ABSTRACT



     We develop a multi-country, dynamic general equilibrium model of product
innovation and international trade to study the creation of comparative
advantage through research and development and the evolution of world trade
over time In our model, firms must incur resource costs to introduce new
products and forward-looking potential producers conduct R&D and enter the
product market whenever profit opportunities exist. Trade has both ifltra-
industry and inter-industry components, and the different incentives that face
agents in different countries for investment and savings decisions give rise
to intertemporal trade. We derive results on the dynamics of trade patterns
and trade volume, and on the temporal emergence of multinational corporations.

1.   Introduction

     International economists have long used static models of comparative

advantage and (more recently; scale economies to great advantage in studying

the pattern of international trade and the normative properties of trading

equilibria.   But increasingly, many issues of concern to theorists and casual

observers alike are inherently dynamic in nature.    Attention has focused on

such topics as the creation of comparative advantage by technological

cnnovation, the relationship between trade policy and economic growth, and the

dynamic evolution of the volume and pattern of world trade.    The static models

of international trade must be extended if we are to deal with these new

concerns

     In this paper, we develop a multi-country, dynamic, general equilibrium

model of product innovation and international trade to study the creation of

comparative advantage through research and development, and the evolution of

world trade over time.   Our model builds upon the static analyses of trade in

differentiated products by Krugman (1979a, 1981), Dixit and Norman (1980), and

Feenstra and Judd (1982), as well as the closed-economy dynamic model of

product development studied by Judd (1985).

     In our model, firms incur resource Costs to introduce new products.

Forward-looking potential producers conduct R&D and enter the product market

whenever profit opportunities exist.     New products substitute imperfectly for

old, and prices, interest rates, and the pattern of trade evolve over time as

more commodities become available for purchase.     Trade has both intra-industry

and inter-industry   components, with the former governed by R&D expenditures and

the latter by resource endowments.     The incentives that face agents in

different countries for investment and savings decisions give rise to

intertemporal trade.
        The approach adopted here differs in important respects from        several
recent studies of the dynamics of trade with product innovation, such as

Krugman (1979b), Dollar (1986), Jensen and Thursby (1987) and Segerstrom et.ai.

(1987).     These papers have provided useful insights into the evolution of the

trade pattern.     But all have been incomplete in important ways, be it due to

the   lack of explicit treatment of       all general equilibrium interactions, the
lack of explicit modelling of the economic factors that drive the rate of
product innovation, or other features. We believe that in order to study the
evolution    of trade that is based on technological innovation it is necessary to

develop models in which the process of innovation, the incentive to invest in

R&D, and the interaction of these two with resource allocation, both temporal

and intertemporal, are all treated explicitly.

        The organization of the paper and some of the major results are as

follows.     In Section   2,   we develop the model and derive the integrated

equilibrium that would result in the absence of any international borders.

Section 3    presents   our investigation of the pattern ci trade in a two-country,

two-factor   world, with       the factors interpreted to he unskilled labor and   human

capital.     If both product      development and the production of differentiated

products are more human—capital intensive artivities than is the production                 of

the outside good, then the human-capital rich country will be a net exporter of

differentiated products and an importer of the outside good at                moment in

time.     This is true despite the fact that the human-capital rich country

initially devotes more of its resources to R&D (as opposed to production),              and

despite the fact that trade is not balanced along the equilibrium path.               The

model predicts a rising share of trade in world GNP, at least when R&D is the

most human-capital intensive of the three activities.          Concerning   intertemporal

trade, we show that the human—capital rich country has both a greater incentive
                                          -3—




to invest and a greater incentive to save (per capita), the latter due to its

declining relative factor income       Consequently, it appears that this country

may run either a surplus or a deficit on current account in the dynamic

equilibrium.

     In Section 4, we introduce the possibility of multinational corporations

in the manner of Helpman (1984, and Helpman and Krugman (1985, Chp. 12).           We

assume that headquarter services can be separated geographically from

production activities, and that only the former must take place in the country

in which   a   differentiated product has been developed.   If headquarter services

are more human-capital     intensive than production, then the possibility of

multinational activity expands the set of distributions of the world's factor

endnwment for which international exchange can reproduce the integrated world

equilibrium.      For certain compositions of factor endowments    the model predicts

the emergence of multinational enterprises at a particular point in time, which

remain active thereafter.      The extent of multinationality,    as measured by

output, employment of subsidiaries, or the number of multinational firms

increases initially and as the world economy approaches the steady state.



2.   A Dynamic Model of R&D

     We consider an environment in which there are three activities:         the


production of a traditional cnmmndity, the production of a continuum of

varieties of a "modern" industrial product, and research and development (R&D)

that leads to the acquisition of the know-how needed to produce new brands of

the industrial good.

     At every point in time there exists a given (measure of the) number of

varieties that were developed in the past.      Producers of these varieties engage

in oligopnlistic     competitinn by setting prices.   Given demsnds and costs, this
                                               -4-


proce.s determines prices, outputs, and current operating profits.• An
entrepreneur who contemplates developing a new brand can calculate the fiture
stream of operating profits that will be captured. Re chooses to develop the
brand only if the present value of this stream is at least as large as the cost
of R&D. The competitive entry procesa lead. to aggregate investment in R&D
such that a brand's development cost is just equal to the present value of its
future profits (unless no further products are developed).
     As   in   Relpman and trugman (1985),      it proves convenient to solve for the
"integrated world equilibrium", i.e. the equilibria that would obtain in the
absence of any international borders. Under conditiona that give rise to
factor price equalization, a world trading eqillibriun reproduces the
integrated equilibrium in its essential details. g0 properties of the latter
equilibria can be applied to the analysis of the former. For this reason the
following diacuasiondeals        first with the integrated economy.

A.   Consumers

     Infinitely lived consumers       maximize    total lifetime utility.   The

representative consumer has a time-separable intertemporal utility function


           U. Je log u(•)dt,                                                      (1)




where p is the constant subjective          discount rate and u(•) is an instantaneous
sub-ntility function.     We     adopt a   particular form of n(•),

                   n

                                                        —5—




where c(i) is consumption of differentiated product i, c                       is consumption of

the competitive good, and n is the (measure of the) number of available

varieties.        We note that this form implies constant expenditure shares s                   and

       on commodity classes x and y, and a constant elasticity of substitution

between any two differentiated products of a =                  17(1-0)   > 1.

       The consumer's maximizatiun problem can be solved in two stages.                    First we

find               and        to maximize u(S) given total expenditure at time t, E(t),
        {cx(i)}          cy
prices, and the available brands.                   Then we solve for the time pattern of

expenditures that maximizes U.                  The solution to the first stage gives

instantaneous demand functions1

                                 n(t)           1-a

and         =                 where p(i) is the price of the differentiated product              i

and      is the price of the traditional good y.
      Py
       In maximizing U, the consumer must satisfy an intertemporal budget

constraint.        We assume that the consumer can borrow or lend freely on a capital

market with instantaneous rate of interest R(t).                  Then the budget constraint is




                                         =          etEt)hI(r)dt          +   A(t),        (4)




where 1(t) is the consumer's factor income in period t, A(t) is the value of

his accumulated assets at t, with A(0)=0, and R(t) is the cumulative interest

factor    through time t.         Then, substituting (3) into     (2) and the result into

vector of       input prices.0 These costs are the same for all brands, regardless
of whether      the variety has previously been introduced by another entrepreneur

or not.     Then    () is         the fixed cost and   ()   is   the average and marginal

varible cost for all firms in this sector.

        The number of potential products is infinite,            Therefore, it will never be

rational for an entrepreneur to develop an already existing brand, and each

innovator enjoys monopoly power in the production of his particular variety for

the indefinite future.




2.     This csn be seen as follows.  The indirect utility function derived from
(2) has the form v[p(t), E(t)]    =         E(t)f(p(t)).
                                                  Then log u() = log E(t) +
log    f(p(t)), and the first—order condition for maximization of (1) implies

associated with the budget constraint in (4).

3. An implicit assumption here is that product development does not require
finite time. We could relax this assumption without substantially affecting
the structure of the model.

    A producer of an existing brand faces at time t a measure n(t) of
                                                              He also faces a given
competitors who have developed products in the past.
                                                                                       He

chooses the price of his brand so as to maximize operating profits; namely,

revenue minus production costs, using the demand function given in (3).          As is

well known, this results in fixL         markup pricing over unit production costs.

Since all producers are symmetrical, we consider the symmetric equilibrium.            In

this equilibrium output per variety        x(i)x   and prices p(i)=p for all i[O,n(t)j

satisfy



                    sE/pn,                                                      (6)




                    =                                                           (7)




The resulting operating profits per variety are




               Tt       (1 —   a)sE/n                                           (8)




     An entrepreneur has perfect foresight regarding the evolutioa of spending

E and the number of firms n.       Therefore, using (8) he has perfect foresight

regarding profits per variety.          In an equilibrium the present value of these

profits cannot exceed current R&D Costs.           Hence, if at time t there is positive

but finite investment in product development, each new variety breaks even;

i.e.,




             et(t)mm(t)dt = n[wf(t)1.
                                                         —8-




We normalize nominal prices so that



                   1   =
                           e[wf(t)J           for all t.                                      (10)


With this choice of nursersire,                 (9)   implies that the instantaneous interest rate

is equal to operating profits; i.e.,



                               =    R(t).                                                     (11)

                           =
                               (w).                                                           (12)




Equations   (7),   (10) and             (12) describe the equilibrium relationships between


product and factor prices.



C.   Integrated Equilibrium

     First, substitute                  (8) and (11) into      (5)   to obtain



                       =            —   a)s     —
                               (1                   p.                                         (13)




This is the first differential equation that will be used to describe the

evolution of the integrated economy over time.                          It shows the rate of change of

                                                               varieties.                             The

next step is to derive a differential equation for changes in the number of

available brands; i.e., an investment equation.

is the aggregate output of industrial                       products, Y is the output of traditional

products and V is the vector of available inputs.                          The pricing equations   (7),


(10) and (12) together with (14) imply that the total reward to factors of

production can be written as fl(i,                       ap,p;   V), where T1() has the usual

properties of a GNP function.                      In particular, if it is differentiable in the

first three arguments, the first partial derivative is equal to a, the second

to X, and the third to Y (See Helpman (1984) and 11am and Helpman (1987)).                              If

it is not, the vectors of supplied outputs consist of the set of gradients with

respect to the first three arguments.                        Thus, with differentiability   of fl() the

commodity market clearing conditions can be written as

These conditions provide s solution for the equilibrium prices (p,p) and the

development of new products n as functions of the expenditure level, E.                           The

equilibrium factor rewards as functions of E can then be derived by observing

that factor rewards are equal to the gradient ci f1(-) with respect to                        V

     Equations   (13) and          (18)    constitute an autonomous system of differential

equations.   They apply whenever the implied rate of product development is

non-negative.    Global stability requires the function                      v()   to be declining in E

whenever v(E)>0.          For now, we simply assume that this condition is satisfied.4

     The phase diagram for the system is depicted in Figure 1.                         From (13), we

see that the    E0    schedule is an upward—sloping line in (E,n) apace with slope

of E, which we denote by E.    The horizontal line in the figure depicts points

at which there is no product development.          Note that there are can be no

equilibrium of the economy above this line, because this would require negative

product development, which of course is not feasible.5               The relevant regions in

the figure are those on or below the horizontal line.

      Point S io the figure represents the steady state.              For n(0)c n, there is

a single trajectory that leads to point 5, represented by the dashed path.

This is, in fact, the unique equilibrium trajectory for n(0)< ;.                 For initial

points below this trajectory, expenditure approaches zero as time progresses,

which violates the conditions for consumer optimization.               For initial points

above the path, the conditions for profit maximization ultimately are violated.

To see this, note that any such trajectory hits the horizontal line along which

is above the upward sloping ray, operating profits         it   =                are larger

operating profits exceeds the cost of R&D, making it profitable to develop new




5. Suppose that   Q,  and consider the system of equilibrium conditions
comprising (7), (10), (12), (14), (16) and (17). These are 5+k equations in
5+k unknowns, where k is the number of factors of production. The unknowns in
this system are the k factor rewards, two prices for final consumer goods, two
aggregate output levels for the final-goods sectors, and the expenditure level.
Naturally, the solution for the expenditure level in this system is E. Thus,
n0 in equilibrium implies EE, and the system can only be on or below the

left of S are not consistent with long run equilibrium.6



P    piCase
     We now consider a s'ecial case that will be used to discuss trade issues.

There are only two factors of production —-           unskilled   and skilled labor -— and

there are    fied     input-output coefficients.      Hence,

             V =     , w1 =           and             [Lzi     for   z =

                 LHJ          Lri                    L5HzJ

where L stands for unskilled labor and H stands for human capital, which is our

measure of skilled labor.          We assume that the traditional sector is the least

human-capital intensive and that the overall human capital-to-labor ratio

satisfies               H/L <aH./aL. for jx,n.        The latter assumption is required
             aHy/aLy<
to ensure full employment.

     The comparative statics analysis of (7), (10), (12), (14), (16) and (17)

that is executed in the Appendix shows that the function u(E) is declining for

this case.     Therefore the dynamic path is as described in Figure 1; the number

of available brands and expenditure are increasing over time.                This in turn,




6.  If the initial number of products exceeds n, the economy settles
inediate1y at a stationary state, with the number of varieties and all real
magnitudes forever constant.  In what follows, attention_is focused on tbe case
in which the initial number of products is smaller than n, and in particular on
the case in which it is zero.

implies that the level of R&D activity is declining through time, as well

the following price and quantity dynamics (see Appendix for a proof):7




Proposition            1:


(a) w/w       >    p/p      >   p/p   >   r/r;
(b)       >       0;

Hence, the real wage (of unskilled labor) is rising and the real reward to

human capital is falling through time.                    This statement refers, however, only to

the standard method of measuring real incomes.                    Since in this type of an




7.  In deriving our comparative statics results, we have assumed that full
employment of both factors obtains all along the equilibrium trajectory As is
well known, even in static models, full employment is not guaranteed for
fixed-coefficient production functions. In the steady state of our dynamic
system we have an essentially-static two—sector model (because R&D is zero)
with a piecewise—linear, kinked transformation curve. Full employment then
requires restrictions on the parameters of the utility function so that the
slope of the indifference curve at the kink, adjusted for the degree of
monopoly power 1/a, falls between the slopes of the flat portions of the
transformation sue. Put differently, full employment obtains in the steady
state if for            EE
                 the solution to the system of equations (7), (10), (12), (14),
(16), (17) and (18) yields non—negative factor rewards. We also require
non—negative values of the factor rewards when the system is solved with
EE(0). These two conditions at the endpoints ensure full employment and
non-negative factor rewards along the entire equilibrium trajectory, since the
                                                                         there
wage rate is rising and the reward to human capital is falling whenever
is full employment (see (a), (b) and (c) of Proposition 1). If these
conditions are not met, however, there may be unemployment of unskilled labor
during an initial phase of the dynamic equilibrium, or unemployment of human
capital during an ultimate stage, or both.

environment variety is valued per-se (see Helpman and Krugmsn (1983, Chp. 6))

and the available variety increases over time, real incomes of unskilled

workers necessarily increase hut real incomes of skilled workers oeed not

decline.8     The product-development           sector contracts while the production of

industrial goods expands.         The traditional sector contracts if and only if R&D

is more humao-cspital        intensive thsn production of industrial goods.              This

completes the description of the integrated world equilibrium.



3.     TEe Pattern of Trade in        aycCouny World
       We suppose now thst the world consists of two countries, labelled "A" and

'B'.   The two countries share common tastes and technologies identical to those

specified for the integrated economy.                   We allow for the exisoenoe of integrated

section.    We ask first whether the trade equilibrium osn reproduce the

there exists the term with n, which represents the love-of-variety effect.
This real income component is rising as a result of expanding variety.

equalization everywhere along the equilibrium path, we derive the properties              of

the trade equilibrium.

     Consider Figure 2.       The dimensions of the rectangle in the figure

represent the worldwide       factor endowments, with the division of these

endowments between countries represented by a point such as E in the interior

of the rectangle.       For concreteness, we suppose that country A is the

relatively human capital rich country; i.e.,                    >
                                                      14a1'La       H.t,/L.

     At time t0, the resource allocation of the integrated equilibrium is

found by substituting E(0) and         n(0)0 from    the equilibrium trajectory into (7),

(10), (12), (14), (16), (17) and (18) and solving for n(0), X(0), and Y(0).9

Let points Q° and C° in the figure represent this allocation, where vector AQ°

is employed in R&D, Q°C° is employed in the X-sector, and C°B is employed in

the Y-sector   (and the slopes of these vectors correspond to the factor

proportions required in each of these activities).              The allocation of the

integrated equilibrium can be achieved in a two-country world so long as it is

possible to decompose the industry employment vectors into non-negative

components for each country that exhaust their separate endowments,              In the

figure, this is accomplished with employment vectors AN° (=AP° + P°M°) and

is country A, and vectors EZ° (rM°N° + N°C°) and Z°B in country B.             Evidently,

the feasibility of such a decomposition requires that point E be in the

interior of the triangle AC°B.          A sufficient condition for this is

9. The system of equations that determines resource allocations, commodity
prices and factor rewards yields a solution for X(0) that is strictly positive
when EE(0), despite the fact that n(0)=0. Strictly positive consumption of
both classes of goods is dictated by the Cobb—Douglas form of the sub—utility
function. It requires, of course, that x(t) •            +
                                                   as t * 0 from above.
Although our model breaks down at t=0, it is perfectly well behaved in the
limit as t approaches zero from above. Therefore, we feel justified in
ignoring the technical problems that arise at time zero.

        In the steady state, R&D ceases, and all resources are devoted to

production.     Let point C    represent the allocation of resources to the two

productive sectors in the steady-state equilibrium of the integrated economy.

In the diagram, we depict the case where R&D is more human-capital          intensive

than production of the differentiated products.           In any event, the allocation

at point C    can be decomposed into feasible allocations for the two countries

provided that   aH/aL    >
                             Ha/La >   H/L   >
                                                 aH/aL.    In the figure, this

decomposition is achieved by allocating in country A the vector of factors AN

to the production of x-sector goods, and the vector N F to the production of
                                                                                    1

     2
and C represent sectoral allocations for the equilibrium of the integrated

economy.     Each such point can be viewed as an allocation of some factors to

industry y and some factors to the combined activity of development and

production of x-sector goods.      The latter composite activity requires factors

in proportions intermediate to the requirements for the two component

activities,     It follows that, if it is feasible to decompose the employment

vectors of the integrated economy corresponding to the initial allocation and

the steady-state allocation, then it will also be possible to do so for all

times between these extremes.      A sufficient condition for factor price

equalization to obtain all along the path of the trade equilibrium is that the

human capital-to—labor ratios of the two countries be bounded by the factor

intensities of (i) the less human-capital intensive activity among R&D and




10.  We must show further that this proposed allocation of resources to the
production of industrial goods in each country is consistent with the number of
products previously developed there, since outputs of all varieties are equal
in the integrated equilibrium. We establish below that this condition is
indeed satisfied for the proposed decomposition.

production of sector—x products and (ii) production                                 of good y.   For the

remainder of this section, we shall assume that this condition is satisfied.

in Country A to the composite activity nf R&D and the production                           of

differentiated         goods in the two-country equilibrium.                 These points all lie on a

straight line through E with slope a11/a0.                    We can further decompose these

allocations into vectors of factors employed in the component industries.                                For

example, at time         1   (corresponding to global allocation C               ),   country A   employs
                                    1                                   11

country B employs N N              in R&D and N C        in the x-sector.       The corresponding

points for time 2 are shown in Figure 3, where we have enlarged the relevant
                                                                         11           511

11.  We note that x(t) is common to goods produced in both countries, because
factor price equalization implies equal prices of the different differentiated
goods, and thus equal amounts of these goods are demanded by consumers. Since
                 the last statement follows.
X(t)n(t)x(t),

                                                                                                  12
their total outputs of differentiated                        products.       Finally, because N N       is

parallel to C C       ,   both of     these ratios must remain constant through time.

      We are now prepared to investigate the evolution of the pattern of trade

in the two-country equilibrium.                   Consider first the direction of trade in good

y at some arbitrary time t.                 From equations (19) and (20) we can solve for the

outputs of good y in each country.                       The ratio of these outputs is given by



             Y(t)         L[h(t)—H/L
                      =
             'b(t)        Lb[h(t) -

where hc(t) is the human capital-to-labor ratio in the composite activity of

R&D   and   production of good x                 Since
                                                          hc
                                                                 is a weighted average of the

human-capital intensities of the two component activities, it is bounded by

 naHo /aLn                                 But each of                            haH/L.

                   x Hx Lx
conditions needed for factor price equalization, so


h(t)_Hb/Lb
                >   h(t)•H/L              > 0.    It follows that
                                                                             Y(t)/Yb(t)
                                                                                          <
                                                                                              L/L.
       Next we calculate the ratio of demands for good y.                            In each country,

expenditure on good y is a constant fraction of total expenditure.                                   Since

consumers in both countries face the same price for the good, the ratio of

aggregate demands is equal to the ratio of total expenditures.                                 Now, from (5),

                                          (t)/Eb(t)          E(O)/Eb(O).

                                                 -20-




Note that the ratio of initial wealth levels on the right-hand side of (22)

includes only factor incomes, because initial asset holdings are zero and

assets scquired along the path earn no excess returns.

        Equation (22) and h/hb      >    1   together imply E (O)/Eb(0) > L/Lb.                  Thus, the

ratio of demands for good y,                                 also exceeds                Since
                                    cva(t)/cyb(t)                              La/Lb.

Proposition 2:      The humsn-capital rich country imports the labor intensive

traditionsl good y at every moment in time.



It is not surprising, of course, that factor endowments should play a major

role in determining the pattern of trade in good y.                    What is surprising,

perhaps, is thst neither the diversion of resources to R&D, nor the existence

of aggregate trade imbalances can upset the strong prediction of the

Heckscher-Ohlin     theorem at any point along the equilibrium path.

        We establish a similar result for trade in differentiated products.                         Each

differentiated product is manufactured in only one country, yet each is

consumed world-wide, so the pattern of trade in the individusi products is

clear-cut.     The existence of such intra—inudstry trade features prominently in

the static models of trade with increasing returns to scale.                        We focus here on

the pattern of trade for the sector as a whole.                     We have already shown that

XaIL0    is constant over   time.       So too is C

                                                                              xi.
                                                                                     .   This    ratio

like that for consumption of good y, equals the ratio of initial wealth levels

in the two countries.       Now if Cx/Cxb >                     this would imply that Country A
                                                   X5/X11,

imports both goods for all t.           But such an outcome would violate the

     Finally, we consider the pattern of intertemporal trade.                We define

aggregate savings in country        i   as the difference between total income and total

expenditure.   These savings are used to accumulate assets, where a. represents

the accumulated stock of assets in country i.             We may think of these as being

ownership shares in firms, in which case current account imbslsnces give rise

to foreign equity ownership.         Or we may think instead of international trade

taking place in short-term bonds, with all firms owned by local residents.                  The

two forms of portfolio trade are equivalent here, as is clear from the fact

that the profit rate equals the instantaneous interest rste (see (11)).                  With

either interpretation,       the instantaneous current account surplus for country i

is given by



                 -   it.(t) = w(t)L.+       r(t)K, + n(t)z(t) -    E(t) n(t).
                                                                         -




Of course,   z(t)+   zb(t)
                              =   n(t)+   nb(t)
                                                  at all points in time and the two

current accounts sum to zero.

     There are two offsetting influences at work in determining the current

account in our model.        On the one hand, the human-capital rich country

undertakes relatively more investment in product development than would be

predicted based on its relative size alone.             This excess of investment demsnd

tends to creste a current account deficit for this country.             On the other hand,

the reward to human capital is falling over time, while the wage rate of

unskilled workers is rising, so that the human-capital            rich country experiences

s decline in its relative factor income.             This effect alone should lead Country

A to save a relatively greater share of its income, at least early              on.   For

these reasons, it seems possible that the human-capital rich country may be
                                             -23-




running either a deficit or a surplus on its current account.           We have not been

able to establish any analytical results that prove otherwise.




4.    1ultinational Corporations

      Our analysis of the trade equilibrium has relied upon the assumption that

every brand has to be produced in the country in which it was developed.            This

requirement xcludes the possibility of licensing and the existence of

multnationa1 corporations.          Naturally, under the conditions of the previous

section, entrepreneurs have no .ncentrve to license and firms have no incentsve

to become multinational.         Suppose, however, that R&O requires more human

capital per unskilled labor than producti n of ndustriai goods, but that

Country       As   human capital-to—unskilled-labor   ratco is larger than that of the

industrial sector.         In terms of Figure 2, this means that point F is above the
      m
ray AC    .    Then the integrated equilibrium cannot Oe reproduced without

licensing or the emergence of multinationals.          In what follows we explore the

latter possibility.

      Following Helpman (1984), assume that production of a variety consists of

two activities that can be decomposed, such that headquarter services can be

located in one country while actual production takes place in another.            For

simplicity assume that headquarter services are produced with human capital and

that production plants use these services and unskilled labor only.'2           Suppose

also that headquarter services have to be produced in the country in which a

brand was developed.         Than the integrated equilibrium can be reproduced even

when the endowment point E is above        AC   in Figure 2.   The resulting allocation




12.  It is easy to see bow the analysis is modified when both activities
require human capital and unskilled labor, as in Helpman and Krugman (1985,
Chp. 12).
                                       the case in which the extent of
patterns are presented in Figure 4 for

multinationality      is minimal (see Helpman (1984) for a discussion of this

assumption)

     It is clear from the figure that up to time Tm at which CTm becomes the

                                                       for the formation of
integrated equilibrium allocation there is no pressure

multinational corporations.        However, immediately after this point in time

                                                if both activities of
equality of factor rewards cannot be maintained

industrial firms are concentrated in the same country.           This exerts pressure

for their separation, with the tendency to locate production in the potentially

unskilled-labor      cheap country; i.e. ,   Country B. A   suitable allocation is


presented in the figure.        At time T the integrated equilibrium allocation is

described by point CT.       Its aggregate variables are reproduced by the following

allocation in the trade equilibrium.         Country A does not produce traditional

time, its factor market clearing conditions read (compare to the discussion                                         if

     From (2Sf we observe that output of x-produ.ts is increasing in country A

if and only if R&D is declining                      Since R&D approaches zero when the steady

state is approached,             ox     must be increasing rinse to the steady state

However, from 24) and (25) we obtain

                          LXn                        n


which together with the previous result implies that the degree of

multinatsnnality           increases close to the steady- state (recall that hn'hx is

assumed on this           section).

     We have shown that the degree of multinationality -- as measured by the

volume of output or employment in subsidiaries -—                                  is   increasing when the

multinationals        start to form and when the economy approaches a steady state.

These results also can be extended to cover a third definition of the extent of

multinationality:              the number of products produced by subsidiaries.                         This

number obviously              is rising initially, when the multinationals                       start to form.

That it is also rising close to the steady state we show by proving that x is
                                            -26-




declining close to the stesdy state.         Since we have already shown that mx is

rising, a declining x implies a rising m; i.e., an increasing number of

products produced by subsidiaries.

     The proof proceeds as follows.         Since the dashed path in Figure        1   is above

the 5=0 line, the ratio 5/n is declining when the trajectory approaches point

(n,E).   On the other hand, from part        (d)   of Proposition   1   we know that p is

increasing as this point is approached, because in this section we require R&D

to be more human—capital intensive than x.            Therefore
                                                                  xsxE/Pn is declining
close to the steady state.         Hence,




Proposition 5:          If differences in factor composition are wide enough and

product development is human—capital intensive relative to production                  of

differentiated products, then there exists           a   time period in which multinational

corporations emerge.         The degree of multinationality —- as measured by the

number of products produced by subsidiaries, or their volume of output, or

employtsent
              --   is   rising initially and when the world economy approaches the

steady state.



     In closing this section we note two additional features of economies with

multinational      corporations.    First, it can be shown that in comparison to

economies with factor endowments that do not bring about the formation of

multinationals      but which have the same evolution of the number of products up

to time Tm  in the world with multinationals after time Tm Country A has a

smaller number of products and Country B a larger number than in the world

without multinationals.          Second, the pattern of trade described in the previous

section need not bold in the presence of multinationals.                It is clear that the

pattern of trade in y-goods is the same as before.              However, the pattern of
                                              -27-



trade in x-goods might change.           This may come about because Country A exprts

headquarter services, and it may therefore end up importing x-goods, which it

exports before the formation of multinational corp.rations.

Ohlin pattern of trade is presrved all along toe dynamic path of toe traooug

equilibrium.      This is true despite the fact that trade is not balanced along

this path.      We further establish that if product development is human-capital

intensive relative to productoo of differentiated producta, the volume of

trade as   a   fraction of world GNP or world expenditure grows over time.

Finally, we show that for certain endowments points, the emergence of

multinational      corporations ie necessary for the preservation of factor price

equalization, and that in these circumstances the extent of multinational

activity generally rises over time.

     The framework that we have developed is suitable for the study of

additional issues.         The analysis here excludes factor accumulation to focus

attention sharply on growth due to product innovation.                    In future work, we hope

to incorporate accumulation as an alternative vehicle for investment.                    This
                                     —28-




will allow us to consider the interactions between resource expansion and

technological progress as sources of growth, and to derive the conditions under

which there occurs everlasting growth in per capita income.   We also plan to

study the dynamic effects and efficacy of alternative commercial and industrial

policies.

                 -         =                       -                                                                           (A.l3)

from (A.8) and (A.9), we obtain



                  -        =             -
                                  Ly         8Lx                                               (A.14)



and from (A7) and (A.8), we obtain



              -       r   =
                                8L                                                              (A15)



Equations (A.13) -              (A.15)   together with (A.12b), part (h) and the assumption

that y is labor intensive relative to x ——                   which                         —— prove part
                                                                     implies   8L>   0Lx

(a) of the proposition.                Part   (d)   is a direct consequence of (h), (A.8) and

(A.12b).   Part           (e)   iS a direct consequence of (A1O) and (h).            Moreover,    (A.1O)

proves that the function v(E) is declining, because the right-hand side of

(A.lO) is negative.

     From (16) and (17) we have:



                          X =   E -




                          Y = E -




Using   these expressions,             E = 1, as well as (A8), (A.9) and (A.l1), we obtain:



              =                   -                                                              (A16)

                                      6Lx 1nix

Equations (A.12a,b) together with the assumption that y is labor intensive

relative to x imply that the right-hand side of (A.16) is positive                            This
                                     -32-




together with part (h) proves part (f) of the proposition.    From (Al?) it is

evident that given that y is labor intenaive   relative to x, the right-hand   side

is positive if and only if n is labor intensive relative to x, which together

with (h) proves part   (g).
