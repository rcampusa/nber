                                           ABSTRACT

How much economic value did the diffusion of broadband create? We provide benchmark estimates
for 1999 to 2006. We observe $39 billion of total revenue in Internet access in 2006, with broadband
accounting for $28 billion of this total. Depending on the estimate, households generated $20 to $22
billion of the broadband revenue. Approximately $8.3 to $10.6 billion was additional revenue created
between 1999 and 2006. That replacement is associated with $4.8 to $6.7 billion in consumer surplus,
which is not measured via Gross Domestic Product (GDP). An Internet-access Consumer Price Index
(CPI) would have to decline by 1.6% to 2.2% per year for it to reflect the creation of value. These
estimates both differ substantially from those typically quoted in Washington policy discussions, and
they shed light on several broadband policy issues, such as why relying on private investment worked
to diffuse broadband in many US urban locations at the start of the millennium.

I. Introduction

In September 2001, approximately 45 million US households accessed the Internet

through a dial-up connection, while only 10 million used a broadband connection.1 By

March 2006, a sharply contrasting picture emerged: Approximately 47 million

households (and growing) had broadband connections, while 34 million (and declining)

used dial-up.2

       The economic determinants behind this trend are straightforward: Dial-up became

available first and diffused to more than half of US households. Broadband emerged later

as a higher quality and more expensive alternative, albeit one available in only a few

places and from a limited set of providers, if any. Then over time, broadband became

more reliable and more widely available, and as that happened, many households paid to

upgrade their Internet service.

        The upgrade to broadband motivates a seemingly straightforward question: What

was the contribution to new economic value created through the replacement of dial-up

access with broadband? This type of question has appeared in prior literature measuring

new goods, and prior work has developed two conventional approaches: One focuses on

the creation of new economic growth, as measured by new gross domestic product

(GDP), and the other focuses on new consumer surplus. Neither economic yardstick is

better than the other, because each measures something different.

        Addressing this topic is not solely of academic interest but also informs long-

standing policy interest in deployment of the “last mile,” that is, the supply of services for

delivering data between the national/global data grid and end-users. In recent times the

revenue associated with the last mile was quite large. In fact, Internet access revenue

measurements reached $39 billion in 2006. For some time, there has been debate about

the structure for maximizing the economic gains from building this infrastructure.3 Most

of the literature does not examine -- but instead assumes -- that the infrastructure led to

large economic gains. In contrast, this paper examines the potential for the

(mis)measurement of those gains.

        Here, we calculate a benchmark for the two conventional approaches to

measuring economic gains. We render these numerical estimates in the spirit of Johnson,

who states, “That, sir, is the good of counting. It brings every thing to a certainty, which

before floated in the mind indefinitely.”4 In other words, we provide numerical estimates

where before there had been none. This establishes the plausible range of the size of the

measured economic gains from the upgrade to broadband.

        Our findings are as follows: While broadband accounted for $28 billion of GDP

in 2006 (out of $39 billion in total for Internet access), we estimate that approximately

$20 to $22 billion was associated with household use. Of that amount we estimate that

broadband’s deployment created approximately $8.3 to $10.6 billion of new GDP. In


        3
            The policy concern arises from the belief that this infrastructure plays a key role in fostering
others, and from international ranking showing that the United States has lower deployment than many
other                          developed                            countries.                           See

addition, between $6.7 and $4.8 billion is new consumer surplus. In both cases, this is

above and beyond what dial-up would have generated. The newly created GDP is

between 40% and 50% of measured total GDP, while consumer surplus (which is not

measured) is between 31% and 47% of the newly created GDP. We can express the latter

gain as an equivalent decline in prices. We show that Internet access price indices would

have to decline 1.6% to 2.2% per year to account for the consumer benefits generated

from upgrading to broadband.

         Our estimates are interesting for a number of reasons. First, they are much lower

than those typically quoted by Washington-based policy analysts and lobbyists, who

regularly quote outsized economic benefits from the deployment of broadband in the

range of hundreds of billions of dollars.5 We believe our estimates suggest that these

outsized estimates are dangerously misleading at best and are rendered with flawed

economic reasoning and incorrect statistical approaches.6

         Second, our estimate also differs from the CPI (Consumer Price Index) for

Internet access. We correct a historically inaccurate inference about the pricing of

Internet access and conclude that the official index’s timing of price decline is actually

several years too late.


         5
             Crandall and Jackson (2001) forecast is a typical example, emphasizing indirect benefits with a
title that discusses a “$500 Billion dollar opportunity.” Crandall (2005) cites the same study and others,
pegging the gains at $300 billion. More recently, Connected Nation (2008) pegs the benefits from national
deployment of broadband in only rural areas at $134 Billion. For a summary of these and other studies, see
Atkinson, Correa, and Hedlund (2008), which stresses both the direct effects from building broadband and
a large number of secondary economic consequences, once again, coming to very large gains.
           6
             For example, the report by Connected Nation (2008) uses estimates of the growth brought about
by broadband in urban areas to estimate its impact in rural areas. Such estimates do not control for
endogeneity or the projecting of results to ranges of data far out of sample. The report also adds additional
benefits to broadband by focusing on the “indirect” benefits from deployment of broadband. The language
of “direct and indirect” benefits obscures the boundary between private willingness to pay and externalities,
as found in conventional economic approaches.
                                                          4
        Third, our second conclusion leads to another implication: We inform

understanding about why the national policy of the last decade has had the effects it did.

Initially, most federal policy sought to subsidize the deployment of dial-up technologies

to less-served areas and users7; but, at the outset of the millennium, policy changed.8 The

new policies relied largely on the private incentives of private actors to deploy broadband

technologies, without subsidy or any regulatory intervention. In retrospect, they seemed

to work well—that is, wire line-based broadband diffused widely. Yet, this outcome was

puzzling in light of the lack of price change measured in the CPI. In fact, our findings

resolve this puzzle: Price indices undervalued the gains to users, and these gains were

what motivated the upgrade at many households. In addition, our recalculation of

conventional GDP estimates illustrates that the incremental gain to a broadband supplier

from creating new revenue covered the costs of investments in urban and suburban areas.

In short, there was no policy magic to relying on private incentives. Private benefits

simply exceeded private costs if both are measured correctly.

        As emphasized by Fogel (1962), Bresnahan and Gordon (1997), and many others,

neither yardstick for economic gains is easy to measure in ways consistent with standard



         7
           In the early 1990s, US national policy focused on deploying technologies that allowed for higher
data-transfer rates over telephone lines, such as ISDN (Integrated Service Date Networks), which supported
bandwidth speeds of 128k. Later, changes to access and interconnection policies altered investment
incentives for incumbent local exchange providers. For example, the e-rate program was a provision of the
1996 Telecommunication Act and sought to subsidize the cost of deploying dial-up access for hard-to-serve
areas. Later still, the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) reclassified broadband investment
outside the range of procedures used to review common carriers, raising incentives for such investment. For
an overview, see Goldstein (2005), Neuchterlein and Weiser (2005) and Greenstein (2008).
         8
           It is no exaggeration to say that policy was shaped by events, such as the implosion of
competitive local exchange competitors (the so-called “Telecom meltdown”), the AOL/Time Warner
merger, the dot-com bubble burst, and Worldcom’s and Enron’s bankruptcies. So too did the effects of the
administration change on the legal interplay between the FCC and courts reviewing its decisions. For an
overview, see, e.g., Goldstein (2005), Neuchterlein and Weiser (2005) and Greenstein (2008).

economic foundations. In this case, rendering benchmarks requires accurate data on

prices and quantities for household use of the Internet, and these must be interpreted

through an appropriate model. While we do not present any statistical advances in this

paper, we do illustrate the importance of using well-known economic methods for an on-

going policy debate, particularly where such methods are regularly overlooked.

Assembling the best publicly available sources of data is also another of this paper’s

contributions. A third contribution is the calibration exercise we perform using different

assumptions consistent with the available data. That exercise exposes the importance of

specific assumptions and focuses attention on areas that require improvement and more

precision. In that sense, our study is in line with the sentiments expressed by Flamm and

colleagues (2007),9 who argue for putting US broadband policy on a footing more firmly

founded in conventional economic reasoning and transparent statistic approaches.

        Our plan is as follows: In Section II, we briefly discuss our approach to measuring

the economic value generated by broadband. In Section III, we measure the diffusion and

pricing of Internet access services during the years between 1999 and 2006 in relation to

the GDP and CPI. In Section IV, we discuss the data we collect; and in Section V, we

perform our simulations of the value created by the diffusion of broadband. Finally, in

Section VI, we conclude with an assessment of future directions for policy discussions.




        9
          Flamm, Friedlander, Horrigan, and Lehr (2007) focuses on a wide range of issues, such as
measuring productivity and assembling new data to accommodate novel on-line economic behavior. The
primary goal of this paper is to dig deeply into one aspect of this broad agenda.

II. The Measurement of Economic Benefits from New
Goods

There is an established literature for measuring the economic gains from the deployment

of a new good. It has been widely accepted since Fogel (1962) that it is an error to focus

solely on the demand for and supply of the new good. Instead, attention should be paid to

the additional benefits beyond what would have occurred without the deployment of the

new good. Fogel famously illustrated this concept by measuring the contribution of

railroads to economic growth in the United States in the mid-Nineteenth Century, while

stressing the economic growth above and beyond what canals would have provided had

they continued to operate. In this paper, there is an analogous measurement—between the

deployment of broadband and what would have occurred had broadband never deployed,

i.e., had dial-up continued to operate at a large scale.

       Here, we measure two gains from the new good by addressing two questions:

First, what is the increase in revenue (GDP) above and beyond what would have been

generated had dial-up continued? Second, what is the increase in consumer surplus

beyond what would have occurred had dial-up continued? When doing these exercises we

will follow convention and not worry about which vendor or user gains or loses, but will

only compute an aggregate measure.

       We focus on revenue instead of producer surplus because we are hampered by the

lack of precise information about the unit cost of provision, which is necessary for an

estimate of producer surplus at each point in time. Instead, we examine the difference in

revenue between vendors with broadband and those without, absent multiplier and

                                                   7
general equilibrium effects. That is, we estimate how much the GDP increased in the

Internet access market as a result of the deployment of broadband. Then, to provide a

ballpark of the producer surplus generated, we compare that estimate against estimates

for upgrade costs for an initial broadband build-out and typical variable costs per year.

        To measure consumer surplus ideally, we should measure the difference in “areas

under the demand curves” between the actual demand for broadband and what consumer

surplus would have demanded had dial-up continued and not been replaced by

broadband. This is challenging to do for many reasons, but one is primary here: We

cannot observe what the dial-up market would have looked like had broadband not

diffused. Instead of measuring two demand curves, we get close to our ideal measure by

looking at estimates of user willingness to pay for the upgrade to broadband.

        Our approaches provide a more precise interpretation of the economic gains from

broadband in comparison to the approach commonly employed in policy discussions

today, which focuses on “indirect/direct” benefits from the upgrade.10 Here, we measure

the economic factors considered by parties involved in a transaction—anything that

shapes the perceived or anticipated costs of using dial-up, the willingness to pay for an

upgrade to broadband, and/or the decision not to return to dial-up. The following factors

shape revenue for suppliers: Sale of second lines, revenue for dial-up access, and revenue

for broadband access. The following factors shape the anticipated value of broadband

service and, hence, the willingness to pay for an upgrade: Savings on a second line,




        10
           Such reasoning can be found throughout policy discussion about the economic benefits from
diffusion of broadband. See e.g., Atkinson, Correa, and Hedlund (2008) for a summary.
                                                       8
savings on commute time, anticipated health and entertainment benefits, and anticipated

savings on phone bill (e.g., if user moves to VoIP, or Voice-Over Internet Protocol).

       Our understanding of these factors circumscribes our interpretation of the

estimates, which do not include externalities, such as benefits or costs not considered by

the parties involved in the transaction. For example, our interpretation does not include

externalities to suppliers, such as the benefits to Cisco from selling more Wi-Fi

equipment to users, to Amazon from additional sales because broadband users experience

more satisfying service, or to Google from more advertisement sales because users stay

on-line longer. Similarly, our interpretation does not include externalities to users. Those

would be unanticipated or unperceived costs or gains—such as the unanticipated

slowness that one neighbor’s use imposes on another’s in a cable architecture, or the

benefits that one person’s participation in a p2p (peer-to-peer) network confers on

another (as long as there is no membership fee).


II. i. Gaps in Measurement
While our exercise follows the spirit of Fogel (1962), we recognize the criticism that

technical change in a key nationwide infrastructure motivates an endogenous response in

complementary goods and services (see, e.g., David 1969). This alternative approach

would argue that had broadband never diffused, many of the complementary services

(e.g., downloadable music, video sharing) might not have been invented, or alternative

innovations might have dominated an industry where dial-up had primacy, thereby

altering the demand for dial-up. In this alternative view, the Fogel-exercise is mis-

specified when these complementary services have great economic significance. Further,


                                                   9
that misspecification invariably becomes more likely, and of greater economic

importance, as time passes.

        We avoid addressing such debates for two reasons. First, we focus on such a short

time period (eight years). More to the point, our data will show that most US households

have comparatively little experience with using on-line broadband. Second, most surveys

of on-line household use after broadband upgrades show only mild changes in the time

and composition of activity on-line. These changes are not symptoms of radical

transformations in economic behavior, as would occur if the entry of complementary

services were economically important to the economic gains realized by users who adopt

broadband.11

        The approach in this paper will lead to much smaller estimates of the economic

benefits from the diffusion of broadband than found in existing policy studies. This arises

for several reasons: First, as noted, we follow the spirit of Fogel's research and others

have not.12 Second, this study does not count any indirect benefits. In our reading of other

studies, it appears that the presence of indirect benefits has been license for analysts to

blur the boundary between internalized benefits and externalities in economic growth. At

worse, analysts have added many benefits to the deployment of broadband far out of

scale with the private benefits motivating adoption.13 Third, we calibrate against the




        11
            Surveys show that the greatest changes in behavior among new users of broadband occur in
music downloading and total time on-line, not in the general distribution of time spent among different
categories of activities other than music. See e.g., http://www.pewinternet.org/.
         12
            For example, Crandall and Jackson (2001) calculate the entire area under the demand curve for
broadband, but leave open question as to whether that consumer surplus would have arisen with dial-up
anyway.
         13
            See, e.g., Connected Nation (2008) for an especially egregious example of misuse of this
license.
                                                        10
actual diffusion pattern of broadband over eight years, not any forecast of an ideal year or

adoption pattern. Calibrating against history (instead of a forecast) grounds estimates and

removes considerable hype.


III. Measuring Broadband Services
III.i. Internet Deployment Policy
To familiarize readers with this technology and market, we provide a picture of

deployment, adoption, and revenue generation for broadband. All these data tell a similar

story. The diffusion of dial-up coincided with the initial use of the Internet in most

households. The diffusion of broadband came a few years later and, most commonly,

involved an upgrade of the bandwidth for many households.

         For all intents and purposes, during this period, broadband service was delivered

to households primarily in two forms of wire-line service — over cable or telephone

lines. The former involved a gradual upgrade to cable plants in many locales, depending

on the generation of the cable system.14 The latter involved upgrades to telephone

switches and lines to make it feasible to deliver a service called Digital Subscriber Line

(DSL). Both of these choices typically supported higher bandwidth to the household than

from it—called Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) in the latter case. Some




         14
            In many areas, households also had access to direct supply of high-speed lines, such as T-1
lines. This was prohibitively expensive for almost all users except businesses, and even then, it was mostly
used by businesses in dense urban areas, where the fiber was cheaper to lay. Fiber to the home has recently
become cheaper, and may become a viable option sometime in the future. See Crandall (2005). During the
1990s most cable companies sold access to the line directly to users, but made arrangements with other
firms, such as Roadrunner or @home, to handle traffic, routing, management and other facets of the user
experience. Some of these arrangements changed after 2001, either due to managerial preferences, as when
@home lost its contract, or due to regulatory mandates to give users choice over another Internet Service
Provider (ISP), as occurred after the AOL/Time Warner merger. See Rosston (2006).
                                                         11
cable firms built out their facilities to deliver these services in the late 1990s, and many—

especially telephone companies—waited until the early to mid 2000s.

         Broadband has several appealing features that users experience in heterogeneous

ways. In comparison to dial-up service, broadband provides households with faster

Internet access and better on-line applications. In addition, broadband services are also

“always on,” and users perceive that as a more convenient service.15 Broadband also may

allow users to avoid an additional phone line for supporting dial-up. That said, many

factors shape the quality of a user’s experience, such as the capacity/bandwidth of lines,

the number of users in the neighborhood in a cable system, the geographic location of a

system in the national grid, the frequency of use of sites with geographically dispersed

caching, and the time of day at which the household performs most activities. In brief,

generalizations are hard to make beyond the obvious: Broadband gives the user a better

experience than dial-up access.16


III.ii. Measuring Diffusion
Broadband was available in only a few locations in the 1990s and the early 2000s, but it

became more available over time. User demands for high-bandwidth applications

increased as households became familiar with high-bandwidth Internet applications (such




         15
            Surveys show that a maximum rate of 14.4K (kilobytes per second) and 28.8K were
predominant in the mid 1990s for dial-up modems. The typical bandwidth in the late 1990s was 43K to
51K, with a maximum of 56K. DSL and cable achieved much higher maximum bandwidths, typically
somewhere in the neighborhood of a maximum rate of 750K to 3M (megabytes per second), depending on
the user choices and vendor configuration.
         16
            Download speed may not reach the advertised maxima. In cable networks, for example,
congestion issues were possible during peak hours. In DSL networks, the quality of service could decline
significantly for users far away from the central switch. The results are difficult to measure with precision.
                                                          12
as music downloading). Firms also rolled out new services as more users acquired

broadband (e.g., Web2.0 applications), which then generated even more adoption.




        This story is consistent with Figure 1, which provides a summary of the federal

government’s efforts to collect data about the adoption of the Internet.17 The first

questions about broadband use appear in 2000 and show a growth in adoption, peaking at

close to 20% of households in 2003, when these surveys were discontinued for some

time.18 Recent data about household use, collected by the Pew Internet and American

Life Project, show that the diffusion continued in the anticipated direction, accelerating



        17
            The first government surveys of household Internet adoption date back to 1997. These came
from additional questions in the CPS Supplement, which had added questions about household use of
personal computers in 1995. See NTIA (1995). These were continued with surveys in 1997, 1998, 2000,
2001, and 2003. See NTIA (2004). The survey was stopped after 2003, then reinitiated in 2007. The latest
data are not available, as of this writing. CPS Supplement surveys prior to 1997 also examined PC use at
home, but asked about use of generic on-line services, such as CompuServe, not Internet access. For
simplicity and consistency, we stick with Figure 1.
         18
            The descriptive results were published in reports authored by staff at the NTIA. See NTIA

somewhat.19 Notably, adoption reached over 47% of households by 2006. We will

discuss this data in more detail below. In Table 1, we provide a summary of another set

of efforts by the FCC to measure the deployment of broadband lines, information that the

FCC collects from surveys of firms.20 It tells the same story as Figure 1, but from the

vendor-side of the market: Vendors were increasingly deploying broadband lines,

presumably to meet growing household demand.

         There are no revenue estimates for household broadband services, but we can

place a bound on an estimate for the combination of household and business revenues.

The US Bureau of the Census estimates revenues and publishes these in its Annual

Service Survey. Table 2 provides a summary of these reports, to which we have made

considerable adjustments to correct for related measurement issues (See Appendix).22 We

            The FCC has never asked about deployment of dial-up. It also has never asked about the prices
of broadband.
         21
            See http://www.fcc.gov/wcb/iatd/comp.html, Broadband Reports, Table 3, for precise
definitions. This table covers any line with at least 200kps in either direction.
         22
            The adjustments are for changes in sampling frame; Census does not return to historical
estimates and review the sampling frame of prior estimates to make all the estimates consistent over time.

expect that between 60% and 75% of the revenue in Table 2 is from households,

depending on the year and access mode.23

         The growth in revenues in Table 2—from $5.5 billion in 1998 to $39 billion in

2006—is astonishing for an entirely new market, especially one that did not start growing

quickly until after 1995. Broadband revenues comprise approximately half the total

revenue over the eight years, beginning with less than 6% in 1999 and growing to 72% of

the total revenue in 2006.

         These revenue levels are important to stress, because access fees generated most

of the revenue during the first decade of the commercial Internet. The typical household

spent more than three-quarters of its time on-line at free or advertising-supported sites,

devoting most of its Internet budget to access fees, not subscription fees.24 Although

subscription-based services and advertising services have started growing rapidly after

2003, the amount spent on access fees each year far exceeds advertising revenue.

Advertising revenue is now growing at a more rapid pace than subscription fees, and it

may exceed access revenue soon, but not as of this writing.25




         23
             We came to that estimate by the following means. First, our estimates below suggest household
revenue for the Internet overall makes up 70% to 75% of the total revenue. Second, the FCC broadband
deployment report puts the number of broadband lines to households at roughly two-thirds of the total
number of lines deployed. Since revenue per line for business likely exceeds that for households, it is
plausible that household revenue is closer to 60% of total revenue. See Table 13: High Speed Services for
Internet Access at http://www.fcc.gov/wcb/iatd/comp.html. Hence, in the text we say “60% to 75%”. Note
that Table 1 and 2 are not comparable, since Table 1 is for households only, while Table 2 is for households
and business.
          24
             See, e.g., Goldfarb (2004).
          25
             The following will provide a sense of the magnitudes of different activities. In the 2006 Annual
Service Survey, Web Search Portals (NAICS 518112) generated $6.3 billion in advertising in 2006, out of
$9.1 billion in total revenue. This is up from $4.5 billion and $3.3 billion in advertising revenue in 2005
and 2004, respectively. In addition, Internet Publishers (NAICS 516) generated $2.6 billion in revenue in
2006, up from $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion in 2004 and 2005, respectively. That is still far less than the $39
billion in access revenue in 2006.

III.iii. Measuring Prices
Another way to measure technical progress is through the decline in prices. The CPI for

Internet access is officially called Internet services and electronic information providers,

which the Bureau of Labor Statistics began compiling in December 1997, after

approximately 20% of US households had adopted the commercial Internet.26 Table 3

displays a monthly quote from the price index, taken the last month of each year, and

normalized to 100 for the year in which the index began.

        26
            Entry into the provision of dial-up Internet services began to explode in 1995 and 1996. The
potential appeal of selling access to the World Wide Web induced most of the entry in 1995 and 1996. See
Downes and Greenstein (2002). Stranger and Greenstein (2007) estimate a quality-adjusted price index for
access between 1993 and 1999 and find that most of the dramatic price decline came in 1995.
                                                               16
        The series has a distinct pattern: It indicates that the official price index for

Internet access in the United States went mildly down and up during the five years of the

dot-com boom and bust, between December 1997, and December 2002.27 It then declined

5% over the next three years, between December 2002, and December 2005—again, a

mild decline for a downturn. Then, in late 2006, it declined more than 18% from its base

(i.e., (94.5 – 77.2)/94.2 = .183). We note that the drop continued (illustrated with the

quote from 12/07). It settled at a 23% from its base in January 2007 (i.e., (94.5 –

73.4)/94.5) and it stayed there for the year.28 Also, looking closely at the monthly data

(also not shown), a mild downward trend began in the fall of 2006, with the big drops

occurring in October, November, and December.29

        We believe this pattern is primarily due to America On Line’s (AOL) pricing

decisions. Specifically, in the fall of 2006, AOL announced a dramatic change to its

pricing: It was moving to advertising-supported service in response to losing customers to

broadband.30 We see the index behave in ways consistent with AOL’s announced price

change. By the fall of 2006, the trade press conjectured that AOL’s service went to less




        27
            With only a few exceptions, the index does not change much month to month or year to year, so
we could have taken a sample of another month and gotten a similar picture.
         28
            This pattern differs from many closely related categories, which is somewhat puzzling at first
glance. Specifically, during the period from December 1997 to December 2005, official price indices for
the United States demonstrated the following patterns: Computer software and accessories declined 42%;
personal computers and peripheral equipment declined 88%; telephone hardware, calculators, and related
consumer items declined 55%; and wireless telephone services declined 35%.
         29
            The indexes in July, August, and September 2006 are 97.3, 94.7, and 93.1, respectively. The
index then drops to 87.0 in October, 81.1 in November, and 77.2 in December, settling at 73.4 in January
2007.
         30
            AOL did retain a number of revenue-generating activities other than advertising. For example, it
gave users the option to maintain an email account for a nominal fee (e.g., $5/month).
                                                        17
than one-quarter of the US households that used the Internet.31 When one vendor makes

up approximately 25% of an index and it announces a 100% decline in price, it is

tautological that the index must decline by 25%. That is nearly what we observe: A 23%

decline in price in a very short period. To be clear, this is merely “informed” speculation,

since we have not examined the confidential BLS data. It is theoretically possible that

other prices were moving downward and upward at the same time.32

         To bolster our contention that AOL’s price change was primarily responsible for

the observed trends, we note two other examples consistent with that theory. First, after

AOL’s merge with CompuServe in the summer of 1999, when its market share was much

larger, AOL attempted to give price breaks to former CompuServe users (as part of an

attempt to move them to AOL email addresses and other services). That price break

appeared to have moved the index down for three months—May through July. The effect

lasted only as long as AOL’s promotion; thereafter the index returned to its previous

level.33 Second, no large change in nominal prices occurred for seven years. Since the

late 1990s, AOL’s dial-up service has been $21.95 (plus or minus a dollar). Its prices

never went down dramatically except the two times just mentioned. For most of the time




         31
            The 23% market share for the index is a plausible number. The last expenditure survey was in
2005, but due to lags the 2006 index uses the survey from 2003. Source: BLS web site. In 2003 dial-up’s
revenue share of household use of the Internet was approximately 53–55%. See Table 3. If AOL’s market
share was 60% of dial-up, then a 26–27% decline is the result. For more on AOL’s market share see Alex
Goldman’s market share rankings, at http://www.isp-planet.com/research/rankings/usa_h.html, who lists
AOL at 24% to 26% market share for 2003.
         32
            Almost certainly some prices other than AOL’s were decreasing. That would have to be true to
account for the other mild declines in the index.
         33
            The price index was 103.4 in April of 1999. It declined to 77.5 in May, 53.5 in June, and 79.4 in
July, and returned to 99.0 in August.
                                                         18
covered by this index (1998–2005), AOL was the dominant dial-up national provider by

far, with a market share between 40% and 60% for dial-up firms.34

         Nevertheless, our speculation is not completely air-tight because we only have

partial information about non-AOL providers, which make up the other half of dial-up

supply. Market share is skewed among this category of providers, but there was also a

considerable amount of restructuring over time, so it is difficult to speculate how actual

market events corresponded to BLS’s sampling.35 The little systematic and public

evidence we do have is consistent with the explanation that nominal prices did not

change.36

         Another piece of evidence regarding the price index is also quite speculative. It

has to do with broadband prices, which slowly (and only recently) have become a bigger

part of the price index.37 For cable modem service and DSL service, price levels also

have been largely unchanged: Respectively, somewhere between $36 and $40, plus or




         34
              Our data on AOL come from Alex Goldman’s market share rankings, at http://www.isp-
planet.com/research/rankings/usa_h.html.
           35
              Rosston (2007) documents a large decline in the price of backbone services. This raises a related
question: Why did access prices not drop with the emergence of a backbone glut in the United States,
beginning in 2001 and thereafter? After all, the price for backbone services is a key cost input into the
provision of access service. That question awaits further research.
           36
              Stranger and Greenstein (2007) estimate prices for dial-up by all the other dial-up providers for
1993–1999. They find little change in the median or average nominal prices between 1996 and early 1999
(i.e., without controlling for quality). For example, the median price of a contrast for 28K service is $19.95
and does not change between May 1996 and January 1999. The average price (unweighted by market
share) for this same set of contracts in the same time period is $22.64 and $19.01. Most of the major price
decline occurs prior to 1997, before BLS initiates the index; that is, between January 1995 and May 1996
(which is coincident with the initial diffusion of the commercial browser and the beginning of the
commercial Web).
           37
              Table 3 partially hints at this fact. In that table, which included both household and business
revenues, broadband revenue does not exceed dial-up revenue until 2004. Household revenue would track
that pattern closely, perhaps lagging slightly because the rate of household adoption of broadband lags
business adoption. In addition, BLS survey procedures would add an additional delay into incorporating
that changing fraction of expenditure.

minus a few dollars.38 Except for a few publicized (but largely unused) marketing

schemes to lower prices to satisfy regulatory requirements, several sources indicate that

broadband price levels paid by users have not changed much. There has been evidence of

price declines only very recently (i.e., 2006) and only for the DSL prices in the Pew

reports.39


III.iv. Diffusion and Prices
Like many new goods, broadband did not diffuse immediately to all households.

Slowness by itself is nothing remarkable for a new good, but it is puzzling in light of the

stable transactional prices observed in the data, as a price decline cannot be pegged as the

catalyst for adoption in this case, as it often is for later adopters of new goods. Our

preferred hypothesis for this puzzle is consistent with a key motivation for this paper:

Unmeasured factors shaped outcomes.

        What unmeasured factors played a key role in stopping adoption decisions?

Plenty of reports suggest there were changes in the availability, bandwidth, reliability,

and anticipated performance for broadband over this time period.40 For example, in

many neighborhoods broadband was not available in any form for some time after

2000.41 Even when it became available, it may not have been reliable enough to spur



        38
            This is the price level in the 2002 sample in Savage and Waldman (2004). Pew’s estimates are
similar for 2004 and 2006, with a decline in the average price of DSL in the most recent sample. John
Horrigan, private communication (July, 2008).
         39
            John Horrigan, private communication (July, 2008).
         40
            This theme arises often in NTIA (2004) and http://www.pewinternet.org/.
         41
            For example, NTIA 2004 reports (from a 2003 survey) that over 20% of rural Internet users did
not believe they had broadband available, while just under 5% of urban Internet users make such a
statement. A large number of households also report that access was too expensive. Other common reasons
given for no Internet or broadband include lack of interest and lack of a computer at home. Even as late as
2007, the FCC reports that only 82% of US households had access to DSL lines, while 96% had access to a
                                                        20
many households to switch quickly from dial-up, thereby inducing users to wait until

vendors improved the infrastructure or service arm of the organization.42 Many

households also waited until they changed their use in sequence (e.g., learned how to use

the Internet for music downloading on an iPod), which then led to the upgrade.

         Said another way, standard price index survey procedures measure the price at

which the new good transacted but not the price that previously deterred the user from

adoption. The price index should fall, but it does not because there was no measured

price change.43 Finding the price change and acquiring a more complete price index

requires complete information about all the factors deterring or motivating adoption,

which is difficult—perhaps impossible—for most price agencies to collect.


IV. Data
In Table 4, we summarize the data used to simulate the economic gains from the

diffusion of broadband. Here, we provide important information about our sources and

their limitations.

http://www.fcc.gov/wcb/iatd/comp.html.
         42
            Comparing broadband deployment reports from the FCC shows evidence of upgrading by cable

particularly Table 5, High Speed Lines by Information Transfer Rates.
         43
            This explanation is an example of what economists label a substitution bias. Such biases are
quite common within categories of goods, as users move market share to the cheaper good, while the price
index only records change in price, not the full change in expenditure. See e.g., the Boskin Commission
Report (Boskin et al. 1996) or Braithwait (1980). Previously documented examples include the replacement
of general purpose retailing outlets with discount outlets (Reinsdorf 1993), the diffusion of generic drugs in
competition with branded pharmaceuticals (Griliches and Cockburn 1994), and the movement of voice
communications from land-line telephony to cellular telephony (Hausman 1997).

IV.i. Adoption of the Internet.
To derive the total number of adopters, we estimate the percentage use of dial-up and

broadband technologies across all households and then multiply this percentage of

adopters by the total number of households.44 Data about household use of dial-up and

broadband Internet comes from two sources, the NTIA (National Telecommunications

and Information Administration) and Pew. 45 We use the NTIA estimates through 2003

and use the Pew estimates thereafter. Pew’s data are good for measuring adoption, but

incomplete for measuring price and quality.46 Data about total number of households

come from the US Census estimates.

        44
            We prefer this because it builds on surveys of users rather estimates of broadband deployment,
such as those kept by the FCC. That choice does not matter until the end of the sample. While the FCC
numbers do not differ much from Pew’s overall, they do differ recently. We prefer the Pew data because it
is consistent with the data from the NTIA, and surveys of users also inform us about other relevant factors
for measurement, as will become clear in the discussion.
         45
            For years between 1997 and 2003 when we have no direct observation, we interpolate between
the two closest known measures of adoption percentage with a target towards midyear.
         46
            Pew’s surveys ask a variety of questions, most recently including questions about bandwidth,
prices and use, but did not get complete answers. For example, 80% of respondents do not know the
bandwidth of their broadband in the 2005 survey. John Horrigan, private communication (July, 2008).
                                                         22
IV.ii. Second Lines.
Table 4 provides estimates of the total number of households in the United States with at

least one second line. We gather this from FCC reports, which do not break out second-

line use into its primary purpose.47 Prior research has shown that several factors

determined the growth of second lines in the 1990s, including use of the Internet.48 The

growth and decline in households with second lines is highly correlated with the growth

of dial-up Internet access and its replacement with broadband lines.49 For example, in the

latter part of the 1990s, the use of second lines grows from 11.4% in 1994, to 26.3% in

2001. It declines after 2001—from 26.3% to 10.5% in 2006.50

        These trends put bounds on estimates of the second lines supporting Internet dial-

up. For example, 16 million households had an active second line in 2003, a decline from

18.4 million in 2002. The 2.4 million drop in second phone lines represents the upper

bound for dropped lines by broadband adopters, meaning that a maximum of 53% of dial-

up converts dropped a line that year.51 More broadly, that percentage varies between

2002 and 2006, rising no higher than 53% and falling no lower than 25%.52

        In our base specification, we reduce the volatility in the estimates from the role of

second lines. Specifically, we assume that one-third of broadband adopters drop a second

line between 2002 and 2006, while we will assume no broadband adopter drops a second

            The other primary driver of the decline in second lines is the growth of cell phone use.

         51
            Strictly speaking, the upper bound could be larger if more than 2.4 million broadband adopters
dropped a second line at the same time others were adding lines, since we observe only a net change.
         52
            In other years, we get different percentages, and prior to 2002 there is no decline in use of
second lines one year to the next.

line between 1999 and 2001. That results in the right level of dropped second lines by

2006, but we view this as a conservative approach (i.e., a deliberate undercount).

        A second telephone line can cost a household as little as $16 a month in some

cities and as much as $24 before including per-minute usage charges, which are generally

low. For our simulations, we use an average of $20.


IV.iii. New Users and Converts.
Neither the NTIA reports nor the Pew reports provides statistics for each year about

whether new broadband adopters are new users of the Internet or converts from dial-up.

At first there was good reason for this lack of information; there was no question that

virtually all household broadband adopters had experience with dial-up before upgrading.

Some new users, however, moved directly to broadband in later years. In his report

describing adoption behavior in the Pew survey between 2005 and 2006, John Horrigan

mentions that new users of the Internet comprised a large percentage of the adopters of

broadband that year.53 He did not mention this for earlier periods because it simply was

not a significant factor until then.54

        Those facts help pin down several assumptions about conversions. We have no

way to know the rate of conversions precisely since public surveys only ask about total

adoption in a given year, not any yearly tally of new Internet users. Yet, we are certain




          53
             John Horrigan does highlight that few adopters of broadband went straight to broadband without
first using dial-up. Horrigan also states that 4 (out of 8) million broadband adopters were new users of the
Internet between 2005 and 2006, and never before had Pew’s surveys found a percentage anywhere near
that high. See http://www.pewinternet.org/.

             Horrigan, private communication (July, 2008).
                                                        24
that the vast majority of the broadband adopters between 1999 and 2004 were former

dial-up users, and we are not so confident about the same fact in more recent years.

       Hence, we assume the following: For our baseline specification we will assume

100% (all 10 million households) are converts in 1999-2001. There are approximately 37

million additional adoptions in 2002-06, with 31 million of those occurring prior to 2005.

The number of new users finally becomes large enough to notice near the end of our

sample, but cannot exceed 50% of the 6 million adopters in 2006, and, to remain

consistent with Horrigan’s observation, it is must be less than 50% of the 14 million

adopters between 2004 and 2005. In other words, we assume that 10 million new Internet

users among broadband adopters is too high a number, and 3 million is too low. For lack

of better number, we will split the difference and assume 7 million in our baseline

specification, then test alternatives assumptions. For our baseline estimate, that means 30

million broadband adopters between 2001 and 2006 were converts from dial-up. For

convenience, we will assume an 81% conversion rate for 2002 through 2006 (instead of

concentrating it all in 2005 and 06).

       To test the importance of this assumption, we calculate implausible extreme

bounds (81% convert rate and 100% convert rate for all years). These bounds will move

estimates in a predictable direction, but result in outcomes outside the range of what we

consider plausible, so they show how this assumption affects the final estimation. Below,

in rows three and four of Table 5, 6, and 7, we provide a summary of such extreme

bounds in comparison to our benchmark estimate.




                                                25
IV.iv. Price Levels.
We do not observe prices directly. Consistent with the generally reported patterns for

nominal prices and for simplicity, we assume for all of our simulations that price is

unchanging over time, and we set the average price level for dial-up to $20.55 We choose

that price because it is the reported average dial-up price for users in two CPS

Supplements in the 1990s.56 We assume the average price for broadband is either $36 or

$40, depending on the simulation we conduct. Again, this is consistent with reported

price levels in Pew reports and other research.57




V. Benchmarks

We begin with estimates of the revenue generated by broadband and then consider

estimates of consumer surplus. Following that, we provide an estimate of an equivalent

price index. Throughout, we try to maintain a conservative stance and show how a range

of assumptions alter the qualitative results. To be clear, this is a calibration and an

accounting exercise. When we vary parameters we are not estimating demand; rather, we

are holding fixed the known facts about broadband’s deployment (i.e., Table 4) and are


         55
             We could examine the effect from small price fluctuations. We do not do so below, since, for
obvious reasons, the qualitative results change things very little.
          56
             It is also the median price in Savage and Waldman (2004) and Stranger and Greenstein (2007).
The CPS supplement asked about monthly expenditure (which looks close to monthly prices) in only two
years and not thereafter. The consumer expenditure survey, however, continued to ask about on-line
expenditures for Internet services every year. While it is not a price index, it looks close to prices (but does
not distinguish between use of broadband and dial-up until after 2001). The difference between some
expenditure and none is a good indicator of a household’s use of the Internet, and correlates with changes
in other levels of expenditure for related goods, such as music and videos, as well as other forms of
entertainment. See Hong (2007).
          57
             For US price quotes, see e.g., Savage and Waldman (2004), Chen and Savage (2007), Crandall,
Sidak, and Singer (2002), Rappoport et al (2003), and Flamm and Chadhuri (2007).

learning how changes to key assumptions about the underlying features of diffusion alter

inferences about consumer surplus and new revenue generation.

        Throughout we maintain the comparison between broadband and a counterfactual,

namely, what would have been supplied by dial-up in the event that broadband had not

arisen. We keep this counterfactual straightforward: for example, we do not consider

endogenous technical change, such as how other complementary services might have

changed (e.g., music or video downloads) had the counterfactual technology (dial-up)

remained dominant and un-replaced by broadband.


V.i. Creation of New Revenue
We begin with a calculation of a single year, 2003, to illustrate how we provide a full

accounting of the new revenue affiliated with broadband. In the process of explaining a

single year, we will articulate the principles that apply to all years.

        Because the average price of residential broadband access was somewhere

between $36 and $40 a month in 2003, residential broadband generated an annual

revenue of somewhere between $8 billion ($36/month × 12 months × 18.5 million

households) and $8.9 billion (if the price is $40/month).

        We first estimate how many broadband users formerly used dial-up. On the basis

of our previously stated assumption that with a adoption rate of 81%, 30 million users of

broadband were converts, the new adopters of the Internet (not converts) generated

between $455 million of revenue (if the price was $36) and $505 million of revenue (if

the price was $40) in 2003. Converts—those who switched from dial-up—generated

between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion.


                                                  27
        We next calculate the proportion of revenue generated by dial-up converts that

was cannibalized, that is, when the revenue source changed while staying within the same

firm. If the average price of dial-up Internet access was $20 a month, then that accounts

for $1.1 billion of cannibalized revenue. That is not all, however. In addition to the loss

of dial-up revenue, there was a loss of revenue from retired second phone lines, with

which many households had supported their dial-up Internet. Using 2003 as an

illustration once again, newly retired phone lines from dial-up converts amounted to a

loss of $357 million in revenue for phone companies in 2003. That puts the total

opportunity cost of lost dial-up revenue and second-line revenue at $1.4 billion.

        In summary, broadband created additional revenue between $964 million and $1.2

billion in 2003. That accounts for both new revenue and cannibalized revenue from

former dial-up users and retired second phone lines.

       We conduct similar calculations for each year, 1999–2006, which we provide in

the Appendix and summarize in Table 5. The aggregate revenue gain for 1999–2006

stemming from broadband adoption is $10.6 billion in our baseline specification when

broadband prices are $40. That is 46% of an estimated $22.6 billion in GDP at the end of

the sample (i.e., 47 million households x 12 months x $40 per month).

       We are interested in understanding how much our assumptions matter for a

benchmark. Table 5 shows the results. Specifically, if prices are $36 instead of $40, then

the total estimate reaches $8.3 billion (41% of $20.3 billion). If all broadband adopters

are converts (which is higher than plausible) and prices are $40, then our estimates of

revenue gains are $2.3 billion lower than in the baseline case. If 81% of adopters are

converts every year (which is lower than plausible) and prices are $40, then our estimates

are $0.9 billion higher.

       In other words, while changes to each of these assumptions move the estimate for

the level of created new revenue in each year in the expected direction, none of these

alters the general pattern over time as more households switch from dial-up to broadband.

Under any estimate, the additional revenue from the adoption of broadband is large,

somewhere between 40% and 50% of measured revenue for households.

       We can summarize it bluntly: Measured revenue is what shows up in GDP, but

the measured revenue is only part of the story. Approximately 40% to 50% of that

measured revenue is new. This means that 60% to 50% of the measured revenue replaces

revenue in dial-up and second lines with revenue in broadband—an amount that is a

combination of business stealing (when revenue goes from one company to another) or

cannibalization .
                                               29
        We redid our simulations with one additional change: We accounted for changes

in AOL’s prices. Since AOL’s prices only go up or down by a dollar or two until the last

year, this makes little difference to the aggregate index. The only appreciable effect is

that converts no longer save $20 at the end of 2006, since AOL’s prices become zero

after September, 2006. That reduces the cannibalized revenue from converts by

approximately $500 million in 2006.58 This makes a little difference in that year, but does

not change any other inference.

        Table 5 and our discussion stress how to decompose the results in 2006 into the

contribution attributable to adoption in each year. There is one additional way to look at

these results, in terms of the total benefits over the eight years from 1999 to 2006. The

largest gains come from those households who adopt in 1999. In their first year of

adoption they generate a 226 million dollar gain (in the baseline estimate with a high

price). We assume they receive the same benefit in all subsequent seven years in

comparison to the alternative, which is going back to dial-up. The same reasoning holds

for the group who adopts the next year in 2000. By this reckoning the total revenue gains

over the eight years are 8*226.9 + 7*536.4 + … + 1322 = 36.8 (29.0) billion for high

(low) price baseline estimate.

        Is that a big number? It depends where one looks. It is 36% (29%) of the size of

the total revenue ($100B) generated by dial-up over the same time period (adding




         58
            We get that by assuming that AOL has 13.1 million households in 2006, which is a 38% decline
from the prior year, when the level was 19.5 million households. Those 6.4 million households faced an
opportunity cost of $20 a month for eight months of 2006 instead of twelve, which reduces the opportunity
cost close to $500 million. Our data on AOL come from Alex Goldman’s market share rankings, at
http://www.isp-planet.com/research/rankings/usa_h.html.
                                                       30
revenue from 1999 to 2006 from Table 2). Of course, the majority of it comes from the

latter part of the sample when there is more adoption.

         Although these calculations tell us nothing about the cost to deploy and support

broadband or, for that matter, the precise level of profitability from its deployment, they

do say something about the economic incentives to perform upgrades. Namely, while

cable companies were the dominant supplier of broadband at the beginning of our

sample, Pew’s survey finds that local telephone companies had a slightly higher market

share than cable companies by 2006,59 but a slightly lower price as well.

         We also could add several additional observations about how cable and telephone

companies differed: Cable did not cannibalize any existing revenue stream, such as from

second telephone lines or an existing dial-up ISP (e.g., Ameritech.com). Telephone

companies, meanwhile, faced regulatory uncertainty in the earlier part of this sample

period over the treatment of their investments. Not surprisingly, cable firms gained

residential broadband revenue sooner than telephone companies did (see Table 1).60 The

only big revenue losers were dial-up ISPs, from whom all the business stealing took

place.

         59
              This is one place where the data from Pew and the FCC do not entirely agree. Table 1 (from the
FCC) gives high market share to cable in the most recent years (2005 and 2006) while Table 3 (from NTIA
and Pew) does not. They generally agree in prior years. If the FCC’s data are correct, then the statement in
the text is not correct, and cable firms have done much better in recent times than the telephone firms.
           60
              The evidence for this statement is partially evident in Table 1, which shows the growth of
household lines. Over this period, cable reached levels of adopters typically two years sooner than similar
levels by telephone firms. It is only partially evident in Table 2, which shows revenue growth, because this
includes both household and business growth. Cable firms, however, get very little of their revenue from
business customers, while telephone companies get a much higher fraction. For example, comparing FCC
statistics on broadband diffusion to all users with those for residential users for January 2006 suggests that
less than 3% of the cable lines go to business customers (0.8 out of 29.1 million), while business generates
a much higher fraction of telephone company revenue: Just over 10% of ADSL lines (2.4 out of 22.5
million) and 35% of fiber lines (244 out of 685 thousand). See Tables 1 and 3 in the reports for high-speed
services for Internet access, available at http://www.fcc.gov/wcb/iatd/comp.html. Hence, Table 2 also
suggests that cable modem access grew sooner than DSL.
                                                          31
         Costs also played a role in these events, although the costs varied by setting (e.g.,

density) and time period (e.g., declining over time) Most estimates from the early

millennium put the cost of initial upgrading of lines to cable and DSL at $400 to $500 per

household in most urban settings, with slightly higher estimates for suburban settings

(e.g., an additional $100 dollars) and much higher estimates for rural settings (e.g.,

another $500 to $1000 per household or more). In all cases, these cost estimates decline

to the industry rule-of-thumb for per-household upgrade costs—as little as $250 (for

cable) and $150 (for basic DSL) for residences in dense urban settings in most recent

times.61 In most cases, post-adoption maintenance costs are estimated to be low, at just

over $100 per household per year.62

         What do those costs mean? Consider the following illustration for a cable firm

that does not experience any cannibalization. For the sake of illustration, consider the

problem facing that firm if it upgrades its system for 2500 homes and expects only 20%

of them to take up the service. At a cost of $250 per household, that means new revenues

(at $480 a year) in Internet service, by themselves, cover the cost of the upgrade in three

             David Burstein, private communications, September 2008. See also Crandall (2005) for a range
of estimates from a variety of sources. In a cable setting this assumes the HFC network has already been
built out to support two-way access. Following OECD (2007), Chapter 5, in the case of DSL, this assumes
the main cost elements are: Customer Premises Equipment (modem); Local Loop (access/operational fee
for the copper twisted pair); Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM); Aggregation Network
(L2 switch); Broadband Remote Access Server (BAS); and a Management System. For a closely related set
of estimates, see http://www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/en/PracticeNote.aspx?id=2899. For more recent
estimates, see Elixmann et al.’s (2008) WIK Consult Report.
          62
             Note what these assumptions imply for a static definition of producer surplus using yearly
variable costs. At $480 dollars per year in revenue and $100 in yearly cost, the variable profits per
household are $380. With 47 million households in 2006, that leads to $17.8 B. That static view seems less
relevant to us than a definition that incorporates the cost of initial retrofit to enable cable modem service or
DSL service, which is the spirit of the discussion below.
                                                           32
years.63 Additional revenue through telephone and other services resulted in covering

those costs sooner. Higher take-up rates also resulted in covering costs sooner. Earlier in

the period those costs were higher, so costs were covered later. A similar calculation

holds for DSL.64 In other words, for most systems, the private incentives to upgrade were

sufficient to motivate investing in upgrading most urban and suburban areas. Similarly,

take-up rates would need to be extraordinarily high to justify even a monopoly build-out

in most rural areas.65

         Table 5 leads to a reinterpretation of one common occurrence in recent

communications industry lobbying: Cable firms have crowed in public forums about the

industry’s willingness to invest in the last decade, as represented by their aggregate

capital expenditure. The industry’s total capital expenditures between 1999 and 2005

amounted to $87.1 billion, never dropping below $10 billion in any given year. Some of

this covered the costs replacing depreciated capital, of course. Yet, the acceleration in

expenditure after 1998 (from $5 to $10 billion or more annually) is consistent with




         63
             Since only 20% adopt, the cost per adopting household would be $1250. In three years the
maintenance expense is $300, which means variable revenue is approximately $1160 on a $40/month
contract. Thus, the costs of upgrade are covered approximately after three years. Of course, this does not
count the interest costs of borrowing, which would increase costs as well.
          64
             The calculation is more plausible with cable firms than telephone firms for reasons alluded to in
the text, because national broadband policy for cable investment did not appreciably change over this
period. Hence, it is possible to examine investment and its consequences in a constant regulatory policy
environment. In contrast, the changes in telephone broadband investment were complex over this time
period, so providing a firm date for their change is difficult since it involves both regulatory actors and
court decisions in a long interplay. For overview of changes to regulatory policy, see Goldstein (2005),
Neuchterlein and Weiser (2005), and for a focus on Internet access see Greenstein (2008).
          65
             For example, consider a cable firm that does not face any cannibalization issues. Even with a
50% take up rate, the economics are not favorable for a $40 service for a rural community of 500 homes
with $1500 per household upgrade costs and $100 per household maintenance costs. Without considering
borrowing costs, investment costs are not covered until after eight years of revenue. For a local rural
telephone firm facing cannibalization issues and a similar cost structure for DSL, the upgrade may be
technically infeasible (due to length of lines), as well as simply cost-prohibitive.

expenditure aimed to convert cable systems to a digital delivery of cable services,66 as

well as facilitate additional services, such as telephone and Internet access.67

          Once again, we can summarize the implication for interpreting regulatory policy

in broadband: The proper benchmark for calculating such returns was not the total

revenue of the market in any given year. Rather, it was the incremental gains in revenue

to those parties from incremental investment aimed at that market. Several factors played

a role in calculating incremental gains, such as the identity of the producer, the size of

potential business stealing and cannibalization, and the speed of household willingness to

respond to new options. Looking at it this way, it should come as no surprise that private

firms invested large sums of money when the incremental gains from doing so were

potentially large, as they were for cable firms facing no cannibalization issues over all

this time period, and as they were for both cable firms and telephone firms that faced low

upgrade costs in urban and suburban settings later in this time period.




V.ii. Creation of Consumer Surplus
In most studies, estimates of broadband demand indicate that there is substitution

between different forms of broadband—that is, substitution between cable and DSL—but

only weak substitution between dial-up and broadband. The latter places some constraint

on demand for broadband, but not much. There also is evidence of upgrade behavior,




          66
             The number of digital households increased from 12.2 million households in 2001 to 30.4 in
2006. See http://www.ncta.com/Statistic/Statistic/DigitalCableCustomers.aspx.
          67
             The number of households with voice service from cable firms grew from 1.5 million in 2001 to
7.5 at the outset of 2006. The growth has accelerated thereafter, reaching 15.1 at the end of 2007. See
http://www.ncta.com/Statistic/Statistic/ResidentialTelephonyCustomers.aspx.
                                                        34
with broadband constraining dial-up demand, but not vice-versa.68 Estimates of

broadband demand generally find that it is elastic, though US estimates tend to be less so

than those of households in other countries.69

         For our estimates of consumer surplus we rely on one set of estimates from

Savage and Waldman (2004). It is representative of the type of findings seen in other

studies, but a easier to use in this context. These authors conducted an extensive survey

of dial-up and broadband users in 2002. We prefer this study because it is based on

slightly later data, and also because it is a survey of both users and nonusers. In addition,

the authors used this survey to directly estimate “willingness to pay” measures for

attributes of dial-up and broadband service, which facilitates some simple accounting of

the value of broadband in comparison to dial-up for existing dial-up users. This is

sufficient for illustrations below.70



         68
             For example, Rappaport, Kridel, Dunnt-Deno, and Alleman (2003) find that broadband service
is partially a substitute for dial-up, with cross-price elasticities of .7 among those with dial-up service,
while dial-up does not act as a substitute for those with broadband (cross-price elasticity of .02). The cross-
price elasticities between cable and DLS are in the .6 and .7 range. Flamm and Chadhuri (2007) use the
2002 Pew Survey and try imputing fewer prices than Rappaport et al. They find that demand for broadband
is comparatively more insensitive to prices and that their detailed data show that demographic factors shape
demand quite a bit. Cardona et al. (2008) find qualitatively similar results to Rappaport et al, with cross-
price elasticities between broadband and narrow band of no greater than .5, and that only when these are
the only two options. Often their estimates are smaller.
          69
             For example, Rappoport et al. (2003) report an own-price elasticity of -1.46 for DSL for a
nested logit model applied to a sample of US households in 2000, while Crandall, Sidak, and Singer (2002)
find an own-price elasticity of -1.184 for a slightly different sample in a similar time period. Using the
same sample, Rappoport, Taylor, and Kridel (2003), page 82, estimate elasticities for different price levels,
finding evidence of more elastic demand. The estiamtes range from close to 1 for DSL and cable modem
prices close to $20 a month, and they change in the expected direction. For $30 DSL prices they estimate a
price elasticity of -2.1, and for cable modem prices of $40 they estimate -2.35. Estimates on samples of
households in other countries tend to find more elastic demand. For example, Pereira and Ribeiro (2006)
find an own-price elasticity for broadband (cable and DSL) of -2.84 for a sample of households in Portugal.
In a sample of Austrian households Cardona et al. (2007) find similar elasticities for broadband
(approximately -2.5) in areas where there are many options, and more inelastic demand (approx -0.97)
when DSL is the only broadband option and dial-up provides the only competition to DSL.
          70
             To be clear, this choice comes with one drawback. It does not fully account for heterogeneity in
household willingness-to-pay. It average outs such differences. We do not believe such accounting would
                                                          35
         Savage and Waldman’s estimates of the willingness to pay for broadband are net

of benefits users receive from dial-up. To remain consistent with their model we assume

users adopt broadband if the additional benefit exceeds the additional cost of converting.

The conversion cost sums two things: The increase in subscription fees and the net

savings in expense for a second line. If the price of broadband is $36, then the average

increase in subscription fee is $16 ($36 less $20). Additionally, many converts dropped a

second phone line, saving, on average, $20 per month for those who dropped. This

impact affects the “average” consumer surplus of converts differently each year,

depending on the average drop rate.

         For example, Savage and Waldman’s lowest estimate of the average willingness

to pay for broadband’s speed is around $11 per month, and their highest is around $22 for

the most experienced and educated user. They also find that users pay more for

broadband because it is more reliable and always on—between $1 and $18 more,

depending on how much more reliability the user perceives in broadband. Savage and

Waldman assume that dial-up has half the reliability of broadband, yielding an additional

value of $9 on average. 71




alter our benchmark calculations much, but we acknowledge it is an open question. The study of
Rappoport, Taylor and Kridel (2003) takes steps in that direction, but did not provide sufficient information
to make a full estimate (such as the distribution of dial-up among this population and its correspondence to
WTP for broadband, or standard errors on their estimates of heterogeneous demand).
          71
             It is reassuring that the average in the Savage and Waldman study, which examines a sample of
only previous dial-up users, is in the same range as the estimates for Willingness-to-Pay from Rappoport,
Taylor and Kridel (2003), which examines a sample of all households. In the latter case the average WTP
in their entire sample is $36.8 for cable and $32 for DSL. Among a truncated sample of likely adopters,
those with Willingness to Pay for broadband above $40, the average WTP is $53.45 for cable and $52.05
for DSL. Note: to make their these estimates into a WTP for a conversation from dial-up to broadband, one
would then need to have information about (or to make assumptions about) the distribution of former dial-
up users in this sample and, among that sub-sample, make further assumptions about their use of second
telephone lines.
                                                         36
        The Savage and Waldman estimates provide an estimate for the number of users

who switched from dial-up, but not one for new users to the Internet. New adopters

started becoming more frequent after the 2002 survey used by Savage and Waldman.

Even though some of the new adopters (surely) had experience with the Internet (e.g., as

students or at work), we take a conservative approach to estimating surplus for

nonconverts. We assume their willingness to pay is what they paid (i.e., they received no

consumer surplus).        This is consistent with our focus on generating a conservative

estimate of the substitution bias arising solely from upgrade behavior among previous

dial-up users.72

        In our base specification, if the subscription fees for broadband are $40 a month,

and someone converts from a $20 a month dial-up account, then the conversion cost is

$20, and we call that the maximum conversion cost. For those who paid the maximum

conversion cost, the low end of the estimates of willingness-to-pay is just enough to

cover the additional cost.

        To be clear, this is one place in the study where we are performing a calibration,

not estimating demand. We do not use this model to predict which household did and did

not adopt broadband, as Savage and Waldman did. Rather, we assume that the quantity

demanded must result in the number of adopting households, as in Table 4. Then we

calculate the level of consumer surplus consistent with Savage and Waldman’s estimates,

while varying assumptions about prices and conversions.



        72
            This is one place where the Savage and Waldman estimates are much easier to use than the
estimates of Rappoport, Taylor and Kridel. Though the late provide a skewed distribution Willingness to
Pay, they give no other indication about how these estimates compare against observable features of the
data, such as whether households had prior experience with dial-up Internet.
                                                        37
        A full accounting of this surplus can be found in the Appendix. It varies from

$6/$10 per month on average in 1999–2001 (when the price is $40/$36 and we assume

that no household drops its second phone line), to $11.35/$15.35 per month after 2002

(when we assume that all converts dropped their second line).

        Table 6 provides a summary of these results. The approximately 40 million

households that converted to broadband since the beginning of the dial-up market

received an additional benefit from their conversion. It amounts to somewhere between

$4.7 billion and $6.7 billion in 2006.

        Baseline high price: Broadband Price = $40; 100% are converts 1999-01; 81% converts 2003-06
        Baseline low price: Broadband Price = $36; 100% are converts 1999-01; 81% converts 2003-06

        Not aggressive conversion: Broadband Price = $40; 81% converts 1999-06




        Comparing Tables 5 and 6 also shows how different assumptions shape estimates

of the distribution of gains from innovation. In the two baseline cases, the total gains

from the diffusion of broadband reach just over $15 billion, though they differ in the
                                                       38
distribution of return.73 As expected, higher prices lead to lower consumer surplus as a

fraction of new value generated, that is, 31.2% and 44.4% for broadband prices equal to

$40 and $36, respectively.

        Comparing two assumptions—that 100% of broadband users upgraded from dial-

up (an aggressive conversion, which is too high) versus 81% of them (an unaggressive

conversion, which is too low)—alters total surplus only a little, but it does alter estimates

of the distribution of returns. Aggressive conversion reduces total surplus by $0.8 billion

(compared to the baseline), while unaggressive conversion increases it by $0.6 billion.

Nevertheless, these assumptions provide a very different distribution of gains from

innovation: 43.2% and 30.0%, respectively. In comparison to the baseline simulation,

assuming an aggressive conversion of dial-up users to broadband yields a large gain for

consumer surplus and a commensurate loss for producer surplus. Assuming an

unaggressive conversion has just the opposite effect.

        Plainly stated, the information in Table 5 gives a sense of the range of changes

that come about from changes in the assumptions, but the direction of change is not

surprising. Rather, these estimates place limits on the range of the benchmark for

consumer surplus. Consumer surplus is between 31.2% and 44.4% of the new revenue

generated, and this is entirely an unmeasured gain from the diffusion of broadband.




        73
           In the $40 baseline estimate, the total gains are 4818.7 + 10595.4 = 15414.1. In the $36 baseline
estimate the total gains are 6735.7 + 8337.4 = $15073.1. When only 81% of the broadband adopters have
upgraded from dial-up, then a reduction in price reduces new producer surplus each year, but increases
consumers surplus by only 81% of the new revenue for vendors. The 19% consumer surplus is lost to our
assumption that new Internet users generate no consumer surplus. The estimates for total surplus are not the
same under different prices except under the assumption that all broadband users are converts from dial-up.
Accordingly, in the simulation at $40 (and $36) with aggressive conversion, the total is 6349.7 + 8326.5 =
$14,676.2. At $40 without aggressive conversion, the total is 4687.9 + 11410.5 = $16,098.4.
                                                        39
       Once again, Table 6 and our discussion stress how to decompose the results in

2006 into the contribution attributable to adoption in each year. Once again, there is one

additional way to look at these results, in terms of the total benefits over the eight years

from 1999 to 2006. The largest consumer surplus accrues to those households who adopt

in 1999. In their first year of adoption they receive a 68 million dollar gain (in the

baseline estimate with a high price), and then we assume they receive the same amount in

all subsequent seven years. By this reckoning the total revenue gains over the eight years

are 8*68 + 7*160.9 + … + 658 = 15.4 (22.2) billion for high (low) price baseline

estimate.

       Is this a large number? By comparison with the size of the total new revenue,

which is $36B ($29B), the gains to consumers generated by broadband over the same

time period is 42% (76%) of the size of total new revenue gains. Notice that in either

simulation new consumer surplus plus new revenue sum to approximately $51B, so

prices simply determine the distribution of gains.

       Once again, we stress that these are benchmark estimates. First, other researchers

found considerable heterogeneity in the demand for broadband, with some adopters of

broadband willing to pay far above the market price. The Savage-Waldman estimate also

measures some of this inelastic demand, but it truncates the level of that valuation among

the biggest fanatics. We have not counted this highly inelastic demand in our valuation.

       Second, we have made no adjustment to these estimates to account for the change

in AOL’s pricing. While we are comfortable with this lack of adjustment—especially

considering how AOL’s price change shapes our estimates—adoption is a slow process;

and the price decline came too late in 2006 to have an effect on broadband adoption. It
                                                40
almost goes without saying, but nobody expects that most broadband users would switch

back to dial-up even if some dial-up became free.

        Third, survey research tends to find a larger willingness to pay from users who

are paying not to have something taken away after they have experienced it than those

who are paying for something they have yet to experience. Savage and Waldman

corrected for this effect by asking both users and nonusers about their valuations;

however, the survey was conducted before widespread broadband adoption, so the

answers about value would most likely be higher if the survey were conducted today

among actual users.


V.iii. An Adjusted Price Index
Standard economic reasoning suggests that the price index will be mismeasured when a

new good results in large consumer surplus. That must be true in this example too. We

briefly walk through the mechanics just to (1) verify that intuition, (2) provide a range for

the estimates, and (3) decompose the causes.

       The standard recommendation is to use the adopters’ reservation value for the

new good; that is, the price index should use the maximum of what a user would have

been willing to expend to get the new good prior to adopting the new good. Thus, the

starting point is straightforward. Converts were willing to pay a virtual price of $51.35

per month on average, but had to pay less. For converts, this was equivalent to a decline

in price of $11.35 ($15.35), but none of this was measured. In other words, against a $40

($36) price for broadband, an average of $11.35 ($15.35) consumer surplus is equivalent

to 22 %(30%) of the monthly price paid by converts for service.


                                                 41
          We now ask how far a price index would have to fall in order to capture the gains

that converts experienced. Table 7 illustrates this result, calculating a weighted average of

the price change for each year as if only converts experienced a price decline. Weights

fall into four categories: (1) dial-up users, (2) existing broadband users, (3) new

broadband users who are new Internet users, and (4) broadband users making an upgrade

this year. In the baseline specification, converts to broadband (who do not retire a second

line, by construction) experience 13% decline in price (from $46 to $40) from 1999 to

2001, which we represent as 0.87. Converts from 2002 to 2006 (who do retire a second

line, by construction) experience a 22% decline in price (from $51.35 to $40), which we

represent as 0.78. We assume all others experience no price decline, which we represent

as 1.0.

        Table 7 shows that this exercise results in an average price decline between 0.984

and 0.978, because in most years only a small percentage of Internet access households

upgraded to broadband. That means the price index for all Internet access should decline

between 1.6% and 2.2% a year by 2006. In this exercise the correction is largest in the

most recent years, when there are more upgrades as a percentage of all Internet

households.

        Another way to represent the price decline is through a Paasche and Laspeyeres

index over eight years—that is, using either the populations in 1999 and 2006 as the

baseline. The baseline for the population matters because there was so much change in

the characteristics of this population over these eight years. Table 4 shows that in 1999,

there were 34.5 million dial-up users and 0.9 million broadband users. In 2006, there

were 47 million broadband users and 34.7 million dial-up users. Hence, the 2006 Paasche

and Laspeyeres indices will use different base populations because of (1) the entry of new

Internet users who later convert to broadband; (2) the entry of new Internet users who use

dial-up in 2006; and (3) the entry of new users who go straight to broadband.

        The different base years matters. If the population in 2006 serves as the baseline,

then 48.9% (39.1/81.7) of households adopted broadband after converting from dial-up in

the baseline estimates. In the baseline estimates, 24.5% (9.6/39.1) of households

experienced a 13% price decline in 1999–2001 and 59.8% (23.4/39.1) experienced a 22%

price decline from 2002–2006.74 Over eight years that adds up to an 8.0% decline in the



        74
            It is plausible because we have 47 million broadband adopters by 2006. We began with 0.9
million in 1999 and 7 million are new Internet users between 2002 and 2006 by construction. Of the
                                                       43
Internet access price index, even with high broadband prices (i.e., $40). It is an 11.2%

decline in prices with lower broadband prices (i.e., $36). In contrast, if the 1999

population serves as the baseline, then it is plausible that all of the users converted to

broadband by 2006.75 We assume adoption behavior consistent with our baseline model.

That is, 9.6 million households experienced a 13% (21%) price decline between 1999 and

2001 if broadband prices are $40 ($36). We assume the remainder (34.7 – 0.9 – 9.6 =

24.2) upgraded between 2002–2006, and that translates into a 22% ($30) price decline.

Accordingly, when broadband prices are $40 ($36), then this population experiences an

18.4% (27.3%) price decline.76

         The Paasche and Laspeyeres index brackets the estimates in Table 7.                             The

minimum is 8.0% (11.2%) and the maximum is 18.4% (27.4%), or an average of 1.0%

(1.4%), and 2.1% (3.4%) decline per year. Our baseline results are 1.6% (2.2%), just

between the minimum and maximum.77 While the middle estimate is almost as much as

AOL’s pricing decision in 2006, there is a big difference in the timing of the recorded

price decline. AOL’s pricing decision concentrates the change in one year. In contrast,




remainder, 9.6 million convert from dial-up to broadband between 1999 and 2001. Hence, if all households
converted, then 23.4 million households converted between 2002 and 2006. This is well below 39.5 (47 - 7
- 9.6 - 0.9). See Appendix.
          75
             This seems natural to us since because it does not come close to the total 39.1 million broadband
converts between 1999 and 2006.
          76
             Using the 2006 broadband population as the baseline, we can estimate a price index that leaves
out dial-up users, but is averaged over a different base. In the baseline estimate when prices are $40 ($36)
we find that 20.8% (9.6/46.1) of upgrading households experienced an average of a 13% (21%) price
decline from 1999–2001 and 63.9% (29.5/46.1) experienced a 22% (30%) price decline from 2002–2006,
while 15.1% (7/46.1) experienced no price decline. That yields a 16.7% (23.4%) price decline over all eight
years for upgrading households. Including all broadband users (i.e., adding the 0.9 million adopters prior to
1999) yields 16.3% and 22.9%, respectively.
          77
             The comparison in the text is over the entire population of households, and each household
experiences only one upgrade, by construction. Hence, to make them comparable it is appropriate to look at
the average rate of decline per year.
                                                          44
accounting for the upgrade when users upgraded would have realized a large fraction of

the benefits many years sooner.

       That simulation informs the puzzling inconsistency between widespread adoption

of broadband, as documented in Table 1, and the lack of measured appreciable decline in

transactional prices over eight years, as displayed in Table 3. A properly measured

broadband price index shows a large change in prices, resolving this apparent puzzle. If

the pricing concentrates on a population of households that were early adopters of the

Internet, then the unmeasured price decline is quite large.

       We now decompose the underlying cause of these conclusions by asking: How

much price decline arises from the retirement of second phone lines? As it turns out,

second lines are not as important as new surplus from conversion. For example, in our

baseline estimates for $40 broadband, the gain is $11.35. The dropped second phone line

is responsible for $5.35, while the consumer surplus is responsible for $6. When the

baseline price is $36, then consumer surplus is comparatively more important. The

second line is still responsible for $5.35, but consumer surplus is now responsible for

$10. These expenses only shape decision making during 2002–2006 in the baseline

estimates. In other words, removing the savings on the second line from the price index

would remove anywhere from a 30% to 40% of the total savings in 2002–2006, or 21%

to 28% of the savings for 1999–2006.

       BLS price indices do not normally count the savings of expenditure in one

category (on a second telephone line) as an input into calculating the price index for

another (Internet access). We appreciate this procedural norm, but we are not fully

sympathetic due to the misunderstanding it produces for policy. Accounting should take
                                                45
place somewhere, and if not, the absence of such accounting should be acknowledged so

policy users of the price indices can properly interpret what they observe.




VI. Conclusion

We contend that conventional accounting of broadband’s effect on the US economy

mismeasures its true economic impact. While broadband accounts for $28 billion of the

GDP in 2006, approximately $20 to $22 billion is associated with household use in 2006.

Of that amount, we show that approximately $8.3 and $10.6 billion of it is additional

revenue (above and beyond what dial-up would have generated), and between $6.7 and

$4.8 billion is consumer surplus. That is, broadband generates new additional revenue

between 40% and 50% of measured GDP, while consumer surplus (which is not

measured) is between 31% and 47% of the newly created revenue. The upgrade was

equivalent to an unmeasured decline in price of between 1.6% and 2.2% per year in all

Internet access prices.

       The paper has focused on measuring the factors that shaped the anticipated

incremental costs and benefits from the national upgrade to broadband. More accurate

measurement illustrates why policy oriented towards relying on private investment

succeeded as it did: The incremental returns were sufficiently large enough to generate

large investments by broadband providers, especially cable firms. It also illustrated why

the gains from the upgrade were large to users in spite of seemingly unchanged nominal




                                                46
transactional prices. The commonly used government statistics, such as a BLS price

index, did not measure the full gains to broadband adopters.

       We have focused on topics for which we can put some bounds on the size of the

measurement issues, albeit imperfectly. However, we do not want to leave the impression

that this settles measurement questions, as many other issues related to quality

adjustments still remain decidedly unsettled. Since these are difficult to measure, they

will likely prove difficult to fix. As a brief example, many broadband firms have recently

upgraded the bandwidth of their lines without increasing prices for consumers; such

upgrades are difficult to record and measure. In addition, the Internet access price index

does not adjust for the improvement in the quality of the many free complements that

have become available over this time period, such as improvements in the Google search

engine, Yahoo! portal, MSN instant messaging client, or caching by Akamai. These

investments increase the quality of the Internet experience for users.

       In addition, our estimates did not include an analysis of the benefits versus costs

not considered by parties involved in the transaction. In the body of the text we included

a range of examples that might incrementally shape the experience at Cisco, Amazon,

and Google. We would expect similar externalities to shape the experience of a wide

range of firms, including Apple, Microsoft, and Intel, as well as many venture capitalists.

We expect many more such examples. Similarly, we did not include externalities to users,

and we can plausibly think of several related mechanisms that would produce both

positive and negative externalities. However, we have tried not to allow the presence of

externalities in broadband economics to become a license to inflate the gains from the

deployment of broadband, so we await further work on this topic.

       We do not, therefore, view our own attempts here as the final word on the

estimation of the size of these effects; rather, we view them as an attempt to benchmark

the size of the issues in one specific case, and by showing their scale, motivate others to

undertake related exercises with greater care than previously shown.

Appendix


Adjustments for Table 2.
Table 2 is constructed from the Annual Service Survey, conducted by the US Census.

The Census Service Annual Survey is available for NAICS 51, as archived on

http://www.census.gov/econ/www/servmenu.html. The annual surveys differ from the

five-year economic censuses. The annual service surveys are estimates of economic

activity, not complete censuses of economic activity. They are designed to provide short-

run estimation at a greater frequency than every five years.

       In general these estimates are based on a particular sampling frame (i.e., data

collected from a small group of firms). In rapidly changing industries, such sampling

frames can, and do, become outdated quickly. The Census alters the sampling frame

frequently (as often as every three or four years), but it does not apply new lessons to old

data. That is, it does not use a new sampling frame to re-estimate archival data. Hence,

historical inconsistencies run throughout this data, particularly in years when new

sampling frames are introduced (in this case that occurs between 2000 and 2001, and

between 2003 and 2004).

       The Annual Survey does not provide guidance about how to adjust data to make

inconsistent historical data consistent with each other. Conversations with employees

indicated no plans to correct historical inconsistencies. In all cases, we try to stay as close

as possible to data in published reports and to use the latest publication, which sometimes

corrects for errors in sampling frame.


                                                  52
       We take advantage of a lucky break in 2004. The Census published two sets of

estimates, one using an old sampling frame and (a few months later) one using the new.

This permitted a direct comparison of the two sampling frames and a correction for prior

years (i.e., 2001, 2002, and 2003).


Cable modem revenue
For 1998, 1999, and 2000, the original data were taken from the tables for NAICS 5175,

from the 2000 report. The data in 2001, 2002 and 2003 came from the listing for NAICS

5175, from the report for 2004, which uses a new sampling frame that differs from prior

years. The data for 2004, 2005, and 2006 came from NAICS 5175, from the 2005 report,

which also used a new sampling frame. Due to a change in the sampling frame, the data

from 2004–2006 were no longer consistent with the data from 2001–2003. For 2004,

there were estimates using both sampling frames, and the data for the new sampling

frame (used in 2004–2006) were found to be 10% higher than the old sampling frame

(used in 2001–2004). For consistency, data in 2001, 2002, and 2003 were adjusted

upward 10%.


DSL revenue
The Census Annual Survey did not report DSL revenue as a separate item prior to 2001.

The data for 2001, 2002, and 2003 originally came from NAICS 5133 and do not include

backbone services. Data for 2004, 2005, and 2006 came from NAICS 5171, from the

2006 report, which used a new sampling frame. As with the other data, due to a change in

the sampling frame, the data from 2004–2005 were potentially inconsistent with the data

from 2001–2003. For 2004, there were estimates using both sampling frames and the data

for the new sampling frame (used in 2004–2006) was found to be inconsistent with the
                                           53
old sampling frame (used in 2001–2004). Data in 2001, 2002, and 2003 were not

adjusted by a fixed percentage, because doing so would have led to implausibly high

revenue in 2001 and 2002 that would be inconsistent with FCC and Pew data on the

number and growth of deployed DSL lines. To generate a series consistent with 2004 and

with the FCC data on deployment, we started with 2004 and worked backwards to data

for 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003. These have growth rates similar to growth in total

DSL lines, as reported by the FCC data on user growth in DSL lines—both business and

household users, not just households as reported in Table 1 (though the data were taken

from the same source). These replace all reported numbers in 2001, 2002, and 2003; and

these replace missing values in 1999 and 2000.


Dial-up revenue
The original data in 1998, 1999, and 2000 were taken from the tables for NAICS 514191,

from the 2000 report. The data in 2001, 2002, and 2003 came from the table for NAICS

514191, which used a new sampling frame from prior years. The data for 2004, 2005, and

2006 were for NAICS 5181111, from the 2006 report, which also used a new sampling

frame. Due to a change in the sampling frame, the data from 2004–2006 were no longer

consistent with the data from 2001–2003. For 2004, there were estimates using both

sampling frames. The data for the new sampling frame (used in 2004–2006) were found

to be 33% higher than the old sampling frame (used in 2001–2004). For consistency, data

in 2001, 2002, and 2003 were adjusted upward 33%.




                                                 54
Wireless revenue
The data for 2004 and 2005 came from NAICS 517212, from the report for 2005. The

report includes Internet access services for wireless carriers, but not satellite services.

Disclosure issues prevented publication in 2006.

       Prior to adjustment for sampling frame inconsistencies, the reports from the

Census Annual Survey (for 1998–2000, 2001–2003, 2004–2006) originally appeared as
