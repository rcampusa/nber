                                   ABSTRACT


     Previous work which showed that prices could aggregate perfectly the
diverse information of traders depended critically on the assumption that all
agents had constant absolute risk utility. We show that either all agents must
have constant absolute risk aversion utility, or all must have constant
relative aversion in order for the strong form of the efficient market
hypothesis to hold generically.

     The notion that stock markets, commodity markets, and futures

markets are informationally efficient Is widely—accepted. When

different traders have disparate information, it is clear that a

single price cannot reveal the information of         of the

participants; but It Is still possible that markets can aggregate

this information, and that prices can reveal all of the relevant

information.     (More precisely, prices can be sufficient

statistics. For example, knowing the futures price, one may be

able to make as good a forecast of the spot price as one could

make knowing the futures price and all of the other information

of the various market participants.

     In an earlier paper, Grossman and Stiglitz (1976) constructed

a Simple model of a futures market that was informationally

efficient.     In their model, there was a large number of farmers,

each of whom had perfect information about his own crop (but no

direct information about the crops of others). The equilibrium

price on the futures market aggregated this disparate information

perfectly, and hence the futures price was a sufficient statistic

for predicting the spot price.

     The Grossman—Stlglitz model had several special properties.

Chief among them was the assumption that all producers had the

same constant absolute risk aversion utility function. This meant

that the aggregate supply of futures only depended on the estimate

of aggregate output:    the distribution of output across farmers
had no effect on the aggregate supply of futures, and hence it had

no effect on the equilibrium futures price.

     In general, one might expect that the distribution of crops

across producers would affect the supply of futures. For

Instance, the supply of futures might be high because all farmers

know that they are going to have a large crop, and want to divest

themselves of the associated price risk; or it may be that the

aggregate crop is small, but with a larger dispersion of crop

sizes.     In this latter case, it may be that farmers with small

outputs are more risk averse, and take a more hedged position,

which outweighs the reduction in hedging by the farmers with large

crops, who are less risk averse.

     The general observation Is that the price on the futures

market is a function of the aggregate level of output and the

dispersion of crop sizes across farmers. The fact that the

futures market is not efficient generically In the model here

indicates that the futures price cannot be fully revealing in
           1,2,3
general.

     This paper determines necessary and sufficient conditions for

prices on futures markets to be sufficient statistics for spot

market prices.4 We employ a simple model of trade on a futures

market to show that there are only two classes of utility

functions for which markets are efficient In general: constant

absolute risk aversion and constant relative risk aversion. The

restrictions to these two families is important because of the

structure of market demand that they generate.

            structure   of   paper. The remainder of the paper is

divided Into three sections. In the first, we set up the basic



                                   2
model.     In the second, we consider the case of cx    ante   identical

farmers.     It is shown there that the only utility functions for

which futures prices are sufficient statistics are those for which

the risk tolerance function is linear in wealth.        If prices are to

be sufficient statistics in more general models, the utility

functions must belong to this class.

     In the subsequent section. we extend the model by allowing

for heterogeneity among farmers. We show that while the constant

absolute risk aversion utility function still works, the constant

relative risk aversion utility function no longer gives the

efficiency result when farmers differ in their respective

coefficients of relative risk aversion.



                                2.   The Model

     There are m farmers indexed by i = 1, 2            m. The farmers

are risk—averse von Neumann—Morgenstern expected utility of wealth

maximizers. There is no motive for pure speculation, so only

farmers trade on the futures market. At time t0, each farmer

sees his crop, q1. At t=l, a round of trading takes place on the

futures market, allowing the farmers to insure themselves by

buying or selling claims on the commodity. At time t2, the spot

market opens.

     Assume that spot market demand is linear:

            p =   a - bQ + 6.


   is the spot price,      is a demand shock, and Q =          is
                                                          q1

the total crop.     Farmers are price takers, and there is no storage

technology here, so the entire crop will be sold on the spot

market.


                                      3
     There is a competitive rational expectations equilibr-iwn In

the futures market. This requires first that the futures market

clears at t1:


           ilxi = 0.

Equilibrium also requires that farmer i selects his supply x. to

maximize expected utility, conditional on Pf and q.:

          x.   = arg sax
                            E[U(pfx+P5(q1_xfllpf,q.].
In sum, plans are optimal with decisions conditioned on the

equilibrium futures prices Pf and one's own output.5



                       3. CondItions on Preferences

     We proceed first by getting conditions on utility that are

necessary for the futures market to be efficient. The spot price

   depends on individual crop sizes only through total supply Q.

For Pf to be fully revealing, it must depend on Q alone, and not

on the individual       values. In other words, Pf must be invariant

to the division of Q among the farmers. An implication is:

     Theorem 1:     In the one—period model, a necessary and

sufficient condition for efficiency on the futures market, when

farmers have identical utility, is that utility be of the linear

risk tolerance class:


          U' (W)/U" (W) = a+bW.

     Proof: The proof is in Appendix A.

     The method of proof Is to show that, In order for the futures

price to be fully revealing, the supply of futures must be a

linear function of the farmer's output. An implication is that

the utility function must come from the linear risk tolerance



                                   4
(hyperbolic absolute risk aversion) class.

      The class of linear risk tolerance utility functions can be

divided into two subclasses    The analysis that follows will focus

on the following representative members of the linear risk

tolerance class:


      1. constant absolute risk aversion (cara): U(W) =

      2. constant relative risk version (crra): U(W) =

The entire linear risk tolerance family Is composed of affine

transformations of the two representative utility functions (and

also U(W)     log(+W)). For example, functions of the form U(W) =

  —         are members. Note also that the class labelled

"constant relative risk aversion' represents a broadening of that

class to include utility functions that exhibit constant relative

risk aversion with respect to a translated origin.

      The necessity of linear supply curves for fitures is

intuitive. Suppose that endowments are altered 5lightly so that

one trader's crop rises while another's drops by the same amount.

For instance, let q1 become q1i, and let q2 become q2—A. Since

the aggregate output is not altered by this transfer, the net

quantity supplied at the price Pf must not change if the price is

to be fully revealing of Q.    In particular, the one farmer's

increased supply must just be matched by the other farmer's

decreased supply.    In order for this neutrality result to hold for

all pairs of farmers and all transfers, each farmer must have a

supply curve with the same constant slope.

      The following section examines the extent to which the

results generalize to cases where individuals have different

utility functions.


                                  5
                    4.   DifferenceS jfl B.iJi   Aversion


     We now ask what happens when farmers have utility functions

within the same class, but with different parameter values. Since

our interest is in determining those utility functions for which

the futures market is always efficient, It Is sufficient to

examine linear risk tolerance utility functions only. We show:

     Theorem 2:     Prices are fully revealing if and only if all

farmers have constant absolute risk aversion utility, or all

farmers have constant relative risk aversion utility, with the

same coefficient of relative risk aversion for each farmer.

     Proof: The proof is in Appendix .

     Theorem 1 has shown that linear risk tolerance Is necessary.

The proof of Theorem 2 shows directly that the utility functions

listed above do imply a linear supply of futures, with the same

slope for each farmer. It is then shown that if farmers all have

constant relative risk aversion utility, but differ In their

coefficients of relative risk aversion, then the futures price is

not fully revealing in general.

     In summation, the only two families that achieve efficiency

generically are affine transformations of the following two

representative utility functions:


     1.   U1(W) =   —e



     2.   U1(W) =   i+
CONCLUS ION

     The insight that prices convey information to market


                                      6
participants and non-participants alike is an Important one.      it

 Is clear that, in general, markets cannot be iriformationally

efficient, In the sense that prices convey all of the Information

of the Informed to the uninformed. Still, It Is possible that

prices might convey all of the relevant informatIon, in the sense

that futures prices might be a sufficient statistic for spot

prices.

     Although earlier work showed that there were examples In

which price was a sufficient statistic, this paper has used simple

and Intuitive techniques to demonstrate that the parameterlzations

employed In much of this work are indeed special:   the constant

absolute risk aversion utility functions, and the constant

relative risk aversion utility functions, with the same

coefficient of relative risk aversion for all traders, are the

only utilIty functions for which efficiency holds generally.

Introducing private information about the demand side further

reduces the likelihood that price can be a sufficient statistic

(Bray [19811).

     While the introduction of additional markets nay result In

futures markets conveying more information, the number and kinds

of markets that would have to be introduced to resolve the

problems discussed here cast doubt on the hypothesis that markets

can aggregate and transmit all relevant Information. This paper

can thus be thought of as providing further support for the view

of prices as noisy signals. Under this view, prices convey some,

but not all, of the information possessed by market participants.

For an exposition of that latter view see Grossman and Stiglltz

(1976, 1980) or Kyle (1989).

                              proof of Theorem 1



     A necessary condition for Pf to reveal total output Q =                  q.
is that Pf be independent of the distribution of Q across farmers.

When facing a price Pf and knowing that the spot price is

distributed as p, farmer i selects his net supply of futures x.

to maximize:


          E[LI(pfx. +     5(q1_x1))Ipf.q1].
(Henceforth the conditioning on Pf and q. will be suppressed.

     The first—order condition is:


          o =                  +
                E[U'(p5q           (PfP5)X1)(PfP5)1.
By symmetry, if q. = Q for all i, where Q = Q/m, there will be no

trade on the futures market and hence x. =               0   for all 1.   At the

same time, if Pf is fully revealing, one need only look at the

case with q. = Q to solve for the equilibrium futures price:


          Pf =   E[U'(pQ)p5]/E{U'(p5Q)1.
     Let z. = q.-Q, and let x(z.) be the desired net supply of

futures, given Pf. Now define the function


          g(z1, z2                 Z1) = x(z1)    +
                                                      x(z2)
                                                                  .   + x(z)
                                                                -z —l
Since g is merely the sum of the net supplies of futures from each

farmer at the price Pf it must be identically zero if the futures

market is efficient. Differentiating with respect to z1 gives

          0 =    x'(z.)
                     1
                          —   x'(—z 1 —z2 ...   —z
                                                  rn—I




                                         8
  = 1, 2,..., rn—i. Hence, for a > 2, we have

            x'(z1)     x'(z2) = x'(-z1—z2                ...
Moreover, for arbitrary ,          the following must also hold:

            x' (z1+)     x' (z2—i) =          x' (z1z2         .   —z1)
Thus x' (z) Is a constant function, so x(z) is linear in z.

      Farmer is wealth can be written:

                                              =           —
            141
                   PfXi +   (q1-x.)               Pfq1         (Pf-P5)(1—x1).
Since the farmer is a price-taker on the futures market, we say

that he has certain wealth pfq• Linearity of x(') shows that

each farmer accepts a gamble that is linear in certain wealth,

given Pf       Following Stlglltz (1973), utility must be of the

linear risk tolerance class

            U' (14)/U" (U) =

for   the futures market to be efficient.

      When the above expression is inverted, it can be rewritten

           d(log(U'(W)fl/dW =           i/a                              b0.
                                   =    (i/b)d(log(a+bwfl/dW             b*O.

The first differential equation characterizes the constant

absolute risk aversion class, while the second characterizes the

constant relative risk aversion class, with a translated origin.

      Sufficiency is now shown. That is, It is shown that                       the
futures price is fully revealing when all farmers have the same
linear risk tolerance utility. Look first at constant absolute
risk aversion utility:
           U(W)

The first—order condition for farmer I is
           o   = [o[P          +
                                       (Pf_s)xi](p_)1
      If          = 0 for all i, then the first—order conditions are



                                              9
identical. Thus x is linear in             and the slope Is the same for

all I.   The futures price is clearly equal to


             Pf E[es•]/E[es'].
     Now consider constant relative risk aversion utility:

             U(W) =

The first—order condition for farmer i is

                                                   —3
             o   = (1—)E[(a   +     + (PfP5)<1)         (Pf P)]
This can be written:

             o   =      + PfX1 +
     If a    +
                 PfX1 is a constant multiple of (q.—x.) for all i, then
the first—order conditions are identical for all i.               Suppose,

then, that

             PfXi = 3(q1—x1)

for all i.       Summing both terms over I gives



                 E(+PfX1)

Market clearing implies that a =      Q.
     The net supply of futures by farmer i is:

             x1 =

which is linear In q1 (for fixed Q). Once again, the slope is the

same for all I. The equilibrium futures price is


             Pf =    E[(a + Q)S]/E[(       +


This completes the proof of sufficiency.
     For m = 2, a separate proof of necessity is required. The

method of the proof is to assume that both individuals know Q,

and then to solve for the equilibrium futures price. If Pf Is

fully revealing, for each value of Q there must be a unique Pf


                                    10
independent of the distribution of Q                             between   the two farmers.

        As before, let x() denote the net supply of futures, given


the equilibrium futures price Pf. Now let q1 =                                     +z   and let q2 =

  — z.    Market clearing ensures that the following condition holds

for all 2:


               x(            z) =
                                        —x(
                                              —       z).
        It likewise follows that

                         +       z) =   x'(       —    z)
and

               x         +       z) = -x ( - z).
The above conditions lmpl' that


               x() = x" ()               = 0.


        We now return to the first-order conditions to get

expressions for these derivatives. For farmer ,                                    the first—order

condition is:


               o   = E{U(pq.              +


Thus,

               dx.                                                         E[U(pf_p9)]

futures market efficiency is x () = 0 or, equivalently,

derivattvos with respect to A, and evaluating at A                 0, gives

This is precisely the condition that T = 0, where T = —U'/U" Is

the measure of absolute risk tolerance. The condition T" =                   0

implies

            U' (W)/U" 1W) = a+bW.


     In these derivations we have made use of the following

formulas:

     A.     The first—order condition is:

            0 =                                 +
                   U'((p+A)q)(p+A-pf)               U'((p5-A)q)•(p9-A-pf),


                                         12
where q = Q/2.             (Henceforth, let IJ'(A) =         U'((+A)q),       U'(—A) =

U' ((p—A)q), etc.) Differentiating the first—order condition

totally with respect to A gives:

                                                -                          U'(A)
            dPf qU(A)(p+A—pf)                       qLJ(-A)(p—A-pf)
                                                                      +            -   U'(-A)
               =
                                                U'(A)    +



Thus

             dPf =

                                 Proof of Theorem                 2



      Write the two candidate families as:
                                                         -&W
           1.    cara              U.(W) =          —e

                                                               l—6
                                                                      l
           2.     crra             U1(W) = (a.+W)

      For constant absolute risk aversion utility, the first—order

condition for farmer I can be written


                       —S1(q1—x1)p5
           o = E[e
                                                (PfP5)l.
Satisfying the first—order conditions for all i simultaneously

requires that &(q1—x1) be equated across all farmers.                                 If

              k for all J, then


            E                      E (k/.).
           j=l (qjx.)            j=l
Hence the supply of futures from farmer I is

           x. =                                  (l/.);
                  q1

which is linear in q., with the same slope for all I.

      For constant relative risk aversion utility, consider first

the case of            .S for i =          1,   2            m.       The first-order

condition for farmer 1 is

                                                         —
           o =                         +             +
                  (l-S)E((1                 PfX1         p(q1—x1))         (PfP5)].
If j+PfXj is a constant multiple of (q1—x1) for all I, then the

first-order conditions are identical. Letting .+PfXj =

for   all i, the first-order condition becomes

                             —     —
           0 =    E{(    +
                             p5)       (Pf—P5)J.

       To solve for , note that



                                                    14
               (a1+PfX1) =

Since    the net quantity supplied is zero in equilibrium, this

implies

               m
                          =    Q.
               1=1


Thus      = aJQ, where a =

        For farmer I, the net supply is:

              x = (aq1_aQ)/(PfQ+a);
which is linear in q., for fixed Q.                           Finally, the equilibrium

futures price is


               Pf =       E[p5(a
                                         +
                                             Qp5)
                                                    ó]/E         +
                                                                     Qp)].
        It   is now shown that the efficiency result d'es not carry

over to the case of farmers who differ in their respective

coefficients of relative risk aversion. Consider the simplest

case:
                                   l—5
               U.(W) =         W



The first—order condition for farmer i Is now
                                                            —5
               0 =
                      E[((p5q1                                   i(p_)]•
        There exists a distribution of quantities across farmers such

that there is no trade on the futures market, i.e., x1 0 for i =

1, 2            in.       In   this case the following must hold for all pairs

i and J:

                                         1—6                         1—6

                      =   ____________

                           E[(p5) I]                       E[(p5) ]

The numerator of f'(5) is not identically zero. Since fS) is not

constant, a fully revealing price cannot exist in general.

       It is equally clear that the futures price is not fully

revealing in general if some farmers have constant absolute risk

aversion utility while others have constant relative risk aversion

utility. u

     There is an alternative approach to the question of whether
prices are fully revealing, which assumes a finite number of
states of nature and a corresponding finite number of markets. This
approach Is of little economic interest: even limiting ourselves
to an economy in which the only random variables are the outputs
of each of N farms, and if these can take on M different values,
the number of states of nature is MN, far larger than the number
of markets. The most that can be hoped is that prices will be
sufficient statistics for conveying information about the limited
number of aggregate economic variables of interest. For
discussions of this alternative approach, see Green (1977) and
Radner (1979), and the works cited there.

2
     Grossman and Stiglitz (1976, 1980) and Stiglitz (1971)
present another category of argument against the view that
markets are informationally efficient: if they were, individuals
would have no incentive to obtain information, and thus the only
information which would be reflected in the market is costless
information. The issue is not relevant here since we assume that
each producer can costlessly obtain information concerning his own
output. When Grossman and Stiglltz constructed their model in
which prices perfectly aggregated Information, they were aware of
the specIal role that the assumption of constant absolute risk
aversion played. The present paper grew out of an attempt to show
that the utility functions they employed were almost the only
utility functions which had the property that the dispersion of
crop sizes would have no effect on price.


     In   the earlier studies, Grossman and Stiglitz also discussed
a problem with the existence of equilibrium.   In particular, they
pointed out that if each farmer had perfect information concerning
his own output, and if the market perfectly revealed all the
relevant information (i.e., provided a perfect predictor of the
future spot price), then individuals' demand for futures would not
depend on theIr own Information about their crop size; but then It
would be Impossible for the futures price to be fully revealing.
This existence problem Is simply an artifact of the assumption
that farmers are perfectly informed concerning their own crops,
which comprise the only source of uncertainty.

     Jordan (1983) addresses the same questions, using markedly
different techniques. Not surprisingly, he arrives at similar
answers. The assumptions underlying our analyses are slightly
different, and we arrive at our results using only elementary
techniques,   which make transparent precisely why the class of
utility functions for which markets are efficient is so
restricted.



                                  18
     To simplify matters we take as given that utility is concave
In the region of interest. Second order conditions will therefore
not be made explicit.
