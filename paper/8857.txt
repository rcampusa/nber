                                             ABSTRACT

        One of the most important representations of an urban spatial structure is its density. Indeed, an
urban area is defined as a densely populated place with a sizeable number of inhabitants. Yet, despite the
fact that the defining element of an urban area is its density, few scholars have systematically examined
the long-run changes in the densities of economic activities in these areas. This paper documents the
historical changes in population and employment densities in U.S. cities and metropolitan areas and
explores the causes of their rise and decline between the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries.

I. Introduction

        The spatial organization of American cities has changed dramatically over the last two

centuries. While the signs of previous eras are still visible in the streets and architecture of

historic buildings in many cities, one of America=s most distinctive characteristics has been its

willingness to constantly reconstruct and modify its spatial environment. The exchanges and

warehouses near the waterfront, the hallmarks of nineteenth century port cities, are gone. The

cast-iron, masonry office buildings were torn down and replaced with modern steel skeletal-

framed skyscrapers. The streets which move people and goods throughout the city have been

redesigned with each advance in transportation. The row houses and tenements have given way

to apartments and single-detached houses.

        This paper examines the changes in the spatial structures of urban areas in the United

States between the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. The spatial structure of an urban

area is measured using average densities of population and employment.1 While there is no single

measure that will fully capture the spatial structure of an urban area, the average density is one of

the most useful and widely used. Indeed, a city or an urban area is typically defined as a densely

populated place with a sizeable number of inhabitants. Yet, despite the fact that the defining



        1
             Density is measured as gross average density or simply as employment or population divided by
the urban area. Net density, or the activity divided by area devoted to that specific activity, is preferred but
is practically impossible to calculate. In principle, the average density and net density will be correlated if
the area of land devoted to different kinds of activities, industry, commercial, and residential, remain
relatively stable across cities and over time. Bartholomew (1955) finds that land uses for 55 cities were
allocated to the following uses: residential (39.61%), commercial (3.32%), industrial (6.44%), railroad
(4.86%), streets (28.19%), and public property (17.67%). It is also possible to derive a weighted average
measure using a finer level of aggregation such as the census tract. However, this measure is prohibitive in
that it is costly to construct for the samples of cities in this paper and it is very likely that these two
measures are highly correlated (see Glaeser (1998)).

element of an urban area is its density, few scholars have systematically examined the long-run

changes in the average densities of urban areas.

        Most scholars believe that dense urban areas arise as firms agglomerate near each other in

order to take advantage of some kind of increasing returns.2 In recent years, the focus has been on

a variety of external economies of scale such as Marshallian externalities and other economies

resulting from large markets.3 However, other sources such as scale economies in the production

of goods and services, in the provision of local public goods, and in transportation may

contribute to the formation of urban areas.4 Surprisingly, most empirical work which attempts to

identify the sources of increasing returns responsible for the rise of dense urban areas examines

population, employment, or output levels rather than their densities. These studies often examine

why cities are specialized or diversified and whether population growth in urban areas are

correlated with specialized or diversified cities.5

        The study of spatial organization within a given city is dominated by the classic urban

model called the monocentric city model.6 The monocentric city model assumes that firms are

Strange (1990) also has external economies that have a local public goods nature.

and Chatterjee (1999).

          The monocentric model was developed by Alonso (1964), Muth (1969), Mills (1972), Wheaton
(1977) and others. Also see Fujita (1989).

exogenously located in the central business district (CBD). Households choose residential

locations and consumption of housing and other goods and services. All households commute to

the CBD for work. Since it is costly to commute, the households who live further away from the

CBD are compensated by a lower price of land and greater consumption of housing. The model

predicts that a household=s consumption of housing increases or population density declines at

greater distances from the CBD.

        The majority of empirical work based on the monocentric city model uses a measure

called the density gradient to capture the spatial organization of a given urban area.7 The density

gradient measures the changes in the density of an urban area as one moves further away from

the CBD. Many urban scholars define the process of suburbanization as the decline in the density

gradient. Most studies indicate that, as predicted by the monocentric city model, density declines

monotonically from the city center. In addition, in the United States, the density gradient of cities

has consistently fallen or flattened over time. Since the monocentric city model predicts a

flattening of the density gradient when incomes rise or when transportation costs fall, the most

popular explanation for suburbanization has been rising incomes and falling commuting costs

        This paper differs from the existing empirical literature on cities in two important ways.

First, as indicated above, this paper examines the average density of cities rather than population

or employment levels or density gradients. The data on the long-run trends in the average density

of cities and metropolitan areas present a strikingly different picture of changes in the U.S. urban



        7
           The density gradient is estimated using a negative exponential function: D(x) = D0 e-γx where
D(x) is the population density at distance x from the center, D0 is the density at the center, and γ, the
density gradient, is the proportional rate at which population density falls with distance from the CBD.


                                                     3
spatial structure than the more popular density gradients.8 Second, despite the lack of a formal

model, this paper adopts an empirical approach which takes both firm and household location as

endogenous. In particular, this paper uses the simultaneous equations approach developed by

Steinnes and Fisher (1974) to explain the population and employment densities of urban areas.9

However, unlike most studies of this type, this paper will combine the elements of the models of

city formation and the monocentric city model. This paper assumes that the models of city

formation explain employment density given population density whereas the monocentric city

model explains population density given employment density.

        The data on the average density of urban areas between the late nineteenth and the early

twentieth centuries provide a different but complementary picture of the changes in the spatial

organization of U.S. urban areas than that based on density gradients. The studies of density

gradients of U.S. cities indicate that it has declined monotonically over time.10 However, data on

average population and employment densities for consistent samples of cities and metropolitan

areas show that the densities of urban areas rose modestly between the late nineteenth and the

early twentieth centuries but then fell rapidly over the second half of the twentieth century. The

           For example, in 1940, the density gradients of New York, Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles
were 0.21, 0.21, 0.31 and 0.27 respectively (see Anas, Arnott and Small (1998)). These density gradients
suggest that New York and Chicago were more suburbanized than Boston and Los Angeles. However, the
average densities of these cities provide a very different picture of urban spatial structure. In 1940 the
figures for New York, Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles were 24,933, 16,434, 16,721, and 3,356 persons
per square mile, respectively. As expected, the average density of New York is much higher than other
cities.

data also exhibit significant regional variation in the density of cities. The cities in the Middle

Atlantic region were significantly more dense than cities in other regions for most of the period.

       This paper finds that the trends in employment and population densities of urban areas are

explained by the joint location decisions of firms and households. First, the analysis of

employment density of cities and metropolitan areas suggests that there are significant urban

scale economies resulting from the spatial concentration of middlemen who coordinate trade. The

data indicate that density is correlated with specialization in transaction services such as

wholesale trade, finance, insurance and real estate. Second, the analysis of population density

indicate that the monocentric city model provides a useful framework studying density in urban

areas. The data suggest that falling transportation costs and rising incomes are both likely to have

contributed to a reduction in the population density of urban areas. Finally, the data analysis

indicate that firms= and households= location decisions influenced each other. Thus, the rapid

decline in population and employment densities of urban areas in the second half of the twentieth

century is likely to have been caused by the fact that these forces were re-enforcing each other.

       The paper is organized as follows. Section II documents the changes in the density of

cities and metropolitan areas between the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. Section III

examines the determinants of urban spatial structures. The monocentric city model and the

general equilibrium model of population and employment densities are estimated for samples of

cities and metropolitan areas. Section IV concludes with a summary.

II. The Density of Urban Areas

This section presents data on the density of cities and metropolitan areas between the late

nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. The data on the density of cities are constructed using


                                                  5
samples of cities whose populations are greater than 25,000 inhabitants for each decade between

1890 and 1990. The data are from the Social Statistics of Cities, 1890, Financial Statistics of

Cities 1901-1940, and County and City Data Book, 1949-1994. The data on the density of

metropolitan areas for 1910 to 1940 are from Thompson (1948) and are based on the

Ametropolitan district@ concept.11 The data for the decades between 1940 to 1990 are based on the

Ametropolitan area@ concept and come from a variety of sources such as the County and City

Data Book, 1949-1977, State and Metropolitan Area Data Book, 1980-1990, Census of

Population, 1990, and Census of Housing and Population, 1990.12

        The data on the average density of cities and metropolitan areas provide an important

view of the changes in the American urban landscape between the late nineteenth and the

twentieth centuries. Unlike the picture provided by the estimates of density gradients, which


        11
            The Census Bureau=s first attempt to define a metropolitan area was in 1910. In that year, the
census officials defined two types of Ametropolitan districts@ that differed in terms of threshold levels for
population and density. For cities with populations of at least 200,000, the Ametropolitan district@ was
defined as the political city boundary plus any contiguous minor civil divisions and incorporated places
having a population density of at least 150 persons per square mile. For cities with populations of 100,000
to 200,000, the Ametropolitan district@ was defined as the municipal city plus all cities, towns, villages or
other divisions located within 10 miles of the central city. However, in 1930, the threshold population level
was lowered to 50,000 and the threshold density criterion of 150 persons per square mile was applied to all
Ametropolitan districts.@
        12
            Despite the fact that the Ametropolitan district@ accorded well with the economists= conception
of an urban area, the metropolitan area was completely redefined by the Bureau of the Budget (Office of
Management and Budget) in 1949. Since the Census Bureau=s Ametropolitan district@ did not coincide with
county boundaries, the amount of useful information that could be reported for these areas was severely
limited. Thus, the new Ametropolitan area@ was defined using county boundaries rather than the population
density criteria. For cities with 50,000 or more inhabitants, except in New England, the metropolitan area
was defined as the city and its county and one or more contiguous counties that were socially and
economically integrated to the central county. In New England, cities and towns, rather than counties were
used to define metropolitan areas. Although the Ametropolitan area@ concept has been modified on
numerous occasions, the use of county boundaries has remained constant since its inception in 1949. The
standards for establishing whether or not a county should be included as a metropolitan area depends on a
variety of considerations such as density, commuting patterns, and industrial structure, among others. For a

decline monotonically over time, the data on average density of urban areas suggest that the

pattern of urban spatial organization has changed dramatically over time. Except for the full

sample of cities, whose overall average density is clouded by the entry of new cities into the

sample, the data indicate that population and employment densities in urban areas increased

during the period between the late nineteenth and the mid-twentieth centuries. However, during

the second half of the twentieth century, urban density declined significantly.

        Density of Cities

        In Table 1 and Figure 1, data on the average density of cities are presented for samples of

cities whose population is greater than 25,000 for every decade between 1890 and 1990. Over

time, as the population grew and became more urban, the number of cities in the sample

increased from 122 in 1890 to 1068 in 1990.13 The data indicate that the density of cities declined

slightly over the first half of the twentieth century but fell sharply over the second half. In 1890,

the average density of cities was 7,648 persons per mile and in 1930, despite a three-fold growth

in the number of cities in the sample, average density remained around 7,366. However, between

1930 and 1990, as the cities in the sample grew another three-fold, the figure fell almost by half

to 3,789 persons per mile.14 Since density is defined as population divided by land area, changes

in density are caused by changes in population or land area. The data on average population and

land area reported in Table 1 suggest that changes in both population and land area contributed

        14
           In 1890, the New York city region had three cities, Brooklyn, Long Island, and New York in
the sample; in 1898, these and other cities were consolidated to form the current greater New York city. If
the 1890 density was calculated using the 1898 definition of New York, the average density was 7253.

significantly to the decline of population density in the second half of the twentieth century.

        The study of city density by region shows that the long-run trend in average density was

replicated by most cities in all regions (see Figure 2 and Table 2). However, there were some

significant regional variations. First, the cities in the Middle Atlantic region were significantly

more dense than those in other regions over most of the period. In 1920, the average density of

cities in the Middle Atlantic was 12,208 persons per square mile whereas the figure ranged from

4,210 to 7,809 for cities in other regions. In 1990, the average density of the Middle Atlantic

cities was 8,212 persons per square mile and was often two to three times more dense than cities

in other regions. Second, the cities in the two southern regions, South Atlantic and West South

Central, were as dense as those in the Middle Atlantic in the late nineteenth century, but their

densities declined rapidly over the twentieth century. Finally, the cities in the two Western

regions, despite their reputation for low density, were just as dense as those in most other regions

        Since the samples of cities in Table 1 change over time, it is difficult to know whether the

overall changes in the average density of cities are caused by changes in the composition of cities

or by secular changes in each city. Therefore, a consistent sample of cities was constructed by

taking the intersection of cities in each decade between 1890 and 1990. Figure 3 and Table 3

provide data on the density of cities for a consistent set of 119 cities. In contrast to the full

sample of cities, the average density of this consistent sample increased by 21 percent between

the late nineteenth and the mid-twentieth centuries.15 In 1890, the average population density was


        15
            While scholars have written about the developments in transportation which contributed to the
outward radiation of population and employment, there has been less written about the innovations in
building technology that contributed to the growth of population and employment densities during this
period (see Warner (1962)). For example, advances in fire proofing columns and elevator technology
allowed building heights to increase from 4 to 10 stories during the late 1880s. Other advances in metal

                                                    8
7203 persons per mile and the figure rose to 8697 and 8876 in 1920 and 1950 respectively. The

difference in the trends between the full and the consistent samples are likely caused by the fact

that the new cities that came into the full sample were generally less densely populated than the

existing cities at any given point in time. However, between the middle and the latter half of the

twentieth century, the average density of cities in the consistent sample, like that of the full

sample, fell by 45 percent. In 1990, the average population density of cities in the consistent

sample was 5647 persons per mile.

        The data in Table 3 indicate that the changes in the density of cities were influenced by

changes in urban population and urban land area (annexation). Between 1890 and 1910, urban

population growth placed significant upward pressures on density, but these pressures were kept

in check by the annexation of significant new areas. During these two decades, population in

these 119 cities grew on average by 25% and 30% in each decade; however, annexations

increased the land area of these cities by 20% and 28% in each decade. During the interwar years,

the changes in the density of cities, population, and land areas of these cities were relatively

small. However, during the second half of the twentieth century, annexation, and to a lesser

extent, a decline in urban population growth both contributed to significant declines in the

densities of these cities. In the postwar years, annexation was most significant between 1950 and

1970, but did not reach the rates of growth experienced between 1890 and 1910. On the other

hand, city population declined most significantly between 1970 and 198

        The data on density for the consistent sample of cities exhibit significant variations by


framing, wind bracing, secure anchoring, power construction equipment, heating, ventilation, plumbing
and lighting all contributed to the rise in building heights of skyscrapers between the late nineteenth and
the early twentieth centuries. See Landau and Condit (1996).

incorporation: 1653-1800, 1801-1830, 1831-1840, 1841-1850, 1851-1860, and 1861-1889. In

each age cohort, the average density rose between late nineteenth and the mid-twentieth century,

and then fell over the second half of the twentieth century. However, at any given point in time,

the average population densities of older cities were consistently higher than those of younger

cities. On average, the cities that were incorporated before 1830 were more dense than those that

were incorporated between 1831 and 1860, and the latter cities, in turn, were more dense than

those incorporated between 1861 and 1889.16

        Finally, figures 5 and 6 present average population densities of cities weighted by

population size. The population weighted data for both the full and the consistent samples

exhibited inverted-U patterns over time. Figure 5 shows that the weighted average density of

cities for the full sample, unlike the unweighted average, rose between 1890 and 1930, fell

slightly between 1930 and 1950, and then, like the unweighted average, fell significantly over the

second half of the twentieth century.17 Figure 6, which presents weighted average density data for

the 119 consistent sample of cities, shows that the weighted average rose more steeply than the

unweighted between the late nineteenth and the mid-twentieth centuries, and then fell less steeply

than the unweighted consistent sample in the second half of the twentieth century. Thus, the

weighted average density data indicate that larger cities tended to be more dense than smaller


        16
           The incorporation date is statistically significant in every decade when it is regressed on
average density and remains significant even when regional dummies are included.
        17
            The 1898 definition of New York city was used to define density for 1890. If the 1890
definition is used, then the weighted average is significantly higher at 12,715 persons per square mile. The
1890 definition for New York includes Brooklyn and New York; the consolidated 1898 definition includes
Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Richmond boroughs.

        Density of Metropolitan Area

        The study of the changes in the density of Ametropolitan districts@ between 1910 and 1940

are particularly challenging since the definition of the Ametropolitan district@ was rarely

consistent across metropolitan areas and over time. Thompson=s (1948) data on metropolitan

districts use the 1940 metropolitan district area definition for all previous years.18 The

Thompson=s data on metropolitan districts indicate that their average densities fell between 1910

and 1940. Table 4 shows that in 1910, the 30 metropolitan districts averaged 1910 persons per

square mile; in 1940, the 92 metropolitan districts averaged 1140. Table 4 also shows data on

density for 30 identical metropolitan districts over time. The data indicate that density rose

slightly between 1910 and 1920 from 1910 to 2042 persons per mile but then fell to 1678 in

1940. However, a closer examination of changes in the average land area of metropolitan

districts between 1920 and 1930 suggests that the significant decline in density is likely to have

been caused by a change in the definition of the metropolitan district.19

        Data based on Ametropolitan area@ concept appear to be much more consistent over time

than those available by Ametropolitan districts@ despite the periodic changes in its definition.20



        18
            Bogue (1953) also provides data on metropolitan areas for the period between 1900 and 1950.
Bogue uses the 1950 census definition and reconstructs what the metropolitan populations would have
been if the 1950 definition was applied for earlier periods. Since some portions of the 1950 metropolitan
area were likely to have been rural in 1900, urban density calculated from Bogue=s data are likely to result
in a downward bias for the earlier period.
        19
           Between 1930 and 1940, the average land area of the 30 metropolitan area districts jumps by
202 square miles from 348 to 550. On the other hand, in the other years, the average decadal change is less
than 30 square miles.
        20
             The Ametropolitan area@ has been redefined at the time of each census since 1949. Thus, it is

                                                      11
Table 5 and Figure 7 present data on metropolitan areas using the definition given at any point in

time. The data on metropolitan areas indicate that their density rose between 1940 and 1960, but

then declined significantly between 1960 and 1990. Between 1940 and 1960, the density of

metropolitan areas rose from 387 to 589 persons per square mile. However, by 1990, density

declined substantially to 288.21

        Table 6 presents data for a consistent sample of 149 metropolitan areas. Unlike cities, the

data show that the trend for the consistent sample was almost identical to that of the full sample.

The density of metropolitan areas for the consistent sample rose between 1940 and 1960 but then

fell dramatically over the second half of the twentieth century (see Figure 8). In 1940,

metropolitan areas averaged 389 persons per square mile; in 1960, the figure rose to 547 but in

1980, it fell to 442. The examination of the changes in population and land areas suggests that

the increase in the density of metropolitan areas between 1940 and 1960 was caused entirely by

an increase in metropolitan population. Table 6 shows that the metropolitan population grew by

more than 23% in each decade between 1940 and 1960; however, the metropolitan land area

changed negligibly between 1940 and 1950 and rose by about 10% between 1950 and 1960. On

the other hand, the data indicate that the decline in the density of metropolitan areas was caused



difficult to know how much of the changes in the density over time can be attributed to changes in the
definitions. However, the redefinition of the Ametropolitan area@ has resulted in only modest changes over
time. Between 1940 and 1980, the metropolitan area data were categorized at the smallest metropolitan
unit designated as the standard metropolitan area (SMA) or standard statistical metropolitan area (SMSA).
However, in 1983, the metropolitan data were re-categorized into three different levels: metropolitan area
(MSA), primary metropolitan area (PMSA), and consolidated metropolitan area (CMSA).
        21
            The 1990 data in Table 6 use CMSA=s. Since average density declines as the definition of
metropolitan area becomes more consolidated, a portion of this decline can be attributed to the change in
the definition of metropolitan areas.

entirely by the growth in the average size of metropolitan areas. Between 1960 and 1980, land

area grew by an average of 27% in each decade. Over this period, the metropolitan population

continued to grow at 18% per decade, but its growth was not enough to offset the significant

growth in land area.

III. Determinants of Urban Spatial Structure

        This section explores some of the causes of urban spatial structures using models of city

formation and the monocentric city model in a simultaneous equation framework where firm and

household locations are both assumed to be endogenous.22 First, motivated by the monocentric

city model, the population density of an urban area is assumed to depend upon household

demand for housing, which in turn depends upon household income and local transportation

costs23 Second, motivated by the models of city formation, this paper assumes that employment

density depends upon the firm location decisions which in turn depend upon the nature and

strength of agglomeration economies as well as the intensities of land use of firms in various

industries. Third, this paper assumes that population and employment densities influence each

other. In addition, this paper examines why city age is correlated with urban density.


        22
            See Steinnes and Fisher (1974), Grubb (1982), Mills and Price (1984), Carlino and Mills
(1987), Greenwood and Stock (1990), Thurston and Yezer (1994), and Deitz (1998). Most of these studies
use population and employment density gradients rather than their average densities.
        23
            There are many versions of the monocentric city model. This paper adopts Fujita=s (1989)
version of the closed city model under absentee landownership where the urban fringe is determined by an
exogenous agricultural land rent. In general, scholars seem to be interested in understanding the density
gradients rather than average densities of cities. Thus, most of the comparative statics results are derived
for density gradients. However, the monocentric model also determines the density of urban areas. In this
model, if urban population increases, then housing lot size decreases everywhere and average population
density increases. However, given a level of urban population, a rise in income or a decline in
transportation costs increases the urban boundary and thereby lowers average population density. See
Fujita (1989), chapter 3, for results on comparative statics.


                                                     13
       The regression estimates consist of two separate sets of equations. One estimate is based

on the monocentric city model which suggests that housing demand is a function of income and

transportation costs:

(1)    Hi = α1 + α2 Yi + α3 Ti + εH

where Hi is housing, Yi is income, and Ti is the cost of local transportation. The second set of

estimates are based on the simultaneous equations of population and employment densities.

Population density is assumed to be a function of employment density, housing and climate:

(2)    Pi = β1 + β2 Ei + β3 Hi + β4 Ci + εP

where Pi and Ei are population and employment densities, respectively, and Hi is housing and Ci

is climate; and, employment density is assumed to be a function of population density and

a vector of explanatory variables that capture industry agglomeration economies:

(3)    Ei = γ1 + γ2 Pi + γ3 Xi + εE

where Xi is a vector of explanatory variables. Equation (1) is estimated using ordinary least

squares and equations (2) and (3) are estimated using 2sls or instrumental variables estimations.

       Due to a variety of data limitations, this paper estimates these equations using cross-

sectional data on cities with population levels of more than 25,000 and for all metropolitan areas

in 1950 and 1990. Panel data of any length are difficult to construct due to frequent data

reporting changes. It is also difficult to estimate equations (1) and (2) for earlier periods due to

the lack of data on housing. However, it is possible to estimate equation (3) for earlier periods.

       The monocentric city model is estimated using various proxy measures for housing lot

size, incomes and local transportation costs. Since data on housing lot sizes are unavailable, the

dependent variable chosen for this study was the percentage of single-detached or owner-


                                                  14
occupied housing. The data on incomes vary from median income, income per capita and

household incomes. The available data on transportation costs also vary; they range from the

shares of commuters using public transportation or automobiles, trucks and vans to per capita

automobile registration rates. The independent variables in the population density equation, in

addition to the housing variable, include two climate variables: rainfall and temperature (January

temperature or heating degree days).24 The independent variables in the employment density

regressions are shares of employment in the various one-digit sectors of the economy. This

implicitly assumes that agglomeration economies, if they exist, are captured within the one-digit

industries. Urban specialization in different industries will affect overall employment densities

since land intensities are likely to differ across these industries.

        Tables 7 and 8 provide descriptive statistics of these variables for cities and metropolitan

areas.25 The data indicate a marked decline in employment and population densities for the

samples of cities and metropolitan areas over this period. For cities, the average employment and

population densities of cities increased from 2667 and 6536 persons per mile to 1800 and 3777

respectively between 1950 and 1990. For metropolitan areas, population density fell from 513

persons per mile to 397 but employment density remained relatively constant. The shares of

single-detached housing in cities and metropolitan areas increased slightly over time. On the

other hand, the industrial structures of cities and metropolitan areas changed noticeably over time

as economic structures shifted away from manufacturing into various services.

           A heating degree day is a measure of energy required for heating buildings. One heating degree
is accumulated for each whole degree that the mean daily temperature is below 65 degrees.
        25
             The 1990 metropolitan area data use MSA=s rather than the CMSA=s used in Table 5.


                                                   15
        The results of the monocentric city equation (1) are reported in Table 9.26 The regression

estimates suggest that the growth in automobile use is highly correlated with growth in single-

detached housing. In 1950, cities and metropolitan areas with higher automobile registration rates

had a significantly higher share of their housing stock in single-detached housing. In 1990, cities

with higher percentages of commuters that used public transportation (inverse of automobile use)

had a significantly lower share of single-detached housing whereas, for metropolitan areas, those

with higher shares of commuters that used automobiles, trucks or vans, had a significantly higher

share of single-detached or owner occupied housing. On the other hand, the income variables

provided differing results. In 1950, median income was negatively correlated with single-

detached housing for cities and metropolitan areas, the latter with statistical significance.27 In

1990, as predicted by the monocentric city model, income per capita was positively correlated

with single-detached housing for cities and metropolitan areas, the former with statistical

significance. In 1950, the cities and metropolitan areas in the New England and Middle Atlantic

regions had significantly lower percentages of single-detached housing than those in other


        26
           Since automobile registration data are unavailable for all cities and metropolitan areas, the
monocentric city model was estimated using a slightly smaller sample for 1950.
        27
           There are numerous potential reasons why the income variables exhibit differing results. First,
Wheaton (1977) shows that incomes can either cause higher or lower densities depending upon the relative
income elasticities for land and commuting costs. If marginal costs of commuting increases with income,
then higher incomes may cause households to live near the city center. Moreover, White (1976, 1988)
demonstrates that when employment is decentralized and not concentrated in the city center, residential
location and incomes may not be monotonically correlated with distance from the city center. In particular,
high income households may locate near the city center and also far away in the suburbs. Second, LeRoy
and Sonstelie (1983) suggest that incomes and automobile ownership was highly correlated until quite
recently. Third, the relatively poor results of the income variable may also be caused by the lack of
information on this dimension using cross-sectional variation across cities. Margo (1992), using data based
on a sample of household heads for 1950, finds that almost half of suburbanization can be attributed to
rising household incomes.


                                                     16
regions. In 1990, the same was true for the New England and Middle Atlantic cities but not for

their metropolitan areas.

        The results of the instrumental variable (IV) estimations of population and employment

densities are reported in Table 10 for cities and Table 11 for metropolitan areas. For estimating

the population density equation, the instruments for employment density were the single-digit

industry shares that proxy for agglomeration economies. For estimating the employment density

equation, the instruments for population density were single-detached housing or owner-occupied

housing (or proxies for incomes and transportation costs) and climate variables.

        The IV regression estimates for population density indicate that ownership of single-

detached or owner-occupied housing significantly contributed to lowering population density for

cities but not for metropolitan areas.28 For cities in 1950 and 1990, a standard deviation increase

in the percentage of single-detached housing led to a decline in population density by about 11%.

However, the disappointing result for metropolitan areas are likely to be caused by the reduction

in data variation that comes from aggregating data up to metropolitan areas. For example, the St.

Louis metropolitan area is composed of many cities, such as St. Louis City, Clayton, University

City, and Webster Groves among others, which differ in their stocks of single-detached housing.

        The data indicate that urban areas with better climates were more dense than those with

poorer climates. Of the two climate variables, temperature tended to be more important. For both

cities and metropolitan areas, higher winter temperatures or lower heating degree days


        28
            Mieszkowski and Smith (1991) use data on housing lot sizes to examine the patterns of
decentralization in Houston. They find that density per residential land use is quite uniform and that the
differences in densities between the city and the suburbs were caused by the greater amount of vacant land
available in the suburbs. Thus, variations in single-detached housing may do a poorer job in explaining
metropolitan population density as compared to explaining city population density.

                                                    17
contributed to greater population densities in 1950 and 1990, respectively. In 1950, less

precipitation significantly increased city densities. One potential interpretation of this finding is

that climate and urban densities jointly increase the value of urban amenities. Accordingly to

Glaeser, Kolko and Saiz (2000), two of the four critical urban amenities are the existence of a

variety of services and consumer goods and climate. The regression results suggest that the value

of dense urban amenities increase with warmer climate since residents can enjoy the rich dense

urban amenities such as restaurants and theaters for more months of the year.

        The IV regression estimates for employment density provide important clues as to the

causes of industry agglomeration.29 The regression estimates suggest that specialization in

agriculture contributed to a decline in employment density but that specialization in

manufacturing activities sometimes contributed to an increase in employment density. For

agriculture, a standard deviation in its share for cities in 1950 and for metropolitan areas in 1990

contributed to declines in employment densities of one and four percent, respectively. For

manufacturing, a standard deviation in its share led to a five percent increase in employment

density for cities in 1950, and a three percent increase in employment density of metropolitan

areas in 1990.


        29
             In the late nineteenth century, Adna Weber was fully aware that patterns of industrial
concentration significantly influenced trends in U.S. urbanization. He wrote: AThe extractive industries
generally require the dispersion of the persons engaged therein. In particular, agriculture, the principal
extractive industry, cannot be prosecuted by persons residing in large groups... The distributive industries,
on the other hand, are distinctly centralizing in their effects upon the distribution of the population engaged
in them. As methods of distribution have been improved and the distributive area enlarged, the tendency
toward concentration has increased... Manufacturing industries also tend toward the concentration of
population, and up to recent years manufacturing centers were coincident with commercial centers i.e., the
great cities. Recently the equalization of transportation facilities and the excessive rents of great cities have
caused the managers of a good many industries to abandon them as sites in favor of the suburb or small
town.@ (see Weber (1899, 223-224)).


                                                       18
        The data analysis strongly demonstrates that specialization in transaction services, such as

wholesale trade and FIRE (finance, insurance and real estate) contributed significantly to

employment density whereas specialization in other services, such as retail trade, health services,

professional services, and public administration, tended to significantly lower employment

density.30 The regression estimates show that a standard deviation increase in a city=s or a

metropolitan area=s share of wholesale trade increased employment density by two to three

percent and a standard deviation increase in the share of FIRE increased employment density of

between four to six percent. On the other hand, a standard deviation increase in the share of other

services such as retail trade lowered employment density from two to five percentage points.

        The instrumental variable regression estimates of the simultaneous equations indicate that

it is important to treat both residential and firm location decisions as endogenous. The IV

regression estimates indicate that population density greatly influenced employment density and

vice versa. In addition, the estimates on cities suggest that population density had a stronger

impact on employment density than the reverse. For cities, the elasticities of population on

employment density were 1.07 and 0.96 for 1950 and 1990 respectively; on the other hand, the

elasticity of employment on population density was 0.71 and 0.60 for 1950 and 1990



        30
              Since data on housing are unavailable for earlier periods, it is not possible to estimate the
monocentric city model nor the simultaneous equation model. However, Kim (2000) provides estimates for
the potential importance of agglomeration economies using a slightly different specification. In 1900,
specialization in trade and transportation significantly contributed to an increase in the density of cities; in
1920, specialization in transportation and in clerical services contributed to an increase in density; in 1940,
specialization in business services and government employment contributed to an increase in density. In all
three years, specialization in agriculture led to a decline in urban density. In general, the regression results
indicate that specialization in manufacturing did not contribute to an increase in density of cities. However,
this result is likely to have been caused by problems of multicollinearity since city specialization in
manufacturing and transportation sectors was highly correlated.


                                                      19
respectively. The estimates on metropolitan areas were much more symmetrical. The impact of

population on employment density was only slightly greater than the impact of employment on

population densities. In general, these elasticities ranged from 0.9 to 1.0.

       The data on urban density presented in section II suggest that population density is

positively correlated with the age of the city. For the 119 cities in the consistent sample for which

initial incorporation dates are readily available, a simple regression of density on incorporation

dates show that city age is significantly correlated with urban density in every decade between

1890 and 1990. What accounts for this correlation? In order to answer this question more fully,

data on incorporation date were collected for 304 cities in 1950. The analysis of the data suggests

that there are two potential explanations. One explanation is based on path dependence

emphasized by Krugman and David. If urban agglomeration economies are important, then initial

advantages are locked into those cities that achieve density at an earlier time period. The

regression results also indicate the agglomeration economies that contribute to lock-in effects are

likely to be in transaction services rather than in manufacturing. The other complementary

explanation is based on the observation that housing is very durable. Glaeser and Gyourko (2001)

show that the durability of housing plays a significant role in understanding the nature of urban

decline. This paper suggests that durability of housing may also influence urban density over

time. Older cities may be more dense since they are more likely to have a larger housing stock

composed of very durable apartments rather than single detached houses.

IV. Conclusion

       During the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, the U.S. urban population grew

significantly as the population shifted from rural to urban areas. The urban population in the U.S.


                                                 20
increased as the population in existing urban areas increased or as rural areas were transformed

into urban areas when new cities formed or when old cities annexed surrounding rural areas. This

paper examines the spatial organization of economic activities in U.S. urban areas between the

late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. This paper finds that between the late nineteenth and

the mid-twentieth centuries, economic activities became more densely organized in urban areas

despite the fact that large tracts of rural areas were annexed into existing urban areas. However,

during the second half of the twentieth century, urban density declined substantially as the

growth of urban population slowed and as urban boundaries continued to radiate into

surrounding rural areas.

       The analysis of cross-sectional data on the density of cities and metropolitan areas suggest

that the variation in employment and population densities can be explained by models of city

formation and the monocentric city model. The examination of employment density shows that

urban specialization in economic activities related to facilitating market transactions, such as in

wholesale trade, finance, insurance and real estate, was highly correlated with employment

density. On the other hand, urban specialization in consumer service sectors, such as in retail

trade, health, professional and other services, was negatively correlated with employment

density. Urban specialization in manufacturing appears to have contributed to urban density in

differing ways over time. The analysis of population density suggests that lower transportation

costs, as proxied by the growing use of automobiles, and higher incomes appear to have

contributed to the decline in population density as households increased their demand for larger

housing. Finally, the regression estimates show that firm location and household residential

decisions greatly influenced each other.


                                                 21
           While it is difficult to explain the long-run trends in urban density based on cross-

sectional data analysis, the two sets of regressions over two different time periods may provide

some important clues. During the late nineteenth and the mid-twentieth centuries, the data

suggest that urban density increased as the forces of agglomeration economies in employment,

particularly in transaction services, outweighed the forces of population dispersion. During this

period, the advances in skyscraper technology, greatly increased employment density. However,

households mitigated this trend in two ways. Households demanded larger housing further away

from the central business district in existing urban areas thereby increasing the boundaries of

these areas. In addition, households migrated to less developed urban areas to consume larger

housing since the opportunity costs of commuting by automobiles were lower in these newer

areas.31

           During the second half of the twentieth century, urban density declined dramatically.

While agglomeration economies in transaction services continued to contribute to employment

density, other forces contributed to its dispersion. The data indicate that there were significant

spatial agglomeration dis-economies in the provision of consumer services and that the growth of

this sector over time may have contributed to a significant decline in overall employment density.

In addition, as household incomes rose and as transportation costs fell, population density fell as

households continued to demand larger housing in the form of single-detached houses. Although

household residential decisions had an increasingly larger impact on the location of employment

than the reverse, the sharp decline in densities of urban areas in this period was made possible by


           31
           Thus, the density of the consistent sample of cities which represent established cities rose
whereas the density of the full sample of cities remained relatively flat.

the strong interaction of household and firm location decisions that greatly re-enforced each

others= trends.

        Scholars have traced the origins of suburbanization to the early nineteenth century, but

the process of suburbanization has been far from uniform. The data on urban land area as well as

various studies on urban density gradients indicate that population and employment have been

steadily radiating away from city centers over time. However, data on average density show that

even as the boundaries of cities and metropolitan areas expanded, these urban areas became

increasingly dense between the late nineteenth and the mid-twentieth centuries. Indeed, for many

urban planners, this era is often identified with the golden years of American cities. However,

since the second half of the twentieth century, the process of suburbanization has taken on an

entirely different character. During this period, the ever expanding urban boundaries have been

accompanied by significant declines in the average densities of cities and metropolitan areas.

Yet, whether this suburban sprawl represents a better form of living and working as argued by

many economists or whether it represents a loss of American civic life as claimed by many urban

planners remains an important topic to be explored.32




        32
            For many urban planners, the years between the late nineteenth and the early twentieth
centuries, which coincided with the City Beautiful Movement, were the glory years of the city and the
downtown. On the other hand, the late twentieth century suburban sprawl is identified with the loss of
urban civic amenities. See Duany, Plater-Zyberk, and Speck (2000).
