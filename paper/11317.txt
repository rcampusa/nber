This paper links the theory of interest groups influence over the legislature with that of congressional

control over the judiciary. The resulting framework reconciles the theoretical literature of lobbying

with the negative available evidence on the impact of lobbying over legislative outcomes, and sheds

light to the determinants of lobbying in separation-of-powers systems. We provide conditions for

judicial decisions to be sensitive to legislative lobbying, and find that lobbying falls the more divided

the legislature is on the relevant issues. We apply this framework to analyze supreme court labor

decisions in Argentina, and find results consistent with the predictions of the theory.

            Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




The theoretical literature on interest group politics has put the emphasis on the link

between lobbying and legislative outcomes. The empirical evidence, however, provides

scant support for this connection (see Ansolabehere, de Figueiredo and Snyder 2002).1

The thrust of this paper is that the impact of lobbying has to be analyzed not in the votes

of the legislature, but rather in the actions of the courts (and the agencies), where much

policy making in modern societies is done. We focus on two intimately related questions.

How do the interactions between a legislature and a formally independent judiciary shape

the incentives for interest groups to engage in costly lobbying activities? Under what

conditions will lobbying effectively influence policy outcomes in this setting?

        The literature on interest group politics considers two broad avenues through

which lobbying influences policy outcomes. The first class of models encompasses

different forms of vote buying in legislatures, emphasizing the role of campaign

contributions (Denzau and Munger 1986; Snyder 1990, 1991; Baron 1994). The second

considers the so-called informational lobbying: interest groups supply government

officials with information, inducing policy outcomes closer to their preferred policies

(Ainsworth 1993; Austen-Smith 1993; Lohmann 1995; Rasmusen 1993). The legislature

is here also taken as the relevant policy-making arena, based (implicitly or explicitly) on

the fact that the information generated by lobbyists can, in general, be related to the

electoral salience of a lobbyist’s cause (Ainsworth 1993; de Figuereido 2002).

        The fact that lobbying may influence directly only legislators’ payoffs does not

imply, however, that it is sensible to focus on legislatures as the only relevant policy-

making body. To the contrary, as long as courts have influence on policy outcomes, the

asymmetric impact of lobbying on the payoffs of the court and the legislature will shape




                                                                                              2

its effectiveness to affect policy in equilibrium, and thus the incentives for interest groups

to engage in costly lobbying activities in the first place.

        The overall effect of this asymmetry rests crucially on the relation between the

judiciary and the legislature. While most judiciaries are isolated from direct public

approval, they are not immune from elected politicians’ influence. Indeed, in most

democracies, judicial decisions are not the last word. Legislatures can normally reverse

judicial statutory rulings with a simple majority, although overturning constitutional

rulings normally requires a higher level of political consensus. The legislature can,

furthermore, affect the court’s incentives by imposing sanctions such as court

enlargements (Gely and Spiller 1992), impeachments (Iaryczower, Spiller and Tommasi

2002), and in some countries simply by not reappointing them.2

        The court, then, can be effectively constrained in its decisions by the majorities

in government. This is the essence of the so-called, “separation of powers” literature:

public opinion alters judicial decisions, but does so only indirectly, by affecting the

composition and preferred policies of members of the legislature (see Segal 1997, and

Bergara, Richman and Spiller 2003 for a discussion).

        In this paper we consider the separation-of-powers logic within a model of

informative lobbying. In this environment, the political constraints faced by the court do

not reflect public opinion directly, but are driven instead by the actions undertaken by an

interest group. By focusing on the incentives of interest groups to lobbying only when

such actions effectively influence policy outcomes, our approach provides conditions

under which previous accounts of interest group influence on politicians can still survive,




                                                                                                 3
             Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




while reconciling the implications of these theoretical arguments with the weak empirical

support for the connection between lobbying and legislative outcomes.

         In the next sections, we develop these arguments formally, and derive empirical

implications of our analysis. We then apply this framework to empirically study the

politics of labor law constitutional interpretation in Argentina from 1935 to 1998.

                           Lobbying Under Separation of Powers

The Model

There are two individual players, the court and the interest group, and a legislature

populated by a continuum of legislators with total size one. To fix ideas, in what follows

we will refer to the interest group simply as the union. Policy space is X = [0,1], and

given ideal policy zi, player i has preferences over policies x∈X represented by a utility

function ui ( x, zi ) = − 1 ( x − zi )2 . 3 Without loss of generality, we assume that the union’s
                      2

ideal policy is at the right extreme of the policy space, zu= 1, and refer to policy x’ as

being pro-labor with respect to x’’ whenever x’ > x’’.

         Legislators and the court differ in their responsiveness to voters. In particular,

we assume that the court is completely unresponsive to the position of voters in the

policy space, and denote its preferred policy by zc∈ X. We assume, though, that

legislators are, at least partially, responsive to voters’ stance on the issue. Assuming for

simplicity that the distribution of voters in the policy space can be characterized by a

single parameter θ ∈ X, we let the ideal policy of legislator j be given by zLj(θ;βj)≡βj+hθ,

where for all j, βj >0 and βj +h < 1. The parameter h allows us to capture varying degrees

of voters’ influence on legislators’ preferred policies. The degree of conflict in the

legislature is captured by the distribution of points βj across members of the legislature,




                                                                                                     4
             Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




which we describe by the cumulative distribution G(.); i.e., for any point β, G(β) denotes

the proportion of legislators for which βj <β.

        Policy outcomes result from the interaction of the court and the legislature. While

the precise form of this interaction depends on specific institutional details, in most

polities the elective body can ultimately impose its will under some sufficiently

demanding procedure. This final stage is the one we represent in the model: the court

chooses a ruling xc∈X, which the legislature can reverse with the votes of a majority m ∈

[1/2,1] of legislators. We say that a court’s ruling is “stable” in the legislature – and

therefore final – if there exists no alternative policy that a majority m of legislators would

prefer to it in a binary choice, and denote the set of stable rulings given the majority rule

m by Sm.

        Legislators and the court are uninformed about the realization of θ, and have

common prior beliefs represented by the cumulative distribution function F(⋅) with

density f(⋅). We assume that f(⋅) has full support (i.e., f(θ)>0 for all θ∈X), but otherwise

allow prior beliefs to be completely arbitrary. Informally, this means that legislators can

potentially be very well (but not perfectly) informed about the realization of θ. In

contrast, the union is perfectly informed about the realization of θ, and can potentially

credibly transmit this information through lobbying, which takes here the form of strikes

and public demonstrations. In particular, given a realization θ’, the union can organize an

observable level a of demonstrations bearing a cost C(a,θ’). We will assume that C(⋅) is

twice differentiable, that for every realization of the median voter θ, C(0,θ)=0,

Ca(a,θ)>0, and that Caθ(a,θ)<0; i.e., the marginal cost of lobbying is decreasing in the




                                                                                                 5
              Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




pro-labor stance of the population. For simplicity of exposition, we will further assume

that C(a,θ)=a(k -θ), k>1.

          The timing of the game can thus be described as follows: (i) θ is realized and

privately observed by the union; (ii) the union decides a publicly observable level of

lobbying intensity a; and (iii) the court chooses a ruling xc in the set of stable policies in

the legislature Sm.4

          An equilibrium is a triplet Γ={γ(⋅),xc(⋅),F(⋅|a)} consisting of (i) a strategy for the

union, γ : X→R+, mapping “types” θ to levels a of lobbying intensity a, (ii) a strategy for

the court, xc : R+→ Sm, mapping observations of lobbying levels a to stable rulings xc∈Sm,

and (iii) beliefs F( |a) by the court and the legislators such that:

          (a) γ (θ ) ∈ arg max uu ( xc ( a )) − C ( a, θ ) ∀θ∈X;
                        a∈R+



          (b) xc (a ) ∈ arg max{uc ( x) : x ∈ S (m | a )} ∀a∈R+, and
                          x∈ X



          (c) whenever a∈ γ(X), F(⋅|a) is determined from F(⋅) and γ(⋅) using Bayes’ rule.



In addition, we supplement this equilibrium concept with a refinement restricting beliefs

off the equilibrium path known as criterion D1 (Banks and Sobel 1987; Cho and Kreps

1987).5

The Symmetric Information Benchmark

We first characterize, as a benchmark, the symmetric information equilibrium. Note that

in this case legislators are perfectly informed about the value of θ, and the union derives

no benefit from lobbying, irrespective of the preferences of the electorate. Hence, there

will be no lobbying in equilibrium. The relationship between preferences of the electorate




                                                                                                   6
             Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




and policy outcomes in the symmetric information environment, however, is the key

element determining the amount and effectiveness of lobbying in the private information

environment.

         We start by characterizing the set of stable policies in the legislature given

majority rule m. Letting β Lm ≡ G-1(1-m) and β Hm ≡ G-1(m), it is easy to see that

Sm(θ)=[zL(θ; β Lm ), zL(θ; β Hm )]. That is, β Lm is the critical legislator for a pro-labor

coalition, in the sense that any policy x to the left of her preferred policy would be

replaced by a more pro-labor policy. Similarly, β Hm is the critical legislator for an anti-

labor coalition, in that any policy to the right of her will be replaced by a more anti-labor

policy. Note that βL(m) ≤ βH(m), and βL(m) = βH(m) only with simple majority rule

(m=1/2), in which case Sm(θ) collapses to the preferred policy of the median voter in the

legislature, and the court has no policy making power. It follows that for m > 1/2, the set

of possible court’s ideal policies that would be stable given θ has positive measure. 6

         The court will then select its ideal policy unless it is constrained either for being

“extremely” pro-labor or anti-labor in relation to the relevant players in congress. In

particular, since the preferred policy of every legislator is strictly increasing in θ, a higher

value of θ results in a pro-labor shift of the entire set of stable policies. A court with a

fixed policy preference zc may then become a “pro-labor” court for a legislature

observing a low realization θ’ (zc > zL(θ’;βH ) ), or an ”anti-labor” court for a legislature

observing a high realization θ’’(zc < zL(θ’’;βL )). Figure 1 depicts in bold the resulting

court’s equilibrium rulings as a function of the state of nature, θ.

                                      <Figure 1 about here>




                                                                                                   7
             Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




The two parallel lines in the figure represent the preferences of the critical legislators as a

function of the state of nature, zL(θ ; βL )=βL+hθ and zL(θ ; βH )= βH+hθ . For each θ, the

set of stable policies S(θ) is the segment between these lines, the interval [βL+hθ, βH+hθ]

in the vertical axis. If, for some θ , the court’s ideal point zc is in S(θ), the court will be

able to rule according to its preferred policy, facing no effective legislative constraints.

In the example depicted in the figure, this occurs for all states between the (interior)

points θ0 and θ1. In this region, then, the flat portion of the bold line represents the court’s

equilibrium ruling. For θ < θ0, however, S(θ) is entirely below zc. Thus, if it were

common knowledge among legislators that public sentiment is strongly anti-labor, the

ideal point of the court would not survive the challenge of a more anti-labor legislation.

The best choice for the court in such states is, therefore, to enact the most pro-labor stable

ruling; i.e., βH+hθ. For θ<θ0, then, the bold line representing the court’s equilibrium

rulings coincides with βH+hθ. Similarly, for θ>θ1, S(θ) is entirely above zc. In this

subset of states the legislature is too pro-labor compared to the court, and thus the best

choice for the court in such states is to enact the most “anti-labor” stable ruling; i.e.,

βL+hθ. Proposition 1 below summarizes the preceding discussion.

Proposition 1. Assume that the realization of θ is public information. Then (i) γ(θ)=0 for

all θ, and (ii) there exist θ0,θ1 ∈ [0,1], θ0 ≤ θ1, such that:

                                   z L (θ ; β H ) = β H + hθ     if     θ ≤ θ0
                                  
                                  
                      xcPI (θ ) =                  zc            if   θ 0 ≤ θ ≤ θ1
                                   
                                   
                                    z L (θ ; β L ) = β L + hθ   if     θ ≥ θ1




                                                                                                   8
             Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




Specifically, θ0=0 for zc<βH, θ0=1 for zc >βH+h, and θ0= (zc-βH)/h otherwise. θ1 is

similarly defined, with βL in place of βH.



The court is thus effectively constrained by the legislature for some realizations of public

opinion when the set K = {θ : θ ≤ θ 0 ∨ θ ≥ θ1} is non-empty. In other words, the court

will be able to rule its preferred policy independently of public opinion only if this policy

is both (i) pro-labor relative to the preferences of the critical legislator for a pro-labor

coalition before a pro-labor electorate (zc > zL(1;βL )= βL+h) and (ii) anti-labor relative to

the preferences of the critical legislator for an anti-labor coalition before an anti-labor

electorate (zc < zL(0 ;βH )= βH ). Note that, as in Gely and Spiller (1990), this condition is

more likely to be satisfied when there is significant dissent in congress (the critical

legislators for a pro and anti-labor coalitions are far apart, βL<<βH) and legislators are not

too responsive to public opinion (h is small).

        Moreover, it follows from proposition 1 that, in general, the size of K increases

with βL and decreases with βH. Thus, the set of realizations of public opinion for which

the court is effectively constrained is always smaller the higher dissent in congress is.

Proposition 1 does not imply, however, that the size of K should be generically lower the

less responsive legislators are to public opinion. To see this, note that the set of values of

θ for which a sincere ruling by the court would not face an anti-labor reversal increases

with h (the court benefits, in this regard, from a more eager response of legislators to

public opinion). Hence, the overall effect of legislators’ responsiveness to public opinion

on judicial independence depends on the relative position of the court in the policy space.

Informative Judicial Lobbying




                                                                                                 9
             Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




The previous analysis showed that when the court is constrained for some (publicly

known) preferences of the electorate, an increase in θ induces a more pro-labor ruling,

and thus, a more pro-labor policy outcome in equilibrium. The first goal of this section is

to show that, when policy-makers are uncertain about the realization of θ, lobbying by the

interest group restores the complete information mapping between the preferences of the

electorate and policy outcomes. Suppose, for example, that the court would be

constrained for some known preferences of the electorate. Then this result says that in the

presence of lobbying, the court would be forced to adjust its behavior to reflect this

constraint, even when it would be independent to rule according to its preferred policy

given the prior beliefs of uninformed legislators. Similarly, suppose instead that the court

would be independent to rule according to its preferred policy for some known

preferences of the electorate. Then the court would indeed be able to rule freely in the

presence of lobbying, even if it would be constrained given the prior beliefs of

uninformed legislators. The result is stated formally in the next proposition (lemma 1 in

the appendix provides a detailed characterization of equilibrium strategies):

Proposition 2. In the unique D1 equilibrium:

    (i)      Lobbying γ(θ) increases with θ in K, and does not change with θ in [θ0,θ1];

    (ii)     Court’s (stable) rulings xc(a) satisfy xc(γ(θ))=xcPI(θ) for every θ, where

             xcPI(θ) is given in proposition 1. In particular, the pro-labor tendency of

             rulings increases with the level of strikes; i.e., xc(a) is increasing in a.



That is, in equilibrium the level of strikes will reflect the preferences of the electorate up

to the extent that this information can influence a binding constraint for the court (and




                                                                                                 10
             Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




thus policy outcomes). We say, then, that strikes are effectively fully informative. As

long as (informed) policy is responsive to the electorate’s preferences, two union types

facing different pro-labor dispositions of the electorate will always choose different

levels of lobbying, allowing the reproduction of the complete information link between

policies and the preferences of the electorate.

        This does not imply, however, that the equilibrium will necessarily involve

transmission of information. In fact, lobbying will be completely unresponsive to the

preferences of the electorate if (and only if) the court is unconstrained for every possible

realization of θ. Conversely, there will be a complete separating equilibrium if (and only

if) the court is constrained for every realization of public preferences. That is, only if the

court’s ideal policy is “extremely anti-labor” (i.e., zc < βL), or “extremely pro-labor” (i.e.,

zc > βH+h) by proposition 1 standards.

        Proposition 2 allows us to study the response of the expected level of strikes and

pro-labor rulings to changes in the composition of the legislature. Note that for our

purposes changes in the composition of the legislature are relevant only to the extent that

they affect the boundaries of the stable set of policies in the legislature, zL(θ;βL )=βL+hθ

and zL(θ;βH)=βH+hθ. Moreover, recall from the analysis of the symmetric information

benchmark that the set of realizations of public opinion for which the court is effectively

constrained is always smaller the higher dissent in congress is. That is, in general, the size

of K increases with βL and decreases with βH. Proposition 2 then directly implies the

following result, and its corollary:

Proposition 3. A pro-labor shift in the preferred policy of the critical legislator for a pro-

labor coalition βL (anti-labor coalition, βH), increases the expected pro-labor tendency of




                                                                                                  11
             Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




the court’ rulings level Eθ [xc], and increases (reduces) the expected level of lobbying, Eθ

[γ].

Corollary 1. A mean preserving increase in the size of the set of stable policies in the

legislature reduces the expected level of strikes in equilibrium.



Proposition 3 also has direct implications over the response of equilibrium outcomes to

changes in court’s preferences. First, it is clear from the previous analysis that the

expected level of pro-labor rulings will increase following a pro-labor change in the

court’s preferences unless the court is constrained for every realization of θ both

preceding and following this change. The change in the expected level of strikes is,

however, ambiguous.7 Similarly, we know from the analysis of the symmetric

information benchmark that the effect of legislators’ responsiveness to public opinion on

judicial decisions depends on the relative position of the court in the policy space. This

implies that the relation between lobbying and the responsiveness of legislators to public

opinion will also necessarily depend on the relative position of the court in the policy

space.

Empirical Implications

The model has direct and empirically refutable implications. The first two implications

are unique to this model. First, proposition 2 states that, in equilibrium, the “pro-labor”

level of judicial decisions is increasing in the extent of the union’s political activity.

Thus, we should observe more “pro-labor” decisions when facing a higher level of union

strikes. Second, the expected level of lobbying decreases the more effective the

separation of powers between the court and the legislature is (i.e., the less responsive




                                                                                               12
            Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




legislators’ preferences are to the electorate’s concerns, and the more divided congress is

on the relevant issues). Specifically, as the corollary to proposition 3 points out, we

expect the level of strikes to be decreasing in the amplitude of the set of stable policies in

congress.

        Our model also has more standard separation of powers empirical implications.

As in most separation of powers models, Proposition 3 implies that the equilibrium level

of “pro-labor” judicial decisions depends on the political composition of congress. In

equilibrium, a more “pro-labor” congress will trigger more “pro-labor” decisions

provided that the court is effectively constrained by congress. Thus, our model provides

unique, as well, as standard empirical implications concerning separation of power

models. The unique implications constitute direct tests of the signaling value of interest

groups lobbying.

        The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation in Argentina

In this section we apply the model to study the politics of labor law constitutional

interpretation in Argentina, and provide an evaluation of its empirical implications using

data on strikes and supreme court’s decisions between 1935 and 1998.

        This case presents a natural application of the proposed framework. While

formally independent, Argentina’s supreme court has faced both implicit and explicit

threats from the political powers, and has adjusted its behavior accordingly (see Helmke

2002, and Iaryczower, Spiller and Tommasi 2002). Moreover, the centralized control by

unions of an institutional structure allowing the effective organization of large

demonstrations have both broadened their scope of interest from industry level to national




                                                                                                 13

labor policies, and transformed organized demonstrations into instruments of political

influence.

        In this environment, the relevant assumptions we impose to the analysis translate

into the following mild requirements. First, legislators are at least somewhat responsive

to (but not perfectly informed about) the preferences of the electorate.8 Second, the union

knows the cost of organizing public demonstrations, and this cost decreases the more

intensely voters oppose anti-labor legislation. As we have shown in the previous section,

under this assumption the observed level of protests will transmit valuable information

about the preferences of the electorate to politicians in equilibrium, even if the union’s

slogans constitute a biased representation of society’s interests.

The Political Environment

According to our framework, the relative position of the court with respect to the set of

stable policies in the legislature is a major factor determining both court rulings and the

level of lobbying. Our first task in defining the relevant independent variables, then, is to

obtain an assessment of the distribution of preferences within congress along a pro-

labor/anti-labor policy space.

        Throughout most of the twentieth century, Argentina had a strong presidential

system with two dominant political parties (McGuire 1995; Jones 2002) characterized by

a relatively sharp contrast in their stance with respect to labor policies and the regulation

of organized labor (Rotondaro 1971; Torre 1983; Fernandez 1988; McGuire 1997). While

all presidents have sought, to some extent, support from (at least some of) the unions, the

strong association between unions and the Peronist party, and the Peronist/anti-Peronist

division of Argentine society defined Argentina’s political reality in the second part of




                                                                                                14
             Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




the 20th century. Relying on these facts, we classify each president (and its party in the

legislature) as pro or anti-labor, and use this classification, along with the partisan

composition of the legislature, to obtain an assessment of the pro-labor composition of

the Argentine legislature.

         We start by classifying Argentina’s presidents between 1935 and 1997 as pro-

labor or anti-labor, following to the greater extent possible the “stylized facts” presented

by previous studies. Presidents Farrel, Peron, and all Presidents who governed

representing the Peronist Party (Campora, Lastiri, and Martinez in 1973- 1976, Menem

between 1989 and 1999) were classified as pro-labor. President Frondizi (1958-1962) did

not represent the Peronist party but was also classified as pro-labor.9 The remaining

presidents (mainly military dictators and democratic presidents representing the UCR

Party) were classified as anti-labor.

         Taking this classification as given, we use parties’ representation in the

legislature to compute the distribution of preferences for the upper and lower chambers in

each period t, GtU (⋅) and GtL (⋅) . We assume, first, that legislative parties are perfectly

cohesive, and that parties in the opposition have the opposite stance in the labor policy

space than the president’s party. The distribution of imputed preferences for legislators of

chamber j in period t is in this case given by Gt j ( x) = ωt j for 0 ≤ x < 1 and Gt j (1) = 1 ,

where ωt j denotes the proportion of seats held by the anti-labor’s party in chamber j in

period t (we assume here that ωt j = 1 during periods of military interruptions to the

democratic regime). We also let parties be imperfectly aligned with the president, and

refer to this as a noisy representation of legislative parties. Specifically, for both the anti-

labor and the pro-labor party, we assume that the proportions of party members with ideal




                                                                                                   15
               Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




policy closer to the extreme anti-labor (0) and pro-labor (1) policies are given by a beta

distribution B (α , β ) with support in [0,1], for β=1 and α=0.1 and α=0.2. 10 With this

assumption, then, the distribution of preferences of legislators in chamber j in a

democratic period t is given by Gt j ( x; α ) = ωt j Βα ( x) + (1 − ωt j )(1 − Βα (1 − x)) .11

Dependent Variables

The dependent variables in our study are supreme court’s pro-labor rulings and the

amount of union strikes. We define the variable strikes as the number of strikes per

year.12 Court rulings are those on labor and social security cases involving the

constitutionality of government norms decided by the Argentine supreme court between

1935 and 1998. 13 Within this universe of cases, we define the categorical variable pro-

labor ruling to take the value of one (zero) if a court ruling (i) upholds a government

norm during a pro-labor (anti-labor) presidency or (ii) challenges a government norm

during an anti-labor (pro-labor) presidency.

Independent Variables

The pro-labor composition of the legislature is relevant for our purposes for two reasons.

First, the appointment of a president’s nominee to the supreme court requires the

approval of the senate (by simple majority until 1994). Thus, the pro-labor composition

of the senate affects directly the preferences of the court. To reflect the influence of the

senate in a simple manner, we use the midpoint between the ideal point of the president

and the median voter of the senate at the time of appointment as an estimate of the pro-

labor disposition of each justice. The pro-labor disposition of the court in each period,

pro-labor court, is then defined as the policy preference of the court’s median justice.14




                                                                                                 16
              Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




        Second, the pro-labor compositions of the upper and lower chambers determine

the set of stable policies in the legislature in any given period. A ruling is stable if it does

not trigger a response by a pro or an anti-labor coalition in the legislature. Since until

1994 Argentina’s Constitution allowed the legislature to enlarge the supreme court with a

simple law, we will focus primarily on the critical legislators for simple majority rule in a

bicameral legislature. These are denoted pro-labor critical and anti-labor critical and

defined – for both the cohesive and noisy representations of legislative parties - as the

minimum and maximum among the median legislators of the upper and lower

chambers.15

        The equilibrium level of pro-labor rulings and strikes depend, however, on the

relative position of the court with respect to the set of stable policies in the legislature.

Consider first the court. Justices will rule based solely on their preferences provided that

their preferred policies are stable policies in the legislature, and will otherwise adjust

their rulings so that these fall within the set of acceptable policies in the legislature. As a

result, court’s preferences will influence Justices’ behavior directly only to the extent that

the court is unconstrained. If instead an anti-labor court is constrained by the legislature,

changes in the critical legislator for a pro-labor coalition - and not in court’s preferences -

will influence court’s decisions (we call this a pro-labor constraint). Similarly, if a pro-

labor court is constrained by the legislature, changes in the critical legislator for an anti-

labor coalition will influence court’s decisions (we call this an anti-labor constraint). We

then define the following variables. Pro-labor constraint equals pro-labor critical if an

anti-labor court is constrained (i.e., if pro-labor court < pro-labor critical) and zero

otherwise. Similarly, anti-labor constraint equals anti-labor critical if a pro- labor court is




                                                                                                   17
             Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




constrained (if pro-labor court > anti-labor critical) and zero otherwise. Finally, court

unconstrained is defined as pro-labor court if the court is unconstrained, and zero

otherwise.

        The union, on the other hand, will only engage in lobbying if policy outcomes are

responsive to lobbying efforts. This implies that the expected level of lobbying (strike

activity) increases the more constrained the court is, and decreases (corollary 1) with the

length of the set of stable policies in the legislature. We then define the variable binding

as the distance between pro-labor court and the set of stable policies, and length as the

distance between pro-labor critical and anti-labor critical.

        We also define two control variables related to the political environment. First,

we introduce the variable dictator, taking the value one in periods of interruptions to the

democratic regime, to allow for possible direct effects of military governments on both

rulings and strikes.16 Second, since the first administration of President Peron marked a

defining moment in the relation of the polity to the judiciary (Iaryczower, Spiller and

Tommasi 2002), in the organization of the labor movement, and in the consequent use of

strikes (see Figure 2), we introduce the variable post-Peron, taking the value one for

observations after President’s Peron initial departure from office in September 1955.

                                        < Figure 2 about here >

Estimation

As indicated by proposition 2, court’s pro-labor rulings are increasing in the observed

level of strikes. The equilibrium level of strikes is in itself a response to the political

environment and the relative positioning of the court in the (labor) policy space. It is not,

however, a function of actual rulings by the court, which only happen after the level of




                                                                                                18
            Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




strikes is observed. Specifically, for our main specification, the variables in the right hand

side of the equation for pro-labor judicial decisions are given by court unconstrained, pro-

labor constraint, anti-labor constraint, post-Peron, and dictator. The variables in the right

hand side of the strikes equation are given by length, binding, pro-labor court, post-

Peron, dictator, along with three lagged observations of the growth of GDP, included as

controls.

        Thus, the model we estimate is a triangular system of two equations. We then test

the hypothesis that the variance-covariance matrix is diagonal with the data arranged on a

case-based unit of analysis. Employing the Breusch and Pagan 1980 test (see Greene

2000, 621), we conclude that the system is indeed fully recursive, and thus proceed to

estimate it equation by equation (see Greene 2000, 678). Furthermore, since pro-labor

ruling is a categorical variable, we use a logit model to estimate the conditional

probability of a pro-labor ruling. Also, since the data for the number of strikes are only

available yearly, we use the number of strikes in the year in which the supreme court

decided the case in the court’s decision equation. We use average annual values for the

right hand side variables of the strikes equation.

        Table 1 presents the results of the pro-labor rulings equation under the cohesive

and noisy representations of the legislature for the complete sample (Model I), and for

only democratic periods (Model II). 17

                                    < Table 1 about here >

The results are consistent with the predictions of the model. As in separation of power

models, the probability of a pro-labor ruling increases with the pro-labor disposition of

unconstrained courts (court unconstrained) and when a binding constraint for a pro-labor




                                                                                                 19
            Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




court is relaxed (an increase in anti-labor constraint),18 or when a binding constraint for

an anti-labor court is further tightened (an increase in a pro labor constraint). The

coefficient of pro-labor constraint, however, is not statistically significant for the whole

sample (Model I), although it is statistically significant at the 5 % level for the democratic

periods sample (Model II).

        Moving towards the more unique implications of our model, we find that,

consistent with proposition 2, pro-labor rulings increase with the level of strikes. This

result stands for both the cohesive and noisy representations of the legislature, and for the

whole or only the democratic period samples. In particular, setting the value of all

variables at their sample average, a one standard deviation increase in the number of

strikes - 152.6 and 180.4 for the complete and democratic samples- increases the

probability of a pro-labor ruling by 12 to 13% for both samples and models.

        We also find that the pro-labor tendency of court rulings increases during

breakdowns of the democratic regime, and decreases following President Peron’ s first

two terms in office.19

        Table 2 presents the results of four exercises that complement the previous

analysis. In Model III, we consider the model under the assumption that the relevant

majority determining the constraints for the court is a supermajority of two thirds of the

members of each chamber. We find that the coefficients of strikes and the preferences of

unconstrained courts (court unconstrained) are statistically significant of the same order

of magnitude as in Table 1. Political constraints with supermajority, however, seem to be

less significant as explanatory variables for court’s behavior.20

                                         <Table 2 about here>




                                                                                                 20
             Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




        Model IV considers an alternative method to capture the preferences of the court.

While the appointment of the president’s nominees to the supreme court requires the

approval of the senate, it can be argued that the senate has only a formal role in this

procedure. In this case, our measure of court’s preferences would be improved by simply

removing the influence of the senate. Thus, in Model IV we assume that the pro-labor

stance of each justice equals that of the nominating president.21 According to the

goodness of fit indicators, Model I performs better than Model IV. Model V considers the

period prior to the first administration of President Peron, during which unions had more

restrictive organizational capabilities. Thus, we do not expect strikes to be significantly

informative about the preferences of a wide electorate. Consistent with this description,

we find that although the estimated coefficients of strikes remain positive in all

specifications, they are no longer statistically significant. Finally, Model VI considers the

strategic defection hypothesis proposed by Helmke 2002. According to Helmke 2002, the

political constraints faced by the Court in a given period can fall short of accounting for

the entire range of incentives faced by the Court. The strategic defection hypothesis

argues that Justices’ behavior reflects not only the effect of current political constraints,

but also their anticipation of the political constraints they will face in the future. To

evaluate this hypothesis, we restrict the sample including only rulings decided one year

before a change of president. The results are similar, although the precision of the

estimates seems to improve, lending some support to this argument.

        Table 3 presents the results obtained from the estimation of the strikes equation.

The independent variables in Model I include length, binding, pro-labor court, post-

Peron, dictator, and three lagged observations of the growth of GDP, included as




                                                                                                21
            Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




controls. The results are consistent with the model’s empirical implications. First,

according to proposition 3 (and its corollary), we expect the level of strikes to increase

the more constrained the court is, and decrease with the size of the stable set (the

“pooling” area). Table 3 supports these implications, as the coefficients of binding and

length are of their predicted signs (positive and negative respectively) and all are

statistically significant.22 Table 3 also shows that unions were less combative during

military governments, and that (as Figure 2 anticipated) the organization of the labor

movement since Peron resulted in a higher capacity of unions to engage in political

demonstrations.23 In Model II, we also include the categorical variable end term, which

takes the value of one in year t if a president’s term finishes either in t or t+1. The

estimated coefficient is positive, although it is statistically significant at the 10 % level

only for the noisy representations of legislative parties. Our results, then, provide some

indication that unions strike more often in transitional periods.

                                         Conclusions

We started this paper pointing to the scant empirical support for models of legislative

lobbying. We provide here a framework that reconciles the theoretical literature of

lobbying with the negative available evidence. The first contribution of the paper is then

to show that the empirical work has been looking at the wrong impact of lobbying on

policy. Rather than affecting policy by impacting on the nature of legislation, lobbying

may be affecting policy via judicial decisions. Thus, judicial lobbying.

        Since interest groups cannot directly lobby justices, however, the link between

lobbying and court rulings can only be indirect: lobbying influences court rulings by

affecting the political constraints faced by the court. Identifying this mechanism allows




                                                                                                22
            Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




us to reconsider the determinants and effectiveness of lobbying in separation-of-powers

systems. We show that a key factor in determining lobbying is the extent by which the

information so generated can sway decisive majorities in the legislature to tighten the

political constraints faced by an anti-interest group court, or relax the constraints faced by

a pro-interest group court.

        Our empirical results for the interactions among unions, courts, and the

legislature in Argentina are consistent with this description. Argentine courts tend to side

more with unions the more the unions strike. Unions, in turn, strike more when courts

face a more unified legislature. It is in these situations that unions’ lobbying makes the

legislature more pro-labor, triggering, then, more pro-union judicial decisions. Our paper,

then, suggests that analyses of lobbying should pay closer attention to the actual nature of

the policy making process, and in particular, to the interaction of the bureaucracy, the

courts and the legislature.

Definition (Ramey 1996) Fix a sequential equilibrium Γ, and denote the payoff in Γ of a

type-θ union by U(θ). Fix an off-the-equilibrium-path action a by the union; i.e., a ∉

γ([0,1]), and suppose there is a nonempty set X’ ⊂ X such that: for all θ ∉ X’ there exists

θ’∈X’ such that U(a,x,θ) ≥ U(θ) implies U(a,x,θ’) > U(θ’). Then the equilibrium is said

to violate criterion D1 unless it is the case that the support of F(θ|a) is included in X’. A

sequential equilibrium is a D1 equilibrium if it does not violate criterion D1 for any a ∉

γ([0,1])



Lemma 1. Coupled with beliefs satisfying Bayes’ rule, the following strategies constitute

a sequential equilibrium: (i) court’s strategy xc(a) is defined by xc (a ) = xcPI (γ −1 (a )) for

all a such that γ -1(a) ∈ K, and xc(γ0(θ0)) = zc , where xcPI (⋅) ,θ0 and θ1 are given in

proposition 1; and (ii) union’s strategy γ(⋅) is defined by:

Proof of Lemma 1. First note that if beliefs satisfy Bayes’ rule, then (i) for all a such that

γ -1(a) ∈ K, f(θ|a)=1 if θ =γ -1(a), and f(θ|a) = 0 if θ ≠ γ -1(a), and (ii)for a= γ0(θ0), f(θ|a)

= f(θ) / [F(θ1)-F(θ0)] if θ ∈ [θ0,θ1], and f(θ|a) = 0 otherwise. Hence it follows directly

from proposition 1 that the Court’s proposed strategy specifies is a best response given

these beliefs. It remains to show the optimality of union’s strategy given f( |a) and xc( ).

To do so it is enough – by the revelation principle – to consider direct mechanisms in

which every type has the incentive to make truthful announcements. Suppose first that

θ0>0. Our initial step is to show that if the restriction of the union strategy to [0,θ0] is

given by γ0(θ), as defined above, then a union of type θ ≤ θ0 does not have the incentive

to misrepresent its type by claiming that its type is θ’∈[0,θ0], θ’≠ θ. To see this, consider

an arbitrary strategy γ~ (θ ) and its restriction to [0,θ0]. Truth telling is then optimal for θ

in this range only if:

Note that the FOC for a maximum at θ can be written as:

                         ∂γ~ (θ )  ∂uu ( z L (θ ; β H )) / ∂x  ∂z L (θ ; β H ) [1 − β H − hθ ]h

From this it follows immediately that γ~ (θ ) is strictly increasing in θ in [0,θ0] (the second

order condition, assuring that γ~ (θ ) is incentive compatible across [0,θ0], follows from

the assumption that Caθ(a,θ)<0. See Fudenberg and Tirole 1998, pp. 262). Moreover, for

the functional forms specified, we can obtain:

Note that we have made use of the fact that γ(0) = 0. For suppose not; that is, suppose

γ(0)= a > 0, and consider a deviation by type θ=0 to action a = 0. Equilibrium policy




                                                                                                            25
             Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




following the observation of lobbying level a =min γ([0,1]) results in the complete

information policy corresponding to the lower type in the distribution; i.e., xc( a ) =

xc(θ=0). But after a deviation, uninformed agents will respond with strategies that are

optimal given some beliefs with support in [0,1]. Then policy following a deviation

cannot possibly be worst for the union than equilibrium policy. Hence, the deviation is

profitable for type 0, since it reduces costs but can’t adversely affect outcomes.

        An identical argument shows that if θ1 < 1, a θ-type union, θ ≥ θ1, does not have

an incentive to play γ1(θ’’) for θ’’≠θ, θ’’∈ [θ1,1]. Furthermore, it follows from the

previous argument that a type θ < θ0 does not have an incentive to play γP = γ0(θ0); i.e.,

every type θ ∈ [0,θ0) prefers (γ0(θ),zL(θ;βH)) to (γP,zc). Similarly, when θ1 ∈ (0,1), there

is no type θ > θ1 with an incentive to play γP = γ1(θ1). We continue by showing that when

0 < θ0 < θ1 <1, no type in θ ∈ [0,θ0] has an incentive to play γ(θ’) for θ’∈[θ1,1] (and the

opposite). That is, we want to show that u(zL(θ;βH)) – C(γ0(θ),θ) ≥ u(zL(θ’;βL)) –

C(γ1(θ’),θ) for θ ≤ θ0, θ’ ≥ θ1. Since θ ≤ θ0 prefers (γ0(θ),zL(θ;βH)) to (γP,zc) = (γ1(θ1),

zL(θ1;βL)), we have, for θ≤θ0:

                   uu ( z L (θ ; β H )) − C (γ 0 (θ ),θ ) ≥ u ( z L (θ1 ; β L )) − C (γ 1 (θ1 ),θ ) (1)

Also, we know that θ’’ ≥ θ1 prefers (γ1(θ’’), zL(θ’’;βL)) to (γ1(θ’), zL(θ’;βL)) for θ’ ≥ θ1,

θ’’ ≠ θ’, θ’’ ≥ θ1. In particular, with θ’’ = θ1, this implies, for θ’ > θ1:

                   u ( z L (θ1 ; β L )) − C (γ 1 (θ1 ), θ1 ) ≥ u ( z L (θ ' ; β L )) − C (γ 1 (θ ' ), θ1 )          (2)

Now by (2), for θ ≤ θ1,

                                                             γ 1 (θ ')  ∂C (a, θ1 )da    γ 1 (θ ') ∂C ( a, θ ) da
              u ( z L (θ ' ; β L )) − u ( z L (θ1 ; β L ) ≤ ∫ 1                       ≤ ∫1
                                                            γ     (θ1 )     ∂a          γ (θ1 )         ∂a




                                                                                                                          26
             Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




so that for θ ≤ θ1 ≤ θ’,

                  u ( z L (θ ' ; β L )) − C (γ 1 (θ ' ), θ ) ≤ u ( z L (θ1 ; β L )) − C (γ 1 (θ1 ), θ )   (3)

The result then follows from (1) and (3). In addition, (3) also shows that any type in the

pool [θ0,θ1] prefers the pool than to announce θ’ ≥ θ1. A similar argument establishes that

when 0<θ0 <θ1 <1, no type θ ∈ [θ1,1] has an incentive to play γ(θ’) for θ’ ∈ [0,θ0], and

that no type in the pool prefers to announce θ’ ≤ θ0. Finally, it is easy to see that γ can

have no discontinuities at γ0(θ0), for in this case there would exist θ < θ0 sufficiently

close to θ0 for which a deviation by θ0 would be profitable (involving a marginal loss in

policy, but a discrete reduction in lobbying costs). Similarly, it can be shown that when

θ1<1, γ1(θ1)=γ0(θ0) when θ0>0. That γ1(θ1)=0 if θ0= 0, as we argued above, is covered in

the claim that γ(0) = 0.



Proof of Proposition 2. That there exists an equilibrium where (i) and (ii) hold follow

immediately from Lemma 1. It remains to show that this is indeed the unique equilibrium
                                ~             ~
                                                (                  )
                                         xc , f (⋅ | a ) be an equilibrium satisfying criterion
satisfying criterion D1. So let Π ≡ γ~ , ~

D1. We will show that if θ0>0, then γ~ (θ ) = γ 0 (θ ) ∀θ ∈ [0,θ 0 ] . The same argument can

then be applied to show that if θ1 <1, then γ~(θ ) = γ 1 (θ ) ∀θ ∈ [θ1 ,1] .

From the proof of lemma 1, we only need to show that γ~ (θ ) is strictly increasing in

                                                                    ~
[0,θ0]. So suppose that this is not the case. That is, for a>0, let Γ −1 (a) denote the inverse

image set of a under γ~ , and suppose that there exists an aP>0 such that

~
      {    ~
               ( )                 }
X 0P ≡ θ ∈ Γ −1 a P : 0 ≤ θ ≤ θ 0 is not a singleton. Since γ~ must be monotonically (weakly)




                                                                                                                27

            ~                                                        ~
increasing, X 0P must then be an interval [ θ , θ ] ⊆ [0,θ0]. Let xL f (⋅ | a); β L , and    (             )
   (

                  )
xL f (⋅ | a ); β H denote the preferred policies of the critical legislators β L and β H given

        ~
beliefs f (⋅ | a) . As in the case with complete information, we can now show that the set

                                                 ( (
                                                 ~
                                                                   ) (~
                                                                                       ))
of stable policies is given by S ~f (⋅| a ) = xL f (⋅ | a ); β L , xL f (⋅ | a ); β H ≡ ( s ( a ), s ( a )) . But if

~
X 0P = [ θ , θ ] ⊆ [0,θ0], then Bayes’ rule and the full support assumption imply that

~                                          ~
f (θ | a P ) > 0 for every θ∈[ θ , θ ] and f (θ | a P ) = 0 otherwise. This in turn implies that

z L (θ ; β H ) < s (a P ) < z L (θ ; β H ) . And since θ ≤ θ 0 = ( zc − β H ) h , then z L (θ ; β H ) < zc .

Thus the constraint is binding for the Court, and ~xc (a P ) = s (a P ) . Next, choose θ < θ

sufficiently close to θ so that s (a P ) < z L (θ ; β H ) . Since by assumption Caθ <0, the slope of

a union’s indifference curve in the (a,x) space is decreasing in the type θ, and we can

always find a pair (a*,xc*) such that U (a*, xc *, θ ) > U (a P , s (a P ), θ ) (1), and for any θ’ <θ

              ~                          ~ ~
U ( a*, xc *, θ ) < U ( a P , s ( a P ), θ )∀θ ≤ θ ' (2). Furthermore, we can as well find one such

pair for xc* < zL(θ;βH). Suppose first that a ∈ range(γ~ ) . Since γ~ is an equilibrium, this

                                                                      ~          ~
implies that ~
             xc (a*) < xc * (IC for θ). But then (2) implies that γ~ (θ ) ≠ a * ∀θ ≤ θ . Then

      ~
supp{ f (⋅ | a*) } ⊂ [θ, θ ] and hence ~
                                       xc (a*) ≥ z L (θ ; β H ) , which is a contradiction. Now

                                                           ~                          ~       ~
suppose instead that a ∉ range(γ~ ) . Then if U ( a*, xc , θ ) ≥ U ( a P , s ( a P ), θ ) for θ ≤ θ , (2)

implies that xc > xc*, so that, by (1), U ( a*, xc , θ ) > U (a P , s (a P ), θ ) . Thus criterion D1

               ~
requires supp{ f (θ | a*) } ⊆ [θ, θ ]. But in this case type θ has an incentive to deviate

from the proposed equilibrium behavior.                                                                  Q.E.D.

   θ<θ0. Here the constraint is binding and xcPI(θ)=zL(θ;βH). Similarly, the court is perceived as
   “anti-labor” for θ>θ1, and xcPI(θ)=zL(θ;βL). For θ∈[θ0,θ1], the court is unconstrained and
   xcPI(θ)=zc.

    For studies finding a relation, see Stratman 1992, 1995 and 1996. See also Snyder

1992.
2
    This is, for example, the case of El Salvador, where justices must be reappointed by the

legislature. The budget could also serve as an instrument of influence. See Toma 1991.
3
    All results would go through employing Euclidean preferences with the usual

properties. We present the analysis with specific functional forms to illustrate the nature

of the results in closed form solutions.
4
    For completeness, there is a fourth stage in which the legislature reviews the court’s

decision, but given that courts would only make policy choices that are stable, we can

without any loss, discard this last stage.
5
    See the appendix for a formal statement. Intuitively, this criterion requires that on

observing a deviation (an action not taken with positive probability by any type of agent

in the candidate equilibrium), the uninformed agents (court and union) will infer that the

deviating party belongs to the class of agents who had the greatest incentive to make the

observed deviation (Bernheim 1994).
6
    Note that this framework allows us to accommodate different procedures for legislative

approval. For example, consider the case in which a policy has to be approved by two

collective bodies (House and Senate, a committee and the floor, etc) by simple majority.

In this case, βL and βH would be given by the median voters in each chamber, S(θ) would

not in general be a singleton, and the court would face a nontrivial strategic problem. To

simplify the presentation, however, we continue with the benchmark interpretation of a




                                                                                               38

unicameral legislature with a supermajority rule unless it is otherwise noted, and drop the

m subscript when there can be no confusion.
7
    This should come as no surprise, however, since for this purpose, increasing xc with βL

and βH given is qualitatively similar as simultaneously reducing both βL and βH taking xc

as given, and we know from proposition 3 that βL and βH have opposite effects on the

expected level of strikes.
8
    This will generally be the case even in systems as the Argentinean, where legislators’

reelection rates are low, since the electoral connection constitutes an asset for other

elective posts such as governors, majors and provincial legislatures. Moreover, this will

generally also be the case even if, as in Argentina, party bosses control the nomination to

party lists, since party bosses need to maintain the support of party members to retain the

command of the party (see Iaryczower 2005).
9
    Peronism was banned from participating in the 1958 elections, and President Frondizi

was elected with the explicit support of Peron (see, for example, McGuire 1997).
10
     This family of distributions is stochastically increasing in α and reduces to the uniform

distribution when α = β = 1. Thus, the “noise” in the identification of the legislative

parties with the President increases with α.
11
     To clarify the second term in this expression, note that due to the symmetry of

treatment, the proportion of legislators of the pro-labor party to the left of (more anti-

labor than) a given point x in [0,1] is equal to the proportion of legislators of the anti-

labor party to the right of (more pro-labor than) the point 1-x, 1 − Βα (1 − x) .




                                                                                                 39

12
     Since these data were not available from a single source for our entire period (1935 –

1998), we selected what we considered to be the best possible source in our sample and

generated the remaining data using the percent variation in the next best available series.

The most comprehensive and reliable source is O’Donnel 2000, covering the period

1955-1972. For 1935–1955 we used data from Rotondaro 1971, which independently

covers the period 1935–1968. For the period 1972–1998 we used Torre 1983, Fernandez

1988, and Nueva Mayoria 2001.
13
     By norms, we mean laws, presidential decrees, administrative decisions and

resolutions. Cases in which the constitutionality of a lower court decision was questioned

(arbitrariedad), and cases in which the constitutionality of the interpretation of a norm by

a lower court was questioned, but not the norm in itself, were excluded. Moreover, we

also excluded those cases in which the supreme court decided not to opine over the

constitutionality of the challenged norm alleging formal or technical reasons. Finally, to

avoid duplications in substance arising from the fact that the Argentine court does not

have the ability to determine a law as unconstitutional per se, but rather has to deal with

the unconstitutionality of its application to a particular case (person), we limit the pool of

cases to those published in extenso in La Ley, the main judicial publication in Argentina.
14
     We do this for the cohesive and noisy representations of the legislature. Note that the

median voter in the Senate at the time of appointment, T, is computed from the

distributions GTU (x) and GTU ( x; α ) respectively, and that therefore the measure of pro-labor

court changes with each specification.




                                                                                                   40

15
     We do however also include a model specified for two thirds supermajority required in

both chambers. Denoting the critical legislator for a pro-labor (anti-labor) coalition in

chamber j=U,L by β Lj ( β Hj ), the critical legislator for pro-labor and anti-labor coalitions

in this case are given by min{β LU , β LL } and max{β HU , β HL } , respectively.

16
     Recall that we also treat military governments as completely unified, anti-labor

governments, controlling both houses.
17
     The results presented in Tables one to three were obtained using STATA version 7.0.
18
     Recall that the relative positions of the court and of the critical legislators in the

legislature vary with each specification. Thus, while there are no instances in which the

political constraint is binding for a pro-labor court for “cohesive” parties, this event does

indeed occur under a noisy representation of the legislature.
19
     The effect of dictatorships on pro-labor rulings should be considered in addition to the

effect brought by a unified government (as we assume dictatorships imply unified

governments). The results, however, may also reflect the nature of cases that come up for

decision to the court in dictatorship periods (more intensively anti-labor) and in post-

Peron periods (more intensively pro-labor).
20
     The evidence, however, is not conclusive. On the one hand, while there are no

instances of a pro-labor court being constrained by the legislature in the cohesive

representation of the legislature, the coefficient of anti-labor constraint is not statistically

significant in the noisy representations of the legislature (this is accentuated with α = 0.2,

with a p-value of 0.729). On the other hand, however, rulings are always pro-labor when




                                                                                                   41
               Judicial Lobbying: The Politics of Labor Law Constitutional Interpretation




the constraint for an anti-labor court is binding. In this case, these observations carry no

statistical information with respect to the likelihood function and have to be removed

from the estimation. This is not to say that this variable is not relevant for the outcomes,

but instead that its contribution can be replaced by the rule: “if a supermajority constraint

is binding for an anti-labor court, the court will rule in favor of labor.”
21
     We thank an anonymous referee for suggesting this exercise.
22
     We note, however, that length was highly collinear with pro-labor court, post-Peron

and dictator in the cohesive representation of legislative parties, and was dropped from

the analysis.
23
     We also find that the level of strikes decreases the more pro-labor the court is. As noted

in the previous section, however, the empirical implication regarding the position of the

court is ambiguous in general. Thus, although intuitive, this finding does not provide

evidence in favor or against the model.
