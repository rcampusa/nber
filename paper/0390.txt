The models presented in this paper were developed by the
authors under the direction of William Branson while at
OECD Project Interfutures and were extended during the
NBER Summer Institute for International Economics. The
results of the simulations are somewhat different from
those contained in the final report of Project
Interfutures and do not reflect the official views of
Project Interfutures. The research reported here is part
of the NBER's research program in International Studies.

         This paper contains a detailed description of a model of trade

and exchange rates. A verbal summary of the model may be found in NBER

Working Paper fl89.

         The model contains equations for import demands, bilateral

trade flows and trade prices for 26 regions and three commodities. A

simple exchange rate model used developments in current accounts to

model changes in nominal exchange rates. The regions coiered are the

twenty—three1 OECD countries and three non—OECD region: LDCs, OPEC, and

the centrally planned economies (CPEs).

         Sector A contains an algebraic description of the model and a

glossary of variables and parameters. Section B is a detailed discussion

of the equations and the sources of the parameter values.

Introduction

     This paper contains a detailed description of a model of trade and

exchange rates. A verbal summary of the model may be found in NBER Working

Paper li

     The model contains equations for import demands, bilateral trade flows

and trade prices for 26 regions and three commodities. A simple exchange rate

model used developments in current accounts to model changes in nominal exchange

rates. The regions covered are the twenty—three1 OECD countries and three

non—OECD regions: LDCs, OPEC, and the centrally planned economies (CPEs).

     Sector A contains an algebraic description of the model and a glossary of

variables and parameters. Section B is a detailed discussion of the equations

and the sources of the parameter values.

B. Parameters of the Trade and Exchange Rate Model and Their Sources
    1. Import Equations
       The short—run income elasticity in import equation for goods and
       services is (a) and the price elasticity is (B). In the long—run,
       when (Y) equals full—employment output (Y*) income elasticity is
       one and the long—term import/output ratio is (P) when relative
       prices remain stable.
       Several estimates for the parameters a and B are available in the
       literature for different countries. Most         comprehensive   sources
       are   Basevi (1973), Branson (1972), Houthakker—Nagee (1969), Samuel—
       son (1973), and   Taplin (1973). Moreover,       Stern, Francis and Schum—
       macher   (1977) provide an excellent survey      of literature concerning
       price elasticities. 1"     These are the main sources for our purposes;
       especially the Taplin estimates were extensively exploited. Table
        1 gives the estimates we have used in our       model,   which come mainly
        from Taplin's study. We wanted to exploit one        common source as
       much as possible t0 guarantee the internal        consistency   of the
       parameter estimates.

       In the petroleum import equations the income        elasticity   (c), the
       price elasticity (p) and     the   speed of adjustment (ic) are "guesstimates"
       based on Interfutures energy scenerlo and they reflect assumptions of
       a decreased share of petroleum in the world energy balance and             the
        ranking of regions according to their substitution possibilities.
        These are shown in Table 2 •        The service share of imports (y) is
        taken to be the 1975 value. 1975 data were also used to derive the
        constant terms (P) and    ()   in   the import equations for goods and     ser-
       vices and   for   petroleum respectively.



       'The recent IMP World Trade del by Deppler and Ripley (1978) was
         not available at the time when the survey of trade elasticities
          was carried out.

                Income elasticity : This is Taplin's activity elasticity plus one.
                It should be noted here that Taplin's activity variable "autonomous
                expenditure", is an aggregate including government expenditure,
                gross fixed capital formation and exports of goods, and services.
                The activity variable we use in our model is GDP. It may be the
                case with our income elasticity that it overpredicts the cyclical
                effect of income on imports. This should not, however, be a serious
                drawback as we have constrained the long—term income elasticity to
                be unity. The income and price elasticities for non—OECD regions
                are set to one and .70 respectively.

   late a compound price elasticity for each exporting country from substi-
   tution elasticities (A) and price elasticities (8) ) in the import func-
   tion and obtain   supply elasticities from other sources. As econometric
   information   about   trade supply elasticities is very scarce (the only
   relevant   empirical estimates for our purposes that        we are aware of are
   those reported in Artus and        Rhomberg (1973)) and they are the se for
   each   country in their model, we have chost another approach. In the
   literature    there exist   versions   of the type of equation in our model.
   Those studies   which   we consider the most suitable for our       purposes
   are rtus and Rhomberg (1973), Samuelson            (1973), and Dornbusch and
   Krugman (1977). The elasticities of export prices with respect to com-
   petitors' price and some measure of the cost variable from the above
   sources are shown     in   Table 5. The coefficients for these variables
   do not necessarily sum      to   unity; we therefore calculated the "first
   state estimates" as arithmetic means, using the estimates in columns
   1, 2 and 3 for the coefficient of competitors' prices and             estimates   in
   columns 5, 6 and 7 for the coefficient of domestic prices. Then these
   coefficients were scaled to add up to one. These are our final esti-
   mates for (c) for OECD countries and        they   are shown   in   Table 6.

   Branson and Papaefstratiou (1978) calculated proxies for market power
   for a sample of 41 countries consisting of both developed and developing
   countries. They assumed that market power in any commodity is an in-
   creasing function of the country's share in world trade.
   A comparison of the market power index for 15 developed countries using
   our estimates (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France,
   Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Noray, Spain, Sweden, The United
   Kingdom and The United States) shows that these are closely related.
   This dependence allowed us to derive a value for (1—u) for the export
   price equation of non—oil LDCa in our model which is .70. This same
   elasticity   was also applied to the export price equations for goods and
   services of Centrally Planned Economies and OPEC.

    The "world interest rate" in the net inve8tment income equation was set
    to .03. jtjal (1975) value for "other terms" in the current account
    is kept constant during the projection period.

5. Domestic Price Equation
    The coefficients for the effects of imported raw materials (*) and
    petroleum      price increases (it)   are   calculated according to the following
    formulas from the 1975 data and         are shown in Table 7.

               — value of raw material imports
                 value of raw material imports +
                 value of petroleum imports +
                 domestic labour costs

          it   = value of   petroleum imports
                 value of   raw material imports +
                 value of   petroleum imports +
                 domestic   labour costs

    The following empirical counterparts are used:

          value of petroleum imports              SITC 331
          value of raw material
          imports                                 SITCO+2+(3—331)+4+5+6

6. Exchange Rate Equationa

    For floaterB exchange       rate   equations applying the asset market      approach
    of   exchange rate determination were         obtained by linking the exchange rate
    equations estimated in       Branson—Ralttunen—Masson (1978) and in Branson—
    Haittunen (1979) to the trade block. These sources give the exchange
    rate equations for Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, Prance, and Italy.
    The (dollar/local currency) exchange rates were used for the first two
    countries and for Canada' and the (Deutsche Mark/local currency) rates
    for the three remaining countries which were converted also to determine
    (dollar/local currency) exchange rates. The money stock variables in

the exchange rate equations were neglected2i due to the fact that our
growth projections do not give any indiciation of the future monetary
growth of these countries and only the effects coming through changes
in net private foreign asset stocks were taken into account.
Exchange rate equations were estimated in log—form and that is why the
obtained parameters are elasticities. For our purpose these equations
were translated into a linear form using the following procedure. The
exchange rate equations can be written in elasticity form as:

E =    the   exchange rate (foreign currency/local     currency).
F      net   private foreign asset stock,     subscript 1 and   f   refer to local
       and   foreign, respectively.
a =    estimated   elasticities; 1 and   f   refer to local and     foreign   respectively.

multiplying by E and      rearranging   we obtain

(ii)         dE    a' —    dF —   a !_    dF


where and         0 are the coefficients shown    in Table   8. To calculate these,
1975 values for E and F were used. Equation (ii) is the equation for ex-

change rates for Canada, France,        Germany, Italy,   Japan     and the   United

Kingdom used in the model.




     implicitly we assume that the effects coming through changes in both
countries' money stocks cancel each other out. The work is in progress
to allow exchange rates to respond to different growth rates of money stocks.
