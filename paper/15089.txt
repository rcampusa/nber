                                              ABSTRACT

This paper studies the contribution of sulfa drugs, a groundbreaking medical innovation in the 1930s,
to declines in U.S. mortality. For several often-fatal infectious diseases, sulfa drugs represented the
first effective treatment. Using time-series and difference-in-differences methods (with diseases unaffected
by sulfa drugs as a comparison group), we find that sulfa drugs led to a 25 to 40 percent decline in
maternal mortality, 17 to 36 percent decline in pneumonia mortality, and 52 to 67 percent decline in
scarlet-fever mortality between 1937 and 1943. Altogether, they reduced mortality by 2 to 4 percent
and increased life expectancy by 0.4 to 0.8 years. We also find that sulfa drugs benefited whites more
than blacks.

1. Introduction

       The U.S. experienced unprecedented declines in mortality during the 20th century. The

age-adjusted death rate decreased by 74 percent, and life expectancy increased by 56 percent, or

30 years (Bernard Guyer, Mary A. Freedman, Donna M. Strobino and Edward J. Sondik 2000).

Seventy percent of the increase in longevity occurred during the first half of the century, driven

by a reduction in infectious disease mortality, the leading cause of death at the time. The welfare

gains from this increase in longevity are estimated to be as large as those from per capita GDP

growth over the period (William D. Nordhaus 2002). Understanding what caused these rapid

gains is of historical interest and also relevant for policy in developing countries today where

infectious disease mortality remains high.

       Several factors are thought to have contributed to the 20th-century declines in mortality,

including rising living standards, better nutrition, and public health initiatives that improved

water supplies, sanitation systems, and household hygiene (Thomas McKeown 1976, John B.

McKinlay and Sonya M. McKinlay 1977, Robert W. Fogel 1994, Samuel Preston 1996, Preston

and Michael Haines 1991, David Cutler and Grant Miller 2005).

       The extent to which medical advances played a role in mortality decline during the first

half of the 20th century is subject to some debate. While studies focusing on the second half of

the century attribute a large share of the decline to medical innovation (Cutler 2004), the

importance of medicine for the earlier period is less well understood. Historical epidemiologists,

such as McKeown, R.G. Record, and R.D. Turner (1975) and McKinlay and McKinlay (1977),

observed that a large share of 20th-century declines in infectious disease mortality preceded the

advent of medical treatments and concluded that the main cause of the advances must be

something other than modern medicine. Other researchers hypothesized that medical innovation



                                                1
in fact was an important contributor to mortality declines, but they did not empirically test the

hypothesis or estimate the magnitude of this contribution (e.g., Irvine Loudon 1987, John

Conybeare 1948, Morton N. Swartz 2004).

       The aim of this paper is to shed new light on the contribution of medical innovation to

mortality declines by examining the introduction of sulfa drugs in the mid-1930s, an important

event in the history of modern medicine. Sulfa drugs were the first medicine to effectively treat a

range of potentially-fatal bacterial infections, including streptococcal (strep) infections (most

notably scarlet fever, puerperal sepsis, and erysipelas), pneumonia, and meningitis. Pneumonia

alone accounted for 8% of total deaths in 1936. The production and sales of sulfa drugs grew

rapidly after their discovery; by 1941, 10 to 15 million people were treated with sulfa drugs

annually (Annabel Hecht 1984). The next major medical advance was not until the mid-1940s

when penicillin and other antibiotics became available. Therefore, the period from the mid-1930s

to mid-1940s provides a unique opportunity to examine the effect of a new medical technology

on mortality.

       Despite the historical and medical importance of sulfa drugs, there is little empirical

evidence on their contribution to mortality decline. One exception is a study by Melissa A.

Thomasson and Jaret Treber (2008) that finds that hospitalization of childbirth in the U.S. did not

significantly reduce maternal mortality until after sulfa drugs became widely available in 1937.

The limited empirical attention given to sulfa drugs may be due in part to the lack of

disaggregated data on their diffusion, which makes it more challenging to estimate their effect on

mortality.

       We confront this challenge by using the timing of the discovery of sulfa drugs—when no

other major factors are known to have affected mortality trends— combined with their rapid




                                                2
diffusion. These facts enable us to provide credible evidence on the impact of sulfa drugs on

mortality despite the lack of data on diffusion. First, we test for structural trend breaks in the

mortality time series. We test both whether the timing of the trend break lines up with the

introduction of sulfa drugs and whether the trend break is statistically significant. For diseases

treated with sulfa drugs (maternal mortality,1 pneumonia, and scarlet fever), we find evidence of

trend breaks in the mortality series around 1937, the first year of large-scale sulfa drug

production.

         Our empirical strategy also uses another fact about sulfa drugs: from clinical trials

conducted in the 1930s, we know that they were only effective against certain infectious

diseases. We thus can also examine mortality trends for a major infectious disease that was not

treatable with sulfa drugs, tuberculosis.We find no trend break during the relevant period for this

“control disease.”

         We estimate the magnitude of the effect of sulfa drugs on mortality using a difference-in-

differences regression approach that compares mortality differences between treated and control

diseases before and after 1937. Our estimates are based on the identifying assumption that post-

1937 mortality declines for treated diseases, beyond those that occurred for the control disease,

are due to sulfa drugs. The results suggest that sulfa drugs were responsible for a 25-40% decline

in maternal mortality, a 17-36% decline in pneumonia mortality, and a 52-67% decline in scarlet

fever mortality between the pre-1937 and post-1937 periods.2 These declines account for

between 40% and 75% of total declines for these causes of death during this period. In addition,

  As shorthand, we call maternal mortality (death due to complications from childbirth) a disease, but it is more
precisely a cause of death.
2
  Pneumonia (treatable with sulfa drugs) is combined with influenza (not treatable with sulfa drugs) in our mortality
data, as explained in Section 3. When calculating the effect of sulfa drugs on pneumonia, we assume the sulfa-
induced decline in the combined category is due to a decline in pneumonia mortality.


                                                        3
we find larger declines in urban areas, consistent with historical evidence that sulfa drugs

diffused more rapidly in cities than in rural areas.

       Finally we compare the effect of sulfa drugs on mortality for blacks and whites. Diffusion

of sulfa drugs was likely slower among blacks, due to the inferior medical care available to them

under segregation and to the high age of southern blacks living in rural areas (Douglas Almond,

Kenneth Y. Chay, and Michael Greenstone 2006, Loudon 1992). More generally, it has been

hypothesized that innovation benefits higher socioeconomic status (SES) groups first (Bruce G.

Link, Mary E. Northridge, Jo C. Phelan and Michael L. Ganz 1998). Consistent with this

hypothesis, we find that mortality from diseases treatable with sulfa drugs fell less for blacks

than for whites.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a brief history of

sulfa drugs. In Section 3, we describe the data. Section 4 presents graphical evidence and tests

for structural breaks. Section 5 estimates the magnitude of the effect of sulfa drugs on mortality.

In section 6, we investigate racial differences in the effect of sulfa drugs. Section 7 concludes.



2. History of sulfa drugs

       Sulfa drugs were the first effective antibacterial agents to be produced in a

pharmaceutical laboratory. Before the first sulfa drug was synthesized in 1932, infectious disease

research and treatment was dominated by immunotherapy, which involved the use of either

animal serum containing antibodies to treat patients (passive immunization) or vaccines that

prevent the occurrence of disease by triggering the body to produce antibodies (active

immunization) (Loudon 2002). While serum was not widely used due to the high cost and the




                                                4
high risk of serum-related illness, several important vaccine discoveries were made in the late

nineteenth century, including the rabies vaccine (1885) and the diphtheria antitoxin (1891).

        In the late 1920s, German researchers began investigating the antibacterial potential of

textile dyes (Loudon 1991). In 1932, Gerhard Domagk, a German scientist working at the

chemical and dye company I.B. Farben, discovered that a red dye compound, “Prontosil,” was

successful in treating mice injected with streptococci. Domagk’s results, however, were not

published until 1935.3 That same year, the Pasteur Institute in France showed that the active

ingredient in the dye compound was sulfonamide. The structure of sulfonamide had been

documented in the doctoral dissertation of an Austrian chemist, Paul Gelmo, in 1908 and the

patent on it had long expired. Therefore, the technology for making sulfonamide was available,

and anyone could produce it. It was also relatively inexpensive to produce. As a result,

production and clinical testing of sulfonamide began on a large scale soon after its discovery.

        The first major clinical trial of sulfa drugs occurred in 1936 at Queen Charlotte’s Hospital

in England when Prontosil was given to 38 women with serious cases of puerperal fever, a

complication from childbirth caused by streptococcal infection that was the leading cause of

maternal mortality at the time. The results, published in the June 1936 issue of the Lancet,

reported a mortality rate of 8% among treated patients versus 24% among the most recent 38

untreated patients (Leonard Colebrook and Maeve Kenny 1936a). The success of sulfa drugs in

treating puerperal fever was replicated, and even surpassed, in subsequent clinical trials in

London, as well as in other parts of Europe (Colebrook and Kenny 1936b, M.A. Foulis and John

B. Barr 1937; G. F. Gibberd 1937). Prontosil was first used in the U.S. in 1935 to treat a child

with meningitis at Babies Hospital in New York (Andrew J. Schuman 2003). Further U.S. testing
3
  As a result of his discovery, Domagk was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1939, but due to
the Nazi government’s opposition to such a prize, was not able to accept the award until 1947 (Kiefer 2001).



                                                     5
in 1936 at Johns Hopkins University and Western Pennsylvania Hospital showed that sulfa drugs

were effective against scarlet fever and pneumonia (e.g., Perrin H. Long and Eleanor A. Bliss

1937). Over the next several years, clinical tests provided compelling evidence that various sulfa

compounds were effective in treating puerperal fever, pneumonia, scarlet fever, meningitis,

gonorrhea, and erysipelas (S.W. Sappington and G.O. Favorite 1939; Paul H. Hamilton 1938).4

         The lay press created immediate and intense enthusiasm for the drugs. Sulfa drugs

became widely-known in the U.S. following a December 1936 New York Times article reporting

that Prontosil cured President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s young son of a deadly streptococcal

infection. By 1939, sulfa drugs were commonly referred to as ‘magic bullets’ and a ‘growing

miracle’ and credited with declines in mortality from childbirth, pneumonia, and other diseases.5

         Pharmaceutical companies took advantage of the positive press on sulfa drugs. By as

early as 1937, sulfa drugs were widely available and dispensed in the U.S. That year, output of

sulfa drugs totaled 350,000 pounds; by 1940, it had doubled; and by 1942, production exceeded

14 million pounds (U.S. Tariff Commission, 1936-1950). More than 5000 sulfa compounds were

developed by the early 1940s (though not all of them proved to be effective) (David M. Keifer

2001). Until 1938 sulfa drugs were available without a prescription, but physicians routinely

prescribed them, and beginning in 1938, a prescription was required (Barron H. Lerner 1991).6




4
  For many clinical trials, particularly those involving diseases with high fatality rates, concurrent controls were not
used for ethical reasons (Lerner 1991; Loudon 2002). In other cases where disease fatality rates were relatively low,
definitive conclusions about the effect of sulfa drugs on mortality could not always be reached. Nonetheless, the
successful results of repeated clinical testing were still viewed as compelling evidence of sulfa drugs’ effectiveness.

  In 1937, 100 people died from consuming an “Elixir of Sulfanilamide”, an untested liquid sulfa preparation. This
incident led to the passage of the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FDC) Act that mandated safety testing of
drugs before marketing and prohibited the sale of some non-narcotic drugs without a prescription, including sulfa
drugs. Sulfapyridine, a sulfa compound, was the first important new drug to be reviewed under the FDC Act (Lesch
2007).

The rapid diffusion of sulfa drugs was aided by their low price, about $35 to $100 (2009 dollars)

per patient for a full course of the life-saving medicine.7

         The fact that sulfa drugs were a sensation and quickly became widely available is very

useful for analyzing their effects. These characteristics of sulfa drugs’ diffusion allow us to look

for sudden changes in outcomes (i.e., mortality) right after sulfa drugs were discovered and

entered into mass production. This approach would be inappropriate for a medical technology

with more gradual adoption, since one could not demarcate a before and after period as sharply.

         The subsequent development of penicillin and other antibiotics have largely

overshadowed the revolutionary effect of sulfa drugs on medical practice and research. However,

the ten-year period covering the discovery and widespread use of sulfa drugs was considered

‘epochal’ at the time, and sulfa drugs are credited today with ushering in a ‘therapeutic

revolution’ (Long and Bliss 1939:1; Richard M. Weinshilboum 1987:1). Sulfa compounds are

still used today, but have been largely replaced by antibiotics, which proved to be more effective

and less toxic in the treatment of most infectious diseases.8



3. Data and disease selection

         For our analyses, we use U.S. vital statistics data collected at the national-, state-, and

city-level for the period from 1920 to 1950. Data prior to 1930 by state and disease were

collected by Grant Miller and made publicly available through the National Bureau of Economic

Research.9 We collected additional state-level mortality data from 1930 to 1950 on four causes


7
  The calculation is based on revenue, production volume, and number of patients treated in 1943, as reported by
Lesch (2007). As a cross-validation, another price estimate is $4.30 per patient per day (converted to 2009 dollars),
suggesting the drugs were taken an average of 8 to 23 days.
8
  Today, sulfa drugs are used to treat some antibiotic-resistant infectious diseases, but are more commonly used in
the treatment of urinary tract infections, leprosy, and fungal diseases.

of death that were shown to be highly responsive to sulfa drugs in clinical trials: maternal

mortality, pneumonia, scarlet fever, and meningitis. In our analysis, we refer to these four causes

of death as “treated” diseases. The most common cause of maternal mortality, responsible for

roughly 40% of maternal deaths in the mid-1930s, was puerperal fever (also called puerperal

sepsis), caused by streptococcus bacteria, which was responsive to sulfonamide; therefore, we

use maternal mortality as a proxy for death from puerperal fever (Loudon 1988). In 1939,

influenza, which was not affected by sulfa drugs, was combined with pneumonia into a single

category in the vital statistics volumes. In order to achieve a consistent data series, we use the

combined pneumonia/influenza category for all years. For the years when disaggregated data are

available, pneumonia accounts for about 75% of total deaths in the combined category. To

calculate state-level death rates, we use population data from the Census Bureau’s decennial

censuses from 1920 to 1950. For years between censuses, we estimate the population by linear

interpolation within a state.

        We also use data on comparison diseases, that is, diseases untreatable with sulfa drugs.

An ideal comparison disease would be an infectious disease that is similar to the infectious

diseases treated with sulfa drugs, with the exception that it does not respond to any sulfa

compound. The disease that meets this criterion is tuberculosis, which we loosely refer to as our

“control” disease (Karl H. Pfuetze 1945).10 We also collected data on three chronic diseases:

diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. While chronic diseases are clearly very different from the

infectious diseases treated with sulfa drugs, they can provide some insight into whether there

were other factors that affected mortality rates for all diseases during the period when sulfa drugs

were introduced.

10
  An additional criterion is the availability of a consistent data series for the time period studied. For example,
influenza would have been a possible control disease had it not been combined with pneumonia in the vital statistics
data.


                                                       8
         In addition to the state-level data, we use national-level data. Age-standardized national

mortality series (using the 1940 population as the standard) are available in vital statistics

volumes, except for scarlet fever mortality and maternal mortality. For scarlet fever, we

aggregated age-specific deaths at the state level and then calculated national age-adjusted

mortality rates using the same direct method of standardization to the 1940 population. Our

analysis examines the maternal mortality ratio (maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) rather

than maternal mortality rate (maternal deaths per 100,000 women of reproductive age), as the

maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is the conventional measure of maternal mortality. The national

MMR is constructed by aggregating total deaths and total births from state-level data and then

calculating the ratio.11

         The U.S. death registration system did not include all states until 1933. Therefore, pre-

1933 national mortality estimates are approximations to complete national rates and, for our

state-level analysis, the number of data points available for each state varies.12 The state results

presented are based on unbalanced panel data, but our results are very similar when we restrict

our analysis to states with complete data series. For the regression sample, we use 1925 as the

beginning of our sample period to minimize the imbalance. The end date for the regression

sample is 1943; beyond this date, the introduction of other medical advances in the mid-1940s

would be a confounding factor.

         The city-level mortality data were collected by Thomasson and Treber (2008). These data

have two limitations for our purposes: (1) they cover only 1928 to 1940, and (2) they contain

information on maternal mortality but not other causes of death. During the relevant period,

11
   Following convention, the MMR is not age-adjusted. The MMR is preferable to the maternal mortality rate as a
measure of risk because it represents the risk of death once a woman has become pregnant.
12
   The annual collection of mortality statistics, known as the death registration system, began in 1900. The death
registration area expanded from 10 states in 1900 to 36 states in 1920 and the entire United States by 1933. Alaska,
Hawaii and the District of Columbia are not included, so there are at most 48 states in a given year.


                                                       9
maternal deaths were reported at the city level for each city with a population of at least 10,000

(in states that had entered the death registration system). We focus our analysis on larger cities

with populations of at least 25,000 (as of 1930), of which there are 267.

        Table 1 shows age-adjusted national mortality rates for 1920 and 1950. It also reports

summary statistics for the 1925-36 pre-sulfa period and 1937-43 post-sulfa period used in our

regression analyses. The state means are not an exact match to the national data because the

national data series are age-adjusted and because the state averages are not population-weighted.

        In 1920, the MMR in the U.S. was about 809 deaths per 100,000 live births, much higher

than in Western Europe, where the MMR ranged from 235 in Denmark to 665 in France (Loudon

1988). The 1920 MMR level in the U.S. is similar to levels found in developing countries such as

Chad and Ethiopia today (Loudon 1988, WHO et al. 2004). The MMR declined by roughly 45%

between the pre-sulfa and post-sulfa periods; similarly large declines occurred in Western

Europe. The pneumonia/influenza and tuberculosis disease categories were responsible for the

largest share of infectious disease deaths between 1920 and 1950 and accounted for

approximately 22% of overall mortality. Deaths due to scarlet fever and other infectious diseases

were much less common. Mortality for the infectious diseases considered here dropped by 34%

to 68% between the pre- and post-sulfa period.



4. The effect of sulfa drugs on mortality in the U.S.: Graphical and time-series evidence

        Ideally, to estimate the impact of sulfa drugs on mortality, one would estimate an

equation such as the following:


(4.1)                  Log(M)it = β0 + β1 (Sulfa drug availability)it + eit




                                               10
The dependent variable is the natural log of the mortality rate in medical market i and year t.13

The independent variable would be a measure of sulfa drug availability (supply) that is

uncorrelated with the demand for sulfa drugs. The hypothesis is that when sulfa drugs become

more available, mortality falls (β1 < 0). In practice, researchers might define the medical market

as a state and use state-year level data on sales volume or the number of prescriptions issued as a

proxy for sulfa drug availability, but it is worth keeping in mind that such a regression would

suffer from endogeneity bias. For example, sales of sulfa drugs are likely to be higher in places

with higher mortality risk from sulfa-treatable diseases. There is also a data limitation in our

case: there are no data on the availability of sulfa drugs disaggregated by state or other subgroups

for the period examined.

         Instead, we use two facts about sulfa drugs to arrive at empirical tests of their effects.

First, we use the fact that the timing of the sulfa drug discovery can be taken as exogenous and

that, because sulfa drugs could not be patented, diffusion was rapid: the first year of large-scale

production and sales of sulfa drugs in the U.S. was 1937 (U.S. Tariff Commission, 1936-1950).

This allows us to use time series techniques to test whether the timing of mortality declines

corresponds to sulfa drugs’ introduction in 1937. Second, there is strong evidence from clinical

trials that sulfa drugs were effective against some infectious diseases but not others. Therefore,

we are able to use infectious diseases that were impervious to sulfa compounds as a comparison

group in our analysis, netting out the effects of other factors that may have coincidentally

lowered mortality around 1937.



13
  The reason for modeling the log of the mortality rate is that medical advances are hypothesized to have a
proportional change on mortality rates: if the initial rate of mortality is high, there is more room for mortality
decline, so a medical advance should lead to a larger drop in the level of mortality than if the initial rate is low.
Using proportional changes also facilitates comparisons of mortality change across diseases that have different
levels of mortality initially.


                                                         11
        Most medical innovations do not have the fortuitous characteristics that the discovery of

sulfa drugs has—that is, fortuitous from the empirical researcher’s point of view. Penicillin was a

revolutionary medical advance, but it was invented in the 1940s at the same time as other major

medical advances (e.g., blood transfusions, refinements in sulfa drugs, and anti-malarial

pesticides), which makes isolating its impact difficult. Moreover, there seems to be no control

disease available, that is, an infectious disease that was unaffected by penicillin or by other

contemporaneous innovations. Hence, we examine the effects of medical innovation in the early

20th century by focusing on sulfa drugs both because sulfa drugs were an important breakthrough

and because other breakthroughs like penicillin do not lend themselves well to an impact analysis

using population data.



Graphical evidence on trend breaks in the mortality time series

        Figure 1 plots total mortality between 1920 and 1950, and Figure 2, mortality for the four

sulfa-treated diseases: maternal mortality, pneumonia/influenza, scarlet fever, and meningitis.14

All graphs show mortality on a log scale. The vertical line at 1937 indicates the first year of

large-scale production of sulfa drugs in the U.S. With the exception of meningitis, the mortality

curves for the treated diseases become noticeably steeper after 1936-7.

        Meningitis has a very different pattern than the other diseases, with wide fluctuations that

suggest outbreaks. Modeling this type of time-series process requires very different techniques

than those we use for the rest of the diseases in this study, and for this reason we do not pursue

meningitis further in our analysis.




14
 Graphs are based on national-level age-adjusted death rates, using 1940 as the standard, except in the case of
MMR, which is based on aggregated state-level data.


                                                      12
         The mortality rate for pneumonia/influenza also fluctuates in the early years, driven by

outbreaks of influenza (Neil M. Ferguson, Alison P. Galvani, and Robin M. Bush 2003, E.

Lofgren, N. Fetterman, Y.N. Naumov, et al 2007). We will be testing the hypothesis that sulfa

drugs affected pneumonia mortality, not influenza mortality (as noted earlier, influenza was

unaffected by the drugs), so the volatility of influenza mortality is, in effect, noise in our data. As

it affects the dependent variable, this noise will make our pneumonia/influenza results less

precise, but is otherwise not problematic.

         In contrast to the treated diseases, mortality trends for the control and chronic diseases

(Figures 3 and 4) do not show any noteworthy changes around the time that sulfa drugs were

introduced. Death rates for our control disease, tuberculosis, are trending downward and chronic

diseases trending upward, with no obvious breaks in the trend lines around 1937, suggesting

there were no factors other than sulfa drugs affecting mortality at this time.15 Since tuberculosis

constitutes a closer comparison group than chronic diseases, for brevity, we exclude the chronic

diseases from the remainder of our analysis.

         The graphs also show that between 1935 and 1937 there is a slight increase in overall

mortality as well as mortality from several of the specific causes of death considered here. The

cause of this uptick is a puzzle in the demographic literature and one that we do not attempt to

solve in this paper. Its timing is somewhat unfortunate for our purposes since we are interested in

structural breaks in our mortality series around 1937; however, this uptick exists in the mortality

series for both treated and control diseases (and, to a lesser extent, for chronic diseases). To




15
  The decline in tuberculosis appears to steepen around 1945. Penicillin and other antibiotics effective against
tuberculosis were introduced around this time.

ensure that our results are not driven by this anomaly, we also check the robustness of our results

to the omission of these years in our estimation.16



Formal tests of trend breaks in mortality time series

         The graphs provide visual evidence that mortality declines accelerated when sulfa drugs

were introduced in 1937. We next conduct a more formal test for structural breaks in the

mortality series. Using out-of-sample information that large-scale production of sulfa drugs

began in 1937, one could assume that 1937 is the first year that sulfa drugs would affect

mortality and examine whether there is a statistically significant break for that year. We start

with a stronger test that does not assume knowledge of when the trend break occurs. We test

whether, among all possible break dates, the break is strongest in a statistical sense in or around

1937 and whether the break is statistically significant.

         We test for a trend break in year τ using the following model:


(4.2)                               Log(M)t –Log(M) t-1 = α + δ0Dt (τ) + et .


The dependent variable, Log(M)t - Log(M)t-1 , is the first difference of log mortality, and Dt(τ) is

an indicator variable equal to zero for all years before τ and equal to one for all subsequent years.

In using first differences, we are testing for a trend break rather than level change in mortality at

year τ.17 To account for serial correlation, we compute Newey-West standard errors and allow

the error structure to be correlated up to two lags.

16
   For all diseases except pneumonia/influenza, the data suggest that the mortality uptick is limited to 1935 to 1936.
For pneumonia/influenza, the uptick is between 1935 and 1937. To be conservative, we present results from models
that exclude 1935 to 1937 as our main robustness test. Appendix Table A1 presents results from an alternative test
that excludes only 1935 and 1936. In both cases, dropping the years of the uptick has little impact on our results.
17
   The graphs suggest a break in the trend rather than level. Moreover, break tests require the data to be stationary,
which the non-differenced mortality series do not satisfy. Using both Pierre Perron’s 1989 test and Augmented
Dickey Fuller tests, we fail to reject non-stationarity when using levels rather than differences. Results available
upon request.


                                                       14
         Using national mortality data for 1920 to 1950, we test for a possible break in each year

in the interval 1933 to 1942; that is, we estimate equation (4.2) ten times, with τ taking on each

value between 1933 and 1942. The interval of possible break dates is smaller than the full span

of the data because one needs an adequate number of data points before (after) the earliest

(latest) break point to estimate the regression line before and after the break point.18 For each

estimate, the null hypothesis of no trend break, or δ0 = 0, is tested, and the largest of the resulting

F-statistics is used to determine the best possible break point and the significance of the break.19

We interpret finding a trend break in or around 1937 as evidence that the introduction of sulfa

drugs had an impact on mortality.

         Table 2 presents the results of the trend-break test, which confirm the visual evidence.

For each of the treated diseases, the test identifies a structural break in 1937 or 1938.20 The three

treated diseases account for about 12% of total mortality in the pre-period and they were not the

only diseases treated with sulfa drugs, so it is perhaps not surprising that total mortality also

shows a possible trend break in 1937. The short time series leads to relatively low statistical

power, but the trend breaks in 1937 are statistically significant at the 1% level for MMR and

scarlet fever. In contrast, for the control disease, tuberculosis, the test identifies 1942 as when a

trend break possibly occurs (statistically insignificantly).




18
   There is little guidance in the literature on how to choose the appropriate test window. A common approach is to
trim 15% from both ends. However, in the case of small samples such as ours, that would leave only three data
points on either side of the test window.
19
   This test is the Quandt Likelihood Ratio test, which is, in essence, a sequential Chow Test where the largest F-test
from these sequential tests is used to identify a possible break point (Richard E. Quandt 1960). We use Andrews
(1993, 2003) critical values that account for the fact that many possible break points are being tested and, therefore,
there are many chances to reject the null hypothesis of no structural change (Stock and Watson, 2003).
20
   The later break date (1938) for pneumonia/influenza mortality likely reflects the availability of sulfapyridine, a
new sulfa compound more effective in treating pneumonia, beginning in 1938 (Lesch, 2007).

5. Regression estimates of the effect of sulfa drugs on mortality

         This section uses regression analysis to measure the magnitude of the effect of sulfa

drugs on mortality. Based on the trend-break results above plus out-of-sample knowledge that

1937 was the first year of widespread sulfa use, the regression analysis interprets post-1937

changes in mortality for the treated diseases as the effect of sulfa drugs. We estimate two models,

one that allows for a level change in mortality in 1937 and one that allows for both a level

change and slope change in 1937.21



Post-1937 changes in mortality

         Using the national mortality series from 1925 to 1943 (19 observations), we first estimate

a simple model that allows mortality to be a function of an overall linear time trend and a level

shift in 1937:

(5.1)             Log(M)t = β0 + β1Yeart + δ0Post-1937+ et.

The dependent variable, Log(M)t , is the log of mortality in year t, Yeart is a continuous year

variable, and Post-1937t is a dummy variable equal to one if the year is 1937 or after. The

question of interest is whether the coefficient on the post-1937 dummy (δ0) is negative and

significant.


         We also estimate a trend-break model that allows for a change in the slope after 1937:

(5.2)             Log(M)t = β0 + β1Yeart + δ0Post-1937 + δ1Post-1937*Yeart + et




21
  The time-series tests in the previous section required stationary time series, and because our mortality data are
only stationary once they are first-differenced, we tested for trend breaks using first-differenced data and could not
test for level shifts. The analysis in this section does not require stationarity, so we are able to estimate both level
and slope changes.


                                                         16
In this model, we are interested in whether δ0 and δ1 are negative and significant. In both models,

to account for serial correlation we compute Newey-West standard errors that allow the error

structure to be correlated up to two lags.

         The first model (equation 5.1) is more parsimonious, which might be preferable given the

short time series; there is limited statistical power to estimate slope changes with a short panel.

However, the second model (equation 5.2) allows for the possibility that the effect of sulfa drugs

starts off small and then accelerates, which one might expect given that technology adoption is

not instantaneous. Indeed, the visual evidence in Figure 2 is consistent with sulfa drugs

accelerating mortality declines and not just causing a one-time drop.22 We present results from

both models, but the slope-change model is our preferred specification.

         The results in the first column of Table 3 (based on estimating equation 5.1) suggest that

there was a decline in all-cause mortality after 1937, but the coefficient is not statistically

significant. However, column 2 (based on equation 5.2) shows that there is a negative and

statistically significant change in the slope after 1937. The coefficient in column 1 suggests that

age-adjusted mortality fell by about 2% between the pre-1937 period (1925-36) and the post-

1937 period (1937-1943). The coefficients from column 2 indicate a larger effect of about 4%.

The total effect size from equation 5.2 is computed as δ0 + 3.5*δ1, where the factor of 3.5 is the

average value of Year for our seven years of post-1937 data.

         Table 3 also shows that each of the three diseases treatable with sulfa drugs saw

significant declines in mortality after 1937. The coefficients of interest are negative and

significant for each disease and for both specifications, expect for pneumonia/influenza for

22
   When we estimate the post-1937 decline in mortality non-parametrically, by including a dummy for each year
starting in 1937 (in addition to a year trend), the results suggest that the second model (equation 5.2) describes the
time pattern in the effect of sulfa drugs well. The coefficients suggest that the effect of sulfa drugs was increasing
linearly and stabilized around 1942. For MMR, the coefficients suggest that the effect may have been increasing
faster than linearly in the first few years after 1937. Results available upon request.


                                                        17
which the intercept, although negative, is not statistically significant. The coefficients suggest a

decline in maternal mortality of 26 to 41%, in pneumonia/influenza mortality of 15 to 29%, and

in scarlet fever mortality of 58 to 75%. (The larger effects are always from (5.2).) On the other

hand, the coefficients for the 1937 break are positive and statistically insignificant for

tuberculosis, our control disease.



Difference-in-difference estimates

       Next, we estimate difference-in-difference models that compare pre- and post-1937 levels

and trends between treated diseases and the control disease. The inclusion of tuberculosis as a

control disease accounts for any other factors that may have affected mortality around 1937. We

allow each disease to have its own overall linear trend, so the identifying assumption is that,

conditional on disease-specific trends, any pre- versus post-1937 changes in mortality caused by

factors besides sulfa drugs are the same for the control and treated diseases, and that sulfa drugs

are the only factor differentially affecting the treated diseases beginning in 1937.

       We start by presenting results using national level data, examining each treated disease

separately. We stack the data so that there are two observations per year, one for the treated

disease and one for the control disease. We then estimate two models,


(5.3) Log(M)dt = β0 + β1 Treatedd*Post-1937t + β2 Treatedd*Yeart + β3 Treatedd +

                  β4 Yeart + εdt

and

(5.4) Log(M)dt = β0 + β1 Treatedd*Yeart*Post-1937t + β2 Treatedd*Post-1937t +

                  β3 Treatedd*Yeart + β4 Treatedd + β5Yeart + εdt.




                                                18
The dependent variable is the log of the mortality rate for disease d and year t. Treatedd is an

indicator variable for whether disease d is a treated disease, Post-1937t is an indicator variable

equal to zero for t between 1925 and 1936 and equal to one for the period 1937 to 1943, and

Yeart is a continuous year variable (centered on 1937). Robust standard errors are reported.

       The first model (equation 5.3) examines changes in the level of the dependent variable

after 1937. The coefficient of interest, β1, measures whether the post-1937 reduction in mortality

was larger for treated diseases than for the control disease. The second model (5.4) allows for a

change in both the intercept and the slope after 1937. In this model, the statistical question of

interest is whether β1 and β2 are jointly significantly different from zero. Both models allow for a

different linear time trend for treated and control diseases.

       We also present results using state-level data. The coefficients should be similar to those

obtained with national-level data (except for the age-adjustment and the population weighting),

but using state-level data can increase the precision of the estimates since we can control for

state-level covariates (e.g., state-specific trends) that affect mortality but are orthogonal to our

variables of interest. We estimate the following equations with state-level data:


(5.5) Log(M)idt = β0 + β1 Treatedd*Post-1937t + β2 Treatedd*Yeart + β3 Treatedd +

                  β4 Yeart + γit + εidt

and

(5.6) Log(M)idt = β0 + β1 Treatedd*Yeart*Post-1937t + β2 Treatedd*Post-1937t +

                  β3 Treatedd*Yeart + β4 Treatedd + β5Yeart + γit + μit*Yeart + εidt.

The dependent variable is the log of the mortality rate in state i for disease d and year t, and

Treated, Post-1937 and Year are defined as before. The equations now include State*Post-1937

fixed effects, denoted by γit, which control for the main effect of Post-1937 and absorb state


                                                19
variation in mortality declines (which is orthogonal to the regressor of interest, but adds noise to

the estimates), and State*Post-1937 fixed effects interacted with Yeart, denoted by μit*Yeart.

Standard errors are clustered by disease-year, since the variable of interest only varies at this

level.23

           We estimate the equations separately for each treated disease using mortality data from

1925 to 1943. Table 4, Panel A presents the results of our main specification for the national

data. Panel B shows the results using state-level data. As expected, the coefficients are of similar

magnitude, but the standard errors are somewhat smaller using the state data. The coefficients of

interest are negative and significant using both levels of data and for all three treated diseases

(except for β1 for pneumonia/influenza, which is negative but not significant). These results

suggest that the introduction of sulfa drugs led to significant mortality declines for diseases that

were treatable with the new drugs.

           Panel C shows that the results are robust to the exclusion of 1935 to 1937, the years of

the uptick in mortality (we present these using the state-level data for brevity). While the

estimated coefficients in the MMR and scarlet fever models are virtually unchanged, the

coefficients in the pneumonia/influenza model are reduced by roughly a half. That the

pneumonia/influenza point estimates are sensitive to excluding even a few points is not

surprising given that the data are noisier for this outcome and we have a short panel. In all other

cases, however, the estimates are negative and statistically significant.

           We can use the difference-in-differences coefficients to assess the magnitude of sulfa

drugs’ effect on mortality. Starting with the first model (equation (5.5), using the coefficients

reported in Panel B, column 1), the MMR coefficient of -0.28 implies that the introduction of

23
  We also estimated standard errors clustering by state to correct for possible serial correlation (Marianne Bertrand,
Esther Duflo, and Sendhil Mullainathan 2004). When we cluster by state, the standard errors are actually smaller
than when we estimate robust standard errors, suggesting that this serial correlation correction is not needed.


                                                       20
sulfa drugs resulted in a 25% decrease in MMR in the post period, or 163 (0.25*653) fewer

maternal deaths per 100,000 births between 1925-36 and 1937-43. Sulfa drugs thus appear to

explain 56% of the total decline in MMR during this time period, which fell by about 292 deaths

per 100,000 births between the two periods (Table 1). The estimates also suggest that sulfa drugs

were responsible for a 13% decline in pneumonia/influenza mortality (a decrease of 15 deaths

per 100,000 people) and 39% of total mortality decline in this disease category. If one assumes

the averted deaths in the combined pneumonia/influenza category were from pneumonia, then

sulfa drugs caused a 17% decline in pneumonia mortality. Finally, the scarlet fever results imply

that sulfa drugs led to a 52% drop in scarlet fever mortality, which accounts for 76% of the total

decline in this cause of death between the pre-1937 and post-1937 periods.

        The coefficients from the second model, which allows for a break in trend as well as a

level change (Panel B column 2), suggest larger effects: MMR declined by 40%,

pneumonia/influenza declined by 27% (implying a 36% decline in pneumonia) and scarlet fever

declined by 67%. These effect sizes are very similar to those we obtained using the simple

difference estimates in the previous subsection.

        Our estimates are quite consistent with clinical trial estimates from the time (G.M. Evans

and Wilfrid F. Gaisford 1938, Colebrook and Kenny 1936a). In clinical trials, sulfa drugs

reduced mortality from pneumonia by 50 to 70%, while we estimate a 17% to 36% decline at the

population level. The larger effect size in clinical trials is not surprising since only a portion of

the population afflicted with pneumonia took sulfa drugs, and drugs are generally more

efficacious in a controlled, clinical setting. Sulfa drugs reduced mortality from puerperal fever,

which was responsible for roughly 40% of maternal deaths in the pre-sulfa period, by about 81%

in clinical trials, implying a 32% reduction in maternal mortality. In comparison, we find a




                                                21
maternal mortality decline of 25% to 40%. It is somewhat surprising that the population-level

effect for maternal mortality is the same size as the clinical-trial effect, but one potential

explanation is that, because the vast majority of births were physician-assisted, sulfa drugs were

administered in a high proportion of puerperal fever cases in the general population (higher than

for pneumonia cases, where a physician may not always have been consulted).24 For scarlet

fever, we do not have estimates from clinical trials to compare with our results.

         Using the estimated effect sizes combined with the summary statistics presented in Table

1, we can calculate the contribution of sulfa drugs to the overall mortality decline from 1937 to

1943. We first convert the decline in MMR due to sulfa drugs to a percent decline in maternal

deaths per 100,000 individuals, which we estimate to be 24%. We know that mortality from

maternal causes, pneumonia/influenza, and scarlet fever accounted for 1.1%, 10.5%, and 0.2%,

respectively, of total deaths in the pre-sulfa period. Therefore, we estimate that sulfa drugs,

through their effect on the three treated diseases, were responsible for 1.7% of overall mortality

decline between 1925-36 and 1937-43 (0.24*0.011 + 0.13*0.105 + 0.52*0.002). If we repeat the

calculation using the second model, we find an overall effect on mortality of 4.1%. These

estimates are very similar to the simple post-1937 change in all-cause mortality implied by Table

3.

         The impact of sulfa drugs on life expectancy can be estimated with a back-of-the-

envelope calculation. Using national-level mortality counts by age (and by cause) for 1936 along

with population estimates, we can compute actual life expectancy in 1936. We can then calculate

a counterfactual life expectancy using the lower mortality rates caused by sulfa drugs for the

treated diseases. We find that sulfa drugs increased life expectancy by 0.38 to 0.76 years of life


24
  Another possible explanation is that, given that maternal deaths are difficult to classify, puerperal fever may have
accounted for a larger share of maternal deaths than the 40% figure we assume.


                                                       22
(the larger estimate uses results from the second model). Published estimates suggest that life

expectancy increased by about 4.8 years during this period (from 58.5 to 63.3 between 1936 and

1943), so sulfa drugs account for 8-16% of the increase. Note that our estimates do not capture

the full impact of sulfa drugs on life expectancy because we cannot account for the effects of

sulfa drugs on mortality declines after 1943 and because, due to data limitations, we do not study

the effect on other diseases (such as meningitis, erysipelas, and cerebrospinal fever) that sulfa

drugs also treated.25



Urban-rural evidence on maternal mortality

         While the above analysis provides strong suggestive evidence that the introduction of

sulfa drugs caused a reduction in mortality starting in 1937, we conduct an additional test to

validate our interpretation that the decline was due to sulfa drugs. Studies of diffusion of medical

technology in the U.S. find that large, urban-based research hospitals are usually the first to

adopt new medical technologies, followed, after the importance of the new technology is proven,

by urban medical facilities and, lastly, by medical centers in rural areas, often after a

considerable delay (Duke University, Medical Technology Assessment Working Group, 2006).

According to historical accounts, clinical testing for sulfa drugs was first carried out at several

urban-based research facilities in the U.S. such as Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore), Babies

Hospital (New York City), and Western Pennsylvania Hospital (Pittsburgh). Therefore, one

validation test is to compare post-1937 mortality reductions in urban and rural areas, with the

expectation that urban areas would benefit from sulfa drugs more immediately than rural areas.


25
  Clinical trials also indicate that sulfa drugs reduced morbidity from pneumonia and our other treated diseases.
They were also were effective in the treatment of various infections with low fatality rates, including bacillary
dysentery and gonorrhea. Therefore, the contribution of sulfa drugs to health is greater than what is captured by
focusing on mortality alone.


                                                       23
        We have urban-only mortality data but not rural-only data. Therefore, we compare urban

mortality to state-level mortality, where state-level data represent the sum of mortality in urban

and rural areas. If the trend breaks are larger in urban areas than in rural areas, then the urban

data should show larger trend breaks than the state-level data that aggregate across urban and

rural populations.

        We restrict the urban data to cities with populations of at least 25,000 for two reasons.

First, our hypothesis of a higher rate of diffusion in urban areas is more likely to hold in larger

cities. Second, vital statistics data were not collected in cities smaller than 25,000 people in 1931

and 1932. Recall that our city-level data series includes maternal mortality only, and only covers

the period from 1928 to 1940. Figure 5, which is based on city- and state-level data, shows that

the MMR was higher in cities than at the state level until 1936, after which point an urban

advantage emerges. While the mortality curves for both cities and states become noticeably

steeper around 1936-7, the graph suggests that this slope change occurs earlier in cities.

        Because the city-level series end in 1940, we cannot estimate the timing of trend breaks

using the time series methods used above, which require a longer panel. We can, however,

estimate regression models that test whether there is a larger break in urban areas in 1937, using

pooled city- and state-level maternal mortality data. (An observation is either a state-level or a

city-level mortality rate. States with more than one large city will have more than two

observations in a given year). We estimate the following two regressions:


(5.7)   Log(MMR)ict = β0 + β1 Urbanc*Post-1937t + β2 Urbanc + β3 Urbanc*Yeart + β4Year t
                       + γit + εict
and

(5.8) Log(MMR)ict = β0 + β1 Urbanc*Post-1937t + β2 Urbanc *Yeart + β3 Urbanc *Year t *Post-
                      1937t + β4 Urbanc + β5Yeart + γit + μit*Yeart + ε ict.


                                               24
The dependent variable is the log of the maternal mortality ratio for geographic category c (city-

or state-level observation) in state i in year t, Urban is an indicator variable for whether the

observation is a city, Post-1937 is an indicator variable equal to zero in the period from 1928 to

1936 and equal to one in the period from 1937 to 1940, and Yeart is a continuous year variable.

Equation (5.7) includes State*Post-1937 fixed effects and allows for differential time trends in

urban areas. Equation (5.8) also includes State* Post-1937 fixed effects interacted with Yeart.

These equations are analogous to those used before, with the treated-disease dummy replaced

with an urban dummy. The hypothesis is that the interactions with Urban and Post-1937 should

be negative (β1 in Equation (5.7) and both β1 and β3 in Equation (5.8)). As the state-level data are

an aggregate of data from cities and from rural areas, the error terms will be correlated across the

state-level and city-level observations within a given state and year. Therefore, we cluster the

standard errors by state-year.

       Table 5 presents the regression results. For both equations, β1 is negative and significant,

suggesting that cities experienced statistically significantly larger declines in maternal mortality

after 1937 compared to rural areas. In addition, in the second model, the slope of the MMR curve

after 1937 is more negative in urban areas (β3 is negative and significant), suggesting that

mortality started to decline faster in cities compared to rural areas after sulfa drugs were

introduced. Panel B again shows that, although the magnitude of these effects changes when the

1935-1937 years are excluded, the substantive conclusions of the analysis do not.



6. Racial differences in the effect of sulfa drugs

       We next compare the effect of sulfa drugs for whites and blacks. A growing literature

posits that new medical technologies may increase inequalities in health because they tend to


                                                25
favor, at least initially, the better off who are more able to access and implement health-related

innovations (Sherry Glied and Adriana Lleras-Muney 2008, Dana P. Goldman and Darius N.

Lakdawalla 2005). More broadly speaking, this idea is the basis of the “fundamental causes”

hypothesis, which posits that socioeconomic (SES) gradients in health arise because those with

higher SES use their greater resources to improve their health (Link et al 1998).

         There are specific reasons to believe that sulfa drugs may have diffused more rapidly

within the white population. During this period, the majority of blacks lived in lower-income

Southern states and in predominantly rural areas, often at far distances from hospitals and

physicians. Hospital segregation policies and greater resources in white facilities further

contributed to lower health care utilization among blacks (Almond et al., 2006).

         In addition, with regard to maternal mortality, the rate of home deliveries by untrained

midwives was still high among black women (and very low among white women) living in the

South during this period, which may have reduced black mothers’ access to sulfa drugs during

and after delivery (Loudon 1992, Almond et al. 2006). Thomasson and Treber (2008) find that in

U.S. cities, greater rates of hospital births were associated with significant and large declines in

MMR for both races after the introduction of sulfa drugs in 1937, but that the effect of hospitals

on MMR in the post-sulfa period was greater for blacks than whites. This may reflect the

relatively worse hospital care received by black mothers in the pre-sulfa drug period.26

         If sulfa drugs diffused more rapidly among whites then blacks, then one should observe

larger and steeper declines in mortality for whites than blacks after sulfa drugs’ introduction in

1937. Figure 6 shows mortality by race for our treated and control diseases from 1920 to 1950.


26
  In their balanced city panel, Thomasson and Treber (2008) find that greater hospitalization of births in the pre-
1937 period lowered MMR for whites only, but the effect was larger in the post-1937 period. However, in their
unbalanced panel, the mortality effects of hospital-based deliveries in the pre-sulfa drug period are insignificant for
both blacks and whites.


                                                        26
There were clear racial disparities in maternal and pneumonia/ influenza mortality throughout the

period. The gap between blacks and whites in MMR was stable from 1925 to 1935 but widened

after 1937 as a result of steeper declines in MMR among whites. Pneumonia/influenza appears to

follow the same pattern, though the evidence of greater gaps after 1937 is not as clear (though

these data are noisy). Somewhat surprisingly, mortality from scarlet fever was higher among

whites than blacks in the pre-sulfa period, which the medical literature has attributed to lower

susceptibility to scarlet fever among blacks (William M. Welch and Jay F. Schamberg 1905).

Nevertheless after 1937, mortality from scarlet fever falls more rapidly for whites, and the black

advantage is greatly diminished. Meanwhile, for the control disease, tuberculosis, there is no

change in either black or white mortality around 1937.27

         We next use regression analysis to estimate the magnitude of post-1937 changes in

mortality for whites and blacks. Using the same difference-in-differences regression approach

outlined in Section 5, we estimate equations 5.5 and 5.6 separately for blacks and whites and

then pool the races and estimate models with race interactions, clustering the standard errors by

disease-year. We use state-level data for this analysis rather than national-level data because by

comparing blacks and whites in the same state, we can hold more factors constant (or closer to

constant) such as the extent of urbanization or the health care system.28 The regressions include

the 18 states in which blacks comprise at least 5% of the total population, which are mostly in

the South.29 The black mortality rate has sizeable measurement error in states that have a small




27
   Interestingly, around 1945 when penicillin becomes available, the decline in tuberculosis mortality accelerates for
whites but not blacks.
28
   The results using national data, which include whites and blacks from all states and use only one observation per
year and disease and race, are qualitatively similar for both models, although the standard errors are larger. Results
available upon request.
29
   These states are Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi,
Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.


                                                       27
black population, and as we are running unweighted regressions, we exclude them to avoid

reducing the precision of the estimates and introducing attenuation bias.

       Table 6 reports the results. Sulfa drugs appear to have caused a 26% decline in MMR for

whites versus a 12% decline for blacks allowing for a level change after 1937, or 42% versus

27% allowing for both a level and slope change. For pneumonia/influenza, our estimates suggest

that sulfa drugs led to a 21% decline in mortality for whites and an 11% decline for blacks, or

35% versus 25% using the second model. For scarlet fever, we find that sulfa drugs had no

statistically significant effect on scarlet fever mortality for blacks, but resulted in a 55-67%

decline in scarlet fever mortality for whites (the effect size is also much smaller for blacks; the

coefficients imply a 13-21% decline).

       To determine whether the differences in the coefficients for blacks and whites are

statistically significant, we pool the race data and estimate fully interacted models. The results

are shown in Panel C of Table 7 and confirm that whites experienced significantly greater

mortality reductions from sulfa drugs than blacks for all of the treated diseases (positive

interaction coefficients imply a smaller decline for blacks than whites). Appendix Table A2

shows that these results are robust to omitting 1935 to 1937 in our estimations.

       Blacks were more likely to live in rural areas in this period, and our urban-rural results in

the previous section suggest that location could be one explanation for why sulfa drugs seemed

to diffuse more slowly among blacks. We do not have data at a disaggregated enough level to

explore this hypothesis in the ideal manner, but we can regress state-level mortality on the

percent black and percent rural in the state. We find that percent black is statistically significant

conditional on percent rural, which suggests the smaller effect of sulfa drugs on black mortality




                                                28
is not just a rural effect and likely reflects segregation policies and the inferiority of the health

care available to blacks. (Results available upon request.)30

         Thus, whites appear to have benefited more from the introduction of sulfa drugs, in line

with previous work that finds that medical innovation increases health gradients, at least initially.

Sulfa drugs are a particularly interesting case because, unlike most life-saving innovations, they

were inexpensive. The full course of medicine cost less than $100 (2009 dollars). This suggests

that factors other than income were the major barrier to accessing medical breakthroughs for

low-SES groups like blacks.



7. Conclusion

         This paper contributes to our understanding of the role that medical advances played in

improving longevity in the first half of the 20th century. Specifically, we examine the effect of

sulfa drugs, whose discovery and rapid diffusion in the 1930s was one of the first major

successes of modern pharmaceutical research. We use time series and difference-in-differences

estimation methods, whereby we compare mortality patterns before and after sulfa drugs were

introduced between treated and control diseases. Our results suggest that sulfa drugs caused

significant mortality declines for the three causes of death included in our analysis: maternal

mortality, pneumonia, and scarlet fever. Sulfa drugs led to a 25-40% decline in maternal

mortality, a 17-36% decline in pneumonia mortality, and a 52-67% decline in scarlet fever

mortality between 1937 and 1943. These findings imply that sulfa drugs reduced age-adjusted


30
  More generally, we investigated whether any state-level factors can explain differences in the adoption of sulfa
drugs across states, where adoption was proxied by the level of mortality decline after 1937. Using our difference-
in-differences setup, we tested for an association between state characteristics—such as income per capita, high
school graduation rates, number of doctors and hospitals per capita, percent of the population in urban areas and
percent black —and mortality declines due to sulfa drugs. Our results were generally inconclusive (in most cases,
not statistically significant and sensitive to specification choice). These results are available upon request.


                                                       29
mortality by at least 2-4% and increased life expectancy at birth by 0.4-0.8 years. Thus, sulfa

drugs had a significant impact on longevity, but most of the longevity gains during this era were

due to other (probably non-medical) factors.

       In addition, sulfa drugs seemed to benefit whites more than blacks, increasing racial

inequality in maternal and pneumonia mortality and almost eliminating the black advantage in

scarlet fever that existed before sulfa drugs became available. These results suggest that sulfa

drugs diffused more rapidly among whites and support the hypothesis that medical innovation

favors high-SES groups, at least initially. This finding is especially striking given that sulfa drugs

were an inexpensive life-saving drug. Thus, one of the policy implications of our findings, which

may be relevant for reducing infectious disease in developing countries today, is that while

inventing and investing in new medical technology could be a promising way to combat disease,

achieving equitable access to that technology may be a challenge, even for cheap and effective

medical breakthroughs.

Notes: In Panel A, national mortality rates are age-adjusted (using the U.S. population in 1940 as the standard),
except for MMR (maternal deaths per 100,000 births). The national and state summary statistics in Panels A and B
are for years and states included in the regression analysis presented in Section 5 and 6. The analysis in Section 5
includes all states; the race analysis in Section 6 includes 18 states with black populations greater than 5% of the
total state population. The state-level MMR data by race is only available for 10 of the 18 states in 1925; mortality
rates for other causes by race are available for 14 of the 18 states in 1925.

Notes: Dependent variable is the first difference of the log mortality rate.
Trend breaks are estimated using the Quandt Likelihood Ratio test for a
single trend break between 1933 and 1942, using age-adjusted mortality
data from 1920 to 1950 for all diseases except MMR. Newey-West
standard errors are used, allowing for autocorrelation in the error term for
up to two lags. The test statistic is the maximal F-statistic from a sequence
of Chow tests for each possible break date in the test window. Critical
values were obtained from Andrews (2003).

Notes: Treated diseases refer to maternal mortality, pneumonia/flu, and scarlet fever. Tuberculosis serves as
the control disease. Estimates are based on 1925 to 1943 state-level mortality data. Only states with black
populations greater than or equal to 5% of the total population in 1936 are included (18 states for MMR and
pneumonia/influenza models). In three states, MMR data by race are available four years later than
pneumonia/influenza and scarlet fever data by race, which results in a total of 8 fewer state/year/race
observations in the MMR models for each race. In the scarlet fever models, six states are dropped from the
analysis due to a large proportion of year/state observations with zero mortality for blacks. In Panels A and B,
Model (1) includes the main effect of Treated, state*post fixed effects, a continuous year variable, and its
interaction with Treated; Model (2) additionally includes state*post fixed effects and their interaction with the
continuous year variable. In Panel C, Models (1) and (2) include each of the same variables as in the previous
panels plus their interaction with Black. Robust standard errors, clustered by disease-year, are in parentheses.

Notes: Treated diseases refer to maternal mortality, pneumonia/flu, and scarlet fever. Tuberculosis serves as
the control disease. Estimates are based on 1925 to 1943 state-level mortality data. Only states with black
populations greater than or equal to 5% of the total population in 1936 are included (18 states for MMR and
pneumonia/influenza models). In three states, MMR data by race are available four years later than
pneumonia/influenza and scarlet fever data by race, which results in a total of 8 fewer state/year/race
observations in the MMR models for each race. In the scarlet fever models, six states are dropped from the
analysis due to a large proportion of year/state observations with zero mortality for blacks. In Panels A and B,
Model (1) includes the main effect of Treated, state*post fixed effects, a continuous year variable, and its
interaction with Treated; Model (2) additionally includes state*post fixed effects and their interaction with the
continuous year variable. In Panel C, Models (1) and (2) include the same variables as in the previous panels
plus their interaction with Black. Robust standard errors, clustered by disease-year, are in parentheses.
