The received view pins the adoption of labor regulation before 1914 on domestic forces. Using directed
dyad-year event history analysis, we find that trade was also a pathway of diffusion. Market access
served as an important instrument to encourage a level playing field. The type of trade mattered as
much as the volume. In the European core, states emulated the labor regulation of partners because
intraindustry trade was important. The New World exported less differentiated products and pressures
to imitate were weak.

       This paper brings a fresh coat to shopworn questions in political economy: what explains the

adoption of labor legislation across a large and disparate group of countries in a brief time span

before 1914, and why did the Old World see more intervention than the New, a phenomenon that

has persisted into the early twenty-first century? The standard explanation situates the origins of the

regulatory state in a confluence of domestic factors that included the rise of per capita incomes, the

extension of the vote, and demands for social reform of labor organizations and pressure groups,

even those led by employers. But rich and poor countries, and the most and least democratic states,

adopted similar laws before 1914. Our explanation is that domestic and international factors jointly

mattered in the diffusion of social policy. 1 While others have given priority to learning from

neighbors and emulation of social norms, in this paper we identify trade flows between countries—

the nuts and bolts of globalization—as pathways in the cross-border movement of social policy.2

       The crux of our argument is that international integration prompted states to emulate the

stricter laws of major trading partners. The type of trade mattered as much as the volume. In the

European core, intraindustry trade was important. If states failed to imitate the legislation of

trading partners they would have exposed themselves to embargos on exports and terms of trade

shocks. In the New World, states were not compelled to adopt laws of major partners because

world demand and supply determined prices of their less differentiated exports and, consequently,

threats of market loss were not credible.

       The complementary relation between trade and social protection stands in opposition to

frequent claims, espoused in the first wave of globalization and echoed in the second, that

competitive forces drive labor standards down in a race to the bottom. Our findings suggest that,

even in the absence of international authorities like the World Trade Organization coordinating

strategies and responses, decentralized forces promoted convergence in worker protection.

Market access served as an important instrument to encourage the diffusion of labor regulations,

and farsighted policymakers recognized that emulating partners’ laws would serve to bolster

trade. This is not to imply that there was a race to the top in which one country leapfrogged

another in the adoption of restrictive laws. Nor was it the case that states mimicked exactly the

regulations of others. And states could delay emulating laws that imposed significant costs.

Nonetheless, over the period, a rising tide in legislation swept countries upward and together. 3

       Our methodology is based on models of policy diffusion applied, most recently, to the

spread of environmental protection and health care provision across jurisdictions. 4 In contrast to

standard country-year event history analysis, we focus on convergence in policy between pairs

(or dyads) during particular years. This setup naturally allows for a clear demarcation of the

relative weights of internal factors, like the extension of the vote, and external pressures, such as

trade, for each pair of countries. To be clear, the issue of adaptation—the effect of regulation on

labor market outcomes—requires a different methodology and is beyond the scope of this paper.

       Our research strategy responds to our conception of social policy formation in an

interdependent world. The standard approach begins with the local interests of key protagonists,

firms, sectors, or factors of production, whose preferences toward policy are defined by their

location relative to others in the international economy; in the next phase, domestic institutions

and politicians, whose objective may be to maximize support, broker competing interests and

determine policy; in the final stage, the state, as if it were a unitary actor, brings these outcomes

to the international level. Our view, which is in the spirit of studies in “open economy politics,”

captures the likelihood that causality also runs in the other direction, from international

institutions and pressures to domestic interests. 5 In this case, states do not take domestic and

foreign interests as given, because the international context structures bargaining and affects

outcomes relevant to constituents. Since states must contend with a complex and shifting

amalgam of interests, they are anything but unitary actors. Robert Putnam put the problem

simply: “Domestic politics and international relations are somehow often entangled. It is fruitless

to debate whether domestic politics really determine international relations or the reverse. The

answer to that question is clearly both sometimes.” 6

               LABOR REGULATION: RECEIVED VIEWS AND BASIC DATA

       At the most basic level, the widely accepted view is that labor laws were the stepchild of

development, “the consequences,” Stanley Engerman wrote, “of higher national income, with

accompanying changing preferences regarding work time and work arrangements as income

rose.” 7 In the popular power resources model, the leading protagonists are the spread of the

franchise and the rise of organized labor. Comparative approaches have built on national

histories, juxtaposing domestic factors of one country against another. 8 The common

denominator in this body of research is that regulation was a closed economy affair.

       Curiously, the basic data reveal only a weak correspondence between income and voice

and the adoption of labor laws. Table 1 gives dates of introduction of five major pieces of

legislation for a broad sample of Old and New World countries. Putting aside issues of data

availability, we have selected these regulations as representative of contemporary demands to

protect children and women, improve factory conditions, and provide some form of compensation

in case of workplace accidents. 9 The last two columns give GDP per capita in 1900 and average

voter turnout in 1890-1900. Among Old World countries, the dispersion of income was large, as

was voter turnout, but even the poorest and least democratic countries, Bulgaria, Italy, Portugal,

Russia, and Spain, had several laws on the books. In the New World, Canada was relatively

wealthy and had a large male electorate, but it was a laggard compared to Europe; Mexico after

the revolution had pretty much the same level of regulation. 10 The calendar of adoption was also

inconsistent with the income and voice model. Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom

were early movers, but beginning in the 1880s any systematic ordering is difficult to detect. 11

       Figure 1 presents a competing perspective on the spread of labor laws showcasing their

diffusion over a narrow time frame. The adoption of minimum age legislation of 12 years traces a

classic S-shaped logistic curve, a pattern representative of other laws in Table 1, and similar to that

which has been documented for the diffusion of democracy and economic and social policies, from

Keynesianism to neo-liberalism, across a range of countries in the late twentieth century.12 The first

movers behind age limits, Germany and Switzerland, were decidedly early. For this precocious

club, regulation may have had different origins than for countries in the middle years. This phase,

which had no obvious leader, saw the bulk of adoptions in small and large, and poor and rich

countries alike— even the U.K. in 1901. In the last period, adoptions leveled off and were restricted

chiefly to latecomers in the periphery. The pattern of diffusion gives us pause to reconsider the

widely held view that situates the rise of labor regulation as a chapter of national history only.

       To be sure, historians have not ruled out the interdependence of domestic and international

factors. Learning from neighbors—and rivals—and emulation of norms regarding women’s and

children’s employment precipitated a “transfer in social technology.” 13 In the classic example of the

demonstration effect, Lloyd George was full of praise for Germany’s social programs after his visit

to the continent in 1908, the year before he introduced unemployment insurance legislation in

London. 14 Apart from these exchanges, transnational epistemic communities emerged late in the

century. Founded in 1900, the International Association of Labour Legislation (IALL) coordinated

research on working conditions and evolved into a well-organized pressure group for the

harmonization of labor standards. 15 According to its historian, Daniel Rodgers, blueprints flowed

across the Atlantic, and in both directions, the reform ideals of Henry George outpopularized those

of the Webbs, let alone Marx. 16 The trouble with this line of argument is that the establishment of

information channels does not explain how beliefs were translated into policy, the presumption

being that regulation was adopted because of ideas in the ‘air’.17 It remains unclear which ideas

were persuasive and under what circumstances the new body of legislation was adopted, especially

in countries where membership in communities in support of legislation was small. 18

A Closer Look at the Data

       It may well be that the data in Table 1 cannot bear the weight of our argument. Any

international comparison is flawed because the laws by their very nature were not identical across

jurisdictions, owing to differences in coverage, application, and compliance. To minimize

differences, we chose standards established at the international conference on labor legislation

held in Berlin in 1890, the midpoint in our period of study. 19 The federal structures of the New

World and Germany and Switzerland complicate issues of comparability because sub-national

authorities held responsibility for labor legislation. While Canadian provinces and Australian

colonies and states passed legislation within short delays of neighbors, there were substantial

differences in dates of adoption and in the heterogeneity of laws across U.S. jurisdictions. 20 To

adjust for this, the table gives two dates for the introduction of each piece of legislation in the

U.S. The first when ten states achieved the level set at Berlin, and a second, in parentheses, when

the ten most populated states achieved this norm.

       Notwithstanding these drawbacks, Table 1 is a meaningful point of departure to study

adoption across countries. At the most practical level, when the U.S., the most troublesome country

in our sample, is omitted in the analysis that follows all our results go through. 21 Across national

and sub-national units, many dimensions of the laws tended to converge after their passage. The

same pressures promoting international diffusion of the basic laws would have also affected the

various dimensions of these laws. Table 2 reports the number of factory inspectors per

establishment, some specifics of restrictions on women’s night work, age limits for children, and

the actual contributions employers paid out for accident compensation (measured as a percentage of

the wage bill). Even before pressures to harmonize labor regulations that can be traced to the

establishment of the International Labor Organization in 1919, dispersion across these dimensions

was remarkably small—a testament to the forces of convergence in policy that we will describe

below. There is only one obvious outlier in the table: the factory inspectorate in Italy was poorly

staffed, a finding entirely consistent with contemporary observation and gives credence to the other

values in the Table 2.

         Finally, we restrict our use of Table 1 to study international diffusion. How workers and

firms responded to labor regulation is a different question that requires another methodology and

other types of information. 22 Consider the interdependent world of 1914 facing support-

maximizing politicians. Their objective was to supply benefits to concentrated constituencies

while diffusing costs as much as possible. To reduce the burden on their own constituents,

policymakers would have prevailed upon partners to level the playing field. Under certain

circumstances—and we consider this possibility below—countries may have had legislation

imposed on them, regardless of local labor market conditions and how domestic forces lined up in

support of or in opposition to regulation. The upshot is that domestic and foreign reform agendas

were entangled. At some level, adoption and adaptation were related, but Table 1 serves as a

starting point because it provides the timetable we need to study policy diffusion in an

interconnected world.

             INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND THE RISE OF LABOR REGULATION

         In today’s global economy, the claim is, national authorities care what social and economic

policies get adopted elsewhere because they want to keep their exports competitive, contain

imports, and keep their home markets open to foreign investment. Of course, in the long term,

certain regulations may increase the capabilities of local workforces, but policymakers are driven

by short-run considerations, and assume rivals vie for a fixed quantity of trade or investment.

Polices adopted to harmonize markets across jurisdictions have tended to weaken local controls.

Everywhere, the argument goes, global competition has unleashed a race to the bottom in all

types and dimensions of regulation.

     For the U.S., see Fishback, “Progressive Era.”
                                                                                                  10

      The late nineteenth century, the heyday of globalization, saw comparable competitive

pressures. Bismarck, for one, asserted that “[a] normal workday could be established for

Germany alone, if Germany were surrounded by a Chinese wall and were economically self-

sufficient.” 23 The Chancellor rejected demands to incorporate labor legislation in Germany’s

advanced program of social entitlements. Exploiting similar reasoning, the Swiss National

Council, despite the early leadership of several cantons in policy adoption, delayed passage of the

first set of federal labor laws in the early 1870s. The association of cotton textile employers had

lobbied against proposals for limits on hours in order to preserve foreign and domestic markets. 24

Bending to employers, the Swiss government did not move ahead with protective legislation.

Others have found direct evidence of a downward spiral in labor regulation. In 1891, Finland

extended the length of the work day of minors (aged 12-14 years) to 8.5 hours from the level of

6.5 fixed in 1889, after its export firms found they had lost their competitive edge to rivals.

Following the decision of its neighbor to loosen standards, Sweden reciprocated and lengthened

the working day of 13 year olds from 6 to 10 hours 25 For the U.S., Jacob Hacker and Paul

Pierson claimed that capital’s threat to divest locally and move their enterprises across state

borders stunted, if not delayed, the development of the welfare state. 26 Canada, in turn, postponed

legislation to limit women’ s work to meet the competitive North American environment. 27

      There is an opposing way to conceptualize the role of competition. Countries imported and

exported labor standards as they did goods. Globalization, in this view, was an effective deterrent

and not the cause of a race to the bottom. Kyle Bagwell and Robert Staiger developed a model in

which countries are motivated to preserve market access, the combined shares of exports they

have acquired in foreign markets and of imports they have come to accept. 28 A country that

unilaterally raises its labor standards will find its domestic market more vulnerable to imports and

its exports less competitive, since adopting stricter laws is the equivalent of reducing trade

barriers. Bagwell and Staiger empower any country in the WTO, as set in GATT Article XXIII,

to impose sanctions on trading partners that fail to reciprocate because they have reneged on

raising labor standards or lowering tariffs. There is no presumption labor standards will be

harmonized internationally, only that the newly established level of regulation will preserve

market access, thus giving politicians’ discretion to raise standards as they see fit.

         In the absence of international oversight before 1914, states had other options to level the

playing field. They could threaten import restrictions on selected products of trading partners; fail

to renew or abrogate commercial treaties and most-favored-nation clauses; or, in extreme cases,

initiate trade wars to cut off competitors’ entry into their markets. 29 The threat of market loss was

credible in established and thick trading networks, like the bulk of countries grouped in the

middle period of Figure 1. Conversely, low degrees of integration reduced the ability to enforce

labor standards, and there were also latecomers at the tail of the logistic curve, the handful of

countries that did not play by the rules or did not know them, and which were more likely to

defect. International associations used soft coercion or moral suasion on these countries, but in

the absence of sanctions the incentive to cooperate was weak.

         The distinction between intersectoral and intraindustry trade is relevant to the history of

labor regulation because countries that sold differentiated goods were more susceptible to

retaliation if they did not adopt the standards of their chief markets. While the hallmark trade in

the period was exchange between the resource-abundant New World and labor-abundant Old,

trade in manufacturing was sizeable within the European core. 30 In the iconic world industry,

cotton textiles, Europe was the foremost producer and largest consumer. Differentiation was

based on type of machinery used, ring or mule spindles, quality and treatment of cotton fibers,

and the final dressing and preparation of goods. 31 Many producers were dependent on restricted

outlets, for instance Belgium on France, and Italy on France and Germany, and found themselves

exposed to threats of market loss. Certainly, manufacturers could have modified or upgraded

products to find new customers, but, in the short run, if states did not acquiesce to demands for a

level playing field, they would have had to dump their goods at steep discounts. 32

       Table 3 presents a snapshot of trading networks in cotton and woolen textiles, and silk and

lace manufacture, for several European countries in 1913. 33 Column 12 gives the share of each

country’s exports of manufactured items sold in Europe; 65 percent of the total value of

production had European outlets. The last column gives country shares of all items exported to

other European destinations, while the bottom row gives the share of imports. The U.K.,

Germany, the Netherlands, and, by this date, Switzerland had developed commercial networks to

sell goods abroad, but for all exporters destinations in Europe retained importance. Many

producers were dependent on restricted outlets, for instance Belgium on France, and Italy on

France and Germany, and found themselves exposed to threats of market loss.

       Again the Swiss experience is illustrative. Recall it was reluctant to adopt limits on hours,

fearing the loss of export markets if it introduced legislation ahead of major partners. Germany

   The shares of inter- and intraindustry exchanges in world trade remained roughly stable between 1870 and 1914.

   Big countries had the advantage of discriminating between home and foreign markets. Providing a textbook study of
unfair trade practices, Belgian woolen manufacturers accused German firms of pricing exports lower than identical
goods sold in their home market—a practice contemporaries called ‘le dumping’. Since their domestic market was
small, the Belgians were unable to reciprocate (Mahaim, “La conference de Berne”).

and France did introduce limits on women’s work in 1891 and 1892. As it happens, the French

National Assembly had initiated an inquiry into compulsory accident compensation in 1893, and

opponents claimed that exporters and import-competing industries would not be able to pass on

the increased costs. 34 The timing of the reform debate was propitious. Rejecting France’s offer of

the minimum rates in the Méline tariff schedule, in exchange for import concessions, Switzerland

initiated a trade war. 35 French exports fell, but the conflict was relatively more costly for

Switzerland. 36 It could not find alternative outlets for its major exports to France, high-end cotton

textiles and silks, clocks, and specialty cheeses. The French had an incentive to prolong the

conflict since it provided the import-competing sector a respite to adjust to the new reforms. It

was the Swiss who backed down first. Even before the end of the trade war in 1894, Switzerland

agreed to restrictions on night work and an 11-hour working day for women.

       Trade wars were costly for all parties. By the early 1900s, states put aside the stick of

retaliation for the carrot of conciliation. Policymakers realized that attempts to level the playing

field did not have to come at the expense of trade between partners. The vehicle was bilateral

labor accords, early versions of labor and environmental clauses in late twentieth-century trade

agreements. Table 4 gives some examples of labor treaties negotiated from 1880 until 1914.

Initially, states discriminated in the delivery of social protection; for instance, foreign or guest-

workers, were not eligible to receive accident compensation, which inevitably gave rise to an

incentive to reduce benefits for nationals. The early bilateral accords, which assured the

reciprocal treatment of native and foreign workers, were conceived as backstops against a

potential unraveling in labor standards. These accords served to standardize the coverage and

application of labor laws as reported in Table 2, and although they often revolved around single

items, the expectation was, as stated clearly in the Germany and Austria-Hungary accord of 1905,

that a “broader” harmonization of legislation would follow. 37

       There was also a commercial dimension. Belgian authorities were persuaded that its 1897

accord with France dealing with workers’ savings would strengthen commercial relations and

preempt retaliatory trade practices. 38 Beginning with the Franco-Italian labor accord of 1904,

which we examine in a later section, agreements were explicitly designed to strengthen bilateral

trade. Many of the signatories had previously negotiated most favored nation treaties as indicated

in the last column of the table. 39 The spike in labor accords in the years after 1904 coincided with

the clustering of MFN treaties and the decline in tariffs in the subsequent decade. Germany

initiated accords with its partners, exploiting strategically its high tariffs to negotiate increased

access to its markets in exchange for better foreign labor protection. 40 The link between labor and

commercial treaties reinforced the stepwise movement in adoption traced in Figure 1. Countries

would raise levels of regulation because their trading partners had done so. But the added

incentive was that as it raised its labor regulation to the level of its partner, it gained market

access in countries that had MFN arrangements with the latter.

       Both episodes of retaliation and negotiation were infrequent in the New World since

domestic concerns trumped external pressures. Regions of recent settlement mainly exported

foods and raw materials whose prices were fixed in world markets. The pressure to comply with

   We are grateful to Robert Pahre for providing us access to his commercial treaty data set. Many of the accords were
unconditional MFNs. See Pahre, Politics and Trade, pp. 157-76. Irwin, (“Multilateral and Bilateral Trade,” p. 454),
referred to MFN agreements as “progressive bilateralism” because they promoted multi-party accords and did not divert
trade. The clustering of bilateral labor accords fits this model.
40
   France and Germany, high-tariff countries, actively negotiated bilateral agreements. Lampe, (“Nineteenth Century
Bilateralism”), found that high-tariff states were more prone than low-tariff countries to cooperate in the Cobden-
Chevalier era. Later in the century, Pahre, (Politics and Trade, pp. 204-46), reported that smaller countries were less
likely to cooperate, and tariff treaties more likely to be stable if foreign tariffs were initially high.

standards of major trading partners was less keen, because exporters could shift outlets without

severe loss. Canada’s wheat exports did not contract when Germany launched a trade war

between 1903 and 1910 to protest Ottawa’s preferential agreement with London; in fact, it was

the U.K. that feared collateral damage. 41 Exceptionally, by 1914 the U.S. exported manufactured

goods, although these were mainly standardized items. 42 Anyway, international trade played a

small role in total production in the U.S. Overall, the New World was insulated from external

pressures to emulate the European model. Trade patterns reinforced the primacy of domestic

factors in areas of recent settlement. There was a structural disconnect in the New World between

commercial access negotiated at the national level and labor laws passed by sub-national

jurisdictions. In some regions, like Australia, labor power in key states was strong enough to use

the ballot box to see through legislation, but it was difficult to mount the same force in North

America. The aphorism that all politics is local was appropriate to the New World.

THE DECISION TO ADOPT: TESTING FOR DOMESTIC AND EXTERNAL FORCES

       To study policy convergence we implement a directed dyad-year event history analysis.

The unit of analysis is the country-pair-year (or dyad-year). We seek to explain why country “A”

converges to the labor standards already adopted by another country “B”. Convergence does not

imply that policymakers emulate exactly the other country in the dyad. The dichotomous

dependent variable takes on the value one if country A adopts at least one out the five labor

standards (Table 1), given that B had already adopted that (those) particular standard(s) prior to

the current year, and zero otherwise..43 When A converges to all standards in B, this particular

dyad is dropped from the sample, since no further convergence is possible.

       A pair of countries can be present up to two times in each year since the order of adoption

for each country adopted may not have been the same across labor laws. We found that just over

50 percent of the ‘emulations’ in the data are associated with convergence to a standard

previously adopted by five or fewer countries. The number of leaders in our sample period is

restricted by definition, and as a result most countries were followers in the diffusion process. To

be clear, our procedure is inappropriate to explain fully why country B was in fact the first mover.

Our primary interest is the transmission of policy between trade partners.

      The directed dyad approach improves on the standard country-year event history model

because it includes information on interaction effects between neighbors or trading partners and

common features of the country pairs. In event history models, external factors are usually

weighted-averages of arbitrarily defined ‘neighbors’, or other countries comprising the reference

group. Our approach also permits countries to be leaders and followers over different policies and

in different country pairs. To be sure, some degree of sample selection is unavoidable because B

only appears when it has adopted at least one of the five pieces of legislation. For sample

selection to force a change in the sign of a marginal effect, A’s “error term” would have to be

strongly correlated with B’s. The selection problem increases in severity as the correlation

between the included explanatory variables and B’s error term becomes greater. We return to

these issues below.

       Our control variables consist of external and internal determinants of labor standards. For

trade integration, we use the measure of trade costs developed by David Jacks, Christopher

43
   This procedure avoids jointly estimating the probability that country A imitates B and the probability of B adopting a
labor standard. Boehmke, “Policy Evaluation.” There are no cases where a country adopts and then gives up a particular
standard.

Meissner, and David Novy. The measure is related to the (geometric average of) bilateral trade

shares of GDP, but it is derived explicitly from trade theory and is more precisely evaluated. 44

We invert the trade shares to obtain the tariff equivalent. In effect, the term measures the wedge

between observed bilateral trade and that predicted by size alone, which would be the key driver

in a world without barriers to trade. The variable is strongly related to observable proxies for

barriers to trade including tariffs, transportation networks, exchange rate variability, and language

differences. The measure for year t is calculated as

                                                                1

The variables xAA and xBB are proxies for intra-national trade, or domestic absorption, and xAB and

xBA represent total exports from country A to country B and exports from B to A. The parameter σ

is the elasticity of substitution between all goods, domestic and foreign (and foreign vs foreign),

and is assumed to be equal to 11. 45 The term can be interpreted as the extent to which foreign

trade is more costly than domestic trade; it falls as countries trade more together. The estimated

coefficient will have a negative sign if increased trade encourages A to adopt B’s policy.

       The baseline model includes the share of the labor force in agriculture of country A to

control for the level of development, and also wealth and size (the logarithms of GDP and

population) of each country in a pair. Central to Engerman’s claim, A’s demand for labor

trade costs was 23 percent. See also Jacks, Meissner, and Novy, “Trade Costs in the First Wave.”
45
   The level of trade costs depends on the elasticity of substitution. There is no evidence to that the elasticity varied
across countries in the aggregate and evidence for more recent periods suggests preference parameters are constant over
time. The parameter is a scaling factor, with a consensus estimate of eight. Arguably, during the nineteenth century
goods were less differentiated and, hence, more substitutable. Our assumption is equivalent to a factory gate markup of
10 percent over the marginal cost of production.

regulation would have risen with income per capita (a positive marginal effect of GDP for a fixed

level of population). But larger countries faced weaker external pressures. They may have been

less prone to imitate neighbors because they naturally traded less internationally and were more

shielded from foreign competition. A proportional increase in GDP and population (an increase in

size) would have lowered the likelihood of adoption. We include real GDP and population of

country B to identify the roles of wealth and size in policy diffusion and emulation: was A more

willing to adopt if B was big or rich?

      The other determinants follow from previous discussion. Union density and voter turnout,

the ratio of persons actually voting to the adult population (of the relevant enfranchised gender),

stand in for the key determinants of the power resources model. Since convergence may have

differed across regions, a dummy variable indicates whether country A is in the New World or

not. We have also included an interaction variable between the presence of a New World country

and voter turnout. This variable disentangles the roles of resources and political economy factors

behind regulation. The decision to adopt might have also been dependent on the number of

standards already in place, measured by the total number of laws (out of the five considered) A

and B shared in the prior year.

      The sample in the baseline regression consists of information on the adoption of five

standards in 17 countries, across a maximum of 16 partners, and for the 33 years from 1881 to

1913. The exact number of observations per country depends on the length of time required to

converge on a partner’s law, and the number of standards and dates of adoption of each partner.

Countries in the baseline sample (and occasions they initially appear as a follower/leader) are:

Argentina (14/0), Australia (5/6), Austria (5/12), Belgium (14/13), Canada (12/10), Denmark

(11/9), France (6/15), Germany (2/15), Italy (10/8), the Netherlands (10/14), Norway (13/14),

Portugal (15/2), Spain (15/7), Sweden (11/11), Switzerland (10/10), United Kingdom (11/16),
                                                                                                                        19

and the United States (14/14). All countries behaved as followers and leaders which underscores

the basic problem we explore: what drove pairs of countries to converge on labor laws? 46

       Table 5 gives results of a series of logit regressions for the policy convergence model. We

report average marginal effects. Standard errors are clustered at the country pair level (regardless

of whether a country is located in position A or B) to correct for potential bias in the errors

arising from arbitrary forms of serial correlation over time. 47 In the baseline specification of

column 1, which includes all relevant independent variables, the trade cost marginal effect is

negative and significant. Trade was a conduit of convergence. Contrary to claims, international

competition did not lead to a downward cascade in social and labor policy. Wealthier, larger, or

more democratic countries were not more likely to play leadership roles. It would appear that the

impact of Germany’s advanced legislation on British policy had as much to do with Lloyd’s

George storied visit to a large country as with the fact that the two were major trading partners.

       In the baseline regression, domestic factors in A, with the exception of union density, have

the expected signs, though their impact was not significant. The positive marginal effects of A’s

GDP (p-value 0.40) and population (p-value 0.94) are insignificant. The natural logarithm of

GDP per capita (entered as a single variable in a separate unreported specification) has a positive

but statistically insignificant marginal effect (p-value 0.32). The overall size of A was

unimportant. Proportionally increasing GDP and population did not lead to a change in the

probability of convergence. If we cannot detect that large and democratic countries were leaders,

neither were small countries followers.




46
  Excluding Germany from our sample does not affect the estimated results.
47
  In unreported regressions, we clustered standard errors over all country A observations in a particular year to account
for correlation within years across a country’s decision to adopt its partners standards. Results do not differ from those
of the baselines in columns 1 and 2.
                                                                                                                   20

       The salience of domestic and international factors varied across regions. In the Old World,

voter turnout, while positive, is not significant. Our interpretation is that domestic voice was not

sufficient to achieve the goals of social activists, although it may have interacted with other

internal or external forces to advance the reform agenda. In one scenario, capital in B would have

sought to form cross-border and cross-class coalitions with labor and reformers in A to level the

playing field. These types of pressures may be captured in the trade costs term itself. Putting

aside this explanation, the dynamic was different in the New World. Countries were less prone to

converge, but sufficiently high levels of voter turnout offset the obstacles to regulation posed by

the region’s specialization in primary products and other idiosyncrasies.

       The sign of union density may appear to be counterintuitive, but worker organization was

strongly correlated with the presence of a New World country. 48 Other studies have reported a

positive relation between the share of population above 65 and social spending, a finding repeated

in column 1, although the marginal effect is statistically insignificant. Older workers were less

mobile than younger ones and more dependent on social entitlements. Populations were younger

in the New World thus deepening the divergence between regions.

       Countries with relatively weaker sets of labor laws were more prone to adopt. The negative

sign on the lagged number of shared standards has, at least, two interpretations. Stragglers may

have wanted to signal to residents and foreigners their willingness to move toward the new

international norm of greater regulation, albeit at a slower pace; alternatively, they may have

adopted legislation later than others because the cost of doing so was less. 49



48
   The New World indicator actually rises in absolute value in the short baseline in column 2 which omits unionization
rates.
49
   According to Von Laue (“Factory Inspection,” p. 348), Russia “stood ahead of public opinion of employers and
workers,” upgrading labor standards to attract more foreign investment and in the anticipation of securing new export
markets. By the late 1890s, Von Laue added, Russia “had a set of laws more enlightened than those of France or the
United States.”
                                                                                                      21

         Did countries with common features have the same regulatory outcomes? Neither

differences in GDP nor turnout had a perceptible effect. We cannot conclude, as did Markus

Lampe and Robert Pahre in separate studies of MFNs, that democracies were any more prone to

emulate each other than autocracies. 50 We also consider in the baseline whether close neighbors

were more likely to copy each other. The answer is mixed. A common border actually exerted

pressure to diverge, but a smaller distance between capitals implied a greater chance in adopting a

similar labor standard. Emulation effects, derived from culture—common language and legal

origins, and shared histories—cannot be excluded even after controlling for trade relations.

         In the remaining columns, we explore the robustness of these findings. We exclude

unionization, agricultural share of the labor force, age distribution, differences in turnout and

income per capita, and geographical variables. These variables did not prove to be robust

determinants, and, in the short baseline of column 2, the trade cost coefficient actually increases

in significance. The geographical variables are highly collinear with trade costs as the literature

on trade and gravity models shows. The income and turnout differences are essentially controlled

for already since A and B’s respective levels are entered separately. The other structural variables

are poorly measured across the sample and we are hesitant to rely on them further.

         Columns 3 and 4 compare estimates of an Old World only sample and another which

restricts country A to being in the New World. For European pairs, the results are in line with

column 1. The dynamic was different in the New World: the trade cost term is positive but not

significant, and the marginal effect of voter turnout is statistically significant. Recall Rodgers’

claim that reform blueprints flowed between continents; trade, however. does not appear to have

been the conduit of transmission to the Americas and Australia. Voice was the main channel of

policy diffusion in the region. In line with our previous discussion, local forces trumped global

pressures in regions of new settlement.

      Column 5 controls for (time-invariant) unobservable heterogeneity at the level of country A

with a conditional logit model. GDP and population of B are now significant. GDP of A, which is

strongly persistent and presumably highly correlated with country fixed effects, is estimated to

have no statistically significant impact on convergence. The high correlation between fixed

factors and GDP shows up in the sign on the coefficient which is opposite to that in column 1.

Regardless of specification, the effect of trade costs is robust, confirming the rising tide in labor

standards as nations sought to keep up with levels of regulation provided by trading partners.

Figure 2 summarizes the baseline result. For each year we give the total number of labor laws

adopted. The maximum for the 18 countries in the sample is 90. We also track the decline in trade

costs. The decline in trade costs was steep beginning in the 1880s, as was the rise in the number

of adoptions rapid. Greater trade integration went hand in hand with convergence in social

protection.

Alternative Models of Labor Standards

      Our model and empirical evidence have several potential problems. The procedure we have

exploited may be restricted to policy adjustments, for instance the tweaking of current minimum

age law in A to meet levels in B, as opposed to converging on new policies having no history

between the pair. But states in our sample had previous interactions on immigration, commercial,

and foreign policies, and in other ways like legal systems they were not far apart. In light of

broader historical and political interconnections, countries can be seen to be fine-tuning along an

existing dimension of contact. We may have omitted some key determinants of convergence or

measured incorrectly other variables. In the appendix, we report results using an alternate
                                                                                                                     23

measure of political competition that substantiates the baseline results But the inclusion of other

indicators, like a new measure of political competition, substantiates the baseline results.

       Our procedure may be flawed if we have not properly controlled for the sample selection

problem because only pairs where B has already adopted one or more standards are included,

thereby leaving out information for a number of dyads. The loss of information is attenuated

since a country not appearing as B will likely show up as A; that said, a fraction of observations

remains ineligible to converge and, hence, excluded from the estimation sample. 51 Bias in the

marginal effects of the convergence equation depends on whether or not unobservables in country

A that may have helped determine its decision to follow B were correlated with the latter’s

unobservables, and the extent to which included covariates in the convergence equation

determine the probability of B adopting. The impact of the selection bias depends on the degree

of correlation that is, arguably, not too great in our large sample. Concretely, the wave of

adoptions in the short-time frame beginning in the 1880s created a large number of countries with

the potential of being emulated. Finally, to address the problem of correlation in error terms, we

control for as many observables as possible for A and B.

       In the appendix, we report results for two tests of the effects of missing pairs and of

correlation in error terms. First, we estimate a country-year event history analysis which performs

poorly both in terms of domestic and international forces. Second, a Heckman selection

correction for a probit model of convergence cannot reject the null that there is no correlation

between the error terms of the convergence equation and the determinants of B adopting one or

more standards, and hence eligible to be included in the sample or not. Overall, it appears there is

  In the entire sample of 11,286 dyads, 21 percent of the cases are eliminated because country B has no standard to be
emulated.

little evidence that missing information and sample selection issues are driving the baseline

findings on convergence.

                                 BRINGING UP THE LATECOMERS

      The pressure to emulate at the tail of the logistic curve in Figure 1 was weak because

countries were not well integrated in trade networks, or, because as latecomers in development,

domestic forces in support of reform had not yet coalesced. The IALL spearheaded the

transnational movement to level the playing field. The Belgians and Swiss were key players in

founding the IALL in Paris in 1900, since, by themselves, small states had less leverage to coerce

trading rivals than larger ones. The powers of the IALL were limited, however, to soft coercion

and no procedure was put in place to ensure ratification. Still, attendance at the occasional

conferences grew in the decade before the outbreak of war. 52 Most European governments in our

sample sent delegates—the U.S. sent an observer to the first meeting—and although they were

not completely persuaded by reformers, states became attuned to new social norms of worker

protection that were being circulated. In the decade after the creation of the IALL, Italy, Portugal,

Spain, and Sweden, all latecomers to the reform movement, prohibited night work of women.

      There is modest statistical support for the role of the IALL as a purveyor of ideas. The

quinqeunnial controls in the baseline estimations suggest a higher propensity of emulation later in

the period, a change in trend coinciding with the emergence of a vocal and organized movement

for international harmonization. Column 6 in Table 3 tests for the role of international coercion

more directly. We include dummy variables if both countries A and B attended IALL conferences

in 1901 (Basel), 1905 (Berne), and 1913 (Zurich and Berne). 53 We find attendance at all three

meetings is related to a higher likelihood of adoption, although only for 1901 was it significant.

The effects of the 1905 and 1913 conferences may be poorly estimated because the primary

objective of the later meetings was to harmonize the dimensions of existing labor regulation, as

most counties had some laws on the books by this period.

       There were substantial costs involved in negotiating multiparty agreements and all states,

even those which could easily meet the criteria set out, were wary of the diktats of a transnational

body. States had little reason to ratify IALL conventions because the penalty or reward for doing

so was small. After 1900, states negotiated bilateral labor accords which, as we previously

described, ensured reciprocal commitments to level the playing field. The accords gave

policymakers greater control over the reform agenda. Moreover, because accords were linked to

market access, states had a motive to promote and abide by them. The intuition was clearly laid

out by the German Minister of the Interior in parliamentary discussion on Imperial commercial

social and policy in 1902. Since import tariffs had reduced the purchasing power of workers, the

degree of further commercial protection available to manufacturers was limited. Better to

persuade commercial rivals to raise levels of social protection. “If we and our neighbors agree to

common charges for worker protection, we will be able to lower our commercial duties. We

should consider rivals which raise their levels of protection favorably.” 54 Exploiting strategically

its higher tariffs, Germany exchanged increased access in its own market for greater labor

protection abroad. 55 Germany had come to reject Bismarck’s formulation of a “Chinese wall” in

defense of social policy; instead, labor regulations and economic integration were now perceived

   In the Cobden-Chevalier era, Lampe (“Nineteenth Century Bilateralism”) found that high-tariff states were more
likely to cooperate than low-tariff jurisdictions. Pahre (Politics and Trade, pp. 204-46) reported that smaller countries in
the decades before 1914 were less cooperative and MFN treaties more stable if foreign tariffs were initially high.

as complements. In terms of the baseline model, the reduction in tariffs would lead to lower trade

costs and higher likelihood of convergence.

       The French-Italian labor treaty of 1904 represented an attempt by one trading partner to

persuade a laggard to level the playing field in exchange for greater market access. 56 France and

Italy had engaged in a trade war that began in 1886 and effectively lasted into the early 1900s.

The war was especially hard on Italy because of its dependence on France for its exports of

specialty goods. 57 While Italian silk was a relatively standardized item and producers readily

found markets in Switzerland, its specialty wine producers were less fortunate and they had to

dump their stock. 58 As part of the agreement ending the trade war, France demanded that Italy

raise its labor standards to international norms, thus guaranteeing its producers greater market

access. In exchange, France agreed to give Italian migrant workers the same level of benefits

French workers received. It also enticed its trading partner by removing some commercial duties

on Italian imports. Italy was not opposed to the French initiative. Its history of labor legislation

was recent and, because the percentage of the population eligible to vote was low, the liberal

government could exploit the French initiative to go around vested interests opposing reform. 59

The net result was that labor costs increased relatively more in Italy. After the accord, French

exports to Italy rose by 61 percent; Italian exports to France by about 20 percent. 60

         The strategy of linking regulation and market access was generalized across Europe. The

   In 1887, Italian exports to France were 40 percent of its total exports; French exports to Italy were less than 6 percent
of its total. In the ten-year period after 1887, Italian exports to France fell by 57 percent, and those of France to Italy by
21 percent. Connybeare, Trade Wars, p. 185.

   Earlier in the decade, the Italian (liberal) Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti had invited socialists into his cabinet. In the
years before the accord, the minimum working age was raised to 12 years, and the employment of women on night
shifts was restricted to 12 hours, but Giolitti hesitated against making further improvements. Workers were
underrepresented in Parliament, universal suffrage being granted only in 1911 (Coppa, Planning in Italy, pp. 162-65).

Labor viewed as groundbreaking, served as a model for the French-Belgian (1906) accord, and

Germany’s treaties with Italy (1904) and Austria-Hungary (1905). 61 For the time period 1902-

1913 we estimate the short and long run effects of the bilateral treaties (from Table 4) on trade

between pairs of European countries (a and b) with the regression:

       Trade costsab = 0.0008 + 0.9248trade costsab (t-1) - 0.0066labor treatyab
                       (0.0138) (0.0182)**                  (0. 0029)*

               + controls (tariffs, common border, distance between capitals, year dummies),


       N = 1868                      F(18, 179) = = 2265.4                 R-squared        = 0.96. 62

The short run effect is the coefficient on labor treaty, -0.0066, significant at the 2 percent level.

The long run effect is calculated as -0.0066/(1-0.9248) = -0.089, or a 9 percent decline in trade

costs (p-value 0.02). With an elasticity of substitution between foreign and home goods of 11, the

point estimate amounts to a rise of bilateral exports of 35 percent for each partner. 63 Lampe’s

observation that the interaction of “trade-creation considerations and strategically oriented

political economy forces” lay behind the diffusion of MFN agreements appears applicable to the

spread of labor accords. Countries had an incentive to consent to converge on labor standards,

because they did not wish to forsake the gains from trade.

       In unreported regressions, we estimate that the negotiation of a labor treaty after 1900

reduced trade costs by nine percent. Countries had an incentive to converge on labor standards

because they did not wish to forsake the gains from trade.

                             WERE ALL LABOR STANDARDS EQUAL?

       In this section, we extend our analysis and examine the type of legislation countries adopted

in response to the entanglement of domestic and foreign pressures. Consider the likelihood that

country A had the choice between high and low-cost standards, defined by the relative incidence

of legislation on firms’ bottom line. On the domestic front, high-cost standards may have gained

politicians a large and loyal constituency, but could have been perceived to do damage to the

competitiveness of the economy. An alternative was to adopt policies having more symbolic than

real effects. Now consider the ‘open political economy’ aspects of the decision. Country B might

demand that A adopt a high-cost standard like its own. Could A have gotten away with regulation

imposing lower costs? It might have if it could have convinced its partner that adoption of low-

cost standards, appropriate to its own level of development and size and wealth, was a prelude of

tougher regulation. Country B may have not been entirely satisfied, but it at least had something

to show its own constituents who may have been behind targeting A in the first place. In this way,

even piecemeal regulation could have acted as gateway standards. 64

       The Berne meeting of the IALL in 1905 distinguished between types of labor standards. 65

Delegates considered limits on the working hours of women and children as high cost. According

to one observer, 1.4 million women in Europe would be affected by a curb on night work,

benefiting, on average, from a shorter workday of 2.5 hours. 66 Factory inspection laws were

deemed low cost, as determined by the number of inspectors states had actually hired, and so was

accident compensation whose burden was shared by workers, firms, and governments (Table 2).



64
   Rodrik (One Economics, p. 228) claimed a similar process was behind the rise in labor regulation after 1945.
65
   For a summary, see Mahaim, “La conference de Berne,” pp. 14-15.
66
   Assuming women comprised 60 percent of the labor force in textiles, the reduction of labor input in the industry
would have been in the order of about 10 percent. This is a lower bound estimate. Men may have reduced their hours
alongside women since their work was complementary. The 60 percent figure is for the U.K. from Boot and
MainDonald, “New Estimates”; hours from Huberman, “Working Hours.”
                                                                                                     29

      We employ a multinomial logit approach to study the possibility that the determinants of

convergence varied with the type of labor standard adopted (Table 6). We create three categories

to capture country A’s potential responses. Category 0 represents the outcome where there was no

convergence between countries A and B. Category 1 designates that country A adopted limits on

women and children’s work (restrictions on women’s maximum hours and prohibition of night

work, and minimum age laws for children) to emulate B’s corresponding legislation. The third

category (effectively category 2) indicates that country A adopted factory inspection or accident

compensation when B had these policies in place. For this purpose, our sample of 2,884 country-

pair years, contains 90 instances of emulation in category 1, and 151 in category 2. The list of

explanatory variables is identical to the short baseline in Table 5, but we now include two

indicators for lagged values of convergence. The first indicates the number of category 1

standards shared in the previous year; the other indicates the number of category 2 standards

shared.

      For category 1, the key determinants of policy convergence in Table 6, column 1, are

similar, but not identical, to previous results. Domestic forces trumped external pressures in the

adoption of costly regulation. As per capita GDP of country A rose, it was more likely to

implement limits on women’s and children’s work and converge to country B. Size did not matter

in the adoption of category 1 standards. Adoption was less likely the greater the degree of

convergence already achieved. The lagged values of convergence in each category reveal

evidence consistent with the dynamic proposed above. Countries may have acted sequentially,

adopting one category of legislation before moving on to the other set as conditions became more
                                                                                                                        30

opportune. Emulation was more likely the higher the level of convergence in the opposite group

of standards. 67

          Strikingly, and in contrast to Table 5, the partial effect of trade integration for category 1

standards is not statistically significant. Trade pressures were less important for these types of

standards. And there was no difference between Old and New Worlds. In a separate, but

unreported multinomial estimation that included bilateral distance and a border dummy, these

variables were also not statistically significant. Again, domestic forces overwhelmed external

pressures in the adoption of costly regulation.

          All standards were not alike. We find opposite results for policies that we perceive to have

imposed a smaller shock on an economy’s cost structure. There are significant differences in the

determinants of convergence between high and low cost standards. Country A’s GDP per capita

(an increase in GDP for a fixed population) has the opposite sign from that for high cost standards

in column 1. Richer countries were less likely to emulate less costly standards. Alternatively,

poorer countries were more prone to emulate less costly standards. Proportional rises in GDP and

population (or size) had no relation to convergence. Turnout in country A is no longer statistically

significant. Similar to previous findings, the process of emulation was slower in the New World,

although a higher voter turnout ratio accelerated the process. Regarding the time path in the

diffusion of standards, the (unreported) period dummies for category 2 variables grow larger over

time and are statistically significant, while none of the period dummies for category 1 are

statistically important, though the point estimates of the average partial effects on the time

dummies appear to fall over time.

          Conspicuously, trade was a pathway of diffusion for less costly labor standards only. States

did not mimic holis bolis the policy agenda of neighbors or trading partners, but were selective in

67
     In other (unreported) regressions, emulation was more likely if the country pair had similar per capita incomes.
                                                                                                     31

their choice of policy based on internal and external constraints. Domestic and external forces

were entangled. Countries more exposed to trade were predisposed to emulate, but only on low

cost standards. The adoption of factory inspection and accident compensation satisfied the

demands of the domestic reform movement, and of trading partners and their constituents,

because they were the first step to more stringent and comprehensive legislation. Still, while

states appeared to have been more cautious in adopting costly standards in the face of

international competition, there is no evidence of a race to the bottom. If undercutting

international competition mattered, then the partial effect on the trade cost variable should have

been positive and statistically significant. Countries facing the stiffest international competition—

where trade costs were low—would have been the least likely to emulate. However, greater

integration did not lead to a lower likelihood of adopting labor standards present elsewhere, and

European countries, in particular, raised levels of labor regulation in line with key trading

partners while preserving some domestic independence in the sequence of policies adopted.

                            CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS

      Everywhere labor regulation was on the rise in the decades before 1914. The prevailing

narrative views this episode as a chapter in national history. Since countries developed

economically and politically on parallel trajectories, they consequently adopted comparable

policies. But globalization mattered too. Countries were under strong pressure to emulate the

labor standards of major trading partners, although this did not mean adopting identical laws. And

since the process was uncoordinated, trade flows actually strengthened nationally regulatory

standards.

      Our findings lead to a neglected but straightforward explanation of the origins of social

Europe and liberal America—and possibly why the divergence between the two has persisted

over the last century. Intraindustry trade was greater in the Old World. The threat of market loss
                                                                                                    32

was credible and enforceable against countries that failed to emulate the standards of partners. To

avoid costly trade wars, policymakers negotiated bilateral labor treaties that exchanged market

access for a level playing field. The New World exported undifferentiated products and countries

were under no compulsion to adopt regulation of trading partners, the rise of labor legislation

being predominately a local affair.

         We have made a point of separating the determinants of adoption from the effects of

regulation, studies of which have tended to find that new legal norms codified existing practice. 68

Why then did states feel compelled to adopt legislation? Politicians may have wished to

demonstrate a concern for working people; social reformers may have wanted to curtail

backsliding; employers may have thought otherwise. This paper points to an alternative

explanation of the persistent and loud demands for legislation, despite its null effects. Foreign

intervention, in conjunction with or in opposition to domestic interests, had a voice in the

timetable of reform. But since the adoption of new laws was conditional on guarantees of market

access, trade and labor regulation rose together. As incomes and employment expanded along

with trade, a self-adjusting mechanism ensured that the effects of legislation were neutralized.

                                                  APPENDIX

                                               Labor Legislation

       Table 1 gives the years countries adopted legislation, as opposed to when it came into
effect. Wherever possible, we selected dates of introduction of laws or amendments to laws that
came close to meeting standards of the Final Protocol of the International Conference on Labour
in Factories and Mines held in Berlin in 1890. The Berlin meeting outlined a model labor code
that was intended to be the basis of a late nineteenth century European social charter. The final
Protocol recommended that children under 12 years of age be prohibited from factory work; the
elimination of night work for young women; and a working day for women of 11 hours. In an
attempt to be consistent, we relied on dates given in the proceedings of the International
Association of Labour Legislation that gave detailed information for many of the countries in our
sample. The IALL distinguished between dates of adoption and dates when the legislation came
into effect. 69 Where the IALL did not provide information, we relied on official publications;
when official reports gave conflicting years, we assumed that change occurred mid-way between
the last two dates identified. In the case of accident compensation, we took dates from the
comprehensive international Report prepared by the U.S. Commissioner of Labor. We have
followed the Report and record that Russia adopted accident compensation in 1903. 70
       For the Old World, we assume that legislation was standardized within national borders,
although after the Franco-Prussian War, German manufacturers maintained that Alsatian firms
had a competitive advantage because they were exempted from the stricter German labor code. 71
For Switzerland, we take federal legislation. For Australia, we use the date the first state passed
legislation meetring the Berlin standard; for Canada, when Quebec and Ontario achieved this
level; for the U.S., we give two values: the first, when ten states passed comparable legislation,
and the second in parenthesis, when the ten most populated states adopted comparable laws. In
the case of Mexico, new labor law was passed in the wake of the revloution; we have followed
labor historians and record adoption in 1913. 72
       To be sure, other laws governing women’s and children’s work, and factory conditions
could be included in Table 1. For other measures for which we have information there was
correlation in the years of adoption with those in the table. 73 But some of the details of these
measures (for instance, night work of children) varied greatly across countries. As Table 2
reports, we selected laws that had less dispersion in their various dimensions, although
heterogeneity across countries cannot be ruled out.
       The choice of dates for the U.S. merits discussion because of different histories of
regulation at the state level. Despite its federal structure, Fishback claimed that the “geography of
adoption showed that neighboring states were likely to adopt legislation with similar features
within the same time frame.” 74 Twenty-two states adopted accident compensation between 1911

69
   For instance, following the 1905 Berne conference Belgium agreed to restrict women’s work to 11 hours, but delayed
passage until 1909. Certain aspects of the law were only implemented in 1911. Lowe, International Protection, p. 126.

and 1914 alone. 75 For other regulations, legislation was most common in industrial northern states
with the largest share of workers in manufacturing and import competing activities—key sectors
in our analysis. As for dates of introduction, years recorded in Tables 1 approximate those
reported by Commons and Andrews. For women’s hours, Common and Andrews gave 1908, the
year when the Oregon ten-hour law for women was upheld, to mark the beginning of “enforceable
hour limitation laws for women.” 76 Based on our procedure, we estimated that night work of
women was introduced in 1913.

                                        Model and Robustness Checks

          In Table A1 we present additional robustness checks of the baseline directed dyad event
history analysis. In column 1 we use the Polity IV measure of competition of political
participation (PARCOMP in the Polity IV manual) as an alternative to voter turnout. 77 This
variable takes the values 0,1,2,3,4, or 5. A value of 0 implies no oppositional activity; 5 is
associated with regular voluntary changes in power at the national level, without coercion or
disruption. The results are in line with our previous findings. Political competition matters in the
New, but not in the Old World.
          Column 2 substitutes the ratio of bilateral trade (exports and imports) to GDP for the trade
cost variable. Greater trade is positively associated with convergence. The point estimate is
statistically significant at the 11 percent level. In this model the marginal effect of A’s GDP
becomes significant at the better than the 10 percent level, while the point estimate is close to that
in other specifications.
          To deal with the issue of missing pairs, we tested probit models using the country-year as
the unit of observation, thereby allowing countries which had not already adopted a particular
standard to be included. 78 To account for international effects, we added the standards of all
trading partners divided by bilateral trade costs, summed across all countries in the sample. Most
likely, this variable is plagued with measurement error since the functional form is arbitrary, a
problem which underscores our choice of the directed dyad approach. It is not surprising that the
probits give a small marginal impact of trading partners’ labor standards, and whose sign is
indefinite and with large standard errors. We find no consistent evidence on the impact of the
turnout variable or GDP per capita which was only statistically significant for the probability of
adoption of limits on women’s working hours and night work. Levels of voter turnout (not
interacted) are statistically significant for accident insurance and limits on women’s night work.
Like the convergence equation, the country-year event analysis has potential problems related to
the spatial-correlation of error terms and endogeneity between a country’s explanatory variables
and neighbors’ error terms.
         We also estimated a Heckman selection model which allows for correlation between the
error term in the convergence equation (converted from a logit to a probit) and the probability B
had one or more standards and, hence, eligible to be included in the sample or not. We use the
full list of variables from the baseline model, plus union density and agricultural share of country
B, and the share of the population in country B over 65 as excluded determinants of the selection
process. 79 The selection model cannot reject the null that there is no correlation between the error
terms of the two equations (p-value 0.16). Results in the outcome equation are qualitatively in
line with our baseline findings. Trade costs are still highly significant and country A’s variables
matter in the same way. However, the standard errors on country B’s per capita income are larger
than the baseline, making this variable not statistically significant. In other words, after
controlling for sample selection, A’s decision to converge is not based on the income per capita
of B.

Notes: Standard errors in brackets clustered at the country pair level. Estimation is by
maximum likelihood for a logit model. We report average marginal effects. The
dependent variable is 1 when there is convergence on any of five labor standards.
Quinquennial dummies are included but not reported.
