                       Prices and Terms of Trade for Developed—
                        Country Exports of Manufactured Goods



                                        ABSTRACT



         The purpose of this paper is to contribute some new measurements

 to the discussion of trends in the terms of trade between manufactured

 goods exports of developed countries and primary product exports of

 developing countries. The new measures are manufactured goods price

 indexes that are derived from price data rather than from unit value

 data and include some corrections for quality change.

       Our calculations indicate that the prices of manufactured goods

exported by developed countries to developing countries have risen over

twenty years or so by 75 per cent, as compared to the l4) per cent shom

by tne generally used UN unit value indexes. The decline in terms of

trade for these goods relative to primary products has been almost

50 per cent over this period.

       Over   the   last   hundred years, fluctuations in the   terms of trade of
manufactured     goods relative to primary products have been        very wide,
as   far as we can tell from the inadequate measures we have. Impressions
about trends have been highly dependent on choices of beginning and end
years. There is very little evidence for a long—run trend in either
direction.

     The subject of terms of trade between i:ianufactured goods and primary
prouucts has a long history, and opinions   on the   direction of trends in
them nave gone through several cycles. Recently, until the last few years,

the majority opinion, especially in ueveloping countries and iii   agencies
representing their views, has been that manufactured goods have generally

risen in price over a century or so. This was true despite the fact that

such a rise would have violently contradicted one of the most firmly held

and basic beliefs of classical economics. That was that as a consequence

of diminishing returns——of rising population pressing against a constant

supply of resources, especially land——there must be in the long run a rise

in primary goods prices, especially agricultural prices, relative to prices

of manufactured goods. For example:

          The tendency, then, being to a perpetual increase in the

    productive power of labour in manufactures, while In agriculture

    and mining there is a conflict between two tendencies, the one

    towards an increase of productive power, the other towards a

    diminution of it, the cost of p:oduction being lessened by every

    improvement in the processes, and augmented by every addition to

    population; it follows that the exchange value of manufactured

    articles, compared with the products of agriculture and of mines,

    have, as population and industry advance, a certain and decided

    tendency to fall." (Miii, 1848, Book IV, Ch. II.)
                                  —2
Tue classical view was tile dominant one, particularly in Great Iritain.

It was emphasized in times of rising raw materials prices, as in Jevoris

(1866), Keynes (1912), and Robertson (1915), and subsided when prices

declined, as in the late 19th century and after World War 1.1

     The opposite picture as to the facts of the case was drawn a

century later by Folke Hilgerdt, in Industrialization and Foreign Trade,

which concluded that in the 60 years before 1938, primary product prices

had fallen relative to prices of manufactures and that "the general

trend of the relative movements. .. .of the prices of these two classes

of goods can scarcely be doubted."

     What is particularly astonishing about this conclusion is that

after over a century of confident theorizing that exactly the oDnosite

trend was inevitable and a historical fact, Hilgerdt offered this

conclusion without any reference to the contradiction of classical

doctrine.

     The theme of relatively declining primary goods prices was then

taken up in a long series of documents, many published by the United

Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and written by, or under

the direction of Raul Prebisch, director of ECLA and later of UNCTAD.

Among them were Relative Prices of Exrorts and Imnorts ofnderdevç

Countries (1949) and The_Economic Development of Latin America and Its

Principal    Problems (1950) and. an article by Hans Singer on "The Distribu-

tion of Gains between Investing and Borrowing Countries," American Economic

Review, May 1950. This doctrine, and the explanations given for it,

 became known as the Singer—Prebisch thesis, despite its origins with

 I-iilgerdt who really never developed the theme or gave it the importance

 that was later attributed to it.

          A few dissenters, such as Haberler and Viner, were never convinced

by Flilgerdt's data or the UN line in general, although they had no

counter—evidence to offer. Several pointed to the likelihood that price

indexes for manufactured goods, and therefore for exports of industrial

countries, suffered from upward bias due to the neglect of quality change

and the underrepresentation of new commodities. Export prices for auto-

mobiles, for example, might not take into account gains in horsepower,

the shift to power brakes and steering, anti—pollution devices, etc.

If this were the case, the improvement in terms of trade would be exag-

gerated since the export price indexes for LDCTs, or for primary products,

were not subject to the same biases.

     The issue has continued to be argued back and forth in the journals

and in several books, and with interest recently renewed in connection

with proposals for commodity price indexation, and some progress has

resulted from the reworking of the historical data.2 However, almost

fl these studies have relied on similar basic data: unit value indexes

tor prices of manufactured and primary products exports. The defects of

these data, especially with respect to manufactured goods, are well

known,3 and most authors tip their hats to them and then proceed to use

the data anyway for lack of good alternatives, however, over the last

few decades, some improved data for prices have become available.

        Our purpose in this paper is to make a contribution to the progress

of this discussion in several ways. First we discuss briefly some issues

relating to methods of calculating price movements for groups of countries.

Then we present some price indexes for manufactured products exported by

developed countries for the period since 1953 that do not depend at all

on the use of unit values from trade statistics. We examine the diver—

gence of the more commonly used unit value indexes from these price indexes,

particularly with respect to the implications for recent trends in the
terms of trade. We offer some assessment of the impact of quality changes
on price measures for manufactures and relate these to terms of trade
movements.       Finally, for the   sake of providing a rough perspective on
long    term changes we reluctantly resort to unit value indexes         for the
three quarters of a century prior to the early 1950's when our own price
series begin.

                                Exports of Manufactures
        There   are several basic ingredients for our indexes, which we summa—

rie iere and cescribe       more fully in the appendix. The        first are our
own international price indexes for metals, metal products, machinery,
and transport equipment, for the United States, the United Kingdom,
Germany, and Japan, covering 1953—1964.              The second are the export

price      indexes developed over the last twenty years or more, mainly by


       4
        Kravis   and Lipsey (1971).
 the U.S., Germany, and Japan, the latter two comprehensive, the first

starting with the same coverage as our indexes and gradually increasing

coverage over time. The third element of our indexes is more fragmentary

export price data published by the U.K., Sweden, and the Netherlands,

the last gradually increasing in scope over the years. The fourth type

of data is producer price indexes and/or wholesale price indexes for

all    the countries included here. The fifth type is hedonic price indexes
for    a few types of machinery and transport equipment. These are used in

two ways. The first is to fill in prices for some commodities for hich no

official published indexes exist. The second is as a substitute for

conventional price series in a very rough attempt at adjustment for

quality change where we consider it appropriate and important.

       These various sources of data of course overlap extensively, and

it is necessary for us to assign price series to the index by a system

of priorities, determined by our views as to the appropriateness of each

type of data as measures of export prices. The highest priority is

given to our own series, with interpolations based on the

other types of data as explained for the case of Germany in Kravis and

Lipsey (1972). The second priority is to official export price series,

the third to producer or wholesale prices, and the fourth to the

hedonic price indexes. Although we    consider   the hedonic price series
more   appropriate for our purposes than the conventional series we have
not   given them priority because we wished to produce an index from

something close to conventional data. However, we have also calculated

an alternative index in which hedonic price series are given priority,

and we consider that to be the best estimate we can make of the movement

of prices of manufactured goods.

Designing   a World or Regional Price Index
      Aside from the selection of basic price data, the most important
choice is that of a weighting system, a topic on which we have experimented
a little and plan to study further. The decision on a weighting system
is apart from that on base years, for which we use 1963 here, although
we intend to experiment also with a 1975 base.
      The principal version of a manufactures price index used here,
which we will refer to as Type A, weights the export price series by   the
1963 values of exports by all developed countries to all developing coun-
tries. This is done for each country's prices at the four—digit SITC
level, to produce country indexes with common weights, and then the
country indexes are combined using the values of each country's exports of
all manufactured products to LDC's to form a general DC export price index.
One difficulty with this scheme is that it requires sufficient coverage
of all manufactures to permit the calculation of an overall index. If a
country's price data are too skimpy for that, they do not appear in the
total index even though they may be sufficient for some groups and even
though the country may be an important exporter in some groups.
      A second manufactures price index, shown in the Appendix, which we
refer to as Type B, weights each export price series by the 1963 value
of that country's exports of that product to developing countries. The
country aggregate price index is, as in the Type A price index, weighted by
each country's exports of all manufactures to developing countries.
      Although these are the only indexes of manufactures export prices
presented here, we plan to calculate several others. In general, they
involve   the use of each country's own weights to form the index numbers
for   segments of manufactures (e.g., one—digit or two—digit SITC categories)
and   the weighting across countries at levels below the total of all manu-
factures.
      The maximum use of the available price data would be made by weighting
each price observation by the value of exports of that commodity by that
country to developing countries (Type E).

      If we think of the weights in the form of a country by commodity

 matrix,

the Type A index presented here could be described as A


                                                   m n

               13

     The importance of these choices arises from the fact that each involves

not .'iy weighting but also different assumptions about the nature of the

commodities priced at the most detailed level and about price relationships.

The reason is that each involves different ways of filling in missing price

observations. The justification for starting with the calculation of country

indexes is the assumption that missing prices tend to behave in a similar

manner to the average of other prices in the same country for commodities

in the same 3—digit, 2—digit, or 1—digit commodity classes. These methods
                                  --8—


therefore ignore the behavior of other countries' prices for the same

commodity, a difficult assumption to accept for anyone who believes the

law of one price has any validity at all. In contrast, trie methods that

start with the calculation of indexes for all countries at the 4—digit

SITC level come closer to acceptance of the law of one price, since they

assume that one country's price for a commodity tends to move with the

average of other countries' prices for the same commodity. However, they

therefore assume that there is no country—specific effect on a price change.

Thus a currency revaluation has no effect on the export price of the

revaluing country in comparison to that of others, a proposition we have

found to be frequently contradicted in our studies of international price

behavior.

     Since neither of these two extreme assumptions seems really acceptable

we plan eventually to drop them both by using a method that incorporates

both country and commodity effects in estimating each missing price. The

method is a variant of one developed by Summers (1973) for the estimation

of inter-country price level comparisons. It involves fitting an equation

to each block of country and commodity price observations, the block being

defined by the full list of commodities and countries or by the countries

and some level of commodities, such as all those in a two—digit SITC class.

The equation contains dummy variables for both country and commodity and

therefore permits the data to determine the degrees to which the two

characteristics influence the estimated price.

NBER Price Index
     This is a six—country composite, aggregation within countries by
OECD export weights and between countries by value of exports of manu—
factures to developing countries.

     The calculation of the index is described as Type A in the text.
The six countries covered are the United States, the United Kingdom,
Germany, Japan, Canada, and the Netherlands. The last two are missing
from the indexes for the years before 1956, because data were completely
lacking or too thin and the Netherlands indexes do not begin until
1962. The indexes for 1975—77 are based on less complete data than those
for earlier years.

six   exporting countries are included because they are the only ones for

which we have sufficient coverage to produce indexes for total manufac-

turing. The aggregate index was quite stable over most of the period,

with only two changes of more than 3 per cent before 1970 and an average

change of only about one—half of one per cent per year between 1957 and

1967. In the 1970's, however, the increases became much larger, aver-

aging almost 10 per cent per year. After rising only from 92 to 108

between 1953 and 1969, the index then jumped to over 200 by 1977.

      We   also   calculated a Type B price index for the same six countries.

In this index the country indexes were aggregated with weights based on

each country's exports to developing countries in 1963 rather than those

of all countries combined, but the country indexes were combined in the

same way as for the Type A index. To the extent that the 1963 weights

reflected the previous ten years' price history, and elasticities of

substitution were greater than one, we might expect that this index would

have fallen relative to the Type A index, because a country would have a

heavier weight (larger exports) for a product in which its prices had

fallen relative to the other countries. However, the two indexes stayed

very close together between 1953 and 1963 and changed by identical amounts

over that period as a whole. After that the Type B index tended to rise

relative to the Type A index, with the changes, never more than about a

half a percentage point different in any one year, cumulating to an

increase 5 per cent greater by 1977. In other words, higher than average

country export weights in 1963 were correlated with larger than average

price increases after that.
                                  - ha   -




     We   compare our Type A price index in Table 1 with two versions of the

UN unit value index, the most frequently used currently available indicator

of export price movements for manufactured goods. One of the UN series is

the published export unit value index for total manufactured goods exports

of developed market economies (Column 2). The second UN index (Column 3)

is one we calculated from UN data for the unit values of exports by

developed countries to developing countries for SITC 5, 7, and 6 plus 8,

which we combined using 1963 export weights. The second UN index is a little

closer in coverage to our own index, in the sense that ours is weighted by

the values of exports by developed countries to developing countries although

the prices we use are not specific to trade with developing countries.

Despite these adjustments, it is virtually impossible to be sure what

accounts for the differences between the UN indexes and ours. Not only

are the UN indexes based on unit value data rather than price data, but the

coverage of countries is somewhat wider, the index number formula is differ-

ent, and the weighting is different. The wider coverage of the UN indexes

is not a likely explanation for the divergences between our index and

theirs because the additional countries are minor exporters of manufactured

goods. The effects of the differences in weighting and index number

formulas are more difficult to guess at without a close analysis, but the
                                — 12   --




fact that ours is a Laspeyres index on a 1963 base is likely to make it rise
more, rather than less, rapidly than the UN indexes in the later period of
rising prices. 6
     Whatever the reasons for the differences, we find that both UN indexes,

after being quite close to the NBER series through the mid—1960's, rose

considerably more during the following period of rapid price change.

Furthermore the restriction of the UN series to exports to developing

countries and the weighting at the 1—digit level by 1963 exports to match

that of the NBER series (Col. 3) moved the UN series further away from,

rather than closer to, the NBER index. For example, over the period from

1967 to 1977, at the beginning of which all three series were very close,

the NBER series rose by 98 per cent, the total UN series by 118 per cent,

and the UN series on exports to LDC's by 129 per cent. In the last five

years the NBER index rose by 61 per cent, the full UN series by 74 per

cent, and the UN index for exports to LDC's by 86 per cent. Thus we find

indications that the unit value indexes exaggerate the increase in manu-

factured goods prices and that the exaggeration is largest during periods

of rapid price change. We suspect, although we cannot prove it, that the

differences are due to the use of unit values rather than to differences

in index number formulas or weighting.7



      6
       This is not necessarily the case, however. For sor.ie discussion and
examples see Hansen and Lucas (1981) and Lipsey (1963).

      7
       An odd feature of the unit value series we constructed from UN
series for exports by developed countries to developing countries is the
sharp decline, by about 7 per cent, in 1968. The NBER index shows a
slight decline that year and the overall UN index none at all. The most
                                     13




        In an earlier study (Kravis and Lipsey, 1971) we compared our

indexes for machinery and transport equipment from 1953 to 1964 with

the corresponding export unit value indexes published by the United

Nations. We concluded there that at least in these products, the unit

value indexes were biased upwards to a substantial degree. That rela—

tionship persists in the indexes used here, but it is offset in the

aggregate by a much larger decline in the unit value index than in the

price index for chemicals, especially between 1957 and 1961.

The Treatment of Missing Prices

        Each type of index involves some assumptions about missing price change

observations. The Type A index used here assumes that a missing price change,

in a country for which we have other price data, resembles the changes in

prices   of other commodities in the same commodity group in that country. We
make no use, in this index, of information about prices of the same commodity
in other countries. For countries other than the six included in the
Type A index, however, we   are   in effect assuming that their price movements
resemble    those of these six countries for which we do have fairly complete

data.




Fn. 7 (conci.)
likely reason for the fall is the devaluation of the L in late 1967 which
showed up in annual price indexes in 1968. That devaluation affects all
the indexes, of course, but the coverage of the indexes for exports by
destination may be lower than that of the aggregate index and the British
prices may therefore have a much heavier weight in these indexes. We
have no direct evidence for this explanation but it appears to be the most
likely one.
                                        — 14 —



        One test of the various possible assumptions is to compare, for the

prices that are available, the variance across countries with the variance

within countries. We made such a comparison using price changes at

the 4—digit SITC level for the U.S., Germany, and Jarian, calculating

variances among 4—digit subgroups within 1—digit classes        in each
country    and variances among 1—digit classes across countries. At this

level, at least, we      found the   within—class variances in a country to be

smaller than toe variances among countries for the class. Thus if

either country alone or commodity alone had to be used as the criterion

for assigning missing price observations, country would be a bctter

choice.

     This      result is somewhat surprising considering that we are dealing
with tradable goods, for which the law of one price is often assumed to
hold. The importance of country as a variable determining price
behavior    is shown in another   way   by a comparison of country price
indexes, in Table 2. In these indexes the weights are identical for
all six countries; the differences between them are therefore differences
in price movements, rather than in the weighting of identical price

movements.8

     For   most of the period, roughly through the end of the 1960's,

country differences in price movements were fairly small. The largest

exceptions could be associated with changes in exchange rates such as

the upward revaluation of the DM in 1961 (affecting 1961/1960 and 1962/61)



    8
        That
           is not strictly true because the absence of price data for a
commodity removes that commodity from the weights. However, these are
countries for which the price data are fairly complete.

and the devaluation of the b in 1967 (affecting both 1967/66 and 1968/67,

but mainly the latter).9 During the 1970's, a period of much larger and

more frequent exchange rate changes, the range of variation among coun-

tries was much greater, the extreme case being the range of over 23 per-

centage points in 1973/72. The average range during the 1950's and 1960's

was 3.8 percentage points outside of the years with currency revaluations

and 7.6 points in the years with revaluations, while it was over 12 per

cent during the 1970's. Both the visible relation of the price indexes

to specific currency revaluations during the 1960's and the wide range

of country price changes during the 1970's, despite the fact that an

identical set of weights has been imposed on all the countries, show

that exchange rate changes were not simply offsetting current relative

price movements, even for export commodities. The dissimilarity of the

country price indexes also means that any formula for estimating missing

price observations that relied on the law of one price or even on the

similarity   of price movements, without taking country differences into
account,   would probably be highly inaccurate.

Quality    bias in faiufactures Price Indexts
     One of the comments frequently made in the debate about trends in
the terms of trade of manufactures relative to primary products has been
that the standard price indexes for manufactures are biased upwards by

their neglect of quality change, while those for primary products are

not subject to the same bias. There has, however, been virtually no

evidence on this subject beyond our own earlier comparison of the NBER



     9
      The other wide variance, in 1958/57, was not associated with any
exchange rate movement but with the steep drop in Japanese prices. This
was an extreme case of what appears to have been fairly regular behavior
of Japanese export prices: a strong response to U.S. recessions which
involved a decline in export prices or a decline relative to domestic
prices.
                                   — 17 —




price   series with UN unit value indexes.10 In that case, however, there

were so many possible sources of divergence between the two that it was

impossible to isolate the effects of quality change.

        The alleged bias in manufactured goods price indexes can be divided

into two parts. One is the difference we would find between a unit value

Index and an identically weighted index constructed using conventional

specification pricing. The difference between the two would measure the

effects of shifts in composition within commodity groups. That difference

might represent a shift to higher or lower quality but could also repre-

sent any other change in characteristics that involved higher or lower

average values per ton or per unit.

        The second element of the supposed bias is the incompleteness of

allowance for quality change even in indexes based on specification pricing.

The quality change might take place in a characteristic of the commodity

not part of the specification or, probably more important, the specification

pricing method may not properly account for the change in price that takes

place with the introduction of a new product, as in the substitution of

jet aircraft engines for piston engines or the substitution of newer types

of computers for older ones.

        Here we do have some direct evidence on the second type of bias,

certainly on its direction and to some extent on its size in manufactured

goods price indexes. In our indexes for the United States for SITC 7 we

have made the experiment of replacing a number of individual conventional

price indexes at the four—digit SITC level by series that have been adjusted



        10
          Kravis and Lipsey (1971), Chapter 8.
                                  — 17a —



for   quality changes and also of incorporating such adjusted series where

there were no conventional series at all. The difference between the

adjusted and unadjusted series should almost certainly be a minimum esti—

mate of the bias from this source for several reasons. One is that the

'conventional' series already included a small amount of quality adjustment

for items in SITC 7 between 1953 and 1964, where such adjustments were

carried out in Kravls and Lipsey (1971). Other indexes for manufactured

goods would not include such adjustments. Secondly, the corrections were

performed for only eleven subgroups, all in SITC 7, accounting for about

15 per cent of exports of all manufactures and less than a third of SITC 7

exports by developed countries to developing countries. Third, we restricted

the substitutions to cases where the series to be used clearly involved a

specific quality adjustment, and did not use alternative series for which

the adjustments involved other types of corrections, such as the more

rapid introduction of new products or differences in the type of outlet

from which prices were secured.
                                -. 18   —




     The results of these quality corrections are shown in Table 3. The

adjusted series showed changes in manufactured goods prices that were

lower (smaller increases or larger decreases) than those in the conven--

tional series in all but two years. Over the whole period through 1976

for which we have made this calculation, the adjusted index rose 77 per

cent as compared to 105 per cent for the conventional index. We would

thus estimate the bias from neglect of quality change to be more than 25

per cent over the period as a whole. The average difference was over

1/2 of a per cent per year.


                        Prices of Primary Products

     Although most of the controversy about measurement has centered on

the manufactured products side, there is also a considerable variance in

measures of primary products prices probably not entirely due to differ-

ences in coverage. The strong commercial and financial interests in

primary product trade and the relative homogeneity of the products has

led to the publication in countries of both origin and destination of

prices for well specified product variants by both official and journalistic

sources. International agencies, including the UN and IMF, have taken

vantage of the existence of these materials to form export price indexes

-.t primary products that go back to the 1950's. We have not developed

—'ur own price indexes for primary products and simply report here some

results using these widely available measures, with a small amount of

reweighting to match our manufactured goods price indexes.

    As in the case of manufactured goods, both unit value indexes and

price indexes can be calculated. The unit value indexes, the ones most

frequently compared with the corresponding manufactures series, are regu-

larly reported by the UN and are presumably almost universal in coverage.

     For price indexes, the problems posed in their construction are less

formidable than those for manufactures, but still not negligible. Both

the UN and the IMF indexes aim at worldwide coverage of price movements

and are Type E measures. A Type B index may be advantageous for primary

product prices if they come close to obeying the law of one price, at

least with respect to price changes. If, for example, Brazilian iron ore

and coffee export prices each moved very similarly to prices of the same

commodities abroad but changed relative to each other, a Type E index

might be more appropriate than the Type A index we have used for manufac—

tures. The UN index is broader in commodity coverage, including dairy

products, forest products and fuels, none of which Is in the flIF index.

Also with 61 primary commodities and 6 nonferrous metals the UN index can

obtain fuller coverage for sectors included in both indexes: for example,

it includes bananas, oranges, lemons, grapefruits, apples, tomatoes, onions

and pepper whereas the only fruit or vegetable in the IMF index is bananas.

Both indexes are computed with a Laspeyres formula, the UN using country

and commodity export weights. The UN series starts with 1950 and is a

series of linked indexes with the early years employing 1953 export weights

and the most recent years those of 1975.   The   flif series begins with 1957

.nd is based on 1968—70. Both indexes aim at export prices but rely on a

mixture of export, import and domestic price series.

     Table 4 summarizes the primary goods price measures and compares them

with unit values, both including and excluding fuels. The chief differ-

ences in the behavior of the IMP and UN price indexes, each taken in Its

most comprehensive form, is attributable to the inclusion of fuel in the

TIN index and its exclusIon from that of the IMP. Given the huge increases

     the weights were 53.2 per cent for SITC 0 and 1 and 46.8 per cent
     for SITC 2 and 4. For the index of all primary products the weights
     were 34.9 per cent for SITC 0 and 1, 30.6 per cent for SITC 2 and 4,
     and 34.5 per cent for SITC 3.

in   petroleum prices beginning in 1973, it is not surprising that the UN

shows the overall index at 406 in 1977 while the overall [HF index is

only 280. When petroleum is excluded, the UN 1977 index is 269, not

far from the INF index and even a little below it. Before 1970, when

fuel prices did not behave so exceptionally, the two indexes do not dis—

agree on the broad development of primary product prices. From 1957 to

1970 the annual index numbers in each series moved up and down without

a clear trend and never strayed outside of a 10 per cent range on either

side of the mean for the period.

        From the comparison between the most comprehensive price index

(Col. 4) and unit value index (Col. 2) we find no support for the idea

suggested by Spraos (1980) that unit value indexes for primary goods

Pxports are as likely to suffer from upward bias due to quality change as

those for manufactured goods.     [f they do, they should tend to increase

relative to indexes based on price data, but no such tendency is visible

here; the trends are very similar. We cannot conclude that the unit

value indexes are not biased, since there are other differences between

the two types of indexes, such as in coverage and weighting and in the

reference dates of the prices being reported that we have not corrected

for. However, we can say that these indexes, both produced by the UN,

show no evidence of upward bias in unit value indexes for primary commodi-

ties.


                                Terms of Trade

        Since we have our own price measures only for manufactured goods the

best measures of the terms of trade we can calculate are based on the

comparison of these with the UN and DIF price indexes for primary products.
                                — 24



 We can then compare these with the corresponding estimates of terms of

 trade changes based on unit values in both numerator and denominator.

      Terms of trade. measures for developed—country manufactured products

 relative to developing—country primary products based on price, rather than

 unit value, data appear in Table 5. The terms of trade moved in favor of

 manufactures between 1953 and the end of the 1960's or 1970. The manufac—

 tures—primary product terms of trade (Col. 3) rose gradually but fairly

 steadily, from 83 in 1953 to 105 in 1967 and 1968 and to 106 in 1970 (with

 1963=100). This gain of 28 per cent was, however, quickly dissipated in

 the ensuing years; by 1974 the index was down to 48, its lowest point in

 our table, and it was only 51 in 1977. When the price of petroleum is

 excluded from primary products, the index of the terms of trade between

 manufactures and primary products (Col. 2) rises until 1972, but it then

 declines by a third between 1972 and 1977. Thus the decline in manufac—

 tures terms of trade in the 1970's was far from being a result solely of

 rising oil prices, however, the comparison with primary products excluding

 crude petroleum shows manufactured goods terms of trade in 1973—77 only

 10 per cent below 1953—57 while the comparison with all primary products

 shows them more than a third lower In the latter period.

     We mentioned earlier the suspicion that the commonly used manufactured—

goods unit value and price indexes might have been biased by the failure to

take account of quality improvement in manufactures and we presented what

we thought to be a minimum estimate of such bias for the United States.

An approximation of the probable effect of such bias on our terms of trade

calculation may be based on the difference between the adjusted and unadjusted

price Indexes for U.S. manufactures by assuming that the quality adjustment

estimated for the United States in Table 3 may be applied proportionately
to our "world" (six—country composite) price index for manufactures.

That approximation, shown in column (4), suggests that the period of rising

terms of trade for manufactures was very brief: mainly from 1953 to the

early 1960's. In fact, aside from a couple of higher levels in 1961 and

1962, the terms of trade of manufactures by this measure, were virtually

unchanged from 1958—59 through l96970. After that they fell very sharply

as did the uncorrected indexes. Thus the main effect of the quality correc-

tion is to substantially dampen, but not completely offset, the decline in

the   terms of trade for primary products between 1953 and 1970.   It has

little impact on our impression of later developments.

      The effect on terms—of trade calculations of using unit values instead

of prices can be observed by comparing Table 5 with Table 6, which presents

some unit value measures. The comparison is summarized in the text table,

below. It shows that between 1953 and 1976 the price data, even without

any correction for quality change in manufactures, indicate a decrease

in the terms of trade of manufactures relative to all primary products

(36 per cent) almost a quarter greater than that suggested by the unit

values (28 per cent). With that correction for quality change the price

data suggest a fall in manufactures terms of trade (45 per cent) more

than 50 per cent greater. The difference between price and unit value

measures of terms of trade is even larger for primary products other than

fuels. The unit values show a substantial rise in the terms of trade

of manufactures while the price indexes show a fall.

     The direction of terms—of-trade changes an investigator finds is

sensitive to the period of his study. If we had stopped our calculations

at 1970 we would have found increases in the terms of trade for manufac—

tured goods whether we measured them by prices or by unit values and with

or without fuels included among primary products. however, quality-corrected

measures of the terms of trade of manufactures would have shown only about

half as large a gain as the other indexes. The direction of this apparent

bias due to the neglect of quality change in manufactures seems to be

impervious to changes in the span of years examined.

Historical Perspective

     In view of the many historical generalizations that have been made

about the terms of trade between manufactured goods and primary products,

it is of some interest to try to place the experience of the past 25 years

or so in historical perspective. Unfortunately, the tools for doing so

are even cruder than the series we have used for the recent past. All of

the available series, at least for manufactures, have as their basic irigredi-

ients the same unit value data, and differ only in weighting, in product
                                 — 29   —




and geographical coverage, in the degree of disaggregation used in calcula-

tion, and in the years at which various versions of the series were linked.

To the extent that there are biases or inaccuracies in unit value series,

as we have suggested, they are incorporated in those we must rely on for

earlier years.

        The unit value measures in Table 7 seem to be the closest we can

come to the concepts we use for later years with respect to commodity

and country coverage. They are unit value indexes derived from Kindleberger

(1956) and from Maizels (1963). Those from Kindleberger are for Industrial

Europe's   exports of manufactured products to areas outside Europe and the
United States and for Industrial Europe's imports of   food, drink, and

tobacco    and raw materials from the same areas. They are for six widely
spaced years from 1872—1952 and use end—year trade weights for each period.
We used estimates for the same weights in combining them for Table 7.
The indexes   from Naizels (1963) are for exports of manufactures to the
world   by European countries, the United States, Canada, Japan, and India.

The Maizels indexes cover a set of periods similar to Kindleberger's but

beginning only in 1899. They were published with both end—year and

beginning—year weights for each period but we have used only   the former
for comparability   with the Kindleberger indexes for primary products.

        As compared with other available indexes, both of these have the advan-

tage of covering a long span of years using a common method of calculation

across both periods and countries, as far as that could be done with the data

as published. The Kindleberger indexes refer specifically to manufactures

exports by developed countries to developing countries and developing—country

exports of primary products to developed countries. The Maizels indexes

are more like our own in that they are for exports to the world, assuming

in effect that price movements are the same across all destinations for a

Maizels (1957).


of the Kindleberger indexes, aside from the probably excessive

degree of aggregation discussed by both Kindleberger and Maizels,
are the omission of the United States as an exporter and the

fact that the primary product prices include freight, since they
are derived from import values. Although Maizels includes India
as an exporter, its weight is too low to have any substantial
effect on the index for all manufactures.
     The picture of trends in terms of trade shown by the two
indexes from 1900 to the beginning of our series in 1953 is

similar. The terms of trade between manufactured goods and
primary products were roughly the same in 1953 as in 1900, but
the Kindleberger series showed much wider fluctuations. In
addition the Kindleberger series indicated little change in the

terms of trade of manufactured products between 1872, when they
began, and 1900, and thus no real trend between 1872 and 1953.
     Perhaps the main point to be emphasized is the very wide

range of the fluctuations of the terms of trade and, as a
consequence, the dependence of any impression about trends on

the choice of beginning and end years. For example, 1938, the
final year of Hilgerdt's League of Nations study,12 was the

most unfavorable for primary products in the


     12
          League of Nations (1945).
                                  — 31 —


whole period after 1872, and it is not surprising that he found a long

term downward trend in primary product prices. The early 1950's, on the

other hand, followed a large recovery of primary product prices, and a

period of worry about raw material shortages. It is thus not surprising

that studies of terms of trade since the early 1950's tended, until recently,

to again find downward trends in relative prices of primary products.

Similarly, it is understandable that around the World War I years, the

long—term trend was thought by many to favor primary producers.


Conclusion

     These calculations indicate that the prices of manufactured

goods exported by developed countries to developing countries

have risen over twenty years or so by considerably less than is shown by

the generally used UN unit value indexes: something like 75 per cent

rather than 140 per cent. Furthermore, the decline in terms of trade for

these goods relative to primary   products has been almost 50 per cent.
substantially   greater than one might calculate from unit value indexes,

which suggest a fall of only about one third.

     The difference between our estimate of the decline between 1953

and 1976 in the terms of trade of manufactures relative to primary products

(45 per cent) and that based on unit values (28 per cent) is composed of

several elements. Mostly they are aspects of the manufactured goods price

measurement, which has been the focus of our research, although if a

different time span were used, there would be some larger effect of our

use of prices instead of unit values for primary products. One component

is some mixture of differences in index number formulas, country coverage,
                                   — 32 —



and the use of price data rather than unit values, of which we think the
last   is the main influence. That part accounted for about half of the
difference. The second half was the result of a minimum estimate of
quality bias in the manufactured goods price index.
       These are all rough calculations, sensitive to choices of end-years
and other factors. We plan further refinement of them, but so far they
do suggest the likelihood that the usual estimates of the rise in rnanufac—
tured goods prices and the terms of trade of manufactured goods relative
to primary products are seriously biased upwards.
       It is important to remind ourselves in all these discussions of the
terms of trade that, as has often been pointed Out, and despite the appar-
ent implications that have been drawn, the net barter terms of trade is
not a welfare measure, and that its divergence from a welfare measure is
particularly great over long periods. The reason we would emphasize is
that long—term changes are dominated by shifts in supply: major changes
in productivity which make the net barter terms of trade depart from the
single factoral terms of trade, which could make a stronger claim to be
welfare measures. However, both of these measures suffer from the added
defect that they ignore quantity changes and would treat as "favorable,"
for example, a rise in export price which drives the exporter almost, but
not completely, out of export markets.
       Perhaps the only safe conclusion about very long—run trends in either direc-
tion is that the evidence for their existence is weak. There is very little
foundation for historical "laws" that specify the inevitability of movements
in either direction in the terms of trade between these two sets of
products. If a speculation is to be provided, the safest one would appear
to be that any apparent trend is likely to be reversed. The serious
content of this uhlawtT is to remind us of the self—limiting feature inherent
in sustained shifts in the relative price movements of any pair of broad
categories of goods. The relative prices of computers can, of course,
sink very low and that of petroleum can go very high. However, when one
whole class of goods such as primary products is compared with another such
as manufactures——both having very varied and widely spread uses throughout
the world economy——supply and demand factors tend to operate so as to limit
the extent and duration of relative price shifts. Eventually producers are
driven off and/or drawn in while consumers are affected oppositely, and
eventually relative price movements shift in the opposite direction.
                                 — 33 —




Laws of improving or worsening terms of trade for manufactures or for

primary products are usually based on two dangerous suppositions:

1. It is possible to predict the relative behavior of demand and

supply for the two groups of products; and 2. Responses to the changes

in these relative demand and supply conditions will take the form of

permanent price shifts rather than quantity shifts. Over the long run

quantities can change a lot, and trends turn out to be fitted to arbitrary

points in long, irregular, and probably unpredictable cycles.

       The set of price data we gave priority to are the international

price Indexes for metals, metal products, machinery, and transport equip—

ment for the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Japan, 1953, 1957, and 1961—64,

from Kravis and Lipsey (1971). These were interpolated by various other

series, mainly the types mentioned below, as described in Kravis and

Lipsey (1972), to give continuous series for the period from 1953 through

1964. The second priority was given to the official export price indexes

published   by various countries. The German price data at the commodity
level    appear in Statistisches Bundesamt, Preise, L8hne, Wirtschaftsrechnungen,

Reihe 1, PreIse und Preisindizes fUr AussenhandelsgUter. A brief descrip-

tion   is given in Angermann (1980), and in articles in Wirtschaft und
Statistik such as Rostin (1974). The Japanese export price data are
published in the Price Indexes Annual, earlier the Export andt Price
Indexes Annual, of the Bank of Japan. The U.S. export price data are from
releases of the U.S.   Bureau of Labor Statistics entitled,   "U.S.   Import and

Export   Price Indexes." A brief   description of these is given in Comparisons
of   U.S., German, and Japanese Export Price Indexes, BLS Bulletin 2046, 1980.

            price data for other countries were more fragmentary. Two
       Export

publications of the Central Bureau of Statistics of the Netherlands,

Maandstatistiek van de Binnenlandse Handel and Bilvoegsel Maandstatistiek
van de Prijzen, provided   export price data with incomplete but increasing

coverage.

      For the U.K. there are virtually no export price data outside the

 period of the price competitiveness study. The exception is a set of

 export price indexes for products in SITC 7 for 1976 through 1979, part

 of an experimental program that was later discontinued.

      For Canada, our data consist entirely of domestic prices: wholesale

 price indexes at a detailed level from tapes provided by Statistics

 Canada.


      Domestic price data for the U.S. were price series at the most

detailed level from a BLS Wholesale Price Index tape. For the U.K., some

individual series were collected from publications of the Board of Trade

and the Department of Trade and Industry. However, the U.K. does not

publish individual series for most machinery or "engineering" groups.

For these, we used a set of indexes at the two—digit SITC level calculated

for us by the Board of Trade from detailed price data using OECD weights

we supplied. For later years, we could not obtain these series and were

obliged to use a similar set of two—digit indexes calculated by the

Department of Trade and Industry based on U.K. export weights.

     The German domestic price indexes are individual series published in

Preise, L3hne, Wirtschaftsrechnungen, Reihe 3, Preise und Preisindizes fUr

industrielle Produkte, Index der Erzeugerpreise and Reihe 8, Index

der Grosshandelsverkaufspreise (Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden).

The Japanese domestic price indexes are also individual series from

the Price Indexes Annual and the Wholesale Price Indexes Annual published

by the Bank of Japan.

           The other main set of data are the             hedonic   price indexes substituted

    for conventional price series in our calculation of the quality—adjusted

    price index. These indexes are from a number of sources but were, with

    one exception, collected by Robert J. Gordon for his manuscript on The

    Measurement of Durable Goods Prices. The               other    index that was used was for

    aircraft, taken from Robert J. Gordon, "Energy Efficiency, User Cost Change,

    and the   Neasurement     of Durable Goods Prices," NBER Working Paper No. 408,

    November 1979. The hedonic price indexes were for the following SITC sub-

    groups, with weights as indicated.

                    711.1 Steam boilers for electricity generation
                    111.5   Outboard motors
