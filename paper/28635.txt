                                          ABSTRACT

Most aggregate theories of financial frictions model credit available at a single cost of financing
but rationed. However, using a comprehensive firm-level credit registry, we document both high
levels and high dispersion in credit spreads to Brazilian firms. We develop a quantitative dynamic
general equilibrium model in which dispersion in spreads arises from intermediation costs
and market power. Calibrating to the Brazilian data, we show that, for equivalent levels of
external financing, dispersion has more profound impacts on aggregate development than
single-price credit rationing and yields firm dynamics that are more consistent with observed
patterns.

1       Introduction

The credit market features a sizable gap between lending and deposit rates, and
these spreads are larger in poorer countries. According to the International Fi-
nancial Statistics, the average interest rate spread is approximately 0.7 percent
in Japan, 3 percent in the United States, 10 percent in Uruguay and 40 percent
in Brazil. Beyond the average spread, micro empirical studies report a high
variability in the interest rate charged by lenders for similar loan transactions
within the same economy.1 Such empirical work examines small subsets of the
credit market, however, so that the relevance of spreads and spread variability
for the macroeconomy is less clear. Moreover, the quantitative literature assess-
ing the role of financial frictions on development has focused mainly on credit
rationing at a fixed zero-spread interest rate. This paper addresses the role of
the level and dispersion in financing spreads on economic development and
firm dynamics, showing their importance both empirically and quantitatively.

Empirically, we focus on Brazil because of the availability of high quality data
that are especially useful for our purposes. We use the Brazilian credit registry, a
confidential loan level data set covering all the credit operations in Brazil since
January 2005 and containing information on loan characteristics and interest
rates. We merge these data with Brazil's linked employer-employee adminis-
trative dataset to examine how interest rates and loan size vary with firm char-
acteristics. Even controlling for loan type, loan maturity, a credit risk index,
past and future firm default episodes and industry and location fixed effects,
the loan interest rate and the volume of credit vary considerably with other
firm characteristics, such as firm size and age. In particular, young and small
firms pay higher interest rates. For instance, ceteris paribus, a firm with 300 em-
ployees pays in interest rates approximately 3 percentage points less than a firm
with 30 employees and 5.5 percentage points less than a firm with 3 employees.

Quantitatively, we introduce financing spreads into a standard model of credit-
    1
    See Banerjee (2003), Banerjee and Duflo (2010), for example. Gilchrist, Sim, and Zakrajsek
(2013) provide similar evidence for the U.S.

constrained entrepreneurs and demonstrate their important impact on en-
trepreneurship, firm dynamics, and economic development, even relative to
hard quantity constraints. We start with a continuous-time general equilib-
rium model with heterogeneous agents and occupational choice. Agents are
heterogeneous in their stochastic managerial ability and, at any instant, choose
whether to be a worker or an entrepreneur. Following the existing literature,
entrepreneurs can acquire capital from intermediaries but face a quantity limit,
which can distort a firm's decision away from its optimal level of capital.

We innovate by introducing price-driven distortions in the form of interest rate
spreads on externally financed capital. Like quantity constraints, spreads in in-
terest rates distort capital, but they also distort retained income conditional on
capital. These interest rate spreads stem from two sources: intermediation costs
that decline with productivity and assets and intermediary market power. The
productivity-dependent intermediation costs generates fixed variation across
firms, while the the asset-dependent costs yield life cycle variation as firms
grow. Intermediary market power arises from Nash bargaining between in-
termediaries and firms. This bargaining creates a dependence of interest rates
on ability and wealth through the firms' outside option and the surplus of the
transaction. With market power, ceteris paribus, high-productivity firms gener-
ate larger surplus and therefore pay higher interest rates. Also, distinct from
intermediation costs, intermediary market power distorts financing costs with-
out necessarily distorting the quantity. Taken together, financial frictions help
jointly determine the loan size and the interest rate.

We calibrate the model to match key characteristics of the Brazilian economy,
including standard macro aggregates as well as firm characteristics and credit
market moments based on our micro-level datasets. Both unweighted and
credit-weighted average spreads are important moments because they disci-
pline not only the costs of credit that firms face but the extent to which firms
borrow at high financing costs. Specifically, the fact that large loans are low
interest implies little presence of market power driving spreads, since market
power leads to higher interest rates for larger loans; they do not distort loan


                                        2
sizes but simply transfer rents to the lender. Instead, calibration attributes most
variation in spreads to variation in intermediation costs.

In quantifying the aggregate impacts, the calibrated financial frictions lower
output per capita by 31% relative to a frictionless credit benchmark. Wages fall
by 35%, with financial frictions leading to much larger firms. Both lower TFP
and lower capital usage play key roles in driving these aggregate results. TFP is
25% lower and capital is 26% lower relative to the frictionless credit benchmark.

Counterfactual simulations reveal that spread variation coming from direct in-
termediation costs drive the vast majority of impacts. First, quantity constraints
account for a small fraction of the total losses. Turning off quantity constraints
increases GDP by about 7 percentage points, or 20% of the total losses. Second,
turning off spreads accounts for 21 percentage points, or 2/3 of the total losses,
split roughly equally between the level and dispersion of spreads. Third, in-
termediation costs--especially those that fall on low-asset firms--are the most
important spread frictions. Market power can also be distortionary, but given
the low calibrated level of market power, its contribution is negligible. Finally,
the sources of frictions interact with one another, so eliminating one friction has
smaller impacts in the presence of others.

To further assess the impacts of spreads, we compare our calibration to an al-
ternative model with only a quantity constraint, similar to the existing litera-
ture (e.g., Buera, Kaboski, and Shin, 2011). When both models are calibrated to
match the ratio of external finance to GDP, the model with spreads yields larger
losses (from the perfect credit benchmark) on all dimensions: 60% higher losses
in output, more than double the losses in TFP, and slightly higher losses in cap-
ital. Thus incorporating spreads into models appears quantitatively important,
not only for decomposing the source of frictions but for aggregates as well.

We then study how financial frictions affect the dynamics in spreads and firm
growth. Both spread and firm growth patterns in the Monte Carlo simulations
follow those observed in the data. Moreover, the hump-shaped firm growth
patterns in the data are broadly consistent with those in the literature (e.g.,
Hsieh and Klenow, 2014). The hump-shaped life cycle dynamics in our model

                                        3
with spreads is quantitatively closer to the data compared with those of the
more typical model with only quantity constraints.

Related Literature. This paper is related to a large literature on the quantita-
tive effects of financial frictions on entrepreneurship and economic develop-
ment (e.g., Jeong and Townsend, 2007; Antunes, Cavalcanti, and Villamil, 2008;
Banerjee and Moll, 2010; Buera, Kaboski, and Shin, 2011; Buera and Shin, 2013;
Erosa, 2001; Greenwood, Sanchez, and Wang, 2010; Midrigan and Xu, 2014;
Moll, 2014; Moll, Townsend, and Zhorin, 2017; Itskhoki and Moll, 2019). We
differ from these papers in two ways. First, most papers in this literature have
a single interest rate. When there is a spread, it does not vary within the same
economy. Second, these papers typically consider a collateral constraint as the
only financial friction.2 An exception on both fronts is Greenwood, Sanchez,
and Wang (2010), which shows how monitoring technology can generate dis-
persion in interest rates. However, they abstract from self-financing, a key fea-
ture in our model.3

Micro studies have noted variation in interest rates and their potential for mis-
allocation (e.g., Banerjee and Duflo, 2005, 2010). Some macro papers have
looked to measure the extent and quantify the aggregate impact of misallo-
cation among an existing set of firms (e.g., Hsieh and Klenow, 2009; Sraer and
Thesmar, 2018; David and Venkateswaran, 2019). Most closely related is the
work of Bai, Lu, and Tian (2018) and Gilchrist, Sim, and Zakrajsek (2013). Bai,
Lu, and Tian (2018) impute interest rates as the ratio of interest payments to
debt for large Chinese firms and relate interest rates to leverage to infer fixed
costs. Gilchrist, Sim, and Zakrajsek (2013) directly observe interest rates using
contracts of publicly traded bonds in U.S. manufacturing. We complement this
work with evidence on spreads for the universe of loans to formal firms, not just
large or publicly traded firms where frictions are almost surely less severe, and
   2
     An exception to the single friction is Moll, Townsend, and Zhorin (2017) which considers
an economy with both collateral constraints and moral hazard frictions, but there is regional
variation where each agent only faces one of the two frictions and the economy has a single
prevailing cost of capital.
   3
     Besley, Burchardi, and Ghatak (2017) study a model with spread variation but the model is
static and variation is purely driven by risk.

we do so for a developing economy.4 We show that the details of contracts mat-
ter for understanding spreads. Moreover, because we model entry, we account
for losses along the extensive margin, which have been shown to be important
(e.g., Buera, Kaboski, and Shin, 2011).

Finally, we follow other researchers in examining firm dynamics in response
                                                                        ¨
to credit constraints (e.g., Midrigan and Xu, 2014; Gopinath, Kalemli-Ozcan,
Karabarbounis, and Villegas-Sanchez, 2017). We are the first to link financial
details to firm dynamics, however, and we use both spreads and firm growth
to evaluate our key mechanism.



2       Empirical Analysis

This section provides a description of our data and documents empirical evi-
dence of the high level and dispersion in financing costs. These patterns pro-
vide motivation, inform our modeling strategies, and ultimately discipline our
quantitative approach.



2.1     Data

Data on bank loans to all formal firms in Brazil are from the Brazilian Public
Credit Registry (SCR - Sistema de Informa¸  co         edito).5 This is a confidential
                                             ~ es de Cr´
loan-level database, managed by the Central Bank of Brazil. It contains infor-
mation of all formal loans granted from January 2005 until December 2016. For
any bank-to-firm loan during the period of analysis, we identify the lender, bor-
rower, size of the loan, the interest rate on the loan, the loan maturity, default
rates, the currency denomination of the loan and whether or not it was at an

(2020) to link financial flows and structural transformation.

earmarked interest rate.6 This dataset allows us to construct information on the
borrower-lender relationship, such as the length of a firm-bank relationship.
We aggregate loan-level data to the level of the firm using loan-weighted aver-
ages to construct annual data on spreads, maturity, non-performing loans, and
other measures. Spreads are the difference between the weighted average of
firms' outstanding loans rates and the one-year interbank deposit rate.7

The second dataset that we use in our empirical analysis is RAIS (Rela¸
                                                                      ca~ o Anual
de Informa¸co
            ~ es Sociais), a matched employer-employee administrative dataset
covering all formal firms in Brazil. This is a mandatory annual survey main-
tained by the Ministry of Economy. RAIS provides information on firms, such
as industry and location, and information on employees, which we use to con-
struct firm-level measures of employment and labor compensation. It is also
possible to identify the date of entry and exit of firms. With this dataset, we
can capture important firm dynamics for all formal firms in Brazil. Using the
unique firm tax identifier, we merge the SCR and RAIS datasets.



2.2    Empirics

Here we document the high level and dispersion of spreads. We show that
loan characteristics or observed risk explain roughly half of the variation, and
other firm characteristics, including firm size and age, explain roughly half of
the remaining unexplained variation.

We start with some basic summary statistics on the interest rate spreads, which
are high and variable (see Table A1 in Appendix A). Relative to the one-year
interbank deposit rate, the average spread in the sample is 44 percentage points
and the median spread is about 23 percentage points. There is also large vari-
ability in spreads since the standard deviation of the spread rate is 60 percent-
age points. Some firms pay an interest rate above 100 percentage points in
   6
     The Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) is the main financing institution for productive
investment in the country, and it offers subsidized interest rates for long-term investments.
   7
     Loan maturity is typically short with a mean of 1.2 years and a median of 0.66. Hence, we
found similar patterns using only new loans.


                                              6
excess of the deposit rate, while other firms with access to earmarked credit,
provided often but not exclusively by the BNDES, pay a negative spread.

The variation in spreads follows discernible patterns. Table 1 reports the Or-
dinary Least Squares (OLS) regression in which the dependent variable is the
logarithm of one plus the spread rate. The regressors include loan and bor-
rower characteristics, such as maturity, earmarked credit, length of firm-bank
relationship (in months), firm-level controls (e.g., industry, location), and time.
There are also controls for proxies for the risk of default of the loan, such as
the contemporaneous rate of non-performing loans and the lead and lag of this
variable.8 There is a positive relationship between the interest rate spread and
the rate of non-performing loans of a firm, and a negative correlation between
the interest rate spread and the maturity of the loan. The longer the firm-bank
relationship, the lower is the spread. This relationship may also capture some
(inverse) measure of loan risk. Finally, the higher is the number of banks from
which the firm is borrowing, the lower is the spread on its outstanding loans.
This may proxy for the extent of competition.

Approximately 12 percent of the observed variation in the spread is explained
by the loan characteristics presented in Column 1 of Table 1, including the rate
of non-performing loans at the firm level and the lag and lead of this variable.
The introduction of loan type controls increases the explanation of the observed
variability in the spreads from 12 to 45 percent, which emphasizes the impor-
tance of having loan level data on spreads.9 In our most complete and preferred
specification with a full set of different fixed effects (Column (4) of Table 1), ap-
proximately 50 percent of the observed variability in the spread at the firm level
can be explained by the regressors. Thus, roughly half of the (considerable)
variation remains unexplained.

How much of the remaining variability may be predictable for the firm and
   8
     Including higher order leads and lags does not appreciably impact our conclusions, which
may relate to maturity being typically short-term.
   9
     These controls are the proportion of credit which is in different type of loans, such as:
working capital, investment loans, discounted bill, earmarked credit, and credit to finance in-
ternational trade.

perhaps even dependent on characteristics partly endogenous to firm decisions
like firm size? To understand this, we regress the residuals of the regression
of Column (4) of Table 1 on various firm characteristics.10 Column (1) of Ta-
ble 2 regresses residual spread on firm fixed effects. Firm fixed effects absorb
idiosyncratic firm characteristics that do not vary over time. It can also cap-
ture other persistent features that change little within a ten-year period, such
as intangible characteristics like managerial practices (e.g., being a family-run
business). Firm fixed effects explain approximately 54 percent of the variability
of the residual of the logarithm of one plus the spread rate. Again, these persis-
tent spreads are likely known and predictable from the firm's perspective.

In Columns (2) to (5) of Table 2 we also control for age and size. (All relation-
ships reported in Table 2 are statistically different from zero at 99% confidence
  10
    We also run regressions similar to those of Table 1 with added firm-level controls and reach
similar conclusions.


                                                 9
level and these correlations hold after we control for a set of loan characteris-
tics and time fixed effects.) Older firms pay lower interest on loans. The age-
squared term indicates that this relationship is convex, flattening out with time.
Age may proxy for assets, since assets and firm size can be increasing but con-
cave. Lacking capital or output, we use the log of the wage bill as a more direct
proxy for firm size.11 Column (4) indicates that much of the relationship with
age is captured by firm size. Firms with large wage bills pay lower spreads,
and the significance and magnitude of the age relationship declines after con-
trolling for firm size. However, adding in firm fixed effects in Column (5), the
sign of the wage bill coefficient flips, and the role of age is strengthened. If in-
deed wage bill is proxying for size, much of the fixed effects may also reflect
the role of size, whether assets or productivity. Unfortunately, the data and re-
duced form regression analysis alone do not allow us to distinguish between
assets, productivity, or other firm characteristics.

In sum, spreads are high and there is a large dispersion in the spread rate, even
after controlling for risks, loan types, and other variables that may drive the
cost of lending. Much of the remaining variation is persistent and firm-specific.
Spreads fall with firm age, firm size, and the presence of competition in lend-
ing. These facts motivate our model, which allows for firm-specific spreads that
vary idiosyncratically, exogenously with productivity and assets and endoge-
nously declining with age, and are also impacted by the extent of competition.
We return to these data to evaluate additional model implications in Section 5.



3        Model

This section develops a model of entrepreneurship decisions and firm dynamics
under financial constraints that yields multiple sources of misallocation and
dispersion in spreads. We discuss, in turn, the environment, static optimization,
dynamic optimization, and equilibrium.
    11
    We explored different specifications, including using number of employees to proxy for
firm size. We also add the variable ln(loan/wagebill). The results are similar.

3.1     Environment

The economy is populated by a continuum of infinitely-lived heterogeneous in-
dividuals, who can choose at any time to be either a worker or an entrepreneur.
Time is continuous. There is a single good that can be used for consumption
or investment and is sold competitively. Entrepreneurs accumulate assets but
can augment their own assets with capital from intermediaries. However, fi-
nancial intermediation suffers from three potential sources of frictions: limited
enforcement, intermediation costs, and lender market power.


3.1.1   Endowments

At any point in time, t, heterogeneous individuals vary by their entrepreneurial
productivity, z (t), and their assets, a(t), and they make an occupational choice
to be either a worker or an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurial productivity is drawn
from an invariant Pareto distribution function µ(z ) = z -(+1) with z  1. With
Poisson arrival rate  , individuals draw a new talent for managing from distri-
bution µ(z ). Agents accumulate or decumulate assets subject to their consump-
tion decisions and budget constraint.


3.1.2   Preferences

Individuals derive utility from consumption, c (t), and preferences are repre-
sented by:                                    

                             E0  e-t u(c (t))dt ,                             (1)
                                  0

where  is the subjective discount rate, and E0 is the expectations operator con-
ditional on information at t = 0. The period utility takes the following form:

                                    c (t)1- - 1
                         u(c (t)) =             ,  > 0.                       (2)
                                        1-



                                       11
3.1.3   Technology

Entrepreneurs operate a technology that uses labor, n (t), and capital, k (t), to
produce a single consumption good, y (t):

          y (t) = z (t) k (t) n (t) , with ,   (0, 1), and  +  < 1.             (3)

Entrepreneurs incur a fixed-cost   0 to operate at any time and can operate
only one project. They hire labor and may finance capital through their own
assets, by borrowing from financial intermediaries, or a combination of the two.


3.1.4   Financial Intermediation

A continuum of financial intermediaries with unit mass offers agents an op-
tion to deposit assets at an endogenously-determined competitive rate r(t) or
borrow additional capital, where both the loan amount l(t) and the borrowing
interest rate r~(t) are subject to financial frictions. We model three sources of
frictions: the typical limited enforcement that constrains loan sizes by the frac-
tion of income stream that the intermediary recovers, and spreads on borrow-
ing rates that come from real intermediation costs and lender market power.
For simplicity, we model static, one-time loan relationships, in which an en-
trepreneur meets a financial intermediary and enters into negotiation to deter-
mine the amount and the interest on a loan. For ease of expression, we drop the
time indexes in discussing the financial intermediation technology and static
optimization. Since we solve for a stationary equilibrium, these relationships
will not vary with time. The individual state vector (a, z ) will be sufficient.

The real intermediation cost associated with making a loan l = k - a to an en-
trepreneur who has collateral a and productivity z is g (l,  (a, z )). This cost is
associated with collecting information about borrowers, monitoring, and en-
forcing credit contracts. Otherwise, borrowers could break their promise with-




                                        12
out any penalty. We denote this intermediation cost by

                                 g (l,  (a, z )) = l (a, z ),

where

                            a   z
           (a, z ) = 0 +      +    , with 0  0, a  0 and z  0.
                           1+a 1+z

We model per unit intermediation costs that are (weakly) decreasing in both
productivity, z , and assets, a. The former captures a measure of cash flow and
the latter captures a measure of collateral, two commonly-evaluated lending
criteria.12

Market power comes from the bilateral nature of borrowing/lending oppor-
tunities. The lender and borrower negotiate over the interest rate r
                                                                   ~ and loan
amount l via Nash bargaining, where   [0, 1] denotes the intermediaries' bar-
gaining power.

The range of possible loans over which the lender will bargain is constrained
by the limited enforcement of contracts, however. Limited enforcement means
borrowers have the option to strategically default and lenders can only recover
a fraction  of the output produced net of labor costs.  is therefore a measure
of financial enforcement, and will lead to a quantity restriction that is common
in the literature (e.g., Buera, Kaboski, and Shin, 2011). For simplicity, we follow
this literature in modeling only static penalties for defaulting.



3.2    Static Optimization

Given the continuous-time set up, occupational choice, intermediary meeting,
negotiation, contracting, disbursal, and repayment all happen contemporane-
ously. We now solve for static quantities, including occupational choice, con-
  12
    Bai, Lu, and Tian (2018) model intermediation costs that are decreasing in loan size. In-
termediation costs that vary with loan size, while reasonable, would introduce an additional
nonlinearity into the static optimization, increasing the required computation substantially.

tract terms, factor usage, and instantaneous income.


3.2.1   Entrepreneurial Profits

Static entrepreneurial profits are subject to multiple frictions. Entrepreneurs
can freely hire labor at wage w, but may face different costs for external capital,
~, and internal capital, r. Given the fixed cost, , the flow of income of an
r
entrepreneur with asset a and productivity z using capital k and labor n is:

                        ~; a, z ) = zk  n - wn - r
                 (k, n, r                        ~(k - a) - ra - .              (4)


Entrepreneurs maximize (4) given factor prices and their choice set for capi-
tal. Solving the constrained static optimization involves first solving for the
entrepreneur's unconstrained capital level (denoted by k u (z )) and comparing
it with the entrepreneur's assets (see the Appendix for details). Then, for those
with assets below their unconstrained capital, we solve for the set of capital
levels satisfying the limited enforcement constraint:

                ~; a, z )  (1 - ) (x(k, r
            (k, r                                   ~(k - a)) - ra - ,
                                        ~; a, z ) + r

where  (k, r ~; a, z ) denotes entrepreneurial profits and x(k, r      ~; a, z ) 
maxn0 { (k, n, r~; a, z )} + r ~(k - a) + ra +  is output net of labor costs,
both expressed as a function of capital given the optimal choice of labor. The
left-hand side of the constraint is therefore income from repayment, which
must exceed the income from defaulting. This income in default is expressed
on the right-hand side as the retained fraction, 1 - , of the total unrepaid loans
and output (net of labor costs), netting out foregone interest on unborrowed
capital and the fixed cost from this retained fraction. When the expression
holds with equality, it defines a hard quantity constraint on borrowing, i.e., a
maximum level of capital (and implicitly a maximum loan size) that depends
on the borrowing rate, k   ¯(~
                             r).

For an entrepreneur who borrows, the loan size, l, quantity of capital, k b , and

                                         14
the borrowing rate, r
                    ~, are the solution to the bargaining problem:

             r - r -  (a, z ))(k - a)] [ (k, r
       max [(~                                                      ~ (a, z )]1- .
                                                         ~(k - a) - w
                                             ~; a, z ) + r
      ¯ka,r
      k   ~


The first term (raised to the  power) is the intermediary's surplus (S b ) from
the loan. The second term (raised to the 1 -  power) is the surplus to the
entrepreneur (S e ). The expression w       ~ (a, z ) is the best outside option of the
borrowing entrepreneur, either: (i) the entrepreneurial profits from operat-
ing the business with internal capital only or (ii) the wage from becoming a
worker. (Formally, w    ~ (a, z ) is defined as max{w, x(a, z ) - ra - } or, equiva-
lently, max{w, ~ (a, z )}.) The solution to this problem defines a financing spread
~ - r that depends on the intermediation costs and the bargaining power of the
r
intermediary.
                                                                              ¯(~
When the contracted capital, k b , satisfies a strict inequality (i.e., k b < k r)), one
can use the first-order conditions to solve for the contract terms:
                                                                          1

                                                      b (a, z ) - w
                                                                  ~ (a, z ))

Equation (5) corresponds to the optimal level of contracted capital for given
intermediation costs,  (a, z ). Indeed, if  (a, z ) = 0, this would be the uncon-
strained level of capital. However, in equation (6), when the intermediary has
market power, i.e.,  > 0, the loan interest r    ~(a, z ), will be distorted even in
the case of  (a, z ) = 0. Thus, intermediary market power will not statically
distort capital but will impact the profits of the entrepreneur, and will there-
fore dynamically impact the entrepreneur's ability to self-finance. Moreover,
the borrowing interest rate will vary with assets a and productivity z , as these
determine the loan size and the entrepreneur's flow surplus. We characterize
elements of this dependence in the proposition below.

loan interest rate and the size of the loan when the limited commitment con-
straint does not bind. The first case isolates the role of intermediation costs
by focusing on the case with no intermediary bargaining power ( = 0): the
loan interest rate equals the marginal cost of a loan, r
                                                       ~(a, z ) = r +  (a, z ). Fol-
lowing the intermediation costs, the loan interest rate varies negatively with
the productivity z and assets a, and the capital used by entrepreneurs is conse-
quently increasing in assets and productivity. The variation in intermediation
costs therefore leads to dispersion in both borrowing rates and the marginal
productivity of capital among borrowing entrepreneurs.

The second case illustrates the direct influence of intermediate levels of mar-
ket power. Market power does not influence the level of capital, since this is
chosen to maximize total surplus. Instead, the loan interest rate simply in-
creases with market power, since this is the intermediary's tool for capturing
surplus. Hence, market power alone does not cause intensive margin misallo-
cation. Nevertheless, the dynamic effects of the dispersion of loan interest rates

                                                     16
on the distribution of assets might still influence whether or not the limited
enforcement constraint binds and the extent of intermediation costs.

The third case looks at the extreme case of the intermediary having full bar-
gaining power ( = 1). When this is the case and intermediation costs are inde-
pendent of assets and productivity ( (a, z ) = 0 ), then Proposition 1 shows that
the loan interest rate will still vary with the entrepreneur's type (a, z ). How-
ever, market power leads loan interest rates to be increasing in productivity.
For a given a, a higher z implies a higher entrepreneurial surplus, which is
captured through the higher loan interest rate charged by financial intermedi-
aries. Whether the loan interest rate is increasing or decreasing in assets de-
pends on whether the outside option is the wage or self-financed entrepreneur-
ship. When    ~ (a, z ) > w, a higher level of assets increases the outside option
of an entrepreneur, and so the loan interest rate decreases with assets. When
~ (a, z ) < w, the outside option is independent of a. Since the loan size de-

creases with a, however, the loan interest rate increases to capture the same
share of surplus. In this case of pure market power, we would observe disper-
sion in spreads but no dispersion in marginal productivity of capital.

Proof. See Appendix B.2

In the first case, when  = 0, the results are similar to those in Proposition 1.
However, in the second case, as the intermediary gets market power, it must
trade off a higher interest rate with less capital, since the incentive to default
involves the product of the interest rate and loan amount. When  = 1 and
the enforcement constraint binds, it is not straightforward to characterize how
assets and productivity change the interest rate and the optimal loan size.

After bargaining and optimization, instantaneous entrepreneurial profits are

                         x(a, z ) - ra - ,                 if l = 0

where the greater of the two is chosen. Financial distortions will impact the
income of a borrowing entrepreneur in two ways. First, a below-optimal level
of capital, i.e, k b < k u , will reduce profits through its impact on x(k b , z ), since the
marginal product of capital will exceed r. Second, for a given level of capital,
a higher cost of borrowing, r        ~ > r, will reduce profits through its impact on
                     b
capital costs, r ~(k - a). Profitability will naturally impact decisions about entry
and dynamic accumulation, which we turn to now.


                                                      18
3.2.2   Occupational Choice

At every moment, agents have the option to either work at a wage w or as an
entrepreneur and earn profits. The decision is static and so they make this de-
cision to maximize their current income flow, I (a, z ) = max{w,   (a, z )}. Define
the policy function o(a, z ) such that o(a, z ) = 1 if the individual becomes an
entrepreneur and zero otherwise.

Financial frictions will influence not only the allocation of capital, but the oc-
cupational choice as well. We illustrate this in Figure 1, which shows the oc-
cupational choice in (a, z ) space for agents facing  = 0 (perfect competition in
the banking sector), a given wage rate, w, and interest rate, r, and two levels
of the enforcement variable, . Appendix B.3 contains the formal derivation of
the two graphs presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1(a) shows the case of perfect enforcement, i.e.,  = 1, and costly fi-
nancial intermediation, r  ~(a, z ) - r > 0. The horizontal line z u illustrates the
cutoff for entrepreneurship in a world with no financial frictions. In this world,
all agents with productivity z > z u would become an entrepreneur produc-
ing at their optimal scale regardless of their wealth, and would share the same
marginal productivity of inputs. With financial frictions, however, this is not
the case. The threshold is now wealth dependent as illustrated by the solid
line z e (a). The white region below z e (a) indicates that the extensive margin
is distorted as some low-wealth agents become workers despite productivities
above the perfect credit z u threshold. The dark gray shaded area (region B)
represents the entrepreneurs who are borrowers. They pay different loan inter-
est rates, depending on their asset a and productivity z , and so the marginal
product of capital varies over this region. Agents in the darker region close
to the z e (a) line pay higher interest rates, borrow more, and produce with a
higher marginal product of capital. Agents close to the dotted line a     ¯u (z ) pay
a lower interest rate, borrow less, and have a marginal productivity of capital
closer to the internal cost of capital, r. The light gray shaded area (region U)
displays the agents who are unconstrained entrepreneurs: their wealth exceeds
unconstrained capital, a  k u (z ). Agents in this region produce at their optimal

Among these entrepreneurs, there is no misallocation of capital.

Figure 1(b) displays the case in which the enforcement of financial contracts is
imperfect, such that  < 1. We still assume that  = 0. There are two differences
compared with perfect enforcement. First, the line z e (a) becomes steeper when

contracts affects the extensive margin, further constraining poor yet talented
agents from becoming entrepreneurs. Second, imperfect enforcement also im-
pacts the intensive margin of the allocation of capital. Focusing on Region B, the
entrepreneurs who borrow, as we get closer to the solid line z e (a), the enforce-
ment constraint binds and entrepreneurs will be producing with a marginal
productivity of capital that is above the loan rate they face. However, agents
in region B close to the dotted line a  ¯u (z ) are not limited by the enforcement
constraint. Such agents produce with a marginal productivity of capital similar
to the loan rate, which varies with their asset and productivity. Region U still

represents the unconstrained entrepreneurs.



3.3    Dynamic Optimization

We turn now to the dynamic optimization, which simply involves a savings de-
cision and the stochastic death of entrepreneurial productivity, z , and replace-
ment with a new one, some z ~.

Given the static optimization that yields instantaneous income, I (a, z ), the bud-
get constraint governing the assets of an entrepreneur (a, z ) is:

                         (a, z ) = I (a, z ) + (r -  )a - c(a, z ).
                        a                                                            (9)

Note that distortions to k b and r
                                 ~ simply influence the dynamics of asset accu-
mulation (and likewise firm growth) through their impacts on income, I (a, z ).

They will also influence the dynamics of asset accumulation through the choice
of c(a, z ) because they impact the incentives to accumulate through the value
function and continuation value. Let V (a, z ) be the stationary value for indi-
vidual with the current state (a, z ). The value function satisfies the following
stationary Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation:

          V (a, z ) = maxc u(c) + a V (a, z )(I (a, z ) + (r -  )a - c) +
                                    Z
                                        V (a, z
                                              ~)µ(~   ~ - V (a, z )
                                                  z )dz                            (10)



3.4    Equilibrium

We solve for a stationary competitive equilibrium.13 Individuals differ from one
another with respect to their asset and entrepreneurial abilities, (a, z ). Given the
invariant distribution of abilities µ(z ), the stationary competitive equilibrium
of this economy consists of a stationary distribution of states (a, z ), H (a, z ), in-
  13
   Given the continuous-time setup, we can use an efficient numerical algorithm based on
Achdou et al. (2021)


                                            21
duced by the decision of the agents and the distribution µ(z ). Prices are given
by the wage rate w, the rental price of capital r, and loan interest rates r    ~(a, z ).
Individuals' optimal behavior was described in detail above and the policy
functions associated with their optimal decisions are k (a, z ), n(a, z ), o(a, z ) and
c(a, z ). These decisions are consistent with the recursive problem of all agents
and with the financial contracts. It remains, therefore, to characterize the mar-
ket equilibrium conditions and the aggregate law of motion:

   1. Equilibrium in the capital market:

                     K :=                  k (a, z )H (da, dz ) =         aH (da, dz ).           (11)
                             {o(a,z )=1}


   2. Equilibrium in the labor market:

                 N :=                  n(a, z )H (da, dz ) =                       H (da, dz ).   (12)
                         {o(a,z )=1}                                 {o(a,z )=0}


   3. Final goods:

                 c(a, z )H (da, dz ) +                               (a, z )H (da, dz ) =         (13)
                                            {o(a,z )=1,k(a,z )>a}

                                                              y (a, z )H (da, dz ) - K.
                                                {o(a,z )=1}


   4. The joint distribution h(a, z ) evolves according to the following Kol-
      mogorov Forward equation:

                       d
               0=-         (a, z )h(a, z )] - h(a, z ) + µ(z )
                         [a                                                    h(a, z
                                                                                    ~)dz
                                                                                       ~.         (14)
                      da

We have assumed that financial intermediaries' profits are spent outside the
economy. Finally, a variant of this fully general equilibrium is that of a small
open economy which faces a fixed interest rate, r. In this case, the interest rate
is assigned from outside the model, and the capital market clearing equation is
dropped as an equilibrium condition.

with macro and micro moments of the Brazilian economy. Our approach is to
assign standard values for two parameters common in the literature, and then
to jointly calibrate the remaining parameters of the model to the private sector
of Brazil during the period 2005-16.

The two assigned values are the inverse intertemporal elasticity of substitution
parameter,  = 1.5, and the depreciation rate,  = 0.06. The intertemporal elas-
ticity is in line with most of the literature on consumption surveyed by Attana-
sio and Weber (2010) and also with the Brazil-specific literature that estimates
 in the range from 1 to 3 (e.g., Gandelman and Hern´     andez-Murillo, 2014; Fa-
jardo, Ornelas, and Farias, 2012). The depreciation rate is commonly used in
the macro growth literature.

The remaining 11 parameters are jointly calibrated to match a set of 12 relevant
moments characterizing firm dynamics, concentration, and credit markets.14
Firm dynamics and concentration are important determinants of the equilib-
rium distribution of productivity and wealth. The credit market characteristics
help discipline the distortions themselves. The parameters are jointly deter-
mined, but we give a rationalization for the choice of moments parameter-by-
parameter below.

Our benchmark is a closed economy.15 We calibrate the subjective discount
rate,  = 0.25, to match the average real risk-free interest rate over the period
from 2005 to 2016. We calculate the risk free real interest rate as the difference
between the real interest rate on Brazilian treasury bills of roughly 6% and the
sovereign default risk premium of about 4%.

The production function exponents on capital,  = 0.29, and labor,  = 0.35, are
    14
    The definition, value, and source of the moments are detailed in Appendix A.2.
    15
    In Appendix C, we present a calibration and counterfactual experiments in a small open
economy in which we target the net international asset position of Brazil. There arises a dis-
tinction between assets and capital, and financial frictions are less severe in an open economy
with fixed interest rate, but the key messages of the paper are robust to an open economy.

disciplined by the the share of income paid to capital and the earnings share
of the right tail, since 1 -  -  is the share of entrepreneurial income, which
is captured in the tail. For Brazil, capital's share can be calculated from the
Penn World Tables (PWT) 9.1, and over the years of interest it averages to be
0.40, the same value reported by Abeles, Amarante, and Vega (2015).16 For
the income tail, we target the fact that top 10% of earners receive 56% of total
income, according to Morgan (2017). Finally, the fixed cost,  = 1.02, helps
define the minimum efficient scale for an entrepreneur, and hence the average
firm size, which we calculate in our data to be 21 employees per firm.

Next, we have two parameters that determine the distribution and dynamics of
productivity. The Pareto parameter,  = 3.47, determines the thickness of the
productivity tail, and is disciplined by the relative importance of large firms in
the tail. We target the share of the top 10% of firms in total employment of 0.78,
which we calculate in our data. The Poisson arrival rate of a new productiv-
ity draw,  = 0.15, is disciplined by the exit rate of establishments, which we
calculate to be 0.08 in the data.

Finally, we have five parameters related to the financial sector: the limited en-
forcement quantity parameter,  = 0.12, the intermediation technology param-
eters, 0 = 0.01, a = 0.68 and z = 0.23, and the intermediaries' bargaining
power in financial contracting,  = 0.03. We discipline these parameters to
match the overall level of financial development, measured as the ratio of ex-
ternal finance to GDP, which averages 0.49, and moments targeting the distri-
bution of credit and spreads. In our data, 35% of entrepreneurs have credit.
The average spread is high, 38 percentage points, and varied, with a standard
deviation of 32 percentage points.17
  16
     The detailed capital services file reports the shares paid to labor and land/natural re-
sources, and the remaining share is capital's share. PWT uses Gollin (2002)'s Method 2 for
Brazil, attributing proprietary income to labor and capital according to the split of nonpropri-
etary income. We follow the same method for measurement in the model, attributing a fraction
/ ( + ) of entrepreneurial income to capital. Entrepreneurial income is important, however,
so the subtleties of its treatment have large impact on capital's share in both data and model.
  17
     This is different from the simple average spread and simple standard deviation of spreads
presented in Table A1. We washed out factors from the data which are not present in our
model, such as differences in maturity and non-performing loans. We accomplish this by using


                                              24
However, the credit-weighted average spread is a much lower value of 6%.
The difference between the two indicates how correlated the use of credit is
with spreads; large firms pay lower spreads and are also the larger borrowers.
Comparing the credit-weighted spread of 0.06 with the value of 0 of 0.01, 1/6
of the weighted spread comes from intermediation costs which do not vary
with firm characteristics. To put the spread-inducing parameters (a , z , and )
into perspective, consider two extremes. The intermediation costs imply that an
entrepreneur with no assets and a minuscule productivity would face a spread
of 92 percentage points, coming purely from intermediation costs. Similarly,
a very productive entrepreneur with no assets--with profits about three times
the equilibrium wage--would pay a spread of about 45 percentage points, a
mix of intermediation costs and market power.

The above discussion about parameter values and calibration targets are sum-
marized in the top panel of Table 3, while the model fit is shown in the bottom
panel. The calibrated values of common parameters generally compare well
with previous calibrations in the literature. The micro returns to scale ( + ),
Pareto parameter ( ), and quantity constraint () all fall in the range (and in-
deed between) those in similar models calibrated for the United States (e.g.,
Buera, Kaboski, and Shin, 2011) and India (e.g., Buera, Kaboski, and Shin, 2020).
The value of  is between those calibrated for services and manufacturing in the
two-sector calibration in Buera, Kaboski, and Shin (2011). The model is there-
fore a close calibration to the existing literature, except that we require a high
discount rate to assure that firms borrow despite the high spreads.

With more moments than parameters, the overall fit of the model is good
though not perfect. The high level of spreads, high dispersion in spreads, and
high fraction of borrowers are only achievable for a restricted set of parameters.
These require the capital's share of income to be somewhat smaller than in the
data, though within the range of commonly accepted values. Moreover, the in-
vestment rate in the model is somewhat lower than in the data, a result of the
larger subjective discount rate required to match the credit moments.

5   Quantitative Analysis

We turn now to use the calibrated model to evaluate the quantitative impor-
tance of financial frictions. We do so by comparing the results for output,


                                     26
wages, TFP, capital, and the credit market under the stationary distributions
of different alternative parameter values.

We start by looking at the impacts of spreads vs. quantity constraints on aggre-
gates. The top panel of Table 4 summarizes these impacts by presenting results
relative to their values in a counterfactual world of perfect credit; i.e., the same
parameter values except no enforcement problems,  = 1, and no intermediary
market power,  = 0, or intermediation costs, i = 0, which lead to spreads.
This perfect credit benchmark is illustrated in Column (1).

Column (2) shows the full impact of the calibrated financial frictions in our
benchmark economy. The three frictions lead to a considerably lower ratio of
credit to GDP, just 47% of the perfect credit economy. The lack of credit leads to
substantially lower capital in the economy, 74% of the level in the perfect credit
counterfactual. Moreover, the credit frictions misallocate capital, which leads
to TFP being lower, just 75% of the perfect credit economy. In aggregate, the
lower capital and less well allocated capital leads to GDP being just 69% of the
perfect credit GDP. The level of wages is just 65% of their level in the perfect
credit world. The slightly larger impact on wages is because the credit frictions
lead to less entry and fewer entrepreneurs (as seen by the lower exit and larger
firms), which means more workers. With Cobb-Douglas technology, the share
of income going to labor remains stable, but, divided among more workers, the
wage level itself is lower.

Columns (3) and (4) are used to decompose the impact of the more traditional
quantity constraints (driven by ) and the impacts of spreads in the benchmark
economy. By comparing them with Column (2) and each other, we can see the
independent impact of these frictions.

In Column (3), we eliminate the enforcement-driven quantity restriction by set-
ting  = 1, so that all contracts can be perfectly enforced and entrepreneurs face
no hard quantity constraints on the amount of capital they borrow. However,
financial intermediaries still have market power and face costs to intermedi-
ate resources among agents. The impact on the financial market is substantial,
with credit/GDP increasing 25 percentage points from the benchmark of 0.47 to

                                        27
0.72. Nevertheless, the aggregate gains are more modest: 7 percentage points
increases in GDP (0.69 to 0.76) and TFP (0.75 to 0.82), and just a 4 percent-
age point increase in capital (0.74 to 0.78). The impact on wages is somewhat
greater, 11 percentage points (from 0.65 vs. 0.76), the result of many more en-
trepreneurs among those with few assets.

For comparison, Column (4) examines the collective impact of all forces that
lead to spreads by setting z = a = 0 =  = 0. Without spreads, credit to
GDP increases 19 percentage points (from 0.47 to 0.66). Capital increases by 10
percentage points (0.74 to 0.84). GDP is 90% of the level of the perfect credit
model, so intermediation spreads alone account for 21 percentage points (0.90
minus 0.69) of output. Spreads account for 20 percentage points (0.95-0.75) of
TFP as well, and 27 percentage points (0.92-0.65) of wage. Thus, about two-
thirds of the losses in output, three-quarters of the loss in wages, and 80 percent
of the losses in TFP come through the credit spread channel. Clearly, although
quantity constraints are not negligible, credit spreads are the dominant source
of frictions in the benchmark model.

Next we contrast our benchmark with counterfactual explanations for the ob-
served financial underdevelopment. That is, in Columns (5) and (6), we cal-
ibrate different parameters to match the credit/GDP ratio in the benchmark
model (and data). In Column (5), we eliminate all dispersion in spreads by set-
ting the spread dispersion-causing parameters to zero, a = z =  = 0. We then
calibrate 0 = 0.09 to match the credit to GDP in the benchmark economy. De-
spite yielding the same level of credit to GDP, a uniform spread does not have
the same severity of aggregate impacts as the benchmark. The capital levels are
comparable (0.73 vs. 0.74 in the benchmark), but GDP (0.80 vs. 0.69) and TFP
(0.88 vs. 0.75) are substantially higher without spread dispersion. Hence, mod-
eling both the level and dispersion in spreads is important, especially for TFP.
In Column (6), we eliminate all spreads by setting a = z = 0 =  = 0, and in-
crease the enforcement friction (by decreasing  to 0.05) in order to again match
benchmark credit to GDP. This counterfactual is closest in spirit to the existing
literature (e.g., Buera, Kaboski, and Shin, 2011), with only quantity constraints

but no spreads. The impacts on aggregates are even milder than in the model
without spread dispersion. Capital levels are a bit higher in this world (0.80 vs.
0.74), but the levels of wages (0.87 vs. 0.65), GDP (0.86 vs. 0.69), and especially
TFP (0.92 vs. 0.75) are markedly higher. Hence, if only quantity restrictions
were modeled, the predicted impacts would be less than 80% (i.e., (1-0.80)/(1-
0.74)) as large on capital, less than half as large on GDP and less than one-third
as large on TFP.

The bottom panel examines the model implications for the interest rate on sav-
ings and firm dynamics. All simulations with frictions yield a lower value for
the interest rate than the perfect credit world. Although capital falls by slightly
more than TFP, the interest rate on savings is substantially lower in the bench-
mark, just 2% relative to 13% in the perfect credit world. With spreads and
quantity frictions, there is a decline in demand for credit at any interest rate.
These frictions also increase the supply of savings by giving strong motives for


                                             29
saving for precautionary and self-financing reasons, and to secure better credit
spreads. All of this drives down the interest rate. Comparing the benchmark
with the perfect credit world, firm growth is faster (0.06 vs. 0.01), exit (which
equals entry) is smaller (0.05 vs. 0.12), and the average firm has more workers
(21 vs. 9) in the benchmark model. Looking at Columns (3) and (4), the faster
growth and larger average firm size is driven by spread dispersion. Looking
across the columns, the lower exit rate is not driven by any one friction so must
arise from the interaction of frictions.

In sum, spread frictions are an important source of the losses from credit mar-
ket imperfections. Modeling spread dispersion matters since it is quantitatively
important for the aggregate impacts of financial frictions on development be-
cause it leads to larger losses, especially for TFP.

Given this finding, Table 5 delves into the driving forces behind spread frictions
in more depth by evaluating the roles of the various types of spread-causing
frictions: market power (governed by ), the uniform intermediation cost (0 ),
the asset-dependent intermediation cost (governed by a ), and the productivity-
dependent intermediation cost (governed by z ). The top panel gives the im-
pacts on aggregates (expressed relative to the perfect credit values), the middle
panel presents the remaining spread and credit moments that we target, and
the bottom panel shows some measures related to firm dynamics.

     Column (1) parameter values are those calibrated in Table 3. Relative to these values, Column (2):  = 0, Column (3): 0 = 0, Column
     (4): a = 0, Column (5): z = 0, Column (6): i = 0 and  = 0.57, Column (7): a = z =  = 0 and 0 = 0.06, Column (8): 0 = z =  = 0
     and a = 37.7, and Column (9): 0 = a =  = 0 and z = 0.30. For Columns (7)-(9), the calibrated value is chosen to match the weighted
     spread in the benchmark.
     
      : It is difficult for the code to converge when market power is very high. Hence, Column (6) generates a spread of around 2% by
     quadrupling the market power relative to the benchmark.
Columns (2)-(5) shut off one of these individual frictions at a time. These
columns highlight the role of each friction in both spreads and aggregate out-
comes. Market power and the uniform intermediation cost have little impact
in the calibrated benchmark, as the values in Columns (2) and (3) are nearly
identical to the benchmark values in Column (1). This reflects the small cal-
ibrated values of  (0.03) and 0 (0.01) in the benchmark. The productivity-
dependent cost also plays a relatively smaller role on aggregates; see Column
(5). It does have the largest independent impact on the credit market, however,
constraining credit/GDP (0.57 without the friction and 0.47 with it), increasing
the average weighted spread (from 0.03 to 0.06), and limiting the fraction of
entrepreneurs with credit (from 0.48 to 0.40). When it comes to macro aggre-
gates, the asset-dependent intermediation cost plays the largest independent
role. Comparing Column (4) with the benchmark, the friction lowers GDP 6
percentage points, capital and wages by 7 percentage points, and TFP by 5 per-
centage points. Focusing on the credit market, the friction greatly increases
the unweighted average spread (from 0.08 to 0.40) and the standard deviation
of spread (from 0.02 to 0.33), despite only marginally decreasing credit/GDP
(from 0.48 to 0.47). Thus, a plays the largest independent role. Neverthe-
less, the total independent impacts of turning off each of the frictions is smaller
than the overall impacts of spread frictions. Hence, the interaction of spread-
inducing frictions is also important.

Columns (6)-(9) instead load up all the spreads onto a single individual fric-
tion, while eliminating the others. For example, Column (6) illustrates that the
negligible results in Column (2) are due to the low calibrated levels of mar-
ket power and not because intermediary market power is inherently benign.
Indeed, if the intermediary's bargaining power had been four times larger, out-
put, wages, capital, TFP and assets would all be substantially lower than in the
benchmark. More entrepreneurs would get credit (0.84 vs. 0.40), but intermedi-
aries with high market power would charge high spreads on productive firms,
capturing their rents and preventing these productive firms from accumulating
assets (0.60 vs. 0.74) quickly over time and eventually escaping their (quantity)
constraints. This would lead to smaller firm growth (0.04 vs. 0.06).


                                        32
For Columns (7)-(9), the parameter value governing the isolated intermedia-
tion cost friction is calibrated to match the average credit-weighted spread in
the benchmark (and data). Column (8) shows that asset-dependent spreads
can have large negative impacts on output, wages, capital, TFP, and assets, and
even larger impacts on credit to GDP. In this world, spreads are avoidable since
assets are endogenous. Therefore, in order to match the high average spread,
the calibrated value of a is enormous, 37.7, indicating a person with no as-
sets would pay an interest rate of 3770%! These poor entrepreneurs of course
do not borrow, leading to a much smaller fraction of entrepreneurs obtaining
credit (0.01 vs. 0.40). Wealth and not ability therefore drives entrepreneur-
ship decisions, and entry and exit are essentially non-existent. At high inter-
est rates, even the very talented, moderately wealthy borrow very little. Con-
sequently, the unweighted spread is much larger than the weighted spread.
(Comparing the unweighted-weighted difference across Columns (6) and (8)
highlights how this difference is important in distinguishing market power
from asset-dependent frictions.) Columns (7) and (9) show that the uniform
and productivity-dependent costs have smaller and similarly-sized impacts on
aggregates. The latter do not lead to much variation in spreads, so they resem-
ble uniform costs except that they enable high-productivity entrepreneurs to
borrow a bit more capital. Indeed, these impacts resemble the quantity con-
straint in Table 4, only somewhat stronger.

Next, we focus on the lower panel to get insight into the faster firm growth,
lower exit rates, and larger average firm size in the benchmark. Columns (2)-
(5) indicate that the faster firm growth hinges on asset-dependent costs. Con-
trasting Columns (1) and (4), we see that growth is much smaller without asset-
dependent costs. Although they reduce retained earnings, limiting the firms'
ability to grow, they also give incentives for firms to accumulate assets quickly
to escape the high spreads. Contrasting Columns (1) and (5), however, we
see that the productivity-dependent costs inhibit growth. They decrease the
profitability and retained earnings of firms, and lower firms' ability to grow.
But, because they are exogenous, they give no additional incentive to grow.
However, if we look at Column (8), in a world where all spreads are driven


                                       33
by asset-dependent costs, growth is very small. This is because entry and exit
are effectively eliminated by the enormous spreads that choke off the ability
for firms with minimal assets to be profitable. Hence, in addition to the abil-
ity and incentives to grow, spreads affect firm growth through their impact on
entry, exit, and selection into entrepreneurship given the endogenous wealth
dynamics that precede it.

Finally, note that all four of the alternative worlds in Columns (6)-(9) lead to
lower average firm growth rates than in the benchmark, which implies that
the interaction of different spread-causing frictions is important in explaining
the benchmark's higher firm growth rate. Similarly, Columns (2)-(5) indicate
that the interactions are important for explaining the higher firm size in the
benchmark.



6    Life Cycle Dynamics in Data and Model

We now examine the firm dynamics in the model and data in more depth as an
additional testable implication of the model's mechanisms. To compare with
the data, we use the model to generate a Monte Carlo simulation of a popu-
lation of agents. From this sample, we generate a comparably large sample of
firms.18 Recall that our data for Brazil contain annual observations of firm size
(number of employees), spreads, and age but lack data on capital and, conse-
quently, productivity. We therefore focus our analysis on the life cycle dynam-
ics of firms. We first evaluate the life cycle pattern of spreads to evaluate our
mechanism and then turn to its implications for firm size dynamics.
  18
     The samples are not identical, since entry is endogenous in the Monte Carlo simulation, but
both samples are so large that the difference is irrelevant.




                                              34
6.1   Spread Patterns

By construction, our model reproduces some moments of the level and varia-
tion of spreads, but it also predicts that spreads have components that vary both
across firms and over their life cycles. Much of the former variation is exoge-
nous, whereas the latter is endogenous. An important question is whether these
patterns are quantitatively consistent with those in the data. Table 6 compares
the results of regressions of ln (1 + spread)i,t on firm i characteristics. Columns
(1)-(3) simply reproduce the the residual regression results in Columns (2), (3),
and (5) of Table 2. (Recall that the constants are less meaningful since the data
are residuals of regressions on loan controls and time fixed effects.) We com-
pare these to the model analogs in Columns (4)-(6). Both model and data show
a significant, declining but convex life cycle of spreads. Moreover, fixed ef-
fects play important roles, increasing the R2 roughly 50 percentage points in
the data--moving from Column (1) to (2)--and 40 percentage points in the
model--moving from Column (4) to (5). Finally, controlling for fixed effects,
the spread is increasing in wage bill in both model and data. The patterns show
remarkable qualitative consistency.

However, three important distinctions between the model and data should be
noted. First, the regression explains much more of the variation in spreads
in the model than in the data. Second, the t-statistics are much larger in the
simulated data. Third, the root mean-squared error (RMSE) in the data is 0.179,
whereas it is just 0.021 in the model. Our parsimonious model contains only
two dimensions that vary spreads (productivity, z , and assets, a). Fixed effects,
wage bill, and age together capture a great deal of this variation. Naturally, in
the data, there are many additional unmodeled sources of variation, and the
RMSEs reflect the simplicity of model vs. data.

Nevertheless, the lifecycle dynamics of spreads that the regressions imply are
similar in the model and data. Concretely, the data estimates in Column (2)
imply a drop of 5 (log) percentage points in the spread between entry and age
15, while the model estimates imply a drop of 9 (log) percentage points over

the same years.19 The shapes of these dynamics are also similar. Moreover,
both magnitudes are reasonable in relation to other work. For example, Midri-
gan and Xu (2014) report drops in average product of capital (which equals
marginal product of capital in their model and our model) of 15 percentage
points in China and 21 percentage points in Korea but an increase of 25 percent-
age point in Colombia over the lifecycle. The spread dynamics are important,
since they impact the ability and incentives to accumulate assets endogenously.
We turn now to the implications of spreads for firm size dynamics.
  19
    We have normalized the spreads to zero upon entry. Recall that the level of spreads are
calibrated to match in the model and data.

6.2     Firm Growth

To capture patterns of firm size with respect to credit and life cycle in the model
                                               ni,t
and data, we regress the growth of firm i, ni,t  -1
                                                    on a quadratic in age, hi,t , an
indicator of whether or not a firm borrowed, Iloan,i,t , and the (log of the gross)
spread, ln (1 + spread)i,t :

       ni,t
             = i + a hi,t + a2 h2
                                i,t + loan Iloan,i,t + r
                                                       ~ ln (1 + spread)i,t + i,t .   (15)
      ni,t-1

We do this with and without fixed effects, i , though we note that the regression
form, which uses growth, implicitly allows for a firm-specific fixed effect in size.
The results are presented in Table 7 below.

Once again, we compare the results in Columns (1)-(3) (data) to those in
Columns (4)-(6) model. Most firms in both the model and data are relatively
young, so the age coefficients reflect a declining, convex relationship of growth
over the first 15 years of lifecycle and the corresponding concave increase in
size over the first 15 years. Comparing Columns (3) and (6), in particular, we
see that firms with loans and firms paying higher spreads tend to grow signif-
icantly faster. The magnitudes of the estimated relationships are much larger
in the model, however: the coefficient on having a loan is 9 times higher, while
the coefficient on spreads is 50 times higher.

Again, however, we do not see this as reflecting that the strength of the spread
and loan relationships is too strong in the model. Rather, we interpret it as
merely an artifact of a parsimonious model with spreads that depend on only
two variables, productivity and assets. To examine this, we add an additive
component to the explanatory spread variable as an additional source of spread
variation. Specifically, we add a mean zero, random variable that is normally
distributed with a standard deviation of 0.158 (the above noted difference in
RMSE of 0.179 and 0.021 in Table 6) and is independently and identically dis-
tributed (iid) over time and firms. Moreover, we add an additional source of
variation into the "have loan" indicator by adding a similar mean zero, iid ran-
dom normal variable with a standard deviation 1.627 (=10.3*0.158, where the

comparable once an additional source of variation is added.

Finally, we examine the quadratic life cycle dynamics of entering firms implied
by these regressions by plotting size relative to entry size over time. We choose
Columns (1) and (4) for the data and benchmark model, respectively, without
growth fixed effects, since this is more comparable with prior empirical work.
Moreover, we run an analogous regression on simulated data from the model

Notes: Benchmark is the full model with both a quantity constraint and spread frictions. BKS

match the same level of credit/GDP as in Column (6) of Table 4.


with only quantity constraints as a third comparison.20

Figure 2(a) plots these quadratic life cycle dynamics for the data, our bench-
mark model, and the calibrated version of our model with only quantity con-
straints (i.e., Column (6) in Table 4). In the data (solid line), firm size in Brazil
is essentially increasing but concave in age over the first 15 years of firm life,
on average rising to just over 150 percent of its entry size.21 The dynamics of a
more standard model with only quantity constraints (dashed line) shows very
little growth, peaking at roughly 10 percent total. The results from our bench-
mark model (light dotted line) are in between, exhibiting the hump shape but
with growth of about 30 percent rather than the 50 percent in the data.

The right panel demonstrates the importance of life cycle dynamics for the ag-
gregate misallocation by plotting (the log of) the percentage gap between un-

     More specifically, as in Column (4) of Table 4, we set spreads to zero and adjust  to match
the credit to output ratio observed in the data.

     This growth is significantly less than the lifecycle growth for manufacturing plants reported
by Hsieh and Klenow (2014) for the U.S., which show 8-fold average growth over 30 years, but
greater than the roughly 1.25-fold increase reported for India.

constrained capital and actual capital over the life cycle. The benchmark model
starts out with firms that are far more constrained on average, leading to higher
levels of misallocation. Nevertheless, the life cycle dynamics demonstrate how
this gap is partially closed by faster growth. Hence, aggregate misallocation is
linked tightly to faster firm growth, a reflection of both larger initial misalloca-
tion and incentives to grow quickly.



7    Conclusion

In this paper, we explored the effects of dispersion in financing costs on ag-
gregate development and firm dynamics. Using rich administrative firm-level
data sets, we presented evidence of the high level and variation of interest rate
spreads on firm's credit in Brazil.

Moreover, we augmented a standard model of credit-constrained entrepreneurs
with interest rate spreads that arise from intermediation costs and financial in-
termediaries' market power. We calibrated the model to match key characteris-
tics of the Brazilian economy. The quantitative results show that credit spreads
have larger impacts on development aggregates than the collateral constraints
typically considered in the literature. Our findings therefore indicate that finan-
cial frictions are more important than previously believed and that interest rate
spreads are an important friction to consider.

Our study also motivates future work on the causes of credit spreads to im-
prove financial development. Spreads arising from market power or falling
disproportionately on small firms are particularly harmful, so they should get
more focus in policy discussions and research. In particular, empirically identi-
fying the sources of these frictions is important.
