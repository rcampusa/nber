                        UNIONIZATION AND EMPLOYMENT BEHAVIOR


                                        ABSTRACT

Although there exists a large literature on the effects of trade
unions     upon   wages,        there    is    no   published     work     that    uses
microeconomic data to examine the employment consequences of
unionization.        The paper addresses this issue with a new British
data     set   and      shows    that,     even     after   the     addition      of   a
substantial       set     of    control       variables,    there     is   a      strong
association between poor employment performance and the presence
of trade unions.           The union employment growth differential is
estimated at approximately -3% per annum.
