            Inventories and the Propagation of Sectoral Shocks




                                 ABSTRACT




  This paper studies the dynamic properties of an imperfectly competitive

economy with inventory holdings.     In particular, we focus on the serial

correlation in aggregate output and employment produced by the holding of

inventories in one sector of the economy and the co-movement between sectors

of an economy over the cycle resulting from demand linkages. This model is

then contrasted with a simple, competitive real business cycle model with

inventories. We find that the predictions of these models with regards to the

co-movement of employment may differ.     Based on this, we present empirical

evidence on the co-movement of employment over the business cycle which is

consistent with the predictions of the model of imperfect competition with

inventory holdings and demand linkages.

               Inventories and the Propagation of Sectoral Shocks



I.    Introduction                                              -




     Nacroeconomists are generally concerned with characterizing the positive

and normative aspects of business cycles.     Two important features of cycles

are: (i) correlated movements in aggregate output over time and (ii) the

positive co-movement in output and employment between sectors over the cycle.

Discussions of these observations appear, for example, in Lucas [1977J   ,   Long-
Plosser [1983], Zarnowitz [1985].' For the purpose of building models of the

cycle, the task is to determine the features of preferences, endowments,

technology and information, along with the institutional structure in which

agents interact, that reproduce these two key observations.

     Macroeconomic theorists (see, for example, Kydland-Prescott [1982J) have

focused on correlated movements in output over time by studying the wide

variety of intertemporal linkages (capital, non-separable preferences,
stochastic structure) present in the economy.     This emphasis on persistence

reflects both the extensive use of the representative agent paradigm and the

fundamental concern of macroeconomists over aggregate quantities.            This

literature highlights both possible sources of aggregate fluctuations

(monetary shocks, real shocks, etc.) as well as the mechanisms which propagate

these disturbances throughout the economic system.

     Formulating models to understand the co-movement in employment and output

across sectors is a bit more difficult.       To see why, consider an extreme

economy in which workers suffer no disutility from work so that equilibrium is

always at full employment.    Then, variations in output and employment in one

sector, say due to sector specific technology shocks, will cause opposite

movements in other sectors.        That is, sectoral shocks may produce the
                                                                               2

substitution of resources from one sector to another rather than the positive

co-movement observed in practice.      While these substitution effects dominate

in this extreme case, they are certainly present in other, less-extreme,

settings as well.2

   One means of producing positive co-movement in employment and output is

through economy-wide rather than sectoral shocks.             Lucas [1972,1975]

accomplishes this in an economy subject to aggregate monetary disturbances

which individual agents confuse with real shocks.         As an alternative to

monetary disturbances, aggregate real disturbances could be the source of

aggregate fluctuations in employment and output. An increase in economy-wide

productivity would generally increase output in all sectors of the economy.

However, the effect on employment may be ambiguous due to offsetting income

and substitution effects.

   Long-Plosser [1983] present a model in which aggregate fluctuations in

output arise from sector specific rather than aggregate technology shocks.

This emphasis on sectoral shocks is perhaps more convincing since it is

difficult to identify aggregate supply disturbances associated with each turn

of the business cycle.      In the Long-Plosser model economy, a technology shock

in one sector leads to a contemporaneous expansion in that sector's output.

This additional output is partly consumed and partly used as an input in the

production of other commodities for next period. The resulting output of the

other commodities is then partly consumed and partly used as additional

inputs, etc.    In this manner shocks to the production function in a single

sector are spread over time and to other sectors creating persistent aggregate

fluctuations.     In the extensive example of Long-Plosser, equilibrium

employment is constant as income and substitution effects are offsetting.

Thus as stated, their example fails to match the observed co-movement in
                                                                             3

sectoral employment levels over the cycle. We return to this point later.

   This paper provides an alternative framework for understanding the co-

movement in output      employment in a multi-sector setting. In contrast to

Long-Plosser's emphasis on technological linkages and factor demand flows, our

approach highlights demands for final consumption goods as the important

linkage between sectors and excludes production of commodities by commodities.

Instead, the intertemporal linkage in the model is the holding of inventories

by the firm in one sector and the linkage across sectors is through demands

for final goods only.       Further, we are interested in generating empirical

implications for the co-movement in employment levels across sectors over the

cycle.

   The normality of demands for consumption goods is the basis for the

propagation of shocks from one sector to another.       These demand linkages

create output and employment movements rather than price changes when the

economy is in an underemployment equilibrium in which all available resources

are not fully utilized.       The source of the underemployment is imperfect

competition.   Hart [1982], Weitzman [1985], Cooper [1986] and Hall [l987a]

also emphasize the importance of imperfect competition in generating large

quantity fluctuations relative to perfect competition because the economy is

more likely to be in an underemployment region when sellers of goods and/or

labor have market power.3

   One important feature of our paradigm is that only         sector can hold
inventories. This reflects the fact that many sectors of the economy produce

goods and services which cannot be held in inventory.          However, as a

consequence of the demand linkages across sectors, the holdings of inventories

in a subset of the sectors is sufficient to produce persistence in the output

of all sectors. A buildup of inventories in one sector will reduce production
                                                                               4

in that sector which then leads to a reduction in demand for the product of

other sectors.     In the underemployment equilibrium this decrease in demand is

met by reductions in output and employment. Section II presents a version of

this model in which imperfect competition is a key feature of the environment

and validates these claims about persistence and co-movement.

   To further facilitate a comparison of approaches, Section III presents a

simple, competitive real business cycle model with inventory holdings in one

sector. Absent mobility costs, shocks to this system will produce negatively

correlated movements in output and employment as workers shift from one sector

to another. As one sector expands, the other tends to contract.

   Section IV reconciles these results with the model of imperfect

competition.     The point of this discussion is to identify the key assumptions

which determine whether employment movements are positively or negatively

correlated across sectors. The main conclusion of the analysis then is that

perfectly competitive economies tend to produce more substitution between

activities than imperfectly competitive economies.

   Drawing on this implication, Section V of the paper looks at the evidence

on employment fluctuations over time and across sectors. Our main finding is

that employment fluctuations are generally positively correlated across

sectors at the frequency of monthly data. We argue that this provides support

for the underemployment equilibrium model relative to a real business cycle

model in which shocks induce the reallocation of workers across sectors.



II. Imperfect Competition, Propagation.and Inventories

   To study these issues, consider a two period imperfectly competitive

economy.   There are two goods produced by monopolists and a third, non-

produced good, endowed to a group of agents termed outsiders.    There are also
                                                                                     5

2N workers present each period who sell their labor services to firms.

      The monopolist in each of the two sectors produces a unit of output from

each unit of labor.         In making production decisions, firms recognize their

market power as sellers. These agents consume the non-produced good in each

period and, as buyers, act as price takers. Their preferences (formally those

of their shareholders) are given by V(m) in each period where V() is

increasing and concave and m is their consumption of the nonproduced good in

period t.       To produce, these firms hire workers in a competitive labor
market. '

      The sectors differ in two important respects.             First, in period 1 the

monopolist in sector 1 receives an endowment of that good, e1.            Second, this

agent can hold goods over time as inventories. The sector 2 monopolist has a

zero endowment and is unable to hold inventories. This specification permits

us to analyze the interaction between sectors holding inventories (such as

manufacturing) and those for which inventory holding is impossible (services).

      There are two types of outsiders.         Type i outsiders have an aggregate

endowment of W units of the non-produced good in each of the two periods.

They demand both the non-produced good and the good produced in sector i and

have homothetic preferences.        Their demands for sector i output and the non-

produced good are given by


(1)      q. =   h(p.)         and    m =   (l   -
                                                    p.h(p.)).

With homothetic preferences, demands are proportional to income so that

variations in M' induce proportional variations in the demand for the produced

good.     The function ho    is   decreasing and, since demands are positive, 1 >

ph(p) for p>O.5

      There are 2N workers born each period who are endowed with a unit of
                                                                              6

leisure. Workers are of two possible types depending on the location of their

employment.     Those employed in sector i consume the nonproduced good and the

good produced in the other sector (denoted hereafter by -i). This is a common

preference structure for these models (see, for example, Cooper-John [1987] or

Heller [1986]) as it highlights the fact that agents generally consume goods

other than those which they produce.

   For simplicity, workers in sector i, who consume good -i, have the same

preferences as type -i outsiders.      Workers employed in sector -i receive a

wage of w and demand h(p1)w units of good i. Their indirect utility function

is given by Z(w,p1) U(h(p1)w,(l-h(p)p1)w) - k where k>O is the disutility
of working and U() is increasing, concave and homothetic.     ZO is necessary

for worker participation in the market.

   Before proceeding it may be fruitful to evaluate the assumptions made thus

far. We have restricted attention to two periods and two sectors for ease of

presentation.      Extensions to more time periods and sectors would not

dramatically affect our results.

   One important assumption is that there are monopolists in the two sectors.

If these markets were oligopolistic, the analysis would be much more difficult

as it would require the characterization of a dynamic Cournot-Nash equilibrium

with inventories.      In this setting, inventories would play an important

strategic role as discussed by Aryan [1985] and Rotemberg- Saloner [1987].

While this is an interesting possibility, it did not seem crucial to our line

of inquiry and is avoided by the monopolistic setting.

   Finally, the structure of demands here is quite important. The monopolists

are assumed to consume only the non-produced good while the workers consume

the produced goods. This implies that the current spending of workers is the

key linkage across the sectors of the economy and firms' profits represent a
                                                                              7

 leakage from the expenditure stream. This is similar to the structure imposed

by Hart [1982] in his discussion of the importance of income distribution in

models of imperfect competition.

   One way to think about this is to view consumption of the non-produced

good, in part, as a proxy for future consumption in an infinite horizon

setting.   In that environment, our (implicit) assumption is that firms (i.e.

their owners) have a higher marginal propensity to save than workers. This

could be explicitly modeled by assuming that workers live many periods but

face credit constraints that limit their participation in capital markets thus

increasing their marginal propensity to consume.      Firms, on the other hand,

have the ability to borrow and lend.       With this approach, workers would be

viewed as "Keynesian consumers" while firms are "life cycle consumers". 6

Instead of formally analyzing these capital market imperfections and working

with the infinite horizon model, we simply assume that workers have a shorter

time horizon than firms and that only workers engage in consumption of the

produced good each period.

   To characterize the equilibrium for this two period model, we first

consider the equilibrium in period 2 taking as given the inventory holdings of

the sector 1 monopolist. We then consider the first period choice problems

and the overall equilibrium.

Period 2 analysis for given Inventories

  In period 2, the sector 1 firm has inventories from the previous period

which we denote by IO This monopolist is interested in maximizing income,

in terms of its consumption good (the non-produced good), and solves


                  1       1           1
(2) maximize p(q2± 11)(q2-4- Il) - w2q2.

Throughout this presentation, superscripts index the sector and subscripts

index the time period.               The demand for sector 1 output comes from the

outsiders and sector 2 workers and is



(3)      q + I h(p)(M1 + qw2 ).


The inverse demand curve in (2), comes directly from (3).                Using (3), the
solution to the monopolist's problem is



         lF             1   1
(4) P2[l- + P2) ] = W2.


where ()            h(p)        < 0 is the inverse of the price elasticity of demand.
                   ph' ()

      Because of the homothetic preferences and constant marginal costs, the

mark-up of prices over marginal cost (the wage rate) is independent of the

level of output.            Thus variations in output and/or inventory holdings will

only influence prices when wages are sensitive to employment levels.

      The maximization problem of the monopolist in sector 2 is identical to that

of the sector 1 monopolist with the restriction that I=O since there are no

inventories in sector 2.            The demand for sector 2 output is given by (3) with

the appropriate changes in the income level of the consunters of good 2. The

solution to the monopolist's optimization problem is therefore




               1
(5)
           [       + (p) ]          W2.




Equations (4) and (5) link the prices in the two sectors to the wage rate in

period 2 through ().            Since both firms hire workers at the same wage and face
                                                                                 9

demand curves with the same elasticities, the prices in the two sectors will

be equal.7 Denote by p2 this common price for period 2.

     Inserting (w2,p2) into the sector demand curves yields- two equations

describing the of output for each of the two sectors at these prices. These

are given by



(6) q = h(p2)(& + w2q)        -
                                  '1   for sector 1 and



        2          -2     1
(7) q2 = h(p2) (M +w2q2 )     for   sector 2.



     For convenience of exposition, (6) is a restatement of (3).     Note that the

demand for sector 2 output depends on the level of output          sales in sector

1.    This is because the linkage between sectors is through the demands of

workers not firms. Hence, a decrease in sector 1 production, perhaps due to

an increase in the inventories held by sector 1 firms, will reduce the demand

for sector 2 output.

     Figure 1 provides a graphical representation of these two curves.       Their

intersection determines the levels of output for the two sectors for given

(w2,p2). For I small, both curves have a positive intercept term and slopes

less than one, since p2>w2 from (5) and ph(p)<l. As the inventory holdings of

sector 1 firms increase, the level of production in that sector will fall at

each level of sector 2 output given (w2,p2).              Since we will ultimately

characterize an equilibrium in which wages and prices will not vary with

these comparative statics will be important in understanding the linkage

between period 1 inventory holdings and the period 2 equilibrium levels of

output and employment.

       The period 1 choice problem of the monopolist in sector 2, the workers and

the outsiders are exactly the same as their period 2 choice problems since

none of these agents solve intertemporal problems. In particular, the sector

2 monopolist's first order condition is given by


         2[                   2 1
(9)     p1j 1 +
                        (p1)      j
                                      = w.

This is identical to (5) except for the change in the decision period.

      The sector 1 monopolist selects an output level and inventory holdings to

(10) max V(4) + V(24)
where

              =
                        (q    +
                                  e1

                        (q2       I1)p2()          w2q2.


Here w2 is the period 2 equilibrium wage anticipated by this firm. The period

2 price function, p() is the inverse demand function that the firm
conjectures for the next period.                           In equilibrium, these conjectures will be

correct.        In the expression for period 1 profits, e1 is the monopolist's

endowment in the first period.                        The first order conditions for this problem

are



(11)
          V'(i4)MR        = V'(ir)M14 and


(12)
          11    1   +             11       = Wi.
         p1 L             e(p1)        j


In    (11), MR refers to the marginal revenue of selling an extra unit of sector

1 output in period t=l,2.                      Expression (12) is analogous to (4) and implies

that within period 1 marginal revenue will equal marginal cost. Using (12)
                                                                                   11

and (4), (11) can be rewritten as



(13) V' (4)w1= V? ()w2


Expression (13) characterizes the intertemporal decision of the monopolist.

The gain to holding more inventories from period 1 to 2 is given by the right

side of (13).    The monopolist saves the labor cost associated with producing

an extra unit times the marginal utility of period 2 income. The cost of

holding inventories is the wage for hiring the extra worker times the marginal

utility of period 1 income. In this economy, as in the Blinder-Fischer [1981]

yeoman farmer model, inventories are used to smooth consumption.

   At these wages and prices, the quantities produced in the two sectors are

given by expressions analogous to (6) and (7). These are



(14) q = h(p1)   (M1 +
                          w1q)   +
                                     I   -
                                             e1
                                                    and



       2           -2        1
(15) q1 = h(p1)(M + w1q1).

Figure 2 provides a graphical representation of these two equations for a

given value of (11-e1).

Equilibrium

   Our interest is in the behavior of the economy in a stationary
underemployment equilibrium where total employment and output is the same each

period and is strictly less than 2N.          To do so, assume that e1=O and that M'=M

in each period so that preferences, endowments and technology are all

stationary and the sectors are symmetric.             Given the symmetry between the

sectors of the economy, the equilibrium wages are independent of time and the

equilibrium prices are independent of time and sector. We denote these by

(w*,p*).

   In an underemployment equilibrium, workers will be indifferent between

working and not. Hence the participation constraint

(16)    Z(w*,p*)=O

will be binding.

   To characterize an underemployment equilibrium, solve for the (w*,p*) that

simultaneously solves (16) and one of the identical mark-up equations, say

(4).   This is an equilibrium if the outputs demanded at these prices are

producible given the technology and number of workers in the economy; i.e.

labor markets clear when (16) holds.     Given the stationarity and symmetry,

this condition must hold in both sectors and time periods and is:



(17) q* h(p*)[M + w*q*] < N



Proposition 1: If H is not too large relative to N, e1=O and M'M for i=l,2,

then there will exist a symmetric, stationary underemployment equilibrium for

this economy with prices and wages determined by (4) and (16) and quantities

determined by demand at these prices.

Proof: See Appendix.

   Figure 3 depicts an equilibrium (w,p) from the crossing of a worker's

indifference curve (16) with one of the mark-up equations, (4).     Note that

multiple equilibria are possible if (p) varies enough to create multiple

crossings of these curves.    This possibility is discussed in Heller [1986].

Uniqueness of equilibrium is guaranteed by assuming a constant elasticity

specification.

   If the conditions for Proposition 1 do not hold, then the economy could be

in a full employment equilibrium.   In that case, the behavior of the economy

in response to shocks is radically different than in the underemployment

regime.   We emphasize the latter case in the analysis to follow and then

return to a discussion of the full employment economy in Section IV of the

paper.

Effects of changes in period 1 endowment

   Consider the effect on the economy of an increase in the endowment of the

monopolist in period 1 at a stationary, underemployment equilibrium.8       This

exercise of varying an endowment is similar to that outlined by Blinder-

Fischer [1981] as a vehicle for understanding the propagation effects of

holding inventories.   There are a number of alternative shocks that could be

considered in this framework such as fluctuations in marginal products and/or

variations in the endowment levels of the outsiders. While this might be of

independent interest, for the purpose of focusing on the propagation effects

of inventories on future production, consumption and employment, the analysis

under either of these two alternatives would be the same as that conducted

here.

   An increase in e1 has two important effects. From (14), the output of the

sector 1 monopolist would fall for given inventory holdings. So, in Figure 2,

this causes a shift down in the line expressing sector 1 output as a function

of sector 2 output in period l. As seen from this figure, this causes a

reduction in sector 2 output as well.         However, from (13), part of this

increase in endowment would be held as inventories by the monopolist.       From

(6), this increased level of inventories will then reduce the sector 1

monopolist's output in period 2. This reduction in sector 1 output in the two

periods spills over to sector 2 because sector 1 employment falls. A decrease

in sector 1 employment reduces demand for sector 2 output since the linkage

across the sectors is based on the demands of the workers. This is seen in

Figure 1 as a shift down   in   the line expressing sector 1 output as a function
                                                                               14

 of sector 2 output in period 2. These effects are summarized by



Proposition 2: An increase in e1 will increase       and reduce q for i=l,2 and

t=l,2.

Proof: From (11), if an increase in e1 increases ir, then I must increase so

that this condition is met. However, the increase in I will not exceed the

increase in e1.   Holding inventories constant and using (12), an increase in

e1 increases ir by MR.       So, in order for (11) to hold, I must increase with

e1 but by less than e1.

   From (14), this implies that period 1 output for sector 1 will fall and

from (6) period 2 output will fall as well.        Since sector 2 output is an

increasing function of sector 1 output (not sales) in both periods, sector 2

output will fall as well.                                             QED.

   The key to this result is the positive interaction across sectors in the

economy. Reduction in sector 1 output in each of the periods is a consequence

of a positive endowment shock and the smoothing behavior of inventory holdings

as the monopolist seeks to spread the endowment increase over time.           The

resulting reduction in sector 1 output spreads to sector 2 through the reduced

demands of the unemployment workers.      Thus these demand spillover effects,

coupled with the persistence created by the holding of inventories, generates

correlated movements in output and employment across sectors and over time.

   In the following section, this result is contrasted with that of a simple

real business cycle model.     It is also useful to contrast Proposition 2 with

an alternative model of coordination failures stemming from the search

behavior of consumers/producers. One such model is that of Diamond [1982] in

which agents decide whether or not to accept production opportunities given

that they must meet a trading partner in order to consume. In this setting,
                                                                                  15

increased inventory holdings by other agents may create incentives for

prospective partners to accept more production opportunities since the

likelihood of meeting a trading partner increases when inventory holdings are

higher.       Thus instead of reducing production in other sectors, higher

inventories actually encourage production.



III. A Real Business Cycle Model with Sectoral Reallocation

    The objective of this section is to construct a real business cycle model

with inventory holdings and to contrast its implications with the results from

Section II.     The model differs from that in Section II both in terms of the

market structure and in the specification of agents' preferences.                 In

particular, we follow the real business cycle literature by assuming that the

market allocation corresponds to the solution of a planner's problem and that

there is a single agent in the economy.             The analysis in this section

highlights the role of sector specific shocks in inducing the sectoral

reallocation of workers.      These differences in assumptions and results are

discussed in some detail in Section IV of the paper.          This section forms a

useful bridge between the economy described in Section II and the Long-Plosser

model.

   Consider a Robinson Crusoe economy in which the single agent has

preferences described by:



(18) flt(Ul(cl) +       U2(c) + U3(m)
                                        -
                                            g(nfl   n= n +   n.

where U1 ()    is   concave, go   is convex and both are twice continuously

differentiable. As in the Section II model, there are two produced goods

(c,c) and one non-produced good (mn) in each period.              Robinson Crusoe is
                                                                                      16

endowed with 2N units of leisure and M units of the non-produced good in each

period. The production technology is given by:


                                  i     1,2
 (19) q f1(n),


where f'> 0 and f't <      0.     Good 1 is storable while good 2 is not.       At the

beginning of period 1, Robinson Crusoe receives an endowment of good 1,         e.
   Robinson Crusoe maximizes utility given by (18) subject to the technology

given by (19) and the following feasibility constraints:


         1         1
(20)    c +            +          for   t=1,2,


(21)    c =    q   and

(22)    rn =


where IO is end-of-period inventories and 10=e1.              As there is no incentive

to hold inventories at the end of period 2, 12 = 0.                   Given this, the

optimality conditions (for an interior solution to                and I) reduce to:



(23) U1'(c)f1'(n) g'(n);                i     1,2; t   1,2

(24) U(c) =

   Expression (23) implies simply that Robinson Crusoe makes his within period
consumption and production decisions so that the marginal utility from the

output produced by one additional unit of labor equals the marginal disutility

of an additional unit of labor.             Expression (24) indicates that inventories

are used to smooth the marginal utility of consumption over time.

  Now consider the same         conceptual    experiment conducted in Section II.    In

particular, consider the effect on the economy of an increase in the endowment
                                                                              17

of good 1 in period 1. As the following proposition demonstrates, in response

to an increase in e1, Robinson Crusoe will reduce his production in sector 1

and shift resources towards the production in sector 2 in both periods.



Proposition 3: An increase in e1 will increase I, decrease q, and increase

q for t = 1,2.

Proof: As long as e1 + q increases in response to the increase in e1, then

both cI and I. I must increase in order to satisfy (24). Further. e.1 + q'
                                                                         1
                                                                           not

increasing would violate (23).      Observe from (23) that the increased

consumption of good 1 in period 1 will induce a reduction in the production of

good 1, which in turn by reducing the marginal disutility of labor induces an

increase in the production and hence consumption of good 2. Further, since I

increases as well this will induce an increase in the consumption of good 1 in

period 2. This, in turn, will induce a similar reduction in the production of

good 1 in period 2 but an increase in the production of good 2 in period 2.

                                                                  QED.

   Overall, we observe that in this setting the co-movements in inventories,

output and employment are very different than those found in the model of

Section II.   In this environment with complete mobility across sectors and

resources necessarily being allocated to their highest value use, inventory

movements in one sector induce substitution of resources away from that sector

to the other sectors of the economy. Thus neither output nor employment vary

together in response to endowment shocks. This contrasts with the co-movement

in output and employment present in the specification of Section II.      In the

subsequent section we discuss what factors underlie the dramatic differences

in the predicted behavior of inventories, output and employment across the two

alternative specifications.
                                                                             18

   Before proceeding, it is useful to bridge the conceptual gap between

Propositions 2 and 3 and the results that emerge from the Long-Plosser

analysis. Their model differs from ours in two important ways.      First, the
shock in their model is sector specific productivity disturbance which occurs

after the determination of factor inputs.    That is, their model contains a

stochastic technology with a production lag while we focus on an endowment

shock.   Second, the use of commodities as inputs in the production of other

commodities provides a mechanism for generating positive co-movements in

production across sectors and time. In the Long-Plosser model, these linkages

are characterized by an input-output matrix with non-zero off-diagonal

elements. Our model has a matrix in which the only linkage across commodities

and time is the holding of sector 1 inventories.

   In contrast to Proposition 3, Long-Plosser demonstrate that their model can

produce correlated movements in output across sectors which reflect the input-

output matrix. As noted earlier, their explicit example yields an allocation

in which employment levels in each sector were constant because of the Cobb-

Douglas preferences.

   To understand the differences between these models, consider a transitory

productivity shock in sector 1 in our model instead of an endowment shock

while retaining the assumption of no production lags.          The optimality

conditions for the planner's problem will equate the marginal disutility of

work with the product of the marginal productivity of labor in a given sector

and the marginal utility of consuming that sector's output (as in (23)).

Suppose that there is a positive productivity shock in sector 1. If U(c) is

not too concave, then employment and output in sector 1 will increase while

sector 2 output and employment will decline.10     Through inventory holdings,

the effects of the productivity shock will be propagated over time. Thus the
                                                                            19

response to a shock to the sector 1 production function would be the

substitution of employment across the sectors just as in Proposition 3 so that

negative correlations in output and employment across sectors would again be

predicted.

   To move a step closer to the Long-Plosser specification, suppose that

sector 1 output is produced with a lag so that period t output in sector 1 is

a function of labor input in period t-l and a shock in period t.      Further,

assume that sector 2 does not have a production lag (i.e. continue to think of

that as a service sector). Then, in an infinite horizon version of the model

(which is needed to avoid the inconsistency of having a final period in a

model with a production lag), a shock to the sector 1 production function in

period t will reduce employment in that sector and cause the substitution of

labor into sector 2.    Output will be higher in both sectors in the period of

the shock though sector 1 output will, on average be lower in the next period

(assuming i.i.d. shocks) due to the reduction of sector 1 labor input. Note

that once again, employment is negatively correlated across sectors as the

productivity shock creates substitution effects.

   As a final step, suppose that we allow the production of commodities by

commodities and assume that labor and other inputs are complements in the

production function, as in the Long-Plosser model. A shock to the sector 1

production function will then cause a decline in the marginal utility of

consuming sector 1 output.     Since some of this additional output is used in

the production of sector 1 goods next period, this increases the marginal

productivity of labor.       Thus, as discussed by Long-Plosser, there is an

ambiguity regarding the response of employment to productivity shocks in the

Long-Plosser setting.    A sufficiently large technological complementarity

between inputs and labor in all sectors relative to the curvature of the
                                                                           20

utility function is required to generate positively correlated movements in

employment.   In a sense, the effect of the technological linkages between

sectors in the Long-Plosser model can be similar to an economy-wide technology

shock inducing both income and substitution effects and hence an ambiguous

effect on employment in each sector.    If, however, there are sectors in the

economy for which the marginal product of labor is xi an increasing function

of the level of intermediate inputs, then employment in these sectors will be

negatively correlated with employment in sectors exhibiting the technological

complementarities.

   The point of this analysis is to demonstrate the importance of the

reallocation of labor in the presence of sector specific technology shocks.

This effect will generally produce negative correlations in sectoral

employment levels.   While a modified version of the Long-Plosser model might

overcome these tendencies, it is not clear whether the specification of

preferences and technology (in particular the required complementarities

between labor and other inputs) is at all reasonable.

IV. Reconciliation

   There are several factors that contribute to the differences in predicted

behavior across the specifications presented in Sections II and III.      One

important element is the imperfect competition of the Section II model. To

see this, consider the equilibrium allocation from a competitive version of

that model. An underemployment equilibrium may arise and is characterized by

simultaneously solving the participation equation (16) and the zero profit

condition of w=p for all t and i.      These two curves are shown in Figure 4

which is a variation on the figure used to characterize the underemployment

equilibrium in the model with imperfect competition.         The competitive

stationary, underemployment solution is given by the (w,p) solving these two
                                                                            21

equations j the resulting quantities demanded are less than N in each sector.

If they are not, then a full employment equilibrium results.

   Since (p)<O, the wage and price levels are higher for the imperfectly

competitive economy than under perfect competition in an underemployment
equilibrium. This is indicated in Figure 3 by the fact that the curve for the

mark-up equation in the imperfectly competitive economy, lies below the 45

degree line.    As a consequence, the set of parameter values for which an

underemployment equilibrium can occur (demand at (w*,p*) less than N) with

perfect competition is a subset of that for imperfect competition.

   Given that underemployment can occur with perfect competition, what is the

contribution of imperfect competition to the analysis?     Because prices and

wages are higher due to imperfect competition, the likelihood that the economy

will be in an underemployment equilibrium is higher.1'         That is, if the

parameters describing the economy were chosen randomly at the start of the

model, than the consequence of the imperfect competition is to increase the

probability that the stationary equilibrium will be in the underemployment

region.   As a consequence, the propagation effects of inventories on output

and employment discussed above are more likely to occur.

   This argument is further strengthened by noting that there are environments

in which an underemployment equilibrium occurs only if some agents have market

power.    Hart [1982] provides such an example in which the market power of

workers in the labor market supports an underemployment equilibrium in an

economy for which all perfectly competitive equilibria are full employment

solutions. Heller [1987] describes an economy in which workers have a zero

value for leisure so that all competitive equilibria are full employment

allocations.    In that setting, Heller describes the possibility of an

underemployment solution.   In our model, setting k=O would sever the linkage
                                                                              22

between sectors since wages would be driven to zero and workers would have no

income to spend on the other sector. This problem can be circumvented either

by allowing firms to spend some of their income in the other sector or by

considering a contracting solution in the labor markets in which workers have

some bargaining power.12

   The point of the emphasis on underemployment equilibria is that the results

reported in Proposition 2 only hold in the underemployment region.      In the

event that the economy is at a full employment solution, we obtain results

very similar to the real business cycle model of Section III.     That is, an

increase in initial inventories in a particular sector induces a reduction in

the production in that sector and a shift of resources towards the other

sector.    Thus the empirical observation that employment is positively

correlated across sectors over the cycle (see the discussion in the next

section) is produced by an economy operating in the underemployment region.

   Another important part of the Section II model is the extreme nature of the

disutility of work and the restriction to {O,l) employment. This approach is

used to create employment variations rather than hours.    The fact that k is

common to all workers creates an inverted L-shaped labor supply curve and

hence the two regimes noted above.13 As a consequence, the behavior of the

economy across the two regimes is vastly different. If the disutility of work

was continuously increasing and convex as in the Section III model, then wages

and prices would vary with output and employment and this would reduce the

impact on production and employment of the demand linkages across the sectors.

   In fact, it is the convexity of the function characterizing the disutility

of work in the Section III model that creates the negative correlations in

employment since setting g(n)=kn would sever the connection between the
sectors.   As a consequence, shocks to one sector would have no effect on
                                                                            23

output and employment in the other sector.

   Finally, the model explored in Section III contains strong assumptions

about the preferences of workers and firms. As discussed earlier, workers are

"Keynesian consumers" in that their consumption of produced goods is sensitive

to their income while firms only consume the non-produced good (a proxy for

future consumption). This structure creates a linkage between the production

in one sector and the output level of the other sector which is absent from

the real business cycle model of Section III. In the latter model, consumers

are effectively aggregated and their preferences over produced goods are

represented by the functions U(c) for i=l,2 and t=l,2.

   To see the importance of the differences in tastes, suppose that in the

Section II model, workers and firms had identical homothetic preferences.

Then, total demand for each good would simply depend on aggregate income as if

there was only a single consumer. Spending on each sector would then depend

only on the revenues generated by production in the other sector and not the

decomposition of these revenues into profits and wages. As a consequence, the

optimal sales of the sector firm would be independent of the endowment and

inventory holding of that firm and the level activity in sector 2 would be

independent of these variables as well.      Thus, fluctuations in sector 1

inventories caused by variations in e1, would p spillover to activities in

sector 2.

   Overall, the models in Sections II and III capture some important forces in

the effects of sectoral shocks on employment at the disaggregated level. The

specification of preferences coupled with the operation of the economy in an

underemployment region produces positive co-movements in the model of Section

II. Sector specific shocks however may cause the substitution of workers from

one sector to another as captured by the simple real business cycle of Section
                                                                           24

III.      While these sectoral reallocation effects may be reduced by mobility

costs, as in Rogerson [1987], they tend to produce negatively correlated

employment fluctuations.



V. Empirical Implications

   The models explored in Sections II and III have interesting empirical

implications regarding fluctuations in output, employment and inventories both

over the cycle and across sectors. In particular, the analysis suggests that

models with imperfect competition may generate time series with different

properties than perfectly competitive economies.    To emphasize an important

message, imperfectly competitive economies are, on average, predicted to

exhibit less substitution across activities than their perfectly competitive

counterparts.

   One difficulty with confronting these models with data concerns the source

of fluctuations in the economy.      In most of our formal models we rely on

endowment shocks to the inventoriable good as the initial source of
fluctuations.     Broadly speaking, these disturbances can be interpreted as

resulting from sector specific shocks to tastes or technology. However, we

have not formally examined whether the models of perfect and imperfect

competition respond differently to aggregate demand and technology shocks.'4

We conjecture though, that once inventories holdings respond to temporary

shocks, our results that imperfectly competitive economies tend to exhibit

positive correlations in employment and output in subsequent periods will

remain.

  One important implication of our work is that inventory holdings in some

sectors of the economy create correlated behavior in output over time in all

sectors of the economy. This is a consequence of the demand spillovers across
                                                                              25

sectors in a given time period.      Thus one need not appeal to inventory

holdings in all sectors of the economy as an explanation for observed

correlated behavior economy-wide.

   Another important implication of our analysis concerns the co-movement of

output and employment across sectors of the economy. The analysis in Section

II suggests that through the mark-ups of price over marginal cost, imperfectly

competitive economies are more likely to be in an underemployment region and

hence exhibit positively correlated fluctuations in output and employment. In

contrast, the models explored in Section III are more likely to imply that

employment fluctuations are negatively correlated across sectors.      Shocks to

production functions in one sector of the economy cause a reallocation of

labor services from one sector to another. In their most extreme forms, the

imperfectly competitive economies thus have predictions about employment

fluctuations which contrast quite sharply with models of perfect competition.

   To fully analyze the empirical predictions of the models in Sections II and

III is beyond the scope of this paper. However, a brief examination of the

data on employment across sectors is instructive to identify relevant

empirical regularities. In this regard, we examine the time series and cross

section behavior of employment across         sectors.       Table   1 presents
contemporaneous correlations of employment across sectors. The data used are

monthly observations on total manhours by sector for 1947:1 to 1985:12. The

data used to produce the tables are log values, detrended with linear and

quadratic time trends.15

   Several features are worth noting from Table 1.       First, virtually all of

the off-diagonal terms are positive and several are quite large in magnitude.

This indicates that employment exhibits substantial positive co-movements

across sectors over the cycle. Further, the inventory holding sectors of the
                                                                             26

economy (i.e., manufacturing, and wholesale and retail trade) are quite

important in this regard.      That is, employment in the inventory holding

sectors is highly and positively correlated with employment in the non-

inventory holding sectors (e.g. ,   services).
   There are, of course, several potential explanations for the observed

positive co-movements across sectors. One explanation that is consistent with

much of the existing macroeconomics literature is that these sectors are

subject to common shocks. To shed some light on this difficult issue, Table 2

provides the correlations from the residuals from a VAR estimation using this

sectoral employment data.    Specifically, we estimated a VAR with the eight

employment series using log values, a lag length of six and including linear

and quadratic time trends in the estimation. Under some circumstances (see

Sims [1980]), the residuals from this VAR estimation can be interpreted as the

innovations to the respective series.      Under this interpretation, examining

the off diagonal elements of this correlation matrix provides evidence on

whether innovations (shocks) are correlated across sectors.        Further, by
comparing the off diagonal elements from Table 2 to those of Table 1, one can

gain some perspective on how much of the observed positive co-movements

indicated in Table 1 are due to common shocks.

   A comparison of Tables 1 and 2 suggests that the observed positive co-

movements are not primarily due to common shocks.            For example, the

correlation in Table 1 between manufacturing and services is 0.63 but the

corresponding correlation in Table 2 is 0.08. This suggests that in this case

common shocks account for less than one seventh of the observed positive co-

movement in manufacturing and service employment. Other comparisons tend to

yield similar conclusions, although there are a few exceptions.

   Another key issue is the nature of and the relationship between the
                                                                           27

persistence in the employment movements across the sectors. Table 3 presents

the first order own and cross correlations across the sectors. Observe that

the detrended employment series all exhibit a high and similar degree of

positive serial correlation.     Further, the cross lagged correlations are

mostly positive and often large in magnitude. Note in particular that the

correlation between lagged values of employment in the inventory holding

sectors are highly correlated with contemporaneous values of employment in all

other sectors.     This suggests that changes in employment in the inventory

holding sectors often precede changes in employment in the non-inventory

holding sectors.

   While these results are only suggestive, they are consistent with the

predicted patterns of Section II but are not consistent with the predicted

patterns of Section III.       That is, there are positive co-movements in

employment fluctuations across sectors which does not appear to be due to

sectors experiencing common shocks.   All sectors exhibit a high and similar

degree of positive serial correlation. The inventory holding sectors seem to

play a fundamental role in this regard as changes in employment in the

inventory holding sectors precede and contemporaneously move with changes in

employment in the non-inventory sectors.



VI. Conclusions

  The twin observations of serially correlated output movements and positive

co-movements in output across sectors of a multi-sector economy are two

important "stylized facts" that guide macroeconomic researchers.          The

important paper by Long-Plosser [1983] provides one possible explanation for

these features based on the normality of consumption goods in preferences and

a technology which allows for the production of commodities by commodities.
                                                                            28

As a consequence, the linkage highlighted in their paper are intersectoral

demands for intermediate goods.

   This paper investigates an alternative approach which stresses linkages

across sectors from the demand for consumption goods and the presence of

imperfect competition. The market power of sellers produces an environment in

which an underemployment equilibrium is likely to arise. In that case, shocks

to one sector of the economy spillover to others and generate positively

correlated output and employment movements. The linkage across time explored

in this paper is the holding of inventories by a subset of agents in the

economy.    Because of the demand linkages across sectors, the holding of

inventories by some firms is enough to produce correlated output movements in

all sectors.

   This model is then contrasted with a real business cycle model without the

factor demand flows stressed by Long-Plosser.    For that setting, positively

correlated employment fluctuations across sectors is not likely to occur.

Instead, shocks to one sector will generally generate a substitution of

factors to one sector from the others.     Hence, the predictions of the two

models with regards to employment fluctuations are quite different.

   Drawing on these implications, we investigated detrended data on employment

fluctuations.    Our primary finding was positive co-movement in sectoral

employment over the cycle which does not appear to be due simply to sectors

experiencing common shocks. We interpret these findings as supportive of both

the model of imperfect competition explored in Section II of the paper and a

version of the Long-Plosser model in which technological complementarities

dominate.   These results do appear to be contrary to the predictions of many

simple real business cycle models in which sector specific shocks induce the

sectoral reallocation of labor.
                                                                           29

   Our analysis leaves open a number of interesting and important questions.

First, we have only analyzed a two period model and have interpreted the

differences between worker and shareholder preferences as a difference in

savings behavior. One important extension of our model would therefore be to

derive these differences more explicitly.   One avenue would be to allow the

firms as an institution to be infinitely lived. Shareholders could live for

finite periods of time and be able to operate in capital markets while workers

would live for a single period. In this setting, the non-produced good could

act as a store of value for shareholders, i.e. it could simply be money so

that the demand for this good was a means of obtaining future consumption.

Owing to their single period of life, which is a proxy for exclusion from

capital markets, workers would have no demand for this good.

   Second, we have not really incorporated into our analysis any intertemporal

strategic interactions. While these are apparently not necessary to generate

the time series and cross-sector variations of interest in this paper, these

interactions by themselves might be worthy of attention.

  Third, firms hold inventories in our model as a store of value. While this

is analytically convenient, this is unlikely to be the only (key) reason for

inventory holdings. In future work, we plan to integrate into our analysis a

more reasonable rationale for inventory holdings along the lines of production

bunching as discussed by Ramey [19871.16 Nonetheless, we conjecture that the

dynamic effects of inventories will remain even in a setting with a richer

explanation for inventory holdings.

  Finally, a full comparison of this approach with that of Long-Plosser to

understanding co-movements across sectors seems warranted and would best be

achieved by the construction of a model which incorporated in it markets for

both final goods and intermediate products. This would allow us to evaluate
                                                                          30

the role of imperfect competition at each stage of the production process and

to, perhaps, explore the causal linkages between sectors linked together by

both factor and final goods demands.                          -
                                                                            31

                        Appendix: Proof of Proposition 1



   First, we must demonstrate that if e1=O and M'=M, then (4) and (16) will

characterize the prices and wages in an underemployment equilibrium. Because

of the homothetic preferences, the price of each good in each period will be

the same. Hence the wage rates must be the same each period for (16) to hold.

Since marginal revenue is assumed to be a monotonically increasing function of

price, prices will be the same each period.

   We must verify that (w*,p*) solving (4) and (16) exist.      Figure 3 is a

graphical representation of (4) and (16). Marginal revenue, d[p(1+(p)]/dp, is

assumed to be strictly positive so that the graph of (4) has a strictly

positive slope for all p.     As p-O, so must w. Otherwise, the worker would

obtain infinite utility from positive w at p=O.      The slope of (16) is the

workers level of spending on the produced good which goes to infinity as p-'O

and approaches 0 as         These two limit properties plus the quasi-convexity

of the indirect utility function implies that there will be at least one

crossing in Figure 3.

   To show that the left side of (17) expresses output in each period for each

sector, note that (13) is satisfied at 11=0 so that the sectors are identical

over time. Hence the solution will be symmetric and if (17) is satisfied, the

quantities demanded can be produced so that an underemployment equilibrium

will occur.   Clearly, this condition is more likely to be satisfied if N is

large and M small.

1. Long-Plosser present simulation of output fluctuations in a multi-sector
setting using their model of factor demand linkages but do not discuss
employment variations. We provide empirical evidence in Section V of this
paper on employment fluctuations.

2. There is a literature on sectoral flows of workers in the presence of
sector specific shocks.  See, Lilien [1982] and Abraham-Katz [1986] for a
discussion of these flows and their relation to aggregate economic activity.
Rogerson [1987] discusses sectoral flows in a two-period model with sector
specific shocks. His model implies negative correlations in employment levels
as workers move from one sector to another.

3. Strictly speaking, imperfect competition is not necessary for the effects
discussed here to occur.    As discussed in Section IV, the market power of
firms increases the probability that the economy will be in an underemployment
region.

4. This assumption of competitive labor markets is reasonable if the economy
was composed of a large number of monopolized sectors.     In our two sector
model, this assumption is a bit strong. Cooper [1986] analyzes an alternative
way of characterizing labor market equilibrium through a contracting process
in which the variations in the market power of workers and firms are easily analyzed.

5. Additional properties of the demand curves are discussed in Hart [1982].

6. Zeldes [1985] provides empirical      evidence that liquidity constraints are
important for explaining consumption     behavior.  Dynarski and Sheffrin [1987]
argue that the consumption behavior      is dependent upon an agent's employment
status which is consistent with the      proposition that unemployed workers are
liquidity constrained.

7. We assume that marginal revenue is a strictly increasing function of p.

8.  If there are multiple equilibria, they will generically be locally unique
so that in response to variations in e1, the equilibrium is assumed to vary in
the neighborhood of the chosen stationary equilibrium. See Cooper [1987] for
a discussion of selection for economies of this type.

9. Figures 1 and 2 should be be viewed as representing quantity interactions
across sectors at the equilibrium prices (w*,p*) characterized in Proposition
1.   The economy will remain in an underemployment equilibrium if it starts
there for a sufficiently small change in e1.

10. Even if U() is so concave that income effects dominate, as long as go is
strictly convex, productivity shocks still generate substitution of employment
across sectors.

11.   Similar   arguments appear in Cooper [1986] and Hall [1987a].

12. This approach is described in Cooper [1986].
13. One objection to this approach is that this specification appears to
contradict evidence that the labor supply of full-time workers is relatively
inelastic. Our model is primarily concerned with variations of employment on
the extensive margin for which the evidence is much less conclusive. See
Hansen [1985] and Hall [1987a,l987b] for discussions of this point.

14. The discussion at the end of Section III provides a preliminary extension
of Proposition 3 to technology shocks. See Cooper [1986] for a discussion of
demand and supply disturbances in a model of imperfect competition.

15. We also considered alternative detrending methods, such as log first
differences.  Results on correlations in employment changes across sectors
were similar to those reported in Tables 1 and 2. However, this approach did
seem to over difference the data and hence generate some negative serial
correlation.

16. One possibility we will explore is a production bunching model in which
firms incur a fixed cost of 'starting up the plant" and a low marginal cost up
to capacity.    This setting is described by Ramey [1987] as capturing the
technology of a number of industries and implies that production is more
volatile as sales as suggested by recent empirical evidence (see, for example,
Blinder [1986]).
