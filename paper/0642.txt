                        The Relation Between Vocational Training
                          in High School and Economic Outcomes

       This   paper examines estimated relationships between economic outcomes
and vocational training in high school. We find that these relationships
are   relatively robust with respect to variation in the way that type and

quality of vocational training is measured as well as with respect to a

number of other variations in specification. None of the evidence we have

developed supports a view that vocational training for male students in high

school produces any special skills that are valued by firms beyond those

that are produced by a general high school education. The evidence does

suggest that in the early 70's commercial—business programs taken by young

women did produce such valued skills. But the evidence pertaining to

later years is inconclusive.

    This paper is concerned with analyzing empirically the labor market

effects of vocational programs inhigh schools. Such an analysis is of

interest because it is an important part of any evaluation of this major

program. It is also timely because the Vocational Education Act is to

be considered for renewal this year.

     There have been a number of studies analyzing the labor market

effects of high school vocational training. Many of these studies use

data from a single labor market, but recently studies based on a national

data sample have appeared.' Notable among these are the studies by

Grasso and Shea (l979b) and Meyer and Wise (1979)    Despite the

availability of these studies, however, several important questions

remain unanswered. This paper will attempt to shed some light on two

of these questions.

     First, there is the issue of the robustness of previous estimates.

Are these estimates sensitive to the way the high school program is

measured, to the sample used, to the group of control variables included

in the regressions, to the time period studied, to the particular

cohort or cohorts chosen, etc.? An awareness of the reliability of

estimates is important if empirical analyses are to be used responsibly

in evaluating vocational training in high schools.

     1For surveys of this literature, see Stromsdorfer (1972) and Grasso
and Shea (l979a).

     2Other such studies include Creech, et. al. (1977) and lolfi, et.
al. (1978).
                                    2



        The second issue concerns the relationship between vocational

training programs and the labor markets. If vocational programs are

large, the supply of vocational training graduates may reduce the

returns to vocational training in relation to those of non-vocational

graduates, even though the vocational education is producing useful

skills. Under such circumstances, simple comparisons between the

labor market experience of vocational program graduates and others may

provide misleading information not only as to the size, but: even as to

the existence of skills production in high school vocational programs.1

The problem with the simple comparisons is that they reflect not the

total   contribution of vocational training, but the contribution of a
marginal increment of the amount of that training.
     These   issues will be addressed using data from two large national

longitudinal surveys —-   the National Longitudinal Survey conducted at

Ohio State University (the Parnes data) and the National Longitudinal

Survey of the High School Class of 1972. We will attempt to determine

whether findings gleaned from least squares multiple regression

analysis tell a consistent story about differences in outcomes for

those who terminate their education after high school, and if not,

why not.

     More specifically, to determine the reliability of parameter

estimates, we estimate equations which are designed to answer the

following questions:      (1) Are similar results obtained when

the relation of market outcomes to high school program is estimated with

the Parnes data as when it is estimated with data from the Class of


     'This is shown in Gustman and Steinmeier (1980).
                                      3


1972 Survey? (2) Do the findings vary with the date of the survey, the

cohort analyzed, and the age at the time of the survey?       (3) How are

these findings affected by the inclusion or exclusion of several

variables (e.g., union membership or job tenure) which may not be

strictly exogenous with regard to labor market experience?       (4) Does

better measurement of vocational training (e.g., number of vocational

courses taken, detailed field of study, and type of high school

attended)    affect estimated parameters? (5) What is the effect of
standardizing for interarea differences in the wage level and in
youth unemployment rates?
     In order to explore possible influences of     the size of vocational

programs    on the   measured returns to vocational education, we employ a

model in which the relative supplies of vocational and non—vocational

graduates influence the wage differential between them. The model we

use is described in detail in ourearlier paper. If vocational programs

do produce useful skills, this model contains implications for equations

explaining not only economic outcomes, but also enrollment rates in

the programs. These implications are tested by comparing the

predictions from the model with results obtained when reduced form

equations are estimated. We then conduct a further test by applying

a maximum likelihood estimating technique man effort to estimate the

structural supply and demand equations underlying the equations

explaining economic outcomes and enrollment patterns.

     It should be noted that although we hope to shed some light on two

important issues regarding vocational education, the remaining gaps in

our knowledge about this subject are quite large. There has been very
                                   4



little behavioral analysis and virtually no formal modeling of the role

of high school vocational training. We simply do not know how vocational

training in high school fits into a standard labor market model. One

possibility, noted in our previous paper, is that vocational training

substitutes for some type of general training that would otherwise be

provided by employers on the job and paid for by a reduction in

wages. Alternatively, vocational training may reduce the cost of

specific training on the job. We know so little about the skills

produced by high school vocational training that we cannot tell whether

the range of skills effectively augmented by the high school program is

very narrow in scope, proving useful in only a limited number of

occupations, or whether it is quite broad, improving productivity and/

or reducing training costs in a wide variety of later jobs.1 It is

possible that learning of vocational skills takes place at the expense

of learning basic skills. Thus a vocational program student may have

augmented productivity in some areas, but diminished productivity in

others     Perhaps high school vocational training provides information
about the job market that otherwise could only be gained through the
kind   of search and trial and error process that many think is

responsible formuchof youth unemployment. If this is so, one might

find that vocational program graduates make better risks for firm

investments   in specific training and that for this reason they might

exhibit both lower turnover rates and age—earnings profiles that differ



         related discussion is contained in Grubb (1979).
                                    5



from those of general program graduates) We are still a long way from

understanding fully the way in which vocational training affects labor

market outcomes, if it does at all, and for this reason some amount of

caution should still be exercised in interpreting the results of

estimates of differentials between vocational and non-vocational gradu-

ates.


I.      Robustness with Respect to Year, Cohort and Survey


        The evidence gleaned from the Parnes data by Grasso and Shea (l979b)

suggests that women graduates of commercial (business and office) programs

in the high school have higher earninqs and a more favorable employment

experience than women graduates of other programs with comparable years

of schooling. However, those who attended vocational programs that are

not commercial have earnings that are no different from those of women

graduates of other educational proqrams. In the case of men, there

appears to be no discernible difference in earnings between male

qraduates of vocational and of other nroqrams. Using data for males

from the High School Class of 1972 Survey, Meyer and Wise (1979) have

found no evidence of an association between the student having taken

any job training in hiqh school, and later earnings.2


     1For an analysis of the relation of job search to firm specific
training and labor turnover, see Leighton and Mincer (1979).

     2tising data for October 1972, Nolfi et. al. (p. 83) found positive
but insignificant differences in earnings between females who enrolled
in vocational, as opposed to general or academic programs in high school.
For males, earnings of vocational program graduates were lower than
earnings of academic or general program graduates, but again the
difference was not statistically significant. These regressions stan-
dardized for background, ability scores, nd other characteristics.
Observations for blacks and whites were pooled and a dummy iariable for
race was included, constraining the coefficients on the indicators of
high school program to be the same for both race groups.
                                  6


     To   gain some insight about the robustness of these results to
chngs     in th year, the rohort. and the survey data employed, we

analyzed data for two different groups of individuals, both of whom were about

the same age at the time the data were collected. One group was the

Parnes cohort that was 17 years old at the time of the initial Parnes

survey. At the time of the 1972 survey, from which our data are taken,

this group would have been 21 years old. This year was chosen because

it was the year used by Grasso and Shea in deriving their results.

The other group came from the High School Class of 1972 Survey. Data

from this group was taken from 1976, four years after qraduation. For

both groups, we include only individuals who did not attain any formal

education behond high school. and who were not enrolled durinq the

year of the survey.1 The differences between the two groups which

are of interest to us are that they are in different cohorts, that

the information refers to two different calendar years, and that they

are interviewed in two different surveys.

     Table 1 presents means of usual weekly earnings and weeks employed

last year according to the type of high school nrocram completed, sex,

and race for each of the two groups.2 The fiqures in parentheses


     'We also eliminated from the sample all those who did not work in
the week preceding the survey, either because they chose not to partici-
pate in the labor force, or because they could not find a lob, and those
who did not report a value for usual weekly earnings or reported a zero
value. The resultinq possibility of self-selection bias is discussed
at the end of this section.

     2Figures on weeks worked are not strictly comparable between the
samples of women and men in the Parnes survey or between the two surveys.
In the Class of 1972 Survey, weeks worked refers to the previous calendar
year. while in the Parnes survey this variable refers to the time since
the last survey, which may have been takei sliqhtly more or less than
an exact calendar year after the previous survey.

 Table 2 presents analogous regression coefficients for the various

 classifications. In these regressions, dummy variables were entered

 for the various possible high school programs, and additional variables

were entered to standardize for the effects of parent's socioeconomic

 status, achievement on a test score? and residence in an SMSA. In

these regressions, the dummy variable for a general high school program

is omitted, so the coefficients in Table 2 measure diffeiences relative

to general program graduates in the same sex-race classification. A

quick inspection of Tables 1 and 2 reveals that the estimated coefficients

in the regression equations of Table 2 reflect fairly closely differences

in the sample means of Table 1.

     For men, the two surveys appear to tell much the same story. The

data in Table 1 indicate that for this group, vocational programs other

than business and commercial are more common than business and commercial

programs. White male graduates of vocational programs other than

business and commercial have earnings estimated in Table 2 to be around

$20 per week greater than comparable graduates of general programs,

although the difference is riot statistically significant. For black

males, the figure for graduates of programs other than commercial and

business is about $20 less than the figure for general graduates, while

business and commercial graduates of both races have a small positive

earnings advantage over general program graduates. None of these

differences are statistically significant either.      Much the same can

be said of the effect of vocational programs on work experience, as

measured by weeks employed in the previou5 year. Vocational programs

of both types influence weeks worked in a generally positive direction,

hut again none of the differences emerge as statistically significant.

      Among females, the effects of vocational programs is fairly uniform

between whites and blacks, but there are sharp differences in the results

of the two surveys. For the Parnes group, vocational programs have a

general positive impact on both usual weekly earnings and for weeks

employed. The effect of business and commercial programs (the most

common   vocational   programs among women) on usual weekly earnings is

statistically significant for white females. The result matches the

findings of Grasso and Shea, who did much the same regression except

that they included several cohorts in their analysis and added an

experience variable which presumably captured the age—wage profile)

      Using data from the Class of 1972, the results for women are almost

exactly reversed. For this group, vocational programs seem to depress

both usual weekly earnings and weeks employed for both white and black

women, though the only place where this effect is statistically

significant is for weeks employed by black female graduates of business

and commercial programs. The differences between the results using

the Parnes data and the Class of 1972 data cannot be attributed to

small sample sizes. For the Parnes data, business and office training

improved weekly earnings by $23, a figure which is not only statistically

significant but also represents over 25 percent of the average weekly

earnings for the sample. The Class of 1972 data failed to confirm this

result in spite of the fact that the sample size was almost six times

as large.

   The above regression used only a single cohorc because we wanted to
have comparable regressions for the Parnes group and the Class of 1972
group, and only a single cohort is available for the latter group.

      The discrepancy between the results for the Parnes 21—year-old

 group in 1972 and the Class of 1972 group in 1976 may arise from one

 of two sources. Either there was something which changed between 1972

 and 1976 which caused the returns to business and commercial training

to drop between the two years, or there was something about the way in

which the two surveys were conducted which contributed to this result.

To gain some insight into which of these explanations is correct, we

tried two approaches.

     One approach was to take a group from the Parnes data who were 21

years old in 1976. For a couple of reasons, this could be done only

approximately. First, the Parnes study conducted surveys in 1975 and

1977, but not in 1976. The 1975 survey was used because by 1977 the

youngest cohort in the Parnes study was 23 years old. Even in the 1975

survey, there was but one 21 year old working graduate of a commercial

and business program in the sample. To include a reasonable number of

these graduates in the regressions, the sample was extended to include

women who were either 21 or 22 years old in 1975.

     The results of these regressions are reported in Table 3l By

comparing the two lines of Table 3 with the third and fourth lines of

Table 1, it is seen that the significant positive coefficient in 1972

for the effect of business and commercial programs on the weekly

earnings of white females appears to have largely vanished by 1975.

The positive, significant, estimated effect of other vocational programs

for the sample of white females reflects the earnings of the single


     'An additional variable reflecting years of work experience was
added to these regressions, as was done by Grasso and Shea in their
regressions which included more than a single coiiort.

 white female who enrolled in a vocational program other than office and

 business. Since there is no evidence in any of the other sample of

 strong, positive returns for women to vocational training outside of

 the business and office program, this result should be treated with

 due skepticism.

     Another approach was to estimate regressions using the full data

set in the Parnes study, and to introduce dummy variables to allow for

differences in survey years and age groups. The Parnes data set includes

eight survey years from 1968 to 1977, and it uses eleven age cohorts

who were 23 to 33 years old by 1977. In these regressions, we separated

the constant into roughly 80 dummy variables for various combinations

of age and survey years for which we had observations on women who were

working high school graduates. The dummy variables for both types of

vocational education were similarly divided into separate variables for

the different age—survey year combinations. This allows the estimated

impact of both types of vocational education to vary from survey year

to survey year and among the various age groups.

     Table 4 reports the estimated coefficients for the dummy variables

which represent business and commercial training in the weekly earnings

equation.1 The coefficient for 2l—year-olds in 1972 is $18.74 and is

significant. This is close to the results that we found in Table 2 for

regressions using this cohort and survey year along. Similarly, the

coefficient for 22—year-olds in 1975 is slightly negative and insignif-

icant, corresponding well to the results for that group shown in Table 3.

     The aspect of Table 4 that we are most interested in is the change in

the impact of commercial and business training over time for

people in their early 20's. The only age bracket for which we have

results in all the survey years is the 24-year—old bracket, and for this

bracket there does appear to be some evidence for a decline in the

returns to business and commercial training between the 1971—1972 period

and the later surveys. If we consider the 22—24—year—old age bracket,

we can look at the average effect during the years up tol975. These

average effects which are simply the mean of the three coefficient

estimates for these ages, are computed and shown in the bottom row of

Table 4. Again, the figures suggest that the returns to commercial

and business training declined between the early 1970's and later years,

although the evidence on the time trend of these returns cannot be

regarded as conclusive. In any case, one thing does seem clear: The

high coefficient found for 2l-year—olds in 1972 does not seem to be

typical of other ages and cohorts. Of the 74 coefficients reported in

Table 4, only three are numerically greater than the coefficient for

21—year—olds in 1972.

     Why might the returns to business and commercial training have

declined for women between 1971—72 and 1975-76? The different time

periods are characterized by differences in the state of the overall

labor market. In 1972, the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent, while

in 1976 it was 7.7 percent. However, one cannot explain a decline in

the earnings differential between female vocational and female general

program graduates on the basis of cyclical variation of the skilled-

unskilled wage differential. The reason is that skill differentials

are more likely to narrow in tight labor markets as unskilled workers
                                ic


are upgraded into skilled jobs. On these grounds, one might have expected

smaller returns to vocational training in the tighter market of 1972,

not larger ones.'

     Anotn.er possible explanation for the declining differential is

that basic supply conditions changed between the two periods. Specifically,

according to the survey of the class of 1972, and also according to data

from the latest relevant cohort obtainable from the Parnes survey

consisting of those who terminated their education after graduating from

high school in 1970-71, 36 percent of white females were graduating from

commercial—business programs.2 In contrast, for the Parnes sample of

graduates in 1968 who similarly terminated their education after high

school, only 21 percent of the white females were enrolled in business

and office programs.3 The additional supply of female business and

commercial graduates may have eroded their wage advantage, a proposition

which is discussed in more detail in Section III.




    1For a general discussion of the phenomenon and an analysis of the
exception provided by the construction industry, see Gustman and Segal
(1974).


     2One must be careful in comparing means for program enrollment
across surveys. The Program definitions in the Parnes survey are based
on the individual's response, while the class of 1972 data are based
on school records.
      Corresponding figures for black females are 18 percent of the
1968 graduates and 36 percent of the 1970—71 graduates, but these
percentages are based on sample sizes so small as to make them of
questionable reliability.

     3Consistent with Crasso and Shea, for   the sample of females who
report they completed exactly twelve years   of education, the year of
graduation from high school is taken to be   the year in which the youth
was 17 years old during the January survey   month.

     Before closing this section, a few words are in order about our

reliance on ordinary least squares regression analysis, since the nature

of the problem might appear to present econometric difficulties

requiring more sophisticated techniques. One such difficulty is the

fact that there is self-selection into the groups of vocational and

non-vocational graduates we observe. This self-selection goes on at

two levels: First, the decision as to the kind of program in which to

enroll during high school, and then the decision about whether or not

to work after graduation. Self-selection bias occurs if people with

unobserved characteristics leading to greater wages tend to end up

preferentially in one group or the other. In a comparison between

vocational and general program graduates, however, it is not clear

a priori which direction this bias shouldtake,and attempts by Meyer

and Wise to detect this kind of problem did not yield any evidence that

it affected estimated wage equations (although it did seem to play a

role in equations explaining employment after graduation).

     Another difficulty is that a model explaining the determination of

the employment experiences of vocational and non-vocational graduates

may not yield the kind of simple equations that are estimated with

ordinary least squares. More complicated specifications may, in general,

be estimated by maximum likelihood, but only at the cost of introducing

much more specific assumptions about the structure of the model. If

these assumptions are correct, parameter estimates may be improved, but

if they are not, the estimates may well deteriorate with the more

complicated technique. This is the case with the maximum likelihood

estimation of the model discussed in Section lIT of this parer, or with
                                  1

any other attempts to estimate structural parameters underlying wage or

earnings equations.

     A third difficulty pertains only to the weeks worked equation.

Weeks worked is bounded by zero from below and, more importantly, by

52 weeks from above. This suggests that this equation is more properly

estimated by the "Tobit" technique, which allows for truncated dependent

variables. Given the costs of implementing this technique, and the

lack of serious discrepancies between the stories told by usual weekly

earnings equations (which are not subject to this problem) and weeks

worked equations, we have not done so.


II. Other Aspects of Robustness

     In this section we will investigate the sensitivity of coefficient

estimates to several modifications not considered in the last section.

Specifically, we will discuss the robustness of the estimates with

respect to the following changes:     (i) alternative measures of economic

outcomes, (ii) changes in the set of variables used to standardize the

regressions, (iii) inclusion of variables which are really intervening

variables in the effect of vocational training on labor market outcomes,

(iv) alternative measures of participation in vocational training

programs, and (v) inclusion of measures to standardize for interarea

differences in wage level and in unemployment rates. The general

conclusion of this section is that parameter estimates are fairly

robust with respect to these kinds of changes.

    Alternative Measures of Economic Outcomes.

     Two alternative measures of economic outcomes were considered in

addition to weekly earnings and weeks worked. These were the hourly wage
                                   19



and yearly earnings from labor. Hourly wage equations analogous to the

equations presented in the last section were run for both the Parnes

groups and the Class of 1972 group, and yearly earnings equations were

run for the Parnes groups. Unfortunately, the Class of 1972 question-

naires did not contain a separate question specifically asking about

yearly earnings from labor; the closest question inquired about wages,

salaries, commissions, or net income from a business or farm" and was

in   some instances clearly contaminated by   non—labor income.

      With   two exceptions, the patterns of signs and levels of signifi-
cance   of the coefficient estimates using these alternative dependent

variables closely matches the pattern with weekly earnings. One

difference is that for black females in the 1972 Parnes Survey, the

coefficient of business and commercial training in the hourly wage

equation is significant at the 90% level, whereas the analogous

coefficient in the weekly earnings equation in Table 2 was slightly

below significance, with a t—statistic of 1.60. The second difference

is that the anomolous results in Table 3 for white females in vocational

programs other than business and commercial (which we noted previously

was based on a single individual) does not carry over into the hourly

wage or yearly earnings equations. Both of these differences woui, if

anything, strengthen the general conclusion of the last section, namely,

that there was a significant impact of business and commercial training

on the labor market experience of women in 1972 that was weakened by

1975_76.I


     'We note explicitly that tests of statistical significance are not
independent unless separate samples are used. e experiment here with
different specifications estimated with the same samples. Nevertheless,
if estimated coefficients or t—statistics fluctuate widely with reasonable
changes in specification, this should constitute a warning that the
estimated coefficients are of questionable reliability.
                                        20


       Modifications   of Standardizing Variables

       We also experimented to see whether the results were sensitive to

changes in the variables used to standardize the regressions. These

changes included:      (i) the substitution of the "socioeconomic origins"

measure in the Parnes data set for the one used in Table 2, (ii) the

substitution of a measure of family income for the socioeconomic status

of the family for the Class of 1972 Survey, and (iii) the use of dummy

variables for measures of the individual's ability and far the socio-

economic status of the parents.1 None of these changes in specification

had any important effect on the reported coefficients and t—statistics

of the variables measuring participation in high school vocational

programs.

       Inclusion   of Intervening Variables.
      The set of explanatory variables included in the regression which
are   reported in Tables   2 and 3 is   designed to standardize only for the
youth's   ability, family background, and whether the youth lived in a

city. Thus, the estimated impact of vocational training includes all

differences in outcome variables which emerged over time, both those

operating through such intervening variables as job tenure and union-

ization, as well as those operating directly on the outcomes. We

estimated a variety of equations which included these intervening

variables, and in several of the equations we included additional




     'Table 3 used a socioeconomic status variable constructed from the
educational levels of the father and the mother and the occupation of
the father, so that comparable variables could be constructed for both
data sets. The Parnes variable uses the two education levels, the
occupation of the father when the respondent was age 14, the education
of the oldest sibling if applicable, and an index of the availability of
reading materials at home when the individual was age 14.
                                        21


 standardizing variables as well. For example, one such set which was

estimated for women included as explanatory variables job tenure, a

measure of whether the job is full time, and a measure of collective

bargaining coverage. For men, additional explanatory variables include

past military service, southern residence, past on-the—job training,

and an indicator of collective bargaining coverage.

     A comparison of the expanded regressions with those in Table 3

indicates that in most cases the impact of vocational training is not

very sensitive to the set of control variables included in the

regression equation.1 The exceptions were the regressions for black

women in the Parnes study, for which the small sample size (14 indivi-

duals) makes the results particularly sensitive to changes in

specification.

     For this group, we find a significant (at the 10% level) impact

of business and office training, as do Grasso and Shea, when the

hourly wage is utilized as the dependent variable. With yearly earnings

as the dependent variable, results are very sensitive to the exact set

of independent variables used, with significant results being obtained

only with the set of independent variables (excluding years of experience)

utilized by Grasso and Shea. Additional regressions using all the co-

horts in the Parnes study and including years of work experience,

providing 106 observations, continued to exhibit this sensitivity in

regressions for   yearly   earnings.2


          regressions for a given sex—race group were estimated from a
constant sample so that differences between the regressions could not
arise from differential selection into the samples.

     2That analogous findings are ensiti'je to soecification in Grasso
and Shea can be seen by comparing their Tables (continued on p. 22)
                                     22

      Alternative Measures of Participation in Vocational Programs.

      In this part, we consider the effects of using detailed measures of

 type, intensity and quality of vocational training to determine whether

 findings are changed by better measurement. These measures are only

 available for the Class of 1972 survey.

      One refinement of the variable measuring vocational

 education is to separate it into several variables representing the

 detailed area of specialization within a vocational course of study.

 These were estimated only for the samples of white males and females

 and are reported in Table 5. For black males and females, there were

 empty cells in a number of subfields. The areas of specialization

 distinguished are agriculture, business, distributive education, health,

home economics and trade.

     While there is some hint in the estimates of a positive earnings

difference for white males who took a program in trade, as compared

to general program graduates, and negative earnings differences for

white females who took a program in home economics, neither relation is

statistically significant. The only significant finding is that white

females included in the sample who enrolled in distributive courses

work an average of nine fewer weeks than included white females who

were in a general course of study.

     A second refinement is to measure the intensity of vocational

training. One measure of intensity of vocational training is the number


     2(Continued from page 21)
A4.20 and A4.21.   They find that a relation between business and
office training and yearly earnings which is significant at the 10%
level for black females becomes insignificant when 19 observations for
those who worked less than 39 weeks are eliminated from the ample.

Significant at   the 90% level.

aThe estimated regressions include the same set of
                                                   independent variables held constant in Table 2:
 achievement level, parent!s socioeconomic status, enrollment in an academic
 in an SMSA.                                                                 program and residence

                                  24


 of class periods spent in vocational courses, as indicated in the youth's

 school record. We estimated the relation of weekly earnings and weeks

 employed to the total number of class periods in all vocational courses

 taken (i.e., the total of class meetings for each class summed across

 the number of vocational classes for each demographic group), holding

 constant, as in the regressions underlying Table 3, the youth's test

 score, parent's socioeconomic status, and an indicator of residence in

 an SMSA. The coefficient for the variable indicating number of periods

 spent in vocational courses was significant in only one regression,

 indicating that for white females, each additional vocational class

period taken was associated with an additional .046 weeks of employ—

ment. The t—statistjc was 2.52. Insignificant effects of number of

vocational courses takenwere also noted when alternative specifications

of this regression were estimated. In one set of regressions the

intensity variable was separated into two according to whether the

major high school program was vocational or commercial—business. In

other regressions, the intensity variable was further separated according

to narrow high school program (as in Table 5). No systematic relation

between the number of class periods spent in vocational courses and

economic outcomes was apparent in these regressions.

     A final refinement investigates the possibility that type of high

school affects learning. Vocational training may occur in a high school

that specializes in vocational programs, offering up-to-date training

on modern equipment, or it may be simply one of the three tracks in a

comprehensive high school where the training may be of relatively low

quality. The Class of 1976 Survey provides no direct indicator of the
                                  25


 type of high school, so we employed two alternative measures. One

 indicator of potential specialization by the school is the proportion

 of students enrolled in vocational programs. Accordingly, we include

 in some regressions an explanatory variable which takes on a value of

 1 if more than half the students are enrolled in a vocational program.

 In addition, Andrew Koistad of the Department of Education identified

 a subset of schools included in the Class of 1972 Survey which specialize

 in vocational training. These schools were also identified by a dummy

 variable. The measures pertaining to type of school were added

 separately to regressions reported in Table 3.   (Give the distribution

 of responses, the Kolstad measure was added only to the regressions for

 male youth). In no case were the coefficient estimates for these

 indicators of type of high school significantly different from zero.


     Measures for Interarea Differences in Labor Market Conditions.

     The last test for robustness introduces measures for interarea

differences in the general wage level and in unemployment rates into the

regressions. This test could be done only for the Class of 1972 Survey

data, since the Parnes data does not identify specific SMSA's.    Using

the Class of 1972 data, we confined the sample to those in the largest

98 SMSA'g and (i) deflated the youth's wage by a fixed weight index of

the average earnings of 25 to 55—year-old high school graduates in the

same SMSA, and (ii) included as an explanatory variable a measure of

the unemployment rate for 20 to 24—year-old young people in the SMSA.1



     'The unemployment rate is measured as the ratio of time unemployed
to time spent in the labor force in the previous year. Both the unemploy-

  The data on area wage and youth unemployment were taken from
                                                                 the   Survey
 of Income and Education, which was conducted during the spring   and
 summer of 1976.

      With the earnings variables deflated by the local wage index, there

 were no significant relations between the weekly wage and vocational

 training programs in the set of regressions specified in Table 3 above.

 Similarly, with one exception, no significant results were obtained

 when the SMSA youth unemployment rate was included as an explanatory

 variable in these regressions. The only exception is in a weeks

 employed equation for white females. The coefficient, which is

 significant at a ten percent level, suggests that white females who

 enrolled in a commercial—business course
                                            were employed four weeks per

 year less than white female general program graduates in comparable

circumstances.


III. The Impact of the Capacity of Vocational Programs on Labor Markets


     In this section we will consider how the size of the vocational

program in an area may affect the measured returns to the program. To

indicate the general nature of the argument, it will be helpful first

to discuss a simple model of wage determination in the markets for

vocational training graduates and for those without such training.

     The model distinguishes two kinds of workers: those who have been

trained in a high school vocational program or who received equivalent

training on the job, and those who have not received such training.

For convenience, we will call workers of the first type hltrainedtP and

workers of the second type "untrained." The demand curves for the two

types of workers are shown in Figure 1 as DT and D. Note that in this

 diagram the number of trained workers is measured from the left axis,

 and the number of untrained workers from the right axis. For any point

 along the horizontal axis, the sum of the two types of workers will add

 up to a constant total number of workers.1

         A central feature of this model is that if the worker undergoes on—

 the-job training at a cost represented by d         ,   he will receive the

 skills necessary to be considered a trained worker.2 If the number of

spaces in the vocational program is below A individual, then in the

absence of on-the-jobtraining the wage differential between trained and

untrained workers will exceed d .         This   will induce enough workers to

undergo on—the—job training to increase the number of trained workers

to A , thus reducing the wage differential to d .             If the number of
spaces in vocational training programs is between A and B              ,   then   it

will pay anyone who can to take the vocational training. There will be

a positive wage differential between trained and untrained workers, but

it will not be large enough to induce anyone to undergo on—the-job

training,1 Finally, if the number of spaces in vocational training

programs is B or greater, then it will pay B individuals to accept

places in the program. In this case, one would expect no differntial

between the wages of trained and untrained workers.

     In this model, a failure to observe any wage differential between

graduates of vocational training programs and general programs may arise

     1
      The essense of the argument is not affected if the total number
of workers (high school graduates) is allowed to vary. A more complete
version of the model is discussed in Gustman and Steinmeier (1980).

         the model, the one time costs of on—the-job training are
implicitly converted into an annual amount whose present value equals
the costs. This annual amount is represented by d
                                 29



 for one of two reasons. First, it may be that vocational programs are

producing no usable skills, so that the amount of on-the-job training

necessary to produce an equivalent level of skills is zero (d =   0).    The

other possible explanation is that enrollments in vocational programs are

effectively unlimited, so that enough students choose the programs to

equalize the wages between graduates of vocational programs and other

graduates.

     Explanations based either on a decline in d over fime or an

increase in enrollments in vocational programs are consistent with the

evidence presented earlier for female graduates of business and commercial

programs. Recall that in 1972, such graduates had higher earnings than

did general program graduates, whereas by 1975-76 the evidence pointed

to a small positive or zero earnings differential within the Parnes

sample, or a zero differential within the Class of 1972 sample. During

the same time period female enrollment rates in vocational programs

were rising. Hence, the lack of a substantial positive earnings

differential in the later years may have occurred either because the

program's performance deteriorated over time or because the additional

supply of business and commercial graduates caused the earnings differen-

tial to narrow. Two different approaches were tried in an attempt to

discern which of these explanations is correct.


     Evidence from Enrollment Equations.

     Suppose that the demand for graduates of vocational programs is

higher in some areas than others. In the high—demand areas, the demand

curve DT for trained workers in Figure 1 will be shifted to the

right relative to the demand curve Du 'or untrained workers. This
                                  30


will in turn shift the point of intersection between D        and D       to
                                                      T               U
the right. In areas where the enrollment In vocational programs is

not limited, this intersection gives the number of students who enroll

in the program. Hence, if the explanation of a lack of earnings

differential between vocational program graduates and general program

graduates is that the earnings have been equalized by adjustments

equating supply and demand of program graduates, then one would expect

to find a positive relation between the demand for vocational program

graduates in an area and the number of students enrolled in the program

in that area.

     To test this proposition, we developed a measure of demand for

vocational program graduates. This measure uses the responses to the

longitudinal survey of the Class of 1972 to calculate the national

percentages of vocational program graduates in each occupation; these

percentages are then weighted for each of 100 SMSAs by the fraction

of the SSA's employment in each occupation. A regression was estimated

for this group in which the dependent variable was a dummy variable

taking on a value of 1 if the youth had enrolled in a vocational program

in high school and zero otherwise. Observations were confined to those
                                                          1
who terminated their education with a high school degree.      There was



     'To be sure that the wage equation estimates discussed In the
preceding sections of this paper were not affected by the omission of
a measure of demand mix, we reestimated the equation for observations
falling in SMS's where a measure of demand for vocational graduates was
available and included the measure of demand, and both that measure and
an interaction term between vocational enrollment and the demand measure.
The results reported earlier, namely that there is no significant wage
difference between vocational and general program graduates, remain
unchanged.
                                  31


 no evidence of a significant positive relation between the demand mix

 variable and the probability of enrolling in a vocational program.1

 This evidence suggests rejecting the hypothesis that supply side

adjustments are responsible for the absence of a wage differential

between vocational and other program graduates. However, one should be

somewhat cautious about rejecting the hypothesis based on this

evidence alone. One reason is that the measure of demand may be of

too poor a quality to generate significant results. Another is that

the Class of 1972 sample was not taken to be representative of

enrollments in geographic areas, but to provide information on schools

in each area. Thus the measured enrollment probabilities may not provide

a reliable indication of actual enrollment probabilities in the given

market.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the Model.

     A second approach to investiage whether the returns to vocational

training are affected by supply adjustments involves the maximum likeli-

hood estimation of the model presented in the first part of this section.

This is particularly important for women, for whom previously discussed

evidence suggests that the returns had diminished but not necessarily

disappeared by 1976. If there were positive returns in some cities,

then the supply adjustment would not be complete in those cities, and

there would be no fixed relationship between enrollments and demand for

vocational program graduates. In these circumstances, an enrollment


     11n an equation for black females with 38 observations, the
coefficient of the mix variable in an enrollment equation was
significant and negative.
                                                     32

  equation might fail to find significant results because it applies

  strictly only to those cities for which the adjustment is complete.

  To accormnodate the possibilIty that the
                                                             adjustment may be complete in
  some cities but incomplete in others, the complete model was estimated

 with maximum likelihood techniques.                      Note that this model requires a

 much more explicit specification of the underlying structural model than

 do the previous estimates, and the results may be sensitive to the

 accuracy of this specification. Since individual cities cannot be iden-

 tified in the Parnes data set, the model
                                                             was estimated ohly with the
 Class of 1972 data.

        The empirical specification of the model begins with two demand

 functions, one each for trained and untrained workers:
                 *
             in WT =              + CL D
                         CL
                              0     iT 2 NT-.   CL




             ln W      = 13 +              -
                                   l DT         2    N


 where W is the wage rate for trained workers, W the wage rate for

 untrained   workers, DT the measure of demand for vocational program
graduates described previously, N the number of trained workers, and
Nu the number of untrained workers. The total number of workers,
trained and untrained, in a labor market is given                    by

             N=        + Nu
                  NT


where N is the number of 20-24 year olds with exactly a                    high school

education expressed as a percentage of the population 20—64 years old.

       For a given set of values for the cOs, the 13's, and for a given

value of the gap d in Figure 1, the values of WT and W for a particular

labor market depend upon the percentage of young people in that market

who   have had vocational training. In terms of that figure, the avail-
ability of vocational training determines whether the number of trained
workers will be A, between A and B, or B. The percentage of high school

graduates with vocational training in each labor market (SMSA) was

taken from the October 1979 Educational Supplement to the Current

Population Survey.1 The base wages for trained and             untrained   workers

in a particular SMSA are postulated to be the amounts predicted

from this model, plus a random disturbance term:

                         *
             ln WT = in WT +       T
                                                                           (111.1)
                        *

                                   U


where CT and C normally distributed random error terms with variances

   and O, respectively.

        The wages of individual workers in a labor market are further

altered according to whether the worker is currently undergoing or has

undergone on-the-job training and by the basic ability level of the

individual:




                                                                           (111.2)

be negative, on the presuniption that the worker bears at least some of

the cost for the training, and the coefficients for past training are

expected to be positive.1

         alternative way to treat on—the-job training would have been to

precluded consideration of on—the—job training for vocational program
graduates, however, and it would also have assumed that the average amount
of on-the-job training actually received is equivalent to the training
   received in a vocational program. The approach used in the paper
avoids these restrictive assumptions.

The parameter set over which this likelihood function is maximized in-

cludes the a's and the 13's in the demand functions, the p's describing

wage responses to on—the-job training and test scores, the three

variancescY2, 4, and O, and the gap d. The a's, 3's and d enter

the likelihood function indirectly through their effects on WT and W.

     This likelihood function was maximized separately for white males

and white females in the Class of 1972 group. The unrestricted

maximum value was compared to the maximum value obtained under the

contraint d =     0, and for both groups the likelihood ratio test indicated
that this constraint is not significant. This means that there is

no evidence from the maximum likelihood estimation that the gap d is

significantly different from zero, although the point estimates were

in both cases positive. Given the rather crude nature of the model,

this result alone should probably be used with caution, but it does add

further support to the results found using least squares techniques.
                            IV. Conclusions
        The Grasso and Shea analysis of the Parnes data found that in

1972, male vocational program graduates had no higher earnings than

general program graduates, but that female graduates of business and

office programs did enjoy higher earnings. Fitting analogous equations

to observations for 1975 and 1976 using both the Parnes data and the

Class of 1972 data, we obtained similar results for men. But we found

that business and commercial training for women seemed

to have much less of an effect in the mid-l970's than it did in 1972.

This result appears to be robust with respect to a number of changes

in the estimating equations. It does not vary when additional explanatory

variables are included, when attempts are made to refine the nasure of

participation in vocational programs, or when we standardize for inter—

area differences in the general wage level and in youth unemployment

rates.

        For men, the lack of any measurable impact of vocational training

on    subsequent earnings may occur either because the programs are not
producing useful skills or because supply     adjustments have eliminated

the   earnings advantage for vocational program graduates. The latter
would occur if enrollments in vocational training were not limited, i.e.,
the program could accomodate all who applied, so that enrollments in
vocational    courses would continue to rise as long as there was any
earnings   differential. If earnings   differentials for men had been
eliminated in this manner, however, we would expect in cross—section
comparisons between labor markets to find that there are higher per-
centages of students enrolled in vocational programs in labor markets
in   which the demand for training is relatively high. Cross-section

 regressions testing for a relation between vocational program enrollments

 and a measure of demand for training by employers in 100 SMSA's did

 not   find significant evidence of this relationship. Thus none of the
 evidence we have developed for men supports a view that vocational
 programs in high school produce special skills valued by firms beyond
 the knowledge gained in a general high school program.
       The measured impact of business and commercial training on the earnings

 of female graduates in 1972 could be considered to be the result of

 supply side limitations which kept earnings for vocational program

 graduates higher than those of other program graduates. If this expla-

 nation is correct, then the   decline in the impact of business and
 commercial training by the mid 1970's   could   be attributed to a weakening
of the   supply limitation.

       One cannot test for the existence of supply limitations using cross-

sectional data by simply regressing enrollments in vocational programs

on measures of the local demand for training, as was done for men.

The reason is that if the supply adjustment is not complete, or is

complete for some labor markets but not for others, there is no reason

to expect a tight relationship between enrollments and demand for training.

In fact, the regressions we estimated to explain variation among areas

in enrollments by young women in commercial—business programs did not

find any relation between an index of demand and commercial—business

enrollments. The relationship between the earnings advantage of vocational

program graduates and chiracteristics of the local labor market as

described in our discussion, is more complex. This relationship may

be estimated by maximum likelihood technques, albeit at th cost of

increased risk of specification error. The results of the maximuni
                                  38



likelihood estimation, however, do not provide further support for

supply side adjustments as an explanation of the reduced impact of

business and commercial training in cross—section. Thus, in the case

of commercial—business programs for women, there is evidence that

these programs at one time were productive of skills valued by

employers. We cannot be sure whether the skills produced in later

years continue to be so valued.

 aThe dummy variable measuring participation in a commercial (business or offiäe) course is defined
  explicitly in the Parnes survey but not in the Class of 1972 Survey.  2n analogous variable was
  constructed for the Class of 1972 survey by classifying all those enrolled in a business or dis-
  tributive program as enrolled in a commercial course of study.

                       Derivation of the Likelihood Function



       In this appendix, we will derive the likelihood function for the

model in Section III. To begin, substitute equations (111.1) into

equations (111.2):




lnWvlnWT+dcT+dp+PS+c+E
                 i *
                                                                                 (4.1)

lnWN=lnW+I1dcT+p2d+p3S +EU+EN

Define         =       +      and   =         + E. Under the assumption that ETand

the 4 are independent normally distributed random variables, the                         will

have variance o + a2 and covariance 0, where Var(ET) =
                                                                         0 and   Var(G) = 02.

The variance—covariance matrix                 of the vector    of random variables•

may be written as:



                                                                    a.

where H is a column vector of ones and I is the identity matrix. Similarly,

the variance-covariance of               is given by EN =   2   .   +     i.
                                   Appendix 4 (continued)



        The likelihood function for a particular SMSA is simply the joint

 probability of             and flN:




 L =



where f is the multivarjate normal density function.' The log of the

multivariate density function is given by:



in L =     in   f(1])    + in   f(fl)

where

in                 fly                  i                1    1
     f(r1) =     --i- ln(2i) - - ml det           El -
                                                             z, -v


and similarly for in f(fl).                 The term fly is the number of observations

for vocational graduates in the particular SMSA.

        To evaluate det            in f(n) we note that addingorsubtracting one

row or column of a matrix to another does not change the value of the

determinant.        First, subtract the first row from each of the others.




        The separability of the joint probability function assumes that
     and        are independent, which in turn assumes that             and         are
independent. A likelihood function can be constructed for CT and CU not
independent,      but since the maximum likelihood estimate of                was   0, this
issue   is moot.

This      establishes the validity of Lemma 3.

          Define the scalar quantity in WT as



mWT lnWT+—

Note that

                                    *

Thus     the vector fl, + (in WT - in WT)H satisfies the condition of Lemma 3.
         The quantity                              may be rewritten as:

The first term becomes                                   (in WT - in WT) by Lemma. 2. For the

Equation                (4.4) imiies that H'[flv + (in WT*                                    in WT)HI, and thereby the
entire term,is zero. For the third term of equation (4.5), the condition
of Lemma 3 is satisfied, and the term can be rewritten as:
