                                               ABSTRACT


        One account of spatial concentration focuses on productivity advantages arising from market size.
We investigate this for forty regions of Japan. Our results identify important effects of a region's own size,
as well as cost linkages between producers and suppliers of inputs. Productivity links to a more general
form of “market potential” or Marshall-Arrow-Romer externalities do not appear to be robust in our data.
Landlocked status does not matter for productivity of regions in Japan. The effects we identify are
economically quite important, accounting for a substantial portion of cross-regional productivity
differences. A simple counterfactual shows that if economic activity were spread evenly over the forty
regions of Japan, aggregate output would fall by nearly twenty percent.

                   Market Size, Linkages, and Productivity:
                       A Study of Japanese Regions

                                I. Geography and Productivity

        A central tenet in both the traditional and new work in economic geography is that space

matters. This has found application in urban and regional economics, and in the theory of

international trade, as exemplified in the monograph The Spatial Economy, by Fujita, Krugman

and Venables (1999). These literatures highlight the extraordinarily uneven geographical

distribution of activity across space and take this as a central problem to understand. For

example, in this paper we will be working with regional data from Japan, across which the

density of GDP per square kilometer varies by more than a factor of twenty. Such vast disparities

in economic activity across space invite an explanation.

        Theory provides a variety of reasons why space may matter. The one on which we will

focus in this paper is the possibility that space affects productivity. Directly or indirectly, this has

been an important focus not only for theoretical work, but also for prior empirical applications.

Classic papers in the urban and regional literature, such as Sveikauskas (1975), Henderson

(1986), and Glaeser, et al. (1992) have contributed to the understanding of this problem. The

former two papers sought directly to measure and explain productivity differences across regions

within the United States. The last paper implicitly pursued the same objective, by trying to

explain differential rates of city growth, much of this difference believed to devolve from

differential productivity growth.




                                                   2
        These papers have been very important in focusing our attention on the magnitude of the

regional productivity differences and in identifying candidate explanations. They provide a

compelling account that space does indeed matter. In doing so, however, they also point to an

important limitation of the studies. Each proposes that productivity or growth within a region

depends on the characteristics of that particular region. This is the manner in which space is

introduced – own region versus all others. A moment’s reflection, however, suggests that this

distinction is likely to be too sharp. If real space is to matter, and if it does so for more than

purely jurisdictional reasons, then the characteristics of regions that are quite near should

likewise matter – not only the region’s own characteristics. And proximate regions should likely

matter more than remote regions. Thus an important contribution of the present paper will be its

examination of cross-regional productivity differences while taking account of the fact that a

region’s productivity may depend differentially on its access to neighboring regions.

        The approach that we develop builds on prior work of Davis and Weinstein (1998 and

1999) and Leamer (1997). While pursuing a different agenda, the former papers provide a strong

object lesson in why it is important to introduce greater geographical realism into our empirical

work to the extent possible. The Leamer paper is more closely related to the present work,

considering geographical determinants of cross-country growth patterns. An important advantage

of the present paper, though, is precisely the fact that our data is from regions within a single

country. This eliminates a large number of potentially confounding variables that may differ

across countries, but not across regions of a country. This difference may arise, for example,

because it is much more likely that firms are the same across regions than across countries, so

that the same underlying technology is more likely to be at work across regions. As well, focus


                                                   3
on the regions eliminates a host of potential measurement problems introduced by looking at

international data.

       In considering the influence of space on productivity, there are two separate questions

that we might consider. One considers the ultimate source of the productivity differences. For

example, do they arise from Marshallian externalities, from access to a greater variety of

intermediate inputs, learning from customers, or some other source. While some of our results

could make one or another of these more or less plausible, and will comment on this as

appropriate, we think that these are important but difficult questions that deserve precise

answers. Unfortunately they are beyond the scope of this paper. The alternative that we pursue in

this paper is to examine the simpler, but nonetheless important, question of the channels through

which space influences productivity. Does own aggregate region size matter? Will it matter when

we allow for neighboring regions to affect your market access? Do these influences work through

aggregate economic size, through access to the type of inputs your industries require, or by

special access to your customers? Will variables reflecting heterogeneity of production that have

been shown to affect city growth matter for productivity, particularly when controlling for these

other influences?

       It is precisely these questions concerning the channels by which geography and economic

space influence productivity that we pursue in this paper. We examine this in a sample of 40

Japanese regions, utilizing the same data as Davis, Weinstein, Bradford, and Shimpo (1997),

Davis and Weinstein (1999), and Bernstein and Weinstein (1998). The premise for our study is

that cross-regional variation in average productivity will have observable implications for the

relation between the national technology, regional output, and regional factor supplies. Since


                                                 4
theory provides many accounts, we look to the data to identify which seem most important.

       The results identify a few robust channels by which space affects productivity. A region’s

own aggregate size does contribute importantly to productivity, as does good access to the

suppliers of inputs that figure importantly in a particular region’s production structure. Both a

more general “market potential” variable and a variable reflecting so-called Marshall-Allyn-

Romer (MAR) externalities matter when introduced alone, but not when the supplier-access

variable is included. We cannot find evidence that good access to consumers of your product

raises productivity. The magnitude of the effects we do identify are economically important.

Doubling own region size raises productivity by 3.5 percent. In a counterfactual in which

Japanese regions were not allowed to trade with each other, output would fall at least 6.5%.

       In sum, our results make four contributions. They confirm earlier work that identifies own

region size as mattering for productivity. Second, they allow for a richer conception of the way in

which space or geography affects productivity. Third, our use of an excellent regional data set

allows us to avoid numerous confounding problems that might exist with international data.

Finally, they allow us to place in contention some of the leading theories about the channels by

which space affects productivity.



                              II. Towards Empirical Implementation

A. Study Design

       Our study investigates determinants of regional productivity. The dependent variable

“productivity” will be described below. We relate productivity to a variety of traditional

variables as well as introducing new variables that stress the role of demand and cost linkages.

                                                 5
       A first set of variables consists of various measures of market size. The simplest is “own-

size,” which will be represented as the regional labor force. A variety of rationalizations of why

this may affect productivity may be offered. One is that local economic activity gives rise to a

pure Marshallian externality. A second is that the variety link to productivity developed in the

theory section is very general, so that productivity depends on the level of local activity, but not

directly on its composition. An alternative to “own-size” is what Harris (1954) termed “market

potential.” The latter is a more general framework, which allows productivity to be affected by a

weighted average of GDPs of the region itself as well as its neighbors, where the weights are

inverse to bilateral distance. In this sense, the “own-size” variable is one of market potential

where all of the weight is placed on local regional output.

       Two new variables may be considered, which likewise emphasize issues of market

access, but which focus more directly on the linkages between suppliers, users, and final

consumers. The variable “cost linkage” measures the degree of access to sources of precisely the

inputs required for that particular region's output. Theory suggests that these structural input-

output links between producers and their suppliers should be closely related to regional

productivity. One may also consider the structural relation embodied in “demand linkages.” One

interpretation of the demand linkages suggests that this may matter greatly for location decisions

as producers seek to be near purchasers of their product. However, under this interpretation, there

need not be any direct link to productivity. An alternative interpretation, however, might suggest

that producers have a great deal to learn from consumers of their product, so that strong demand

linkages may also be a source of productivity advantage.




                                                  6
       We will also consider two variables which have figured prominently in previous studies.

The first is a measure of regional specialization. Glaeser, et al. (1992) examine the role of

Marshall-Allen-Romer (MAR) versus Jacobs externalities in city growth. In their schema, the

MAR view posits that learning should be greater where there is a concentrated output structure,

whereas Jacobs emphasized potential benefits of a diverse production structure. Glaeser, et al.

find evidence they interpret as favorable to the MAR view. Our study differs from theirs in that it

considers the level of productivity rather than city growth. However, if productivity gains are

believed to be the source of the differential city growth, then we should be able to find some

evidence of this in the resulting productivity levels. We will also examine a suggestion from

Gallup, Sachs, and Mellinger (1998) that landlocked status matters for growth. While their study

emphasizes the link to growth in a cross-national study, we will examine whether this extends to

productivity for a cross-regional sample. This may provide insight to whether it is the remoteness

typical of landlocked regions that matters or the fact that access to the sea must cross national

political boundaries.



B. Data Construction

       In this section we provide an overview of the data used in the paper. Details on the

construction of variables are in the appendix to Davis and Weinstein (1999). Our data set

contains output, investment, consumption, government expenditure, endowment, and absorption

data for the 47 prefectures/cities of Japan. We form two aggregates: Kanto, out of the city of

Tokyo and the prefectures of Ibaraki, Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saitama; and Kinki, out of the

prefectures/cities of Hyogo, Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka. This reduces our sample to 40


                                                 7
observations, but reflects the high level of integration of the prefectures surrounding Tokyo and

Osaka. Our distance data is derived from the Kei/Ido Ichiran Database, which provides longitude

and latitude data for Japanese cities, allowing calculation of the great arc distance between

points.

          Define Xr as the N × 1 gross output vector for region r, and [1] as an N × 1 vector of ones.

Let AXr, Cr, Ir, and Gr be prefectural intermediate input demand, consumption, investment, and

government expenditure vectors. Construction of these variables is described in more detail in

Davis and Weinstein (1999). Define X rTRAD to be equal to Xr for all manufacturing, agricultural,

and mining sectors and zero otherwise. Finally we set DISTrr′ equal to the distance between the

prefectural capital cities when r ≠ r′ and equal to the square root of the area of the prefecture

divided by π otherwise.

          We now turn to the construction of our key variables. We begin with the measure of

productivity, which will be the dependent variable in our study. Previous papers, such as

Sveikauskas (1975), Henderson (1986), and others, have looked at productivity differences by

estimating regional production functions for particular industries. The standard approach

involves either calculating TFP using index numbers or estimating a regional production

function. One of the problems with this approach is that it is impossible to identify demand and

cost linkages using a production function approach because one needs to have information about

the regional availability of inputs and absorption of output. Such information is available if one

turns to input-output data.

          In this paper we will measure factor productivity using the matrix of direct factor input

requirements. Our measure of regional productivity of factor f is πrf where we arbitrarily set the

                                                   8
productivity of each factor for Japan as a whole equal to unity. For each region and factor, the

following condition must hold:

                                              B f X r ≡ π rf Vrf

Note here that Bf is the Japanese average input requirement, so unlike the other variables is not

specific to region r. Hence, we define productivity in region r of factor f as:

                                                       Bf Xr
                                              π rf ≡
                                                           Vrf

        We now turn to specification of our independent variables. Our “Own-Size” variable will

measure aggregate regional size, and will be implemented alternatively as the regional labor force

or regional GDP. An alternative measure of a region's size takes account of its proximity to other

regions. Following Harris (1954), we define “Market Potential” for region r as:

                                                             GDPr ′
                                         MPr ≡ k M ∑
                                                        r′   DISTrr ′

where

                                                                      −1
                                                        GDPr ′ 
                                         kM   ≡ ∑                
                                                r , r ′ DISTrr ′ 

In this definition, as well as in all of our subsequent definitions of variables involving distance,

we assume that a one percent increase in distance causes the impact of output of demand to fall

by one percent. This choice is based on the typical coefficient obtained in gravity model using

both regional and international data.1

        When we say that a region has strong cost linkages, we mean that it has excellent access

within the region and in neighboring regions to the investment goods and intermediate inputs



                                                       9
used intensively by that region's producers. An empirical implementation of this concept defines

“Cost Linkage” as follows:


                                             (                    ) ∑ [AX              + I r ] X rTRAD
                                                                                             T

                                                                                   r

                                                                            r′         DISTrr ′

                                                                                               

        This variable is an input-weighted average of production across all of Japan. Hence cost

linkages are strong when the producers of our inputs are large and proximate. This definition

only allows cost linkages to occur through tradable goods sectors. The decision to focus on

traded goods output was based on the Bernstein and Weinstein (1998) finding services sectors

behave as if they are non-traded in Japan.

        In addition to these core variables, we define a number of other variables that have been

used in previous studies. Glaeser et al. (1992) test for the existence of MAR or Jacobs

externalities using an index of specialization based on the concentration of employment in

particular industries. We will also allow for these factors by following their definition but will

use output instead of employment as our measure of concentration. Our measure of

specialization is

where we divide by 29 because that is the number of industrial sectors in our data. If each region

were a one-fortieth scaled-down version of Japan as a whole, then this index would always equal

unity. However, as regions concentrate in particular sectors, then this index will be larger.

       Finally, we also define a variable that can capture demand linkages. We set demand

linkage to be

where kD is set so that this variable equals one when sum across all prefectures. Our demand

linkage variable gives us an output-weighted average of demand across regions. Paralleling our

cost linkage variable, our demand linkage variable is large when the demanders of our tradable

goods are large and close.

       Table 1 presents sample statistics for all of our variables. There are a number of points

that are worth noticing. First, the average deviation in productivity across prefectures is not

necessarily zero because small prefectures may have higher or lower factor productivity than

large prefectures. This explains why the average deviation is negative for both labor factors and

positive for capital. Second, there appears to be more variation in labor productivity than in

capital productivity. This may reflect the relatively high degree of capital mobility across Japan.

Third, all of our geographic market variables -- market potential, cost linkage, and demand

linkage -- are highly correlated. This makes it difficult, though not impossible, to separate the

effects of these variables.



C. Estimation Issues


                                                           11
        When we move to a multi-factor, multi-good, multi-distance world, analytic solutions

become infeasible. Therefore we need to abstract to some degree from the theory in the

implementation, while hoping to capture its salient insights. Using our definition of productivity,

we can estimate the effects of cost linkages, demand linkages and market potential on

productivity through variants of the following equation:

        (1)     π rf = α f + β 1 f MPr + β 2 f ln (GDP )r + β 3 f COSTr + ε rf

This gives us one equation for each factor or three equations in total.

        There are a number of simple estimation issues we need to address. First, the εrf’s are

likely to be correlated across factors since neutral technical differences will affect all factors

equally. This suggests that we should not assume that corr(εrf, εif') equals zero. We solve this by

treating our equations as a system of seemingly unrelated regressions. Second, it is unlikely that

the impact of market size variables should differ across factors. Rather it seems more reasonable

that the economic geography variables should have common effects for all factors. We can

impose this on the data by forcing βrf = βif' for each factor. Finally, we are likely to measure

average productivity more accurately in larger regions than in smaller regions because

mismeasurement of output and endowments is likely to fall. We therefore weight all

observations by the square root of the regional labor force before estimation.

        The fact that our productivity and linkage measures both are based on a region’s gross

output potentially introduces a simultaneity bias that makes a standard seemingly unrelated

regressions procedure inappropriate. If output-per-factor is high in a prefecture then output in

that prefecture may be high as well. This will tend to cause the cost and demand linkage

variables to rise, creating a simultaneity bias.

                                                     12
       In order to deal with this problem, we first construct instrumental variables for COST and

DEM. For COST, the instrumental variable is defined as:


                                      (                ) ∑ [AX         + I r ] Xˆ rTRAD
                                                                             T

                        COST r ≡ k C [1] (AX r + I r )
                                          T              −1                         ′
                                                                   r

                                                              r′       DISTrr ′

where Xˆ rTRAD
           ′   equals X rTRAD
                          ′   when r ≠ r′ and X Japan
                                                TRAD
                                                      times that region’s share of Japanese labor

otherwise. We define a similar instrument for DEM. These instruments are highly correlated

with the linkage variables because all of the data from other prefectures is the same, however

they should be uncorrelated with productivity in the prefecture. We then estimated the entire

system of equations using three-stage least squares.



                                 III. Data Preview and Results

A. Data Preview

       Before proceeding to a formal data analysis, it will prove useful to preview certain

features of the data. A first issue worth addressing is the level of aggregation used in the analysis.

A check on this comes in the form of Zipf's law, an extremely robust feature of national data sets.

Zipf’s law holds that the log of region size will fall one-for-one with the log of the rank of a

region’s size. Figure 1 examines this for our Japanese regions. As the plot reveals, this

relationship holds almost exactly for Japanese prefectures under our aggregation scheme. The

slope coefficient is –0.951. This reflects the fact that the size distribution of regions is quite

skewed. The largest region, Kanto, is about 77 times larger than the smallest region, Tottori.

The three largest regions – containing the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, and Nagoya –

produce nearly half of Japanese GDP.

                                                  13
       Japanese region-size seems also to be positively correlated with our measure of

productivity. In Figure 2 we plot the average factor productivity in a region against region size.

These variables are clearly positively related. Doubling region size is associated with

productivity rising by about 5 percent. This positive relationship between region size and

productivity has been confirmed econometrically in a large number of previous studies (e.g.

Sveikauskas (1975) and others).

       Average productivity of Japanese regions ranges from 27 percent below the national

average in Okinawa to as much as 15 percent above the national average in Aichi. These

extreme points are quite suggestive of the role that geography may play in regional productivity.

Okinawa is not the smallest Japanese prefecture, indeed it is not even in the smallest decile, but it

is by far the most remote prefecture, situated about 500 hundred miles Southwest the Japanese

archipelago. Shimane prefecture, a more centrally located prefecture with a similar population,

has a productivity gap that is only half that of Okinawa’s. This is suggestive of the possibility

that Okinawa may be at a disadvantage because of its distance from the mainland.

       Hokkaido and Fukuoka are also significant outliers. Despite being the fourth and fifth

largest prefectures in Japan in terms of labor force, their productivity is significantly below

average. Both of these prefectures are located off the main Japanese island at the Northern and

Western extremes and are therefore quite remote from other sources of supply. At the other

extreme is Aichi, which has the highest productivity in all of Japan. Aichi contains the

moderately-sized city of Nagoya and is only one fifth the size of Kanto and less than one half the

size of Kinki. However, situated almost equidistantly between the two largest Japanese regions




                                                 14
on the major Japanese rail lines and highways, producers in Aichi have easy access to goods

produced in either of these large regions.

       This anecdotal evidence suggests that that we also explore how market access affects

productivity. In Figure 3 we plot productivity against our cost linkage variable. Allowing

remoteness to matter, we now find that the most productive prefecture, Aichi, has the strongest

cost linkages, and the least productive prefecture, Okinawa, has the weakest. The only really

troubling point in this plot is Gifu, the second point from the right. Gifu appears to have

substantial market access but low productivity. One reason for this is that Gifu’s population is

25 percent below that of the average region. A second reason is that Gifu’s excellent market

access is an artifact of the way we construct the cost linkage variable. For almost all prefectures,

the capital city lies in the center of the prefecture. Gifu, however, lies just above Aichi, and since

the city of Gifu is only about 20 km from Nagoya, in our data Gifu is closer to Aichi than it is to

itself! That is, our measure overstates the strength of Gifu's market access. We could have

aggregated Gifu with Aichi or recalculated the cost linkage variable to improve the fit, but we

preferred not to change our data construction method in order to eliminate outliers.



B. Results

       Table 2 presents the results from estimating equation 1. As is suggested by Figures 2 and

3, there is a strong positive relationship between region size and productivity as well as between

region market access and productivity. This relationship is present regardless of whether the

variables are considered separately or together. Our estimates indicate that a doubling of region




                                                 15
size causes productivity to rise by about 1.5 percent. This we attribute to a pure Marshallian

externality.

        Of more interest is the role played by market access. For example, consider Okinawa.

Okinawa has a population that is 10 percent larger than Yamanashi (located adjacent to Tokyo),

but while Yamanashi’s level of productivity is almost exactly average, Okinawa’s productivity

level is 27 percent below average . Our estimates indicate that 10 percentage points of the gap

between the two prefectures is due to the greater distance between Okinawa and the mainland.

Similarly, Shizuoka prefecture, located just west of Kanto has a slightly smaller population than

Hokkaido, but significantly better market access to Kanto, Kinki, and Aichi. Our estimates

suggest over half of the 19 percent productivity gap between Hokkaido and Shizuoka is due to

the latter’s advantage in market access. These examples suggest that market access plays an

important role in Japanese productivity even after controlling for size.

        The economic significance of market access can be assessed by considering a number of

thought experiments. For example, suppose that all Japanese prefectures were banned from

trading with each other. We can model this by rebuilding the cost linkage variable with zero-

weights applied to the outputs of all other prefectures. Our estimates indicate that this would

cause Japanese GNP to fall by 6.5%. Of course this is simply a “first round” effect. The full

general equilibrium effect could be smaller or larger depending on what assumptions one made

about the movement of factors and the impact on demand. Even so, our estimates indicate that

trade within Japan has a significant impact on Japanese welfare.

        We can also obtain some sense of the role played by agglomeration in Japan.

Agglomeration enters into our estimation through two routes. First, not all regions are the same


                                                16
size, and second, large regions are often close to each other. We can see how important

agglomeration is by considering the following counterfactual. Suppose that all Japanese workers

were evenly distributed across Japan so that the population density of every prefecture was the

same. This would change each prefecture’s aggregate labor force as well as its linkages.

Prefectures near Kanto would tend to see their linkages worsen while those in the hinterland

would benefit. We model what happens to output by assuming that each prefectures new output

vector is equal to Japan’s output vector times that regions new share of aggregate employment.

Our estimates indicate that Japanese GNP would fall by 4.1%. This suggests that Japan benefits

from having large regions close to each other.



C. Robustness Tests

       In Table 3, we conduct a number of robustness tests. Glaeser et al. (1992) include a

variable for regional specialization in their growth regressions and find that regions that are less

specialized in particular sectors have higher growth rates. They interpret this as evidence in

favor of Jacobs’ externalities. In the cross-section, one should also expect that specialization

should have an impact on productivity. In the first column of Table 3 we include a variable that

increases with regional specialization. When included with GDP, we obtain a positive

coefficient, indicating that on the contrary regions that are more specialized have higher

productivity. However, when we control for cost linkages, we find that the specialization

variable ceases to be significant. This suggests that specialization is not that important if one

controls for market access.




                                                 17
       A number of authors, e.g. Gallup, Sachs, and Mellinger (1998), have suggested that

access to the sea is important in understanding regional growth. Although Japan is an island

nation, six Japanese prefectures are landlocked. To see whether that mattered, we also included a

dummy variable that was one for each of these prefectures. Our results suggest that being

landlocked does not have much of an effect on productivity in the affected regions of Japan.

       Theory is ambiguous about the role that demand linkages may play in productivity.

Clearly in a world with trade costs, it is advantageous for producers to locate near important

sources of demand in order to minimize trade costs. However this need not confer on them any

productivity advantage in the link between inputs and outputs. Yet this could arise if excellent

access to consumers of your product yields information that allows productivity gains. This

suggests adding demand linkages to the horse race over how market size matters. We see in

Table 1 that demand and cost linkages are highly correlated with each other (as well as market

potential), so it will be interesting which the data identifies as key in influencing productivity.

       As we noted, demand linkages are highly correlated with cost linkages (ρ = 0.95), so

multicollinearity is likely to be a major problem. As we see in Table 4, the addition of the

demand linkage variable does increase the standard errors of the coefficient on cost linkages, but

the effect that we have identified seems clearly to flow through cost and not through demand

linkages. Demand linkages typically have the wrong sign in specifications with cost linkages.



                                         IV. Conclusion

       This paper investigates the determinants of productivity for forty regions of Japan. We

look at traditional determinants, such as Own-Size and Market Potential, as well as determinants

                                                  18
more strongly linked to the recent literature on economic geography, such as demand and cost

linkages. We also consider influences that have figured prominently in recent work, such as the

MAR versus Jacobs debate on the role of regional diversity of production, and the role of

landlocked status in productivity.

       The most robust relations to productivity come from the Own-Size and Cost Linkage

variables. Both the MAR externality and Market Potential variables are significant and the

correct sign in the absence of the Cost Linkage variable. However they become insignificant or

take on the wrong sign when it is included. While one can posit theories under which Demand

Linkages may have a role in productivity, we do not find this in the data. Neither do we find that

there is a productivity loss for regions of Japan that are landlocked.

       Our estimates suggest an important link between region size and productivity. Ceteris

paribus, a doubling of region size raises productivity by 3.5 percent. Cost linkages are also quite

economically significant in accounting for differences across regions in productivity. A simple

counterfactual, premised on aggregate activity being spread evenly across the regions of Japan,

would lower output by nearly 20 percent.

       Clearly size and geography play important roles in understanding the regional distribution

of national welfare. This has implications for international integration too. For example, the

European Union has a population that is just over twice that of Japan and most European nations

have populations that are smaller than Kanto (approx 35 mln) or Kinki (approx 17 mln).

Economic geography suggests that countries located near the major economies are likely to be

the major winners from integration.




                                                 19
       Taken together, these results suggest that there are quite important direct productivity

gains associated with the concentration of economic activity in Japan. We must caution, though,

that while we can quantify directly the productivity gains, a full consideration of welfare effects

would likewise need to quantify costs arising from congestion, which falls beyond the scope of

this paper.
