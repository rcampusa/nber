                              ABSTRACT
     The basic puzzle about the so-called Fisher effect, in which
movements in short-term interest rates primarily reflect
fluctuations in expected inflation, is why a strong Fisher effect
occurs only for certain periods but not for others. This paper
resolves this puzzle by reexamining the relationship between
inflation and interest rates with modern time-series techniques.
Recognition that the level of inflation and interest rates may
contain stochastic trends suggests that the apparent ability of
short-term interest rates to forecast inflation in the postwar
United States is spurious. Additional evidence does not support
the presence of a short-run Fisher effect but does support the
existence of a long-run Fisher effect in which inflation and
interest rates trend together in the long run when they exhibit
trends.
     The evidence here can explain why the Fisher effect appears
to be strong only for particular sample periods, but not for
others. The conclusion that there is a long-run Fisher effect
implies that when inflation and interest rates exhibit trends,
these two series will trend together and thus there will be a
strong correlation between inflation and interest rates. On the
other hand, the nonexistence of a short-run Fisher effect implies
that when either inflation and interest rates do not display
trends, there is no long-run Fisher effect to produce a strong
correlation between interest rates and inflation. The analysis
in this paper resolves an important puzzle about when the Fisher
effect appears in the data.

       The relationship between the level of interest rates and inflation is one
of the most studied topics in economics. A standard view, which is commonly
referred to as the Fisher effect, is that movements in short-term interest rates
primarily reflect fluctuations in expected inflation, so that they have
predictive ability for future inflation. Although the Fisher effect is widely
accepted for the period after the Fed-Treasury Accord in 1951 until October
1979 in the United States,t this relationship between the level of short-term
interest rates and future inflation is not at all robust. The level of short-term
interest rates has no ability to predict future inflation in the United States
prior to World War 112 or in the October 1979 to October 1982 period.3 In
addition, the Fisher effect is not found to be strong for many other countries
even in the postwar period.4
       The Fisher effect's lack of robustness raises two issues. First, it leaves
us with the puzzle of why a strong Fisher effect occurs only for certain periods
but not for others. Second, the Fisher effects lack of robustness should make
us somewhat suspicious about its validity.
       Recent developments in the time-series econometrics literature help
resolve these two issues and explain why the Fisher effect is not robust. A
large body of current work has focused on testing for stochastic trends in time-
series and has studied the implications of stochastic trends on statistical

inference. Research beginning with Nelson and Plosser (1982) indicates that
many macroeconomic time series such as interest rates and inflation may he
characterized as having stochastic trends. We are also by now familiar with
the potential for misleading inference when variables have stochastic trends
from the work on the spurious regression phenomenon by Granger and
Newbold (1974) and Phillips (1986). Both these lines of research suggest that
the evidence for the Fisher effect in the postwar United States needs to be
reexamined.
      This paper conducts such a reexamination and finds that the evidence
does not support a short-run relationship between interest rates and future
inflation. However, the nonexistence of a short-run Fisher effect does not rule
out the possibility that there is a long-run Fisher effect in which inflation and
interest rates share a common trend when they exhibit trends. This paper also
conducts tests for cointegration along the lines of Engle and Granger (1987)
to test for a common trend in interest rates and inflation, and it does find
evidence for a long-run Fisher effect in the postwar U. S. data.
         The above evidence resolves the puzzle of why the Fisher effect appears
to be strong in some periods but not in others. The existence of a long-run
Fisher effect implies that when inflation and interest rates exhibit trends,
these two series will trend together and thus there will be a strong correlation
between inflation and interest rates. Just as this analysis predicts, the Fisher
effect appears to be strong in the periods when interest rates and inflation
exhibit trends. On the other hand, when these variables do not exhibit trends,
a strong correlation between interest rates and inflation will not appear if
there is noshort-run Fisher effect. Thus the presence of a long-run but not a
short-run Fisher effect predicts that a Fisher effect will not he detectable

during periods when interest rates and inflation do not have trends. It is
exactly in these periods that we are unable to detect any evidence for a Fisher
effect.
       The next section describes the data used in the empirical analysis,which
is followed by an empirical reexamination of the ability of interest rates to
forecast future inflation. The section following then describes tests for long-
run and short-run Fisher effects, and the paper ends with a set of conclusions.



                                     II. The Data

       The empirical analysis makes use of monthly data on inflation rates and
one to twelve-month U.S. Treasury bills for the period February 1964 to
December 1986.6 The sample starts with February 1964 because this is the
first date that data on all the Treasury bills became available (twelve-month
Treasury bills were not issued until late 1963). End of month T-bill data were
obtained from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) at the
University of Chicago. The one-month bill was defined to have a maturity of
30.4 days, the three-month bill 91.25 days, on up to the twelve month bill with
a maturity of 365 days. For each defined maturity the interest rate was
interpolated from the two bills that were closest to the defined maturity. In
effect, this means that the slope of the term structure is assumed to be
constant between these two hills.7 The interest rates are expressed on a con-

  NoLe that the need for up to twelve-month inflation rates in the empirical analysis requires
CPI data through the end ol 1987.

   'Fama (1984) instcad chooscs a bill that has a maturity closest to six months and (hen keeps on
taking the interest ratc from this same bill every month as its maturity shortens in order to get
interest rates on one to six-month hills, in cffcct, Fama is assuming that the slope of the term
structure is flat around the chosen bill. The procedure for data construction in this paper, which
                                               4

tinuously compounded basis at an annual rate in percent as are the inflation
rates. The inflation data are calculated from a CPI series which appropriately
treats housing costs on a rental-equivalence basis throughout the sample
period. For more details on this series see Huizinga and Mishkin (1984, 1986).
       The timing of the variables is as follows. A January interest rate
observation uses the end of December bill rate data. A January observation
for a one-month inflation rate is calculated from the December and January
CPI   data; a three-month inflation rate from the December and March CPI
data; and so on.8


                          III. A Reexamination of the
                  Methodology for Testing the Fisher Effect

       In previous work, examination of the Fisher effect has involved testing
for a significant correlation of the level of interest rates and the future
inflation: i.e., testing for the significance of                  in following regression
equation (which can also be thought of as a forecasting equation).


(1)         itT      = a,,, + ,,iT



assumes   that the slope around the desired maturity is constant rather than zero, makes a less
restrictive assumption than Fama's procedure. The differences between these two procedures,
however, are very slight and make no appreciable difference to the results.

    The appropriate dating for the CPI is a particular month is not clear since price quotations on
the component items of the index are collected at different times during the month. As a result,
there is some misalignment of the inflation data and the interest rate data which is collected at
the end of the month. In order to see if this misalignment could have an appreciable affect on the
results, I also estimated the regressions in this paper lagging the interest rate data one period
(i.e., for the January observation I used the end of November bill rate). The results with the
lagged intercst rate data are very similar to those found in the text and none of the conclusions
of the paper changes.
where,
                  = the rn-period future inflation rate from time Ito + m.
           iT     = the ni-period interest rate known at time .

One way of interpreting this regression is to assume that expectations are
rational as iii Fama (1975). Then it is easy to show that a test of the correla-
tion of interest rates with future inflation is also a test for the correlation of
interest rates and expected inflation.9 Alternatively, we can view the
correlation of interest rates and future inflation as interesting in its own right.
       In this sectionwe will reexamine this methodology for testing the Fisher
effect and show that it does not provide reliable evidence on the existence of
the Fisher effect. The problem with this methodology is that it is subject to
the spurious regression phenomenon described by Granger and Newbold
(1974) and Phillips (1986) because both the right and left-hand-side variables
in the regression equation above can he characterized as having unit roots.




   Thc correlation of the level o1 interest rates and expected inflation is examined by testing for
the significance of ,, in the following regression:

()          E,[X'J = a,,   +   iT + u"
where,
                     = the expectation conditional on all information available at timej.

Under rational expectations, the realized future inflation rate can be written as,

                     = E,(irTI +

where the ,term, the forecast error of inflation, is orthogonal to any information known at time
 which includes i'. Combining these two equations results in equation (1) in which its error term
i equals       + u. Since u' is orthogonal to i' by construction (this is what makes () a
regression equation) and ' is also orthogonal to i" under rational expectations,the v error term
in (1) is also orthogonal to iT and an ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate of in the forecast-
ing equation in (I) is a consistent estimate of _ in equation ().

Panels B, C and D contain the results for three sub-periods, February 1964 to
October 1979, November 1979 to October 1982, and November 1982 to
December 1986. The sample has been split into these three sub-periods
because results in Clarida and Friedman (1984), Huizinga and Mishkin
(1986a) and Roley (1986) suggest that the relationship of nominal interest
rates and inflation shifted with the monetary regime changes of October 1979
and October 1982.
        Note that because of serial correlation induced by the use of overlap-
ping data, in which the horizon of the interest rate and the inflation rate is
longer than the one month observation interval, standard errors of the OLS
parameter estimates in equation (1) are generated in the analysis here using
the method outlined by Hansen and Hodrick (1980), with a modification due
to White (1980) and Hansen (1982) that allows for heteroscedasticity'1 and a
modification by Newey and West (1987) that insures the variance-covariance
matrix is positive definite by imposing linearly declining weights on autoco-




  °All regression estimates and Monte Carlo results in this paper have been generated with the
GAUSS programming language.
   "The Hansen (1982) modification is the same numerically as that proposed by White (1980).
The Hansen modification applies when there is conditional heteroscedasticity while White's
results are obtained with unconditional heteroscedasticity rather than conditional hctcrosccdas-
ticity, but additional assumptions arc required. The correction [Or hcteroscedasticity is used here
because Lagrange-multiplier tests outlined by Engle (1982) reject conditional homoscedasticity
for the error term of the forecasting equation. The results were very similar to those reported
in the text when a heteroscedasticity correction was not used in calculating the standard errors
of thc coefficient estimates.

      The t-statistics for ,. in the last column of Table 1 appear to indicate
that one to twelve month Treasury bill rates contain a highly significant
amount of predictive power for inflation. This finding is especially strong for
the pre-October 1979 sample period (Panel B) where the t-statistics on the ,
coefficient range from 9.76 to 11.85. However, after October 1979. the one
to twelve month interest rates contain much less information about future
inflation. In the October 1979 to October 1982 period of the Fed's nonbor-
rowed reserves target operating procedure. none of the t-statistics exceed
2.0 and in two cases are even negative. Although there is a positive relation-
ship between inflation and nominal interest rates at all time horizons in the
post-October 1982 period, the m t-statistics are greater than 2.0 only at time
horizons of one and three months.
        The results in Table 1 are consistent with earlier findings in the
literature which have examined the relationship between future inflation and
short-term interest rates for a more limited range of time horizons (one to six
months). Using standard critical values of the test statistics, the ability of
short-term interest rates to predict inflation is highly significant. However,
the conclusion that the fi,,, coefficients are statistically significant rests on the
appropriateness of using the t-distribution to conduct statistical inference
with the test statistics found in Table 1. Yet, it is well known that if the

 autocorrelations in the regression estimates here suggest that r' has significant correlation with
 its values lagged more than -1 periods. To see if this additional serial correlation has any effect
 on the results, I have calculated the standard errorsfor all the forecasting equations allowing for
 non-zero autocorrelations going back three years (36 periods) and have conducted Monte Carlo
 experiments for all the resulting test statistics along the lines described in the text. Allowing
 to have a MA process of order 36, does not alter any of the conclusions reached in the text.
variables in a regression contain stochastic trends because their time series
processes have unit roots, then inference with t-distrihutions can he highly
misleading. as has been forcefully demonstrated by Granger and Newbold
(1974) and Phillips (1986).
       To determine if the levels of inflation and interest rates contain
stochastic trends. Table 2 presents several types of unit root tests for the four
sample periods and time horizons studied in Table 1. The t-test statistic is the
Dickey-Fuller (1979,1981) t-statistic, ( - 1)/s(), from the following
regression:


(2)        Y,      = k + pY,, +       u,


where s() is the OLS standard error of and Y, is the variable being tested
for unit roots. The Z, statistic is a modification of the Dickey-Fuller t-statistic
suggested by Phillips (1987)which allows for autocorrelation and conditional
heteroscedasticity in the error term of the Dickey-Fuller regression. The Z
statistic, also suggested by Phillips (1987), is a similar modification of the test
statistic T(p - 1), where T is the number of observations.'3
       As the Monte Carlo simulations in Schwert (1987) point out, the critical
values calculated by Dickey and Fuller for the test statistics in Table 2 can be
very misleading if the time-series models of the variables tested forunit roots
are not pure autoregressive processes but rather include important moving
average terms. This is exactly what is found for the inflation rates examined
here, and therefore it is necessary to obtain the correct small sample
distributions for these test statistics from Monte Carlo simulations which



   'The Z and Z, Lest statistics are calculated allowing for 12 non-7cro autocovariances in the
error term of regression (2).

  allow for more general time-series processes of the tested variables.
        The Monte Carlo simulation experiments were conducted as follows.
 The data generating process for the itT and iT variables were obtained from
 ARIMA models in first differenced form (i.e., assuming unit roots) whose
 parameters were estimated from the relevant sample periods.t4 Because
 Lagrange-multiplier tests described by Engle (1982) revealed the presence of
 ARCH (autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity) in the error terms, the
 error terms were drawn from a normal distribution in which the variance
 follows an ARCH process whose parameters were also estimated from the
 relevant sample periods. Start-up values for AR terms in the times series
 models were obtained from the actual realized data from six and seven years
 before the sample period (or at the start of the sample period if earlier data
were unavailable), and then five years of draws from the random number
generator produced start-up values for the error terms. Then a sample size
corresponding to the relevant regression was produced using errors drawn
from the distribution described above and the test statistics were calculated.
To check out the robustness of the Monte Carlo results, I also conducted
experiments where the error terms were assumed to be i.i.d. rather than
ARCH and the results were very similar to those reported in the text.



    There is a potential problem that the estimated first differenced ARIMA modeisfor inflation
 and interest rates could have unit roots in the moving average polynomial which would cancel
out the autoregressive Unit root and thus yield series which are stationary in levels rather than in
first differences. To rule out this possibility, I did check the roots of the moving average
polynomials to make sure that they were outside the unit circle and found this to be the case, thus
guaranteeing that the moving average polynomials do not have unit roots. I also checked that the
roots of the autoregressive polynomials arc outside the unit circle. The estimated ARIMA
models thus yield data generating processes that, as desired, produce series that are stationary
in first differences, but not in levels. For the inflation series, the one-month serieswas generated
as described in the text and the three, six, nine and twelve month scrieswere then calculated from
the one-month series. 1 also tried the alternative of generating each of the inflation series with
its own estimated ARIMA model and there was no appreciable difference in the results.

     In Table 2 the value in parentheses under the test statistic is the
marginal significance level of the test statistic using the Monte Carlo
simulation results described above. The marginal significance levels are the
probability of getting that high a value of the test statistic or higher under the
null hypothesis that the variable has a unit root: i.e., a marginal significance
level less than 0.05 indicates a rejection at the 5% level. As we can see from
the results in Table 2, there is some support for the view that both the levels
of inflation and interest rates contain stochastic trends.'5                 In only 1 test
statistic out of 120 in Table 2 do we find a rejection of the null hypothesis of
a unit root. (Interestingly, this rejection occurs during the October 1979 to
September 1982 sample period.)
     I have also conducted unit root tests using Augmented Dickey-Fuller
(ADF) tests described by Said and Dickey (1984) in which lags of Y are
included in equation (2) and performed the same Monte Carlo simulation
experiments to obtain the marginal significance levels of these test statistics.
Four different lag lengths were chosen for these ADF tests: two tests used a
procedure similar to that in Perron (1990) in which the lag length was chosen
to be that which produced a t-statistic on the last lagged value of Y that was
significant either at the 10% or the 5% level; one ADF statistic had a fixed lag
length of twelve and the other chose the lag the length with the criterion used
in Schwert (1987) in which the lag length grows with sample size. The results
using these ADF statistics support the findings of Table 2. Just as in Table 2,
only in the October 1979 to September 1982 sample period when in = 1 is



   '5This conclusion contrasts with that found in Rose (1988). His rejection of a unit root in
inflation arises because he uses the Dickey-Fuller critical values to make his inferences.
Howcvcr, as the Monte Carlo results in Schwert (1987) and in Table 2 indicate, using the correct
small sample distribution to conduct inference does not lead to rejection of a Unit root in
inflation.
                                                11

 there a rejection of a unit root for inflation, and in no other cases could the
 null hypothesis of a unit root in inflation or interest rates be rejected.
       The conclusion from Table 2 and the additional Augmented Dickey-
 Fuller tests is that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the levels of
inflation and interest rates contain stochastic trends.'6 Thus it is entirely
possible that the inference using the t-distrihution which tells us that interest
rates have significant forecasting ability               for inflation could be highly
misleading.
        To explore this possibility, we again run Monte Carlo simulation
experiments using the procedures described above in which the data
generating process for the iTT and iT variables was obtained from ARIMA
models in firstdifferenced form (i.e.,assuming unit roots) using the procedure
described earlier. In addition, the error terms from the irT and iT ARIMA
models are allowed to be contemporaneously correlated as in Mankiw and
Shapiro [1986] and Stambaugh [1986] because this correlation is often found




  'The view that interest rates and inflation have stochastic trends in particular sample periods
does not imply that there is no tendency to mean reversion in the policy process that generates
money growth and inflation rates. In accommodating monetary regimes-- the pre-October 1979
period might be characterized as a good example--the conduct of monetary policy could certainly
lead to non-stationary behavior of money growth and inflation. However, the high inflation that
such a regime creates is likely to lead to a change in regime that would bring inflation back down
again, thus producing a tendency for mean reversion in the long run. Note, however, that this
tendency to mean reversion in the long run is consistent with nonstationary behavior within a
regime period. Another way to see this point is to recognize that a hyperinflation involves a
monetary regime in which money growth and inflation are clearly nonstationary. Yet, at some
point the problems created by such a high inflation regime will result in a change in monetary
regime which brings the inflation rate back to low levels and leads to mean reversion of inflation
in the long run.

to he statistically significant.7 The correlation of the error terms is also
estimated using the relevant sample periods. Then a sample size corres-
ponding to the relevant regression was produced using errors drawn from the
distribution described above and the test statistics using the Hansen-Hodrick-
Newey-West-White method allowing for heteroscedasticity described earlier
were calculated. Table 3 reports the results of Monte Carlo simulations of one
thousand replications of the t-tests for all the horizons and sample periods in
Table l.
        The difference between the small sample distribution of these statistics
and that under the t-distrihution is striking. Aswe can see from the results in
columns 7 and 8, the probability of rejecting the null when it is true using
either the t-distribution's 5% or 1% critical value is typically greater than
5Q%1Q    Furthermore, as we see from a comparison of Panel A and B with the
shorter sample period results in Panel C and D, the bias does not diminish




   "The dating convention for interest rates in this paper is off by one period from the
conventional dating used in Mankiw and Shapiro (1986) and Stambaugh (1986). Hence my
allowing for contemporaneous correlation of the error terms from the ir and iT ARIMA models
means that I allow for a correlation between the i"-cquation error term and one tag of the yr"-
equation error term.


   1 also conducted Monte Carlo experiments which 1) added lags of past to the i' ARIMA
models, 2) assume no correlation of thc error terms from the w" and i' ARIMA models, 3) do not
correct the test Statistics for hetcroscedasticity, or 4) assume that the error terms are i.i.d. These
experiments yield identical conclusions to the Monte Carlo results reported in the text.

   'Note that in Table 3 the probability of rejecting the null using the standard critical values
often declines as m increases. This reflects the fact that i' has significant autocorrelations for
lags greater than ni - 1 although the Hansen-Hodrick-Newey-Wcst-Whitc standard error
correction used here, which is standard in the literature, does not allow for non-zero autocorrela-
lions for lags greater than rn - 1. When ihc standard error correction allows for non-zero
autocorrelations for up to 36 lags, the Monte Carlo experiments no longer show that the
probability of rejecting the null using the standard critical values declines as     increases.

appreciably with an increased sample size.7' We also see from the Monte
Carlo 5% critical values of the t-statistics in column 5, that t-statistics need to
he greater than 9.5 to indicate a statistically significant ,. coefficient for the
full sample. while they need to exceed 13.0 for the pre-Octoher 1979 sample.
The potential for a spurious regression result between the level of interest
rates and future inflation is thus very high.
       The last c&umn of Table 3 indicates that the test results in Table I do
not provide evidence for the forecasting ability of short-term interest rates for
future inflation. This column contains the marginal significance levels for the
t-tests of , = 0 in Table 1 calculated from the Monte Carlo simulations
assuming that the levels of inflation and interest rates have unit roots. These
marginal significance levels are indeed quite high, and for no horizon or
sample period do they indicate that a a,,. coefficient is statistically sig-
nificant.21 The results in Table 3, along with the finding that unit roots in
inflation and interest rates cannot be rejected, thus indicates that the usual
methodology of regressing the level of inflation on the level of an interest rate
is not able to provide evidence that the level of short-term interest rates has



   29ndeed, as Phillips (1986) points out, the bias is likely to increase as the sample size grows.
We do see this tendency in the table; the longer Panel A and B samples have greater bias than
the shorter Panel C and D samples.

   2'Using data for one and three month Treasury bills (which arc available before 1959) along
with the inflation data, 1 also conducted all the tests and Monte Carlo simulations reported in
Tables ito 4 for the January 1953 to July i71 sample period used in Fama (1975), as well as for
the January 1953 to October 1979 sample period and the January 1953 to December 1986 sample
period. The results were very similar to those for the sample periods used in the text. In no case
was the null of a unit root rejected for the interest rate or inflation rate in any of these sample
periods. Under the assumption of unit root, none of the /3,, coefficients was found to be
statistically significant in any of these sample periods when is assumed to have a MA process
or order rn - 1. When t is allowed to have a MA process of order 36, however, a /3 coefficient
is Found to be statistically significant in only one case in these sample periods: in the January
 1953 to July 1971 period when rn = 1, the marginal significance level of the t-statistic on /3,,,
calculated from the Monte Carlo simulations assuming unit root is 0.028.

any ability to forecast future infIation. Thus we need to look at other
methodologies to examine the relationship between interest rates arid
inflation.


    IV. Testing For Long-Run and Short-Run Fisher Effects

       The forecasting regression equation in (1) does not make a distinction
between short-run and long-run forecasting ability and hence between short-
run and long-run Fisher effects. An absence of short-run forecasting ability
for interest rates might lead to an inability to reject = 0 in equation (1)
even though higher levels of interest rates are associated with higher levels
of inflation in the long-run. Thus the finding that the regression relationship
between short-term interest rates and future inflation may be spurious if they
have unit roots does not rule out the existence of a long-run Fisher effect in
which inflation and interest rates have a common trend when they exhibit
trends.
        Engle and Granger (1987) have demonstrated the linkage between the
presence of common stochastic trends and the concept of cointegration. If ,r"
and iT are both integrated of order I [denoted by saying that they are 1(1)] then



   Note that as Dejong. Nankcrvis, Savin and Whitcrnan (1988) point out, the failure to reject
 unit roots may be the result of low power for unit root tests. This conjecture is confirmed for the
unit root tests of Table 2 by conducting Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting power
calculations found in the first appendix indeed indicate that the power of the unit root tests is
extremely low, rarely getting above one-half. Thus the possibility that the levels of inflation and
interest rates are stationary time series Cannot he ruled out. Monte Carlo simulations for the 1-
tests of Table I which assume stationarity rather than unit roots in these series doyield significant
rejections of ,. = 0 in thc full sample and the pre-October 1979 sample periods, but not in the
post October 1979 sample periods. Priors that interest ratesand inflation rates arc stationary
stochastic variables would then lead to a view that the results in Table I do provide evidencefor
the ability of the level of interest rates toforecast the future level of inflation. However, thisview
would be based on a prior rather than evidence in the data.

they are said to he cointegrated of order 1,1 fdenoted by C1(1,1)j if a linear
combination of them is integrated of order zero. In other words n' and i' are
Cl( 1,1). if they are both 1(1) and if     is 1(0) in the following so-called
cointegrating regression:


(3)      ir''   =      + i'' +
Note that this cointegrating regression is identical to the forecasting
regressions in (1). Engle and Granger then show that a test for cointegration
involves estimating the cointegrating regression above using ordinary least
squares (unless,8 is assumed to be known) and then conducting unit root tests
for the regression residual '. In other words, the cointegration of ir'' and i",
which is what we mean by a long-run Fisher effect, implies that a linear
combination of these variables is stationary.
      Table 4 presents the results of two sets of cointegration tests using the
Dickey-Fuller t-statistic and the Phillips Z, and Z statistics. The first set
which are found in columns two through four in Table 4 test for a unit root in
   -       i.e., the cointegration tests using the estimated cointegrating
regressions already presented in Table 1. The second set, in columns five
through seven, conduct unit root tests for ir -i' and assume that = 1 in the
cointegrating regression. These latter tests can be characterized [Galli
(1988)1 as testing for a full Fisher effect in which inflation and interest rates
move one-for-one in the long run.
      Another way of looking at the second set of tests is to recognize that
they are tests for unit roots in the ex-ante real interest rate under the
assumption of rational expectations. This can he demonstrated as follows.
The ex-ante real interest rate for an rn-period bond (rr'") is defined to be:

where E, denotes the expectation taken at time t. By subtracting the forecast
error of rn-period inflation, €T = ir" - E,irT, from both sides and multiplying
both sides by -1, we then see        that ir -iT can be written as:

(5)         ir" -i'            = €" -rr''

Since under rational expectations the forecast error of inflation ' must he
unforecastable given any information known at time t,           'will be 1(0). Hence,
  -   i' can only be 1(1) if rrT is also 1(1). Testing for a unit root in rT - iT is thus
equivalent to testing for a unit root in the ex-ante real rate, rr". Looking at the
second set of cointegration tests in this light indicates that the full long-run
Fisher effect can be interpreted as the hypothesis that the ex-ante real rate is
Stationary.
      The format of Table 4 is identical to that of Table 2. The first number
in the column is the test statistic, the number in parentheses directly under
this is the marginal significance level of that test statistic generated by Monte
Carlo simulations. In the Monte Carlo experiments used to construct the
marginal significance levels of the cointegration tests, the data generating
process for the irT and iT variables was obtained from ARIMA models in first
differenced form (i.e., assuming unit roots). The Monte Carlo experiments
again used the procedures outlined earlier, allowing for contemporaneous
correlation of the error terms along the lines of Mankiw and Shapiro (1986)
and Stambaugh (1986).
       The cointegration tests in Table 4 tell the following story. For the pre-
October 1979 period, there is strong evidence for a common stochastic trend
                                              17

in inflation and interest rates. The null of no cointegration is rejected at the
five percent level using the unit root tests for irT - iT in all the horizons
except twelve months. Similarly unit root tests of ,r' - i' also find support for
cointegration for horizons of one to six months.
       There is also evidence for cointegration in the other sample periods of
Table 4, but it is not as strong as for the pre-Octoher 1979 sample period. In
Panel A, C and D we find rejections of unit roots when the horizon is one
month, but notforlonger horizons. However, as Dejong, Nankervis, Savin and
Whiternan (1988) point out the power of these unit root tests may be quite
low and power calculations provided in the first appendix confirms the low
power of the tests in Table 4. Hence the inability to reject unit roots in these
periods should not be viewed as evidence against the existence of a long-run
Fisher effect. Furthermore, using data on one and three month Treasury bills
for the January 1953 to October 1979 and January 1953 to December 1986
sample periods provides strong support for the cointegration of inflation and
interest rates: the null hypothesis of a unit root in irT - i' is always rejected at
the 1% level. Overall, then, the evidence is quite supportive of the existence
of a long-run Fisher effect.23 Indeed, any reasonable model would almost
surely suggest that real interest rates have mean-reverting tendencies, and this
is consistent with the evidence here which supports the existence of a long-
run Fisher effect.
       The long-run Fisher effect we have found evidence for above tells us
that when the interest rate is higher for a long period of time, then the
expected inflation rate will also tend to be high. A short-run Fisher effect, on
the other hand, indicates that a change in the interest rate is associated with
an immediate change in the expected inflation rate. In other words, we should


   'Galli (1988) also comcs to this conclusion.

expect to find a significant positive           coefficient in the following regression
equation.

(6)         E[7r'] - E,.1[ir"1]   =        + [i7 - i1]      +   u

Because this equation is not estimable, we need to substitute in for expected
inflation by recognizing that = E[7r'1 + e', where is orthogonal to any
information available at time t under rational expectations. This substitution
results in,


(7)        ir'      =       +          +


where,
            t7      = u"

The presence of c in the error term, means that the error term can be
correlated with the explanatory variable iT in (7) since rational expectations
does not rule Out the correlation with c and information known at time t,
such asiT. Consistent estimates are obtained here by using the two-step two-
stage least squares procedure outlined in Cumby, Huizinga and Obstfeld
(1983),24where the instruments contain information only known at time t-1.25

can he non-zero.
                                                19

Because of the evidence for cointegration, one natural way to choose these
instruments is by estimating error correction models of the type described by
Engle and Granger (1987) in which the variables do not contain information
known after time t-1, and then choose the significant variables from these
models as instruments.
       The results from estimating the regression equation above for the
different rn-horizons and sample periods (starting with the January 1965 date
because the need for lagged instruments rules out starting earlier) are found
in Table 5•26 In assessing the statistical significance of the t-statistics on a,,,, we
again conduct Monte Carlo simulations to provide the marginal significance
level of the t-statistic reported in the last column of Table 5. Given the
evidence for cointegration, the data generating process is specified to be one
in which the ir'' and AiT variables are generated from error correction models
in which the current and past values ofiT do not appear in the AT'' equation,
since under the null i' has no forecasting ability for



  'Note that the R's from an instrumental variables procedure are not as meaningful as in an
OLS regression and arc not guaranteed to be positive. This is why we sometimes see negative
R2s in Table 5.
   27Note that these error-correction models differ from the ones used to choose the instruments
because there is no longer the restriction that the explanatory variables in these models must only
contain information available at time t-1. Also, since the power of the cointegration andunit root
tests is low, we often cannot rule out that r' and i' arc stationary in levels or have unit roots but
with no cointegration. Since these are also reasonable choices for specification of the data
generating process ohr'and i, Monte Carlo simulations have beenconductedfor these twocases
as well using the same procedures described earlier which allow for the contemporaneous
correlation of error terms. Because ir and      do not display much serial correlation in the
regression equation (7) above, these Monte Carlo simulations produce similar results. They both
indicate that the t-statistic when m = I in the Panel C sample period is significant at the 5% level
but not at the 1% level, as is found in TableS. The experiments in which ,r' and i haveunit roots
but arc not cointegrated indicate that no other t-statistics are statistically significant, just as in
Table S. while the experiments in which ,r' and i' are stationary in levels indicate that only one
other t-statistic is significant at the 5% but not the 1% level (when = 6 in the Panel C sample
 period).

       The most striking feature of the Table 5 results is that the ,. coeffi-
cients are as likely to be negative, and thus have the wrong sign for a short-
run Fisher effect, as they are to he positive. Furthermore, only one
coefficient is found to he significantly different from zero (when .rn = in            1


Panel C) and in this case the coefficient is negative.28 Therefore, there is
absolutely no evidence for the presence of a short-run Fisher effect in the
regression results of Table 5. In addition, regression results usingdata on one
and three month Treasury bills for the January 1953 to October 1979 and
January 1953 to December 1986 sample periods also do not reveal any
significant coefficients, and so suggest that there is no short-run Fisher
effect.


          V. Interpreting Inflation Forecasting Equations

      The conclusion from the preceding empirical analysis is that there is
evidence for a long-run Fisher effect but not for a short-run Fisher effect.
This characterization of the inflation and interest rate data along with the
assumption of rational expectations can be used to provide a straightforward
interpretation of when we will be likely to see estimated         coefficients
substantially above zero in the inflation forecasting equations. As in Mishkin
(1990). we can derive an expression for the coefficient in the inflation
forecasting equation (1) by writing down the standard formula for the
projection coefficient,, while recognizing that the covariance of the inflation




stage least squares. With OLS there arc two significant   ,

                                                             coefficients, but again they arc
negative. The fact that OLS yiclds similar conclusions to those n Table 5 suggests that the
inability to find a short-run Fisher effect does nor stem from the procedure used here for
choosing instruments.

expectations. The resulting formula for         is:

where,
           a      =     o[E,(r')]/a[rr''] =    the ratio of the unconditional
                        standard deviation of the expected rn-period inflation
                        rate to the unconditional standard deviation of the m-
                        period real interest rate.
            p     =     the unconditional correlation coefficient between the
                        expected rn-period inflation rate, E(irT), and the m-
                        period real interest rate, rr'.
         The equation above indicates that 8, is determined by how variable the
level of expected inflation is relative to the variability of the real interest rate
[represented by a, the ratio of the standard deviations of E(ir') and rrT}, as
well as by the correlation of the expected inflation rate with the real interest
rate (p). Figure 1 shows how varies with a and p.
       As we can see in Figure 1, when the variability of the level of inflation
is greater than the variability of the real interest rate, so that a is above 1.0.
the coefficient will exceed 0.5 and will increase as a increases. If inflation
has a unit root and thus does not have a stationary stochastic process, as is
consistent with the empirical evidence in this paper. then its second moment
is not well defined and the standard deviation of the inflation level will grow
with the sample size. On the other hand, the existence of a long-run Fisher
effect implies that even if inflation and interest rates have unit roots, the real
 interest rate has a stationary stochastic process and will have a well defined

standard deviation that does not grow with the sample size. Hence when we
are in sample period in which inflation and interest rates have unit roots, the
existence of a long-run Fisher effect means that o must necessarily exceed
one and produce a value of substantially above zero, as long as the sample
size is large enough.
       It is important to note that the reasoning above applies equally well if
inflation and interest rates have a deterministic trend rather than a stochastic
trend. A deterministic trend also implies that the standard deviation of the
inflation level will grow with the sample size. On the other hand, the long-
run Fisher effect of a common deterministic trend for inflation and interest
rates leads to stationary behavior for the real rate so that it has a well defined
standard deviation that does not grow with the sample size. Then the
reasoning follows as above.
      We now see that a long-run Fisher effect in which inflation and interest
rates have a common trend will produce a,,, substantially above zero in long
samples even when there is substantial variation in the real interest rate.
However, if there is substantial variation in the real rate when we are in a
sample in which inflation is a stationary stochastic variable, the standard
deviation of the real rate might wellexceed the standard deviation in expected
inflation, which is now well defined and does not grow with the sample size.
The result would be a c less than one. Thus in a period when inflation and
interest rates do not have trends, we might expect to find estimated values of
$m that are close to zero.
       The above interpretation does help explain the results we have found
in Table 1. We can calculate estimated values of a and p using the procedure
outlined in Mishkin (1981), in which estimates of the real rate. rr'. are
obtained from fitted values of regressions of the ex-post real rate on past
inflation changes and past interest rates.2 Then the estimated expected
inflation is calculated from the following definitional relationship,


(9)        E(irT) = i" -      rr'

Finally estimates of atE(iT')], o[rrTl, and p are calculated from the estimated
E(rT) and rr'.3°
       Consistent with the view that inflation has a unit root, which we were
unable to reject except in one instance in the November 1979 - October 1982
sample period, we find that the estimated standard deviation of expected
inflation is much larger for the longer full sample and pre-October 1979
sample periods than it is for either of the shorter post-October 1979 sample
periods. On the other hand, our rejection of a unit root in the real rate,
implies that the standard deviation of the real rate should not necessarily be
larger in the longer sample periods. Again this is exactly what we find: the
post-October 1982 and pre-Octoher 1979 sample periods have standard
deviations of the real rate that are similar in magnitude. However, as is
documented in Huizinga and Mishkin (1986), the standard deviation of the
real rate is extremely high during the November 1979 - October 1982 sample
period, which also raises the standard deviation of the real rate in the full
sample period. The outcome is that the a's for the longer sample periods


  The estimates dcscrihcd in the text were generated from OLS regressions in which the ex-
post real rate. eprr'. was rcgrcssed on i. and on c'.,, and I also experimented with other
choices of lags and the estimated values of o and p were robust to different specifications of the
regression equations.
   'Thc estimates of p are around -t).8 in the pie-October 1979 and November 1979 - October
1982 sample periods, arc around -0.25 in the full sample period and range from -0.5 to +0.8 in
the post-October 1982 sample period. These values arc not crucial to the interpretation outlined
in the text, hut they do indicate that the curves drawn in Figure 1 arc the relevant ones louse in
interpretation of the estimated

generally exceed 1.0, especially in the pre-Octoher 1979 sample period when
they are above 2.0. and they thus generate ,'s which are greater than 0.5. On
the other hand, for the two shorter post-October 1979 sample periods, the a 's
are always below 1.0, except for in = I in the post-October 1982 period and
this explains why the ,'s are so low. The fact that the estimated ,'s are
substantially above zero in the longer postwar sample periods is then well
explained by inflation and interest rates having a common trend!'



                                    VI. Conclusions

      This paper has reexamined the widely accepted view that there is a
strong Fisher effect in postwar U. S. data. Recognition that the level of
inflation and interest rates may contain stochastic trends suggests that the
apparent ability of short-term interest rates to forecast inflation in the
postwar United States is spurious. This finding explains why a finding of
inflation forecasting ability for short-term interest rates has so little
robustness. The evidence presented here thus calls for a major rethinking
about the strength of the Fisher effect.
       The finding that the forecasting relationship between inflation and
short-term interest rates might be spurious suggests that there might be no
short-run Fisher effect. Direct tests confirm that this is the case. However,


    'So far we have been interpreting when we are likely to see a strong correlation between the
level of interest rates and inflation using the assumption of rational expectations. An alternative
interpretation would be that expectations arc not rational and that expectations of inflation adjust
slowly. Then when there are no trends in inflation and interest rates, their correlation would be
low even if the correlation of expected inflation and interest rates arc high. On the other hand,
if inflation and interest rates have strong trends, then a strong correlation of expected inflation
and interest rates would necessarily yield a strong correlation of realized inflation and interest
rates.
                                      25

the absence of a short-run Fisher effect does not rule out the possible
existence of along-run Fishereffect inwhich inflation and interest rates trend
together in the long run when they exhibit trends. Cointegration tests for a
common trend in interest rates and inflation provides support for the
existence of a long-run Fisher effect. Indeed, the findings here are more
consistent with the views expressed in Fisher (1930) than with the standard
characterization of the so called Fisher effect in the last fifteen years. Fisher
did not state that there should be a strong short-run relationship between
expected inflation and interest rates. Rather he viewed the positive relation-
ship between inflation and interest rates as a long-run phenomenon. The
evidence in this paper thus supports a return to Irving Fisher's original charac-
terization of the inflation-interest rate relationship.
      In addition, the evidence here can explain why the Fisher effect appears
to be strong only for particular sample periods, but not for others. The
conclusion that there is a long-run Fisher effect implies that when inflation
and interest rates exhibit trends, these two series will trend together and thus
there will be a strong correlation between inflation and interest rates. The
postwar period before October 1979 is exactly when we find the strongest
evidence for stochastic trends in the inflation and interest rates. Not
surprisingly, then, this should be the period where the Fisher effect is most
apparent in the data, and this is exactly what we find. On the other hand, the
nonexistence of a short-run Fisher effect implies that when either inflation
and interest rates do not display trends, there is no long-run Fisher effect to
produce a strong correlation between interest rates and inflation. Thus, it is
again not surprising during periods when there is some evidence that inflation
does not exhibit a stochastic trend, as in the October 1979 to September 1982
period or pre World War II, that we can not detect a Fisher effect in U.S. data.

The analysis in this paper resolves an important puzzle about the presence of
the Fisher effect.

        The Implications of Nonstationarity of Regressors
        and Cointegration for Tests on Real Rate Behavior

        The evidence in this paper is consistent with the view that interest rates
and inflation are nonstationary, but are cointegrated of order Cl[l.,1].
However, the standard regression tests on real interest rate behavior
appearing in the literature which uses interest rates and inflation as regressors
are based on asymptotic distribution theory which assumes the stationarity of
the regressors. Thus the inferences in the literature about real rate behavior
are somewhat suspect. This appendix reexamines the regression evidence on
real interest rates using Monte Carlo experiments which follow along lines
similar to those in the text.
       TableA3 reports regression results inwhich the ex-post real rate (eprr''
=   i' - ir'') is regressed on the nominal interest rate, i. The standard errors are
calculated with the Hansen-Hodrick-Newey-West-White procedure allowing
for heteroscedasticity which is described in the text. As is pointed out in
Mishkin (1981, 1989). regressions with the ex-post real rate as the dependent
variable allow us to make inferences about the relationship of the ex ante real
rate with the regressors under the assumption of rational expectations. In
addition, the tests of = 0 in Table A3 are identical to Fama's (1975) test for
constancy of the real rate in which he tests for a unit coefficient on the
nominal interest rate in a regression of inflation on the interest rate.
      The quite large t-statistics for ,, in Table A3 appear to strongly reject
the constancy of the real interest rate. The are positive for the full sample
period and the post-October 1979 sample periods, indicating a positive
correlation of real and nominal interest rates in those periods, while the pre-
October 1979 sample period displays negative .             and   hence a negative

inflation, E1[irTj, as the explanatory variable. Here the regressions are
estimated with the two-step two-stage least squares procedure outlined in
Cumby, Huizinga and Ohstfeld (1983), generating expected inflation using as
instruments the nominal interest rate and two lags of inflation following along
the lines of Huizinga and Mishkin (1986a).34 These results also appear to
strongly reject the constancy of the real rate with large t-statistics on 6m, with
the exception of the post-October 1982 sample period. Furthermore, the a,,,
coefficients are almost always negative suggesting a negative correlation
between real rates and expected inflation. This negative association of real
rates and expected inflation has also been repeatedly found in the literature
for many sample periods."
      Table A5 and A6 examine whether the high t-statistics inTablesA3 and
A4 really do produce statistically significant rejections of the constancy of the
real rate. The Monte Carlo simulation experiments were conducted as
follows. The data generating process is specified to be one in which the Mr'
and AiT variables are generated from error correction models in which the
parameters were estimated from the relevant sample periods. The ex-post
real rates were generated assuming that the ex-post real rates were serially
uncorrelated, which must he the case under the null hypothesis of constant

   More specifically, the instruments arc the constant term i", w7.,and        The Newey-West
(1987) technique is used to ensure positive-definiteness of the variance-covariance matrix rather
than a spectral method as in Cumby, Huizinga and Obstfeld (1983).

real rates and rational expectations. The error terms were drawn from a
normal distribution in which the variance follows an ARCI-1 process whose
parameters were also estimated from the relevant sample periods. Start up
values were generated with the procedure described earlier in the paper.
       The results in Table A5 indicate that the nonstationarity of the
regressors has little impact on inference. For the longer sample periods in
Panels A and B, the critical values and the percentage rejections using the
usual critical values are very close to those from the standard asymptotic
distributions. With the shortening of the sample period in Panels C and D, the
percentage rejections are higher than that indicated by the asymptotic
distribution and grow with the degree of overlap in the data (i.e., a higher.rn).
However, this phenomenon does not appear to be the result of nonstationarity
of the regressors, hut is rather a small sample problem which appears in other
contexts.36 The last column in Table AS gives the marginal significance levels
for the tests of real rate constancy from the Monte Carlo experiments, and not
surprisingly given the large t-statistics in Table A3, in all but one case the
constancy of real rates is rejected, and usually the rejection is at the 1% level.
       Table A6 tells a fairly similar story to Table A5. The constancy of the
real rates is strongly rejected in all but the post-October 1982 sample period -
- but even in this period there is one rejection at the 5% significance level (for
in I in Panel D).
       The final two tables report on tests of correlation of the real rate with
both nominal rates and expected inflation. Here the constancy of the real rate
is no longer assumed. The interest rate and ex post real rate variables are
generated with the same procedures as used in Tables AS and A6, except that
ex-post real rates are now allowed to have serial correlation, so that they are

generated from ARIMA models. In other words, the null now assumes that
inflation and interest rates are contegrated. hut that the real rate is not
constant.
       The results in Tables A7 and A8 indicate that allowing real rates to be
serially correlated does have a major impact on the Monte Carlo results. Now
the percentage rejections are much greater than that indicated by the standard
asymptotic distribution. Using a 5% critical value, we sometimes see that the
test statistics reject over fifty percent of the time in Table A7 if the null is true.
The last column in Tables A7 and A8 tell us the statistical significance of the
correlation of real rates with nominal rates and expected inflation, not
assuming constancy of the real rates.         The Table A7 marginal significance
levels from the Monte Carlo experiments indicate that there is some evidence
for a positive correlation between nominal and real interest rates in the full
Panel A sample period: we can reject the null of no correlation at the 5% level
in two cases, whenni = 9 and 12 and at the 10% level form = 1 and 3. On the
other hand, the Panel B results cast doubt on the view that real and nominal
rates were significantly negatively correlated in the pre-October 1979 period
because, except for in = 1 when the marginal significance level is 0.069, the
marginal significance levels are quite high despite the apparently large t-
statistics in Table A3. The Panel C results, however, do suggest a significant
positive correlation between real and nominal interest rates in the October
1979 to September 1982 period when the Fed altered its operating procedures.
The null of no correlation can he rejected at the five percent level for in = 1
and 12 and the marginal significance levels are fairly low for the other
horizons. The post-October 1982 sample period provides some weak evidence
for a positive correlation of real and nominal rates, because all the marginal
significance levels are near the 10% level although there are no rejections at

the 5% level.
        The Table A8 marginal significance levels suggest that the evidence for
a negative association or real interest rates with expected inflation is weaker
than we would expect from the large t-statistics found in the regressions. Only
in the Panel B, pre-October 1979 sample period do we always find rejection of
the null of no correlation between real rates and expected inflation at the five
percent level. We also find two significant rejections of the null of no
correlation between real rates and expected inflation in the Panel C,
November 1979 to October 1982 sample period. However, we do not find that
the rejections of the null in either the Panel A, full sample period, or in the
Panel D, November 1982 to December 1986 sample period. Overall, Table 2
and 6 indicate that there is evidence for a negative association of real rates
and expected inflation, but that it is not always strong in all the sample
periods.
        Analyzing the importance of nonstationarity of the regressors to
inference about real interest rate behavior indicates that our views on the
strong rejections of constancy of realm interest rates does hold up to the
scrutiny here. However, we may have to weaken somewhat our views of how
strong the support is for the correlation of real rates with nominal rates and
expected inflation."




   'Monte Carlo simulations which examine thc strength of conclusions about whether there was
a shift in the stochastic process of real interest rates in October 1979 and October 1982 have not
been studied here because this has already been done in Huizinga and Mishkin (1986b). The set
up of the experiments there is consistent with the conclusions reached in this paper, because
nominal rates and inflation arc assumed to he non-stationary hut cointegrated of order C1[1,1).
The results there provide strong support for the position that shifts in the stochastic process of
real interest rates did take place with the change of Federal Reserve operating procedures in
October 1979 and October 1982.
