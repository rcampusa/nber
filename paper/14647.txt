                                               ABSTRACT

This is the introduction and summary to the fourth phase of an ongoing project on Social Security
Programs and Retirement Around the World. The first phase described the retirement incentives inherent
in plan provisions and documented the strong relationship across countries between social security
incentives to retire and the proportion of older persons out of the labor force. The second phase documented
the large effects that changing plan provisions would have on the labor force participation of older
workers. The third phase demonstrated the consequent fiscal implications that extending labor force
participation would have on net program costs—reducing government social security benefit payments
and increasing government tax revenues.

This volume presents the results of analyses of the relationship between the labor force participation
of older persons and the labor force participation of younger persons in twelve countries. Why countries
introduced plan provisions that encouraged older persons to leave the labor force is unclear. After
the fact, it is now often claimed that these provisions were introduced to provide more jobs for the
young, assuming that fewer older persons in the labor force would open up more job opportunities
for the young. Now, the same reasoning is often used to argue against efforts in the same countries
to reduce or eliminate the incentives for older persons to leave the labor force, claiming that the consequent
increase in the employment of older person would reduce the employment of younger persons. The
validity of such claims is addressed in this volume.

       Several years ago we began an international project to study the

relationship between social security program provisions and retirement. Under

pay-as-you-go social security systems most developed countries have made

promises they can’t keep. The systems in their current forms are not financially

sustainable. What caused the problem? It has been common to assume that the

problem was caused by aging populations. The number of older persons has

increased very rapidly relative to the number of younger persons and this trend

will continue. Thus the proportion of retirees has increased relative to the

number of employed persons who must pay for the benefits of those who are

retired.   In addition, persons are living longer so that those who reach retirement

age are receiving benefits longer than they used to. The effect of aging

populations and increasing longevity has been compounded by another trend:

until recently older persons had been leaving the labor force at younger and

younger ages, further increasing the ratio of retirees to employed persons. What

has not been widely appreciated is that the provisions of social security programs

themselves often provide strong incentives to leave the labor force. By

penalizing work, social security systems magnify the increased financial burden

caused by aging populations and thus contribute to their own insolvency.

       Why countries introduced plan provisions that encouraged older persons

to leave the labor force is unclear. After the fact, it is now often claimed that

these provisions were introduced to provide more jobs for the young, assuming



                                        3 of 74
that fewer older persons in the labor force would open up more job opportunities

for the young. In some cases this may have been a motivation for the provisions

but in other instances it was not, as shown by illustrations presented below.

Now, the same reasoning is also often used to argue against efforts in the same

countries to reduce or eliminate the incentives for older persons to leave the

labor force, claiming that the consequent increase in the employment of older

person would reduce the employment of younger persons. Here are a few

examples:

   •   “The Job Release Scheme is “a measure which allows older workers to
       retire early in order to release jobs for the registered unemployed” (The
       United Kingdom: the 1977 Labour Government: SOURCE …)

   •   “We will extend the voluntary Job Release Scheme to men over 60 so that
       those who want to retire early vacate jobs for those who are currently
       unemployed. This could take as many as 160,000 people out of
       unemployment and into work.” (The United Kingdom: the 1987 Labour
       Party manifesto says: SOURCE …)

   •   “And I would like to speak to the elders, to those who have spent their
       lifetime working in this region, and well, I would like them to show the way,
       that life must change; when it is time to retire, leave the labor force in
       order to provide jobs for your sons and daughters. That is what I ask you.
       The Government makes it possible for you to retire at age 55. Then retire,
       with one’s head held high, proud of your worker’s life. This is what we are
       going to ask you… This is the “contrat de solidarité” [an early retirement
       scheme available to the 55+ who quit their job]. That those who are the
       oldest, those who have worked, leave the labor force, release jobs so that
       everyone can have a job.” (France: Pierre Mauroy, French Prime Minister,
       in Lille 27th September 1981, quoted in Gaullier (1982), L’avenir à
       reculons, page 230.)

   •   “The lowering of the retirement age strengthens the positive effects on
       employment that early retirement policies made possible. It even widens
       these positive effects as a larger share of the population is concerned.”
       (France: Ministry of Employment, in La retraite à 60 ans, Droit social n°4 –
       avril 1983.)




                                      4 of 74
   •   “Unemployment among the youth is perhaps the most serious problem of
       today, because we cannot hide from the fact that we risk losing a whole
       generation of young persons from the labour market and from society as a
       whole.” (Denmark, with respect to the Post Employment Wage: The
       Minister of Labour, Svend Auken, Proceedings of Parliament, 1978).

The validity of such claims is addressed in this volume. It presents the results of

analyses of the relationship between the labor force participation of older persons

and the labor force participation of younger persons in twelve countries.

       This is the fourth phase of the ongoing project. The first phase described

the retirement incentives inherent in plan provisions and documented the strong

relationship across countries between social security incentives to retire and the

proportion of older persons out of the labor force (Gruber and Wise 1999). The

second phase, based on microeconomic analysis of the relationship between a

person’s decision to retire and the program incentives faced by that person,

documented the large effects that changing plan provisions would have on the

labor force participation of older workers. (Gruber and Wise 2004) The third

phase demonstrated the consequent fiscal implications that extending labor force

participation would have on net program costs—reducing government social

security benefit payments and increasing government tax revenues. (Gruber and

Wise 2007) The analyses in the first two phases, as well as the analysis in the

third phase, are summarized in the introduction to the third phase.

       The results of the ongoing project are the product of analyses conducted

for each country by analysts in that country. Researchers who have participated

       An important goal of the project has been to present results that were as

comparable as possible across countries. Thus the papers for each phase were

prepared according to a detailed template that we prepared in consultation with

country participants.

       In this introduction, we summarize the collective results of the country

analyses. In large part, the results presented in the introduction could only be

conveyed by combined analysis of the data from each of the countries. The

country papers themselves present much more detail for each country and, in




                                       6 of 74
addition to template analyses performed by each country, often present country-

specific analysis relevant to a particular country.

       The proposition that more work by older persons reduces the job

opportunities for younger persons put forth in many different forms. It is

sometimes referred to by economists as the “lump of labor” theory. Taken

literally, this statement of the theory says that if an additional older worker is

employed one younger worker must be displaced. The implication is that

economies are boxed and that the box cannot be enlarged.

       In this volume, we emphasize the relationship between the employment

rate of older persons and the unemployment and employment rates of younger

persons, in particular youth. We emphasize employment and unemployment

rates because public discourse about the relationship is typically in terms of

these rates—that the unemployment rate of youth, for example, will be increased

if incentives for older persons to leave the labor force are eliminated.

1. The Context

       At first glance, it seems clear that economies are not boxed. The flow of

women into the labor force in the past few decades has increased the size of the

labor force enormously in many countries. For example, the number of women in

the labor force in the United Stated increased by almost 48 million between 1960

and 2007, from about 34 percent to 46 percent of the labor force. But the

employment rate of men changed little as the proportion of women employed

increased. Figure 1-1 shows the percent change in the employment rate of men

compared to the percent increase in the female employment rate in the twelve




                                        7 of 74
countries participating in this project. In this figure, the number of years over

which the change occurred varies from country to country. The longest period is

from 1960 to 2006 (in Germany) and the shortest from 1983 to 2004 (in Belgium).

Two features of the data stand out. First, there was a small decline in the

employment rate of men over this time period in all but one of the countries, but,

second, on average, the smallest of the small declines were in the countries with

the largest increase in the employment rate for women. For example, in the

Netherlands, the employment rate of women increased by 54 percentage points,

but the employment rate of men declined by only 1 percentage point. Very

similar results are obtained if the same span of years is used for all countries—

1983 to 2004.

       The results are summarized more succinctly in Figure 1-2 that compares

the six countries with the smallest to the six countries with the largest increase in

the employment rate of women. The results are shown both for the variable-

years version and the same-years version. The smallest of the small decreases

in the employment of men are in the countries with the greatest increase in the

employment rate of women. For example, for the same years (1983 to 2003) the

average increase in the employment rate of women was 23 percentage points in

the countries with the greatest increase and in these countries the decline in the

employment rate of men was only 2 percentage points. On the other hand, the

average increase in the employment rate of women was only 6 percentage points

in the countries with the smallest increase in the employment rate of women and

the decline in the employment rate of men in these countries was 4 percentage




                                       8 of 74
points. In seems clear that the small decline in the employment rate of men was

not tied to the increase in the employment of women. The boxed economy

proposition seems quite inconsistent with these data.

      Why did the employment of men not decline when women entered the

labor force in large numbers? The reason is that the economies grew and

employed more people. Then why is it common for many observers to assume

that a new entrant into the labor force must “crowd out” someone who is currently

employed? Or, that a new employee can be hired only if a current employee

leaves? Perhaps one reason is that this might be the case in one’s own

workplace at any given moment. A university president may say that the classics

department can only make one new hire this year, but if someone retirees, two

new hires can be made. But over time, the number of professors typically

increases as the number of students increases. The “university economy” grows

over time and the total number of employees increases. Even if the number of

employees in one company or one industry can not increase in a given year (or



                                                10 of 74
even in the long run in declining industries) this will not be true for the economy

as a whole. Some companies or industries are declining but others are growing.

As women entered the labor force, the growing segments of the economy far

outstripped the declining segments.

       Could there be another relationship between the old and the young? That

is the question we address in this volume.

2. The Country Papers and the Data

       Each of the country papers begins with an historical summary of the

changes in social security program provisions over the past three or four

decades. The key question is whether social security plan provisions, that

provide incentives for older persons to leave the labor force, were prompted by

concerns about youth unemployment in particular. The evidence is based on a

review of legislation, press coverage, and other public discussion proceeding

program changes. The evidence gained in this way is further checked against

corresponding empirical evidence. For each country, the relationship between

the timing of program reforms and the trends in the employment of older persons

and the employment and unemployment of youth is described graphically. For

example, if public discussion suggests the program changes may have been

prompted by increasing youth unemployment, does the data show an increase in

youth unemployment prior to the program reform?

       The reason for emphasizing the extent to which the program provisions—

that induce older persons to leave the labor force—were prompted by youth

unemployment is to help to interpret the key relationships that are estimated in




                                      11 of 74
the country papers, as explained below. The core analyses presented in each of

the country papers are regression estimates of the relationship between the

employment rates of persons 55 to 64 on the one hand and the employment and

unemployment of youth 20 to 24 and prime age persons 25 to 54 on the other

hand. Several different estimation specifications of these relationships are

presented.

       These estimates follow on the estimates in previous phases of the project.

As noted above, the first phase of the project documented the strong relationship

across countries between program provisions that induce retirement and the

proportion of older persons out of the labor force. The second phase was based

on micro estimation of the relationship between the retirement incentives faced

by individuals and their retirement decisions. The central finding is the strong

relationship between social security program provisions that penalize work and

departure from the labor force. Now, the question is whether the departure of

older persons from the labor force expands the job opportunities of youth.

       The trends in the employment of older persons, however, reflect all

determinants of the employment of older persons, not only the social security

program incentives to leave the labor force. Thus, In addition to the template

components of the country analyses, that are common to each of the country

papers, a few of the country papers also present additional information that helps

to explain the developments in that country. For example, while the estimates—

of the “direct” effect of the employment of the old on the employment of the

young—are the central focus of the analysis in this phase, we have also




                                      12 of 74
considered whether it was feasible to estimate the relationship between changes

over time in the incentives inherent in social security plan provisions and the

employment of the young. The reason for considering this question was to

address more directly the effects of plan provisions that are the subject of public

discussion. This goal turned out to be very difficult to accomplish on a

comparable basis across countries. In particular, we were unable, on a

consistent basis across countries, to obtain a reliable measure of the average

incentives faced by persons retired in a given year. Perhaps most important,

even if the average were measured well, the average may not adequately

capture the wide range of incentives faced by individuals. In short, the procedure

we explored was not replicable across countries. Thus, such estimates are

presented in only a few of the country papers.

           The illustrations and the cross-country analyses presented in this

introduction are based on data provided by each country. Key data series are

shown here. Much of the answer to the central question posed in this volume

can be seen in the data themselves.

           Figures 2-1a to 2-1l show the data for each country. The first panel of

each figure shows the actual data for three series—the employment of persons

55 to 64 (E 55-64), the employment of youth 20 to 24 (E 20-24), and the

unemployment of youth 20 to 24 (UE 20-24).1 To simplify the figures, we have

not shown data for prime age persons (age 25 to 54). The employment and

unemployment rates for the prime age group typically parallel closely the rates of

    In Sweden the data for youth are for the age range 16 to 24.


                                                   13 of 74
youth and both series are shown in the country papers. In the analysis below we

present results for prime age persons, as well as for youth.

        The figures below show two versions of the data for each country. The

first panel shows the actual data as reported for each country. The second panel

shows the data adjusted for changes in GDP per capita, GDP growth, and the

proportion of GDP generated by manufacturing.2 The years for which data are

available varies from country to country. The longest period is from 1960 to 2006

(in Germany) and the shortest period from 1983 to 2004 (in Belgium).

        To obtain the adjusted data for a given country, we first determine how

each of the three employment series varies with GDP per capita, GDP growth,

and the “manufacturing share” in that country. Then beginning with the first year

of data for that country, the data for each subsequent year is adjusted based on

the change in the predictor variables between the first year and the subsequent

year. The same procedure is followed for each of the countries. (The details are

shown in the appendix.) Thus the adjusted series eliminates the movement in

each of the series that can be predicted by the change over time in the

adjustment variables in that country. In particular, each of the employment series

is adjusted for macroeconomic shocks to the economy that tend to affect each of

the series. Of course the employment series may be affected by other influences




2
  The adjustment in the United States, Japan, Spain, and Sweden is based on GDP per capita and GDP
growth only because the proportion of GDP generated by manufacturing is not available in all years for
these countries.


                                                14 of 74
imperfectly controlled for by the adjustment variables. Some such influences are

mentioned in the country papers.3

        In the subsequent analyses, we often show results based on both

unadjusted and adjusted data. Both are shown for two reasons: One is that we

often want to observe youth employment or unemployment rates prior to a given

reform in a country. For this purpose we what to use the unadjusted data. The

second reason is that it isn’t clear that estimates based on the adjusted data

always yield the best estimate of the effect of employment of the old on the

employment of the young.

        In addition, prolonged upward and downward trends in the employment of

persons 55 to 64 are marked by left-right arrows in each of the figures. The

arrows positions are determined on the basis of the unadjusted data and are in

the same positions on the adjusted data figures. These prolonged upward and

downward intervals are used in subsequent analysis.

        Three features of the data stand out. First, in each country, the

unadjusted data show substantial correlation among the series. As might be

expected, the employment of youth is positively correlated with the employment

of older persons. The unemployment of youth is negatively correlated with the

employment of older persons. That is, macro “shocks” to the economy affect

employment at all ages and in the same direction. Second, the variation over

time in each of the series is typically reduced when the change associated with

economic output per capita is controlled for. In some countries, the smoothing of

                                               15 of 74
the series trends is substantial. Third, and most important for our analysis, even

after adjusting for economic growth and the manufacturing share much of the

relationship between the employment of the old and the young remains.

      Simple perusal of the data reveals no evidence that increases in the

employment of older persons are related to a reduction in the employment of

younger persons, or that decreases in the employment of older persons are

associated with increases in the unemployment of younger persons.

       We next consider a series of estimates of the relationship between the

employment of older persons and the employment of youth and we show key

results for prime age persons as well. In section 3 we begin by showing how the

tax force to retire—emphasized in the first phase of the project—is related to the

employment of youth and prime age persons. In section 4 we show illustrative

within-country “natural experiment” comparisons that help to demonstrate the

relationship between within-country reforms and the consequent changes in the

employment of the old on the one hand and changes in the employment of the

young on the other hand. In section 5, we show cross-country comparisons

based on various comparison methods. To simplify the presentations in sections

4 and 5 we show results only for youth. In section 6, we show more formal

estimates based on panel regression analysis. In this section we show estimates

for prime age persons, as well as for youth. As it turns out, all of the various

estimation methods yield very consistent results. In particular, there is no

evidence that reducing the employment of older persons provides more job

opportunities for younger persons. And, there is no evidence that increasing the

labor force participation of older persons reduces the job opportunities of younger

persons. In section 7 we summarize the results.

3. The Employment of Youth and the Tax Force to Retire

       We begin by recalling the key finding from the first phase of the project in

which we considered the “tax force to retire.” The tax force to retire can be

explained in this way: Compensation for working another year, say at age 60,

can be divided into two parts—the wage earnings for an additional year of work




                                      29 of 74
and the change in the present value of future social security benefits. One might

suppose that if benefits will be received for one fewer years, then annual benefits

will be increased enough to offset their receipt of one fewer years. This is

typically not the case, however. The present value of benefits declines in most

countries. In some countries, the reduction in benefits is greater than 80 percent

of wage earnings. We then consider the sum of these percents (the ratio of the

loss in benefits to wage earnings) from the early retirement age in a country to

age 69. We call this sum the tax force to retire.

        The relationship between the tax force to retire and the proportion of men

55 to 65 was shown in the summary to the Phase I volume (Gruber and Wise

1999). One version of that relationship is reproduced as Figure 3-1. The strong

relationship between the tax force to retire and the proportion of older men out of

the labor force is apparent.

        If the incentives that reduced the proportion of older persons in the labor

force—increased the proportion out of the labor force—increase the job

opportunities of young persons, then the tax force to retire should be related to

youth employment. The greater the tax force to retire, the lower youth

unemployment should be and the greater youth employment should be. And

analogous relationships should be true for prime age persons. But this is not the

case.

        Figure 3-2 is the same as Figure 3-1 but with the addition of the

unemployment rate of young men 20 to 24. Essentially there is no relationship

across countries between the tax force for older persons to retire and the




                                       30 of 74
unemployment of young men. Indeed, the actual relationship is slightly

positive—the greater the tax force to retire the greater is youth unemployment.

       Figure 3-3 shows the unemployment rate of all youth, male and female

combined. Again there is a slightly positive relationship between the tax force to

induce older persons to leave the labor force and the unemployment rate of

youth 20 to 24.

       Figure 3-4 shows the relationship between the tax force for older persons

to leave the labor force and the employment of youth 20 to 24. If inducing older

persons to leave the labor force provides more jobs for the young, then the tax

force to retire—which is strongly related to the proportion of older persons out of

the labor force—should also be strongly related to the employment of youth. But

in fact the opposite is true. The greater the tax force to retire, the lower the

employment rate of youth.

       Figures 3-5 and 3-6 show the relationship between the tax force for older

persons to leave the labor force and the unemployment and employment of

prime age persons 25 to 54. Like the results for youth, the greater the tax force

to retire the greater the unemployment and the lower the employment of prime

age persons 25 to 54.

       In short, these results provide no evidence that inducing older persons to

leave the labor force frees up jobs for the young. If anything, the opposite is true;

paying for old persons to leave the labor force reduces the employment rate and

increases the unemployment rate of youth and of persons in their prime age

working years.

4. Within-Country Estimates of the Relationship between the Employment
of the Old and the Young

       In many instances it is possible to trace employment trends for both young

and older workers that preceded a social security reform in a country and then to

trace the effect of the reform on the labor force participation of older workers and,

in turn, the relationship between the effect on older workers and the effect on

younger workers. Several such illustrations are presented here. The illustrations

serve two important purposes. One reason is simply to demonstrate—as we

have in prior phases of the project—the effects of reform on the labor force

participation of older workers, and then to show the corresponding effect on

younger persons.

       The second reason to present the illustrations is to help to judge the

extent to which the further results shown below are affected by an important

issue that complicates estimation of the causal relationship between employment

of the old and the young. Suppose—as is now often claimed—that the program

provisions that induced older persons to leave the labor force were prompted by

increasing youth unemployment. In this case, a decline in youth unemployment

following the introduction of retirement incentives could simply have been a

continuation of the pre-incentive decline, and not caused by the incentive-

induced decline in the employment of older persons. To address this issue, we

have selected some examples in which specific reforms were apparently not

prompted by concerns about youth unemployment (or employment). We call




                                      35 of 74
these “natural experiment” or sometimes “natural experiment like” examples. We

want examples where the reform that induced older persons to leave the labor

force was “exogenous.” That is, not motivated by the employment or

unemployment of youth. Or, we want examples that are not contaminated by the

“endogeneity” problem. There is no sure way to correct for the problem, to the

extent that it exists. But, as comparison with subsequent results show, the

“natural experiment” results—that are not contaminated by endogeneity—are

very similar to the findings from comparisons in which we are less sure of the

extent of endogeneity. Thus the fact that later results are much like the findings

from these and other natural experiments lends credence to the results obtained

by other estimation methods.

       We have emphasized the “endogeneity” issue. The natural experiment

illustrations also address an additional and closely related issue. Economic

shocks to the economy are likely to induce parallel movements in both the

employment of the old and the employment of the young. We would like to

evaluate the effect of precipitating events that are intended to induce older

persons to leave the labor force, without a contemporaneous influence on the

employment of the young—unlike macro economic shocks that tend to affect

both simultaneously. The illustrations below also avoid the confounding effect of

economic shocks. Thus the fact that later results are much like the natural

experiment findings also adds credence to later results that could be confounded

by imperfect control for macro shocks.




                                      36 of 74
       Consider first an example for Germany. Before 1972, the social security

retirement age in Germany was 65, except for disability, and there was no social

security early retirement age. But legislation in 1972 provided for early

retirement at age 60 for women and at age 63 for men (given the accumulation of

35 required social security work years). In addition, increased liberal use of

disability and unemployment benefits effectively expanded the early retirement

option. Beginning in 1972 (with further provisions over the next 20 years), social

security early retirement benefits were made available with no actuarial reduction

in benefits available at the normal retirement age; benefits if taken at the early

retirement age were the same as if they were taken at the normal retirement age.

Delayed benefits were increased only through years of service, about 2.2 percent

a each year, well below an actuarially fair adjustment. The 1972 reform greatly

increased the incentive to leave the labor force early. Over the next four years

the employment rate of persons 55 to 64 fell by about seven percentage points, a

decrease of over 17 percent.

       Looking at the unadjusted data in Figure 2-1c, it seems clear that this

change could not have been motivated by an increase in the unemployment rate

of youth, since this rate had been very low throughout the prior decade. The

employment rate of youth had been falling in previous years, however. The

adjusted data show essentially no change in either the unemployment or the

employment rate over the prior 6 years, however.

       The 1992 reform introduced actuarial adjustment of benefits, to be phased

in beginning in 1998. In addition, benefits were based on net wages, rather than




                                      37 of 74
gross wages, which further reduced the incentive to leave the labor force. Since

this reform reduced the incentive for older persons to leave the labor force, it

could not have been motivated by the desire to provide jobs for the young by

inducing older persons to leave the labor force. Indeed, the labor force of older

persons increased following this reform. Between 1997 and 2006, the

employment rate of older persons increased from about 0.40 to 0.49, an increase

of about 23 percent.

       What was the effect of these reforms on the employment of youth? The

results are shown in Figures 4-1a and b. Figure 4-1a shows results based on the

unadjusted data. A seven percentage point reduction in the employment rate of

older persons between 1972 and 1976 was associated with a two percentage

point reduction in the employment of youth, not an increase, and was associated

with a 1.7 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate of youth, not a

reduction. The 15 percentage point increase in the employment rate of older

persons following the1998 actuarial adjustment phase-in was associated with no

change, not a decrease, in employment rate of youth and a slight reduction, not

an increase, in the unemployment rate of youth. The results based on the

adjusted data, shown in Figure 4-1b are essentially the same. Thus the effect of

these reforms was quite inconsistent with the boxed economy view of the

German economy.

       The experience in France provides another, but somewhat more complex,

illustration. Prior to 1972, the French normal social security retirement age was

65 and early retirement provisions were uncommon. Beginning in the early

1970s there was a series of reforms that provided early retirement incentives,

including more generous benefits and guaranteed income for persons age 60

and over who lost their jobs. The first of the series of reforms was encoded in

the Loi Boulin of 1971. A further series of reforms was put in place between

1977 and 1983. In 1983, age 60 became the normal retirement age.

       Prior to 1972, the youth employment rate was rising and the youth

unemployment rate had increased only slightly. Thus it seems unlikely that the

1971 reform was prompted by youth employment concerns. By the time of the

reforms beginning in 1977, however, the youth unemployment rate was rising

and the youth employment rate had begun to fall. Even though it appears that

the fall in youth employment and rise in youth unemployment were tied to the

reforms in the early 1970s, some proponents of the 1977 and 1983 reforms used

the, by then, deteriorating youth employment and unemployment trends to justify

the reforms. That is, while the first of the series of reforms—that induced older

persons to leave the labor force—could not have been justified by adverse trends

in youth employment and unemployment, by the time of the later reforms in the

series, after the youth trends had deteriorated on the heals of the early reforms,

the deterioration was used to justify further inducement for older persons to

retire. Thus, while the first of the long series reforms seem exogenous with




                                      40 of 74
respect to youth employment, the exogeneity of the later reforms in the series is

unclear.

       In 1993, there was a reversal. The number of years of work required to

earn full benefits was raised from 37.5 to 40 years and the rules for computing

the replacement rate became less generous. If seems evident that the 1993

reform could not have been prompted by the continuing adverse trends in youth

employment.

       Here we consider the combined effects of the 1971 and subsequent

reforms, using the period 1972 to 1993. (In the next section we compare reforms

in France and the UK and use a somewhat different range of years.)

       The results of these reforms can be seen in Figures 4-2a and 4-2b.

Figure 4-2a, based on unadjusted data, shows that as the employment of older

persons fell by about 21 percentage points between 1971 and 1993, the

employment of youth also fell by approximately an equal percent. And the youth

unemployment rate increased. In short, the series of reforms was very

successful in inducing older persons to leave the labor force. But to the extent

that the reforms were prompted by hope of providing more job opportunities for

youth (only the later reforms in the series), they failed. There is no evidence that

the reforms provided more jobs for youth.

       On the other hand, when the employment of older persons increased

between 1993 and 2005, the employment of youth also increased and the

unemployment of youth declined. The adjusted employment series for France

show substantially reduced fluctuations in the employment trends over time, as




                                      41 of 74
can be seen by comparing the unadjusted and the adjusted series in Figure 2-1f.

Nonetheless, the direction of the changes are the same when based on adjusted

data, as shown in Figure 4-2b. Again, the results show no evidence of the boxed

economy proposition.

              A reform in Denmark provides a very striking example. In 1979, the Post

Employment Wage (PEW) program was introduced. It induced an almost

immediate 28 percent drop in the labor force participation rate of men 61 to 65.

Prior to the 1979 reform, the employment rate of youth had been increasing and

the unemployment rate of youth had changed little since 1975. Thus it seems

unlikely that the reform was prompted by a fall in the employment rate or an

increase in the unemployment rate of youth. The response to this reform is

shown in Figure 4-2a, based on unadjusted data. Between 1978 and 1983 the

employment rate of men 61 to 65 fell by almost 23 percentage points, a decline

of 35 percent. Over the same period the employment rate of all youth 20 to24 fell

by about 4 percentage points and the unemployment rate of youth increased by

about 4 percentage points. The results based on adjusted data are shown in


                                            43 of 74
Figure 4-3b and tell the same story. Again, this “natural experiment” shows no

evidence of the boxed economy proposition.

      In short, each of these “natural experiments” is consistent one with the

other, and none of them is consistent with the boxed economy proposition.

5. Cross-Country Estimates of the Relationship between the Employment
of the Old and the Young

       The examples in the section above are “natural experiment” estimates of

the effects of reforms in selected countries. The results in this section are based

on cross-country comparisons.

       Before considering comparisons across all countries, we begin by

comparing the employment trends in two countries—the United Kingdom and in

France—and then by comparing natural experiment estimates of the responses

to reform in the two countries. These two countries provide an illustration of the

effect of differences in reform on the employment of older persons and, in turn,

on the consequent tie between the employment of older persons and the

employment of youth.

       Figure 5-1 is abstracted from Figure X in the United Kingdom chapter that

shows trends for four age groups. Figure 5-1 shows employment trends for the

60 to 64 age group only. Between 1968 and 1983, the trends were similar in

both countries. Prior to 1972, the French normal social security retirement age

was 65 and early retirement provisions were uncommon. In the early 1970s

Aearly retirement provisions@ were introduced by way of guaranteed income for

persons age 60 and over who lost their jobs. (Provisions to facilitate early

retirement began with provisions in specific industries in the private sector in the

late 1960s).   In 1983, age 60 became the normal retirement age in France. In

addition, guaranteed income was provided for persons age 57 and older who lost

their jobs. The downward trend in the employment of the 60 to 64 age group was

continuous over the whole 1968 to 1983 interval in France. The downward trend



                                      46 of 74
in the United Kingdom began at the time of the 1975 SERPS reform and

continued until the end of the interval. The downward trend was also facilitated

by the 1977 Job Release Scheme.

       After 1983, however, there was a striking divergence in the trends in the

two countries.    With the 1983 reform establishing age 60 as the normal

retirement age in France, the downward trend in the employment of older men in

France continued and was long-lasting, continuing until 1998.        The eventual

reversal was facilitated by the 1993 reform that increased the number of years of

work required to get full benefits and reduced the replacement rate.       On the

other hand, the downward trend in the United Kingdom changed abruptly. The

Job Release Scheme was terminated in 1988. (In addition, private sector firms

were converting from DB plans—which typically have large early retirement

incentives—to DC plans without such incentives. But in the late 1980s most

older workers were not yet affected by this shift.) The employment of men 60 to

64 turned upward in 1993. In essence, the difference between the post-1983

trends in France and the United Kingdom arises because the reforms in France

remained in effect for many years while the reforms in the United Kingdom were

short-lived.

  To capture as closely as possible to differences in the reforms ongoing in the

two countries in different time intervals, we show data for four time periods—

1971, 1983, 1993, and 2005—and the corresponding three intervals.

       In the years between 1968 and the early 1970s, there was little change in

the employment or the unemployment of youth in either country. Thus it is




                                     47 of 74
unlikely that the early reforms in either country were prompted by decline in the

employment or increases in the unemployment of youth in either country (as

emphasized for France in the prior section).

      Figures 5-2a and 5-2b and Figure 5-3a and 5-3b summarize the

differences in the two countries, both with respect to the employment of older

persons and with respect to the employment and unemployment of the young.

The comparisons in these figures are based on men only in the 60 to 64 age

group, but all youth in the 20 to 24 age group.

      Consider first the results based on the unadjusted data in Figures 5-2. In

the years between 1971 and 1983 the employment of older persons was

declining in both countries. The employment of youth was also declining in both

countries and the unemployment of youth was increasing in both countries. The




                                             48 of 74
differences in all three trends are very similar in the two countries. But after 1983

when the employment trends of older persons diverged in the two countries the

employment trends for young persons also diverged. In the UK, with only a small

decline in the employment of older men between 1983 and 1993, there was little

change in the employment and unemployment of youth during this period.

Between 1993 and 2005, the employment of men increased substantially and

there was an increase in the employment and a decrease in the unemployment

of youth. On the other hand, in France, where the employment of the older group

continued to decline, the employment of youth also declined substantially. The

employment of men continued to decline in the UK until 1998 but then began to

increase. By 2005 the employment of youth had increased substantially and the

unemployment of youth had declined slightly.

       The results based on the adjusted data are shown in Figures 5-3. The

general pattern of change in both countries is the same as the pattern based on

the unadjusted data. For both the UK and France, however, the trends in the

adjusted data differ substantially from the trends in the unadjusted data, as

shown in Figure 2-1f. The adjusted data, suggests, for example, that in both

countries much of the fall in the employment of older men between 1971 and

1983 may be explained by macro shocks to the economies; the differences in the

adjusted trends are smaller than the differences in the unadjusted trends in both

countries. By 2005, the adjusted data show a substantial increase in the

employment of older men in both countries and a corresponding increase in the

employment and a decrease in the unemployment of youth in both countries.

         Like the country-specific examples above, this comparison shows natural

experiment like estimates of the effect of the reforms in each country on the

employment of older persons in each country, and the relationship between the

employment of the old and the young in each country. The differences between

in the employment trends in the two countries correspond closely to the

differences in reform in the reforms in the countries. The findings are clearly

inconsistent with the boxed economy proposition.

         Now consider a comparison across all participating countries. In each of

the 12 countries, the employment of persons 55 to 64 increased over the last 10

or 15 years.4 This can be seen in Figures 2-1a to 2-1l in section 2. In most

countries, the increase began between the mid 80s and the mid 90s, but the

beginning date varied from country to country—between 1983 in the United

States and 1999 in Italy. In many countries the increase can be ascribed to a

particular reform that limited early retirement, as illustrated in some of the

country-specific illustrations above. But even if a precipitating reform cannot be

narrowly identified, it is implausible that a reform, or other event, that precipitated

the increase in the employment of older persons was motivated by a desire to

increase the employment—or reduce the unemployment—of youth. Thus, these

increases provide a good natural experiment—not plagued by the endogeneity

  In prior phases of the project, we emphasized the dramatic decline in the labor force participation of men
60 to 64 between the 1960s and the mid 1990s (Gruber and Wise, 1999). We also emphasized the reversal
to an increase in the labor force participation of men 60 to 64 in most of the countries beginning in the mid
1990s and noted that the increase could be attributed to specific reforms in many countries (Gruber and
Wise, 2007). Here we focus on men and women combined and on a broader age interval, 55 to 64 for all
persons, instead of 60 to 64 for men.


                                                 52 of 74
problem—to judge the effect of the increase in the employment of older persons

on the employment of youth.

       The results are presented in a series of figures. Most of the figures are

based on adjusted data, although some comparison figures are shown for

unadjusted data as well. Figure 5-4 shows the difference in the employment rate

of older persons from the beginning of the upturn to the end of the data in each

country, together with the difference in the employment and unemployment rate

of youth. The countries are ordered by the increase in the employment of older

persons, from least to greatest. It is apparent that a greater increase in the

employment of older persons is not associated with a decrease in the

employment of youth and is not associated with an increase in the

unemployment of youth. On average across all countries the increase in the

employment of older persons is 8.1 percentage points, the increase in the

employment of youth is 4.7 percentage points and the decrease in the

unemployment of youth is 2.6 percentage points.

       Figure 5-5 shows the fit of the relationship between the employment of

older persons and the employment of youth. Figure 5-6 shows the fit of the

relationship between the employment of older persons and the unemployment of

youth. It is clear that if anything, the relationship to youth employment is slightly

positive and the relationship to youth unemployment slightly negative. A boxed

economy view would suggest exactly the opposite.

       Figure 5-7 compares the six countries (in Figure 5-4) with the least

increase to the six countries with the greatest increase in the employment of the




                                       53 of 74
old. The six countries with the greatest increase in the employment of the old

had the greatest increase in the employment of youth and the greatest decrease

in the unemployment of youth.

              Because the change in youth employment depends in part on when the

upturn for older persons began, we have scaled the differences by the ratio of the

value at the end of the period (the last observation in the data) to the value at the

beginning of the upturn. Using this measure, the six countries with the least

increase are compared to the six with the greatest increase in Figure 5-8. Based

on this measure, there is essentially no difference between change in the

employment and unemployment of youth in the two groups of countries.5

  France is excluded from the average ratio for unemployment of youth because the adjusted unemployment
rate for France declined from a positive to a negative value between the beginning and end of the period.
Japan is excluded for the same reason.

        As a further check on the comparison, consider the change over the same

time period for all countries—1995 to 2003. Again, the six countries with the

least increase are compared with the six with the greatest increase in the

employment of older workers. Figure 5-9 shows the results measured in

differences and Figure 5-10 the results measured in ratios.6 Both measures

show that the six countries with the greatest increase in employment of the older

group had a slightly greater increase in the employment of youth. Based on

either measure, the difference in the unemployment of youth was close to zero.

Based on the ratio measure (Figure 10), a one percent increase in the

employment of older persons leads to a 0.51 percent increase in the employment

of youth and a 0.06 percent decline in the unemployment of youth. Based on the

difference measure (Figure 9), a one percentage point increase in the

employment of older persons leads to a 0.173 percentage point increase in the

employment of youth and a 0.036 percentage point increase in the

unemployment of youth. (These estimates can be compared to panel regression

estimates shown below.)

        Thus we conclude that based on this comparison, there is no evidence

that increasing the employment of older persons reduces the employment, or

increases the unemployment, of youth.

        The other side of the comparison of upturns across countries is the

comparison of downturns. Most downturns were long-terms and occurred prior

to the upturns discussed above, as can be seen in Figures 2-1a to 2-1l in section

6
 The ratio averages for youth unemployment exclude France, Germany, and Japan because the adjusted
unemployment values for these countries go from positive values at the beginning of the period to negative
values at the end of the period.

2.   One country has two separate downturn intervals and we consider both. As

shown above, many of the downturns were precipitated by specific reforms, or by

a series of reforms. In this case, we compare the countries with the greatest

decreases with the countries with the smallest decreases. We show results

based on the ratio measure only. The results are shown in Figures 5-11 and 5-

12 for unadjusted and adjusted data respectively. The figures show the

averages over the 6 countries with the smallest decreases in the employment of

older persons and the average over the 7 “countries” with the greatest

decreases—the 7 instead of 6 to indicate that one country had two separate

downward intervals.

       Both figures show that the countries with the greatest decline in the

employment of the older age group have the greatest decline in the employment

of the young as well. The differences are somewhat smaller when based on the

adjusted data.

       Like the results above, these comparisons show no evidence that

reductions in the employment of older persons provides more job opportunities

for the young. The results are inconsistent with the boxed economy proposition.

6. Panel Regression Estimates

       Perhaps the most common way to summarize data series across many

countries is by way of panel regression estimation. The panel estimates allow

control for country-specific attributes that affect the employment and the

unemployment of the young, but that are not included as covariates in the

analysis. Although this method presents a concise estimate of results, it is

subject to several limitations. First, taken on its own, this method masks the

results of “natural experiments” like those discussed above. Second, in the

simple specification we have used, the effect of covariates is presumed to be the

same in all countries. The results based on adjusted data, presented above,

allow the effects of the covariates on each of the employment time series to vary

from country to country. It is clear that the effect of the covariates differs from

country to country. Third, judging by the “natural experiment” segments in the

data, it seems evident that the most relevant year intervals for comparison—

whether differences, or percent changes, or another measure—are not common

to all countries.

       We present panel estimates based on several different specifications.

The method followed is set out in detail in the appendix. The key right-hand

variable is the employment rate of persons 55 to 64. We also control directly for

GDP, the growth in GDP, and the proportion of the economy in manufacturing.

In addition we include country-specific effects, which control for country-specific

attributes that, in addition to the covariates, affect the employment and the




                                       61 of 74
unemployment of youth. We also include year effects that capture attributes that

are common to all countries in a given year.

       The results are shown in Table 6-1. The table shows the estimated effect

of the employment of persons 55 to 64 on the unemployment and the

employment of youth 20 to 24, and on the unemployment and employment of

prime-age persons 25 to 54. The table also shows the estimated effect of the

employment of older persons on the proportion of youth in school. Estimates are

reported for several specifications: The first is “levels,” which means that levels

of employment and unemployment rates are regressed on contemporaneous

levels of the explanatory variables, including the employment rate of persons 55

to 64. The second is “3-year lag,” which means that the employment and

unemployment rates of youth and prime-age persons in a given year are

regressed on the employment of older persons three years earlier. (The other

covariates are measured in the same year as the youth and prime-age

employment and unemployment rates.) The third is “5-year difference,” which

means that we consider, for example, the difference between youth

unemployment in a given year to youth unemployment 5 years earlier. We relate

this difference to the comparable 5-year differences in employment of older

persons, and 5-year difference in the other explanatory variables. The fourth

specification is “5-year log difference,” which is the same as the third

specification but the logarithm of unemployment, for example, in a given year is

compared to the logarithm of unemployment 5 years earlier. In this case, the




                                      62 of 74
estimates represent the percent difference in the unemployment of youth

associated with a percent difference in the employment of older persons.

       Estimates are shown with and without controlling for the covariates—GDP

per capita, growth in GDP, and the manufacturing proportion.

       The key result is that in each specification, but one, an increase in the

employment of older persons is estimated to decrease the unemployment rate of

youth (and prime age persons) and to increase the employment rate of youth

(and prime-age persons). Each estimate is statistically different from zero. The

only estimate that does not follow this pattern is the estimated effect of

employment of older persons on the unemployment rate of youth in the “3 year

lag on elderly” specification, with controls. And in this case, the estimated effect

is not statistically different from zero.

       More precisely, with respect to the unemployment of youth the estimates

for youth suggest this: With controls, a one percentage point increase in the

employment of older persons changes the unemployment rate of youth between

+0.11 and -0.23 percentage points. Without controls the decrease is between

0.09 and 0.44 percentage points. For the log difference specification with

controls, a one percent increase in the employment of older persons is

associated with a 0.91 percent decrease in the unemployment rate of youth.

Without controls the decrease is 1.87 percent.

       With respect to the employment of youth: With controls, a one percentage

point increase in the employment of older persons increases the employment

rate of youth between 0.54 and 0.91 percentage points. Without controls the




                                            63 of 74
increase is between 0.32 and 0.84 percentage points. For the log difference

specification with controls, a one percent increase in the employment of older

persons is associated with a 0.49 percent increase in the unemployment rate of

youth. Without controls the increase is 0.61 percent Comparable estimates for

prime-age persons can be seen in the table.

       The estimates for each specification also indicate that an increase in the

employment of older persons is associated with a decrease in the schooling of

youth. And each of these estimates is significantly different from zero. Across all

specifications, a one percentage point increase in the employment of older

persons reduces the proportion of youth in school by between 0.17 and 0.70

percentage points. A one percent increase in the employment of older persons is

associated with about a 0.70 percent reduction in the proportion of youth 20 to 24

in school. This result is consistent with finding elsewhere that the greater the

employment rate of youth (or the greater the opportunity for employment) the

lower school attendance will be.

       In short, the panel regression results are consistent with the “natural

experiment” results as well as the results based on increasing and decreasing

employment intervals for older persons. The findings provide no support for the

boxed economy proposition. Indeed, the weight of the evidence suggests that

increasing the employment of older persons provides more job opportunities for

younger persons and reduces the unemployment rate of younger persons. The

positive relationship is of course not consistent with the boxed economy




                                      64 of 74
proposition. We have not, however, emphasized the possible mechanisms—

such as lower earnings tax rates—that could produce the positive relationship.

7. Summary and Conclusions

       In this volume, we direct attention to the oft-claimed proposition that

incentives to induce older persons to retire—inherent in the provisions of social

security systems—were prompted by youth unemployment. And that if the

incentives to retire were removed, and older persons stayed longer in the labor

force, the job opportunities of youth would be reduced. We find no evidence to

support this boxed economy proposition. We find no evidence that increasing

the labor force participation of older persons reduces the job opportunities of

young persons. Indeed the evidence suggests that greater labor force

participation of older persons is associated with greater youth employment and

with reduced youth unemployment.

       The results shown in this summary are based on data from the individual

country papers. Some of the data in the papers was borrowed to use in natural

experiment illustrations. The data from all of the country papers was also pooled

to obtain estimates based on the collective information from all of the countries

combined. We began the introduction by showing that the enormous waves of

women entering the labor force over the past several decades varied

substantially across countries and were unrelated to the small changes in the

labor force participation of men across countries.

       We ask whether the economic world might be different for young versus

old employees. We presented results based on several different methods of

inference. A striking feature of the results is the strong similarity of the findings

based on these quite different methods of estimation. First we show that the tax




                                       67 of 74
force to retire—that is very strongly related to the proportion of older persons out

of the labor, as shown in the first phase of the project—is slightly positively

related to the unemployment of youth and slightly negatively related to the

employment rate of youth. Second, we show within-country “natural

experiments” that demonstrate the relationship between within-country reforms

and the consequent changes in the employment of the old on the one hand and

changes in the employment of the young on the other hand. In each case,

decreases in the employment of the old are associated with decreases in the

employment of the young and increases in the unemployment of the young.

Third, we show cross-country comparisons based on various comparison

methods. For example, we show that the labor force participation of older

persons began to increase sometime during the last 10 or 15 years and that the

countries with the greatest increase in the employment of older persons had the

greatest increase in the employment of the young and the greatest decline in the

unemployment of the young. Fourth, we show more formal estimates based on

panel regression analysis, based on various specifications. Like the results

based on the other methods, the findings based on formal regression analysis

show that when the employment of older persons is increased the employment of

the young is increased and the unemployment of the young is decreased.

       We emphasize that the results are made possible by the wealth of

experiences across the countries that provides considerable policy variation

including exogenous variation that is not induced by high youth unemployment

and that better enables us to establish the causal effect of increased older-




                                       68 of 74
worker employment on youth employment. Thus we believe that the results

reported in this phase of the project, as well as in the previous phases, provides

a strong rational for international comparisons.

       In short, the overwhelming weight of the evidence, as well as the evidence

from each of the several different methods of estimation, is contrary to the boxed

economy proposition. We find no evidence that increasing the employment of

older persons will reduce the employment opportunities of youth and no evidence

that increasing the employment of older persons will increase the unemployment

of youth.

Appendix

Adjusted Data

We want to adjust the employment series for macro changes that may affect
each of the employment series. The variables we use to make the adjustment
are GDP per capita, growth in GDP, and the percent of the economy in
manufacturing. This is the procedure we follow: Suppose the employment
series is Y and the adjuster variables are X 1 , X 2 , and X 3 . Then for each series in
each country we estimate

Yt = β 0 + β1 X 1t + β1 X 1t + β1 X 1t + ε t

and obtain the estimated values β 1 , β 2 , and β 3 . We let the first year, Y1 , of each
employment series be the base. Then each subsequent year is adjusted based
on the change in the X variables between period 1 and period t. The adjusted
value of Y in period t is given by

Y ( A)t = Yt + β1 ( X 1t − X 11 ) + β 2 ( X 2t − X 21 ) + β3 ( X 3t − X 31 )


Panel Estimates

We follow a standard panel estimation procedure, with

Y(20− 24)it = β 0 + β1 ( E55−64 )it + β 2 X it + ci + yt + uit

where i indexes countries and t indexes years, Y is youth employment or youth
unemployment, or prime age employment or unemployment, or
schooling, X represents the covariates, the ci are country fixed effects, and
the yt are year effects.

As explained in the text, we estimate several different specifications of this
general model.

Incentive to Leave the Labor Force

       The text presents the results of several different ways to asses the effect
of the employment of older persons on the employment of youth. In principle,
this approach provides an all-inclusive estimate of the relationship between the
employment rates of the two groups. In particular, in addition to the strong
relationship between the provisions of social security programs and the labor
force participation of older workers—which has been demonstrated in earlier
phases of the project—the employment of older workers depends on other
economic influences as well. For example, macro economic shocks to the
economy can affect the employment of older persons, as can be seen in the
comparison of the unadjusted and adjusted employment trends in each of the
countries.

        Much public discussion, however, is focused on the need for the
incentives to induce older persons to retire so that the job prospects for younger
people will be improved. This is often used both as an explanation for the
introduction the incentive in the first place and, now, as a reason for not removing
the incentives. Thus we believe it would be useful to present evidence on the
direct relationship between the incentives for older persons to leave the labor
force and the employment of youth. We approached this question by calculating
a time series index of the average incentives faced by persons who were retired
in each year.

       The index, as well as potential estimation methods, is described below. In
practice, however, the approach was not replicable across countries. There are
several possible reasons for this. One reason is that it is unclear whether an
accurate measure of the incentives faced by all persons retired in a year can be
obtained. A second reason is that even if an accurate average can be
calculated, the average may not be sufficient, it is the broad range of incentives
faced by individuals that matters. The extremes may be more important than the
average, for example. We have shown in earlier phases of the project that the
incentives faced by individuals matter.

       The incentive faced by persons of age a in year y is given by


I (a, y ) = {W ( a, y ) + α [W (a, y ) − PV ( a, y ) ]} q ( a, y )

Here, W (a, y ) is the social security wealth (the present discounted value of future
benefits) that a person would receive at age a in year y and q(a, y ) is a weight
explained below. And [W (a, y ) − PV (a, y ) ] is the gain that could be obtained if a
person delayed retirement to the age at which benefits would be at their “peak
value” PV (a, y) .




                                        71 of 74
        Persons who are retired in a given year are different ages and the
incentive they faced when approaching retirement depends on the persons age
at that time. So to get the average incentive, we must average over the ages of
persons retired in year y. Here we assume, for illustration, that the possible ages
are from 55 to 59. The youngest age 55 is assumed to be the earliest age that
any benefits are available. Now the average for year y is obtained by weighting
each age by the proportion of persons that age.

                ⎡                  ⎤
          a =59 ⎢
                     P ( a, y ) ⎥
I ( y ) = ∑ ⎢ 59                   ⎥ [ I ( a, y ) ]
          a =55 ⎢
                        P ( a, y ) ⎥
                ⎢⎣ a∑
                    =55
                                   ⎥⎦

But we don’t know at what age a person retired. A person who is 59, for
example, could have retired at 55, 56, 57, 58, or 59. A person who is 55 must
have retired at 55. Thus we must consider the incentive the person would have
faced at each of the possible ages the persons could have retired. If the person
is 55, there is only one term in the second bracket. If the person is 59, there are
five terms.

       If the weight given to age a in year y is q(a, y ) , then the average can be
written as

                 ⎡                  ⎤⎡                                                 ⎤

                      P(a, y ) ⎥ ⎢ a −55                           q(a − t , y − t ) ⎥
I ( y ) = ∑ ⎢ 59                    ⎥ ⎢ ∑ I (a − t , y − t )   a −55

          a =55 ⎢
                   ∑     P ( a, y ) ⎢ t = 0
                                   ⎥
                                                               ∑     q(a − t , y − t ) ⎥
                ⎢⎣ a =55           ⎥⎦ ⎢⎣                        t =0
                                                                                       ⎥⎦

       If accurate, this could be interpreted as “the tax force to retire” that was
faced by persons who were observed to be retired in year y , the term we used to
describe the incentive to retire faced by persons between the early retirement
age and age 69 in Phase one of the project and as used in section 3 in this
introduction.

       Now we need to determine an appropriate way to approximate the relative
weight to give to each possible age of retirement. We assume that the weight is
proportional to the proportion of persons in the labor force in the year before the
retirement age. That is, the assumption is that the likelihood that a person faced
a particular incentive depends on the proportion of persons in the labor force the
year before the person attained that age. If, for example, as the LFP was
declining over the years the person aged from 55 to 59, we assume that the


                                                 72 of 74
person was most likely to face the incentive appropriate to 55, less likely to face
the incentive appropriate to 56, and so forth. Now we have

q(a − t , y − t ) = LFP(a − t , y − t − 1)

And

where

I (a − t , y − t ) = {1 ⋅ W (a − t , y − t ) + α ⋅ [W ( a − t , y − t ) − PV ( a − t , y − t ) ]}


To estimate I ( y ) we need to determine α , that is we need to determine the
relative weight given to the two components of the index. Suppose we set the
weight on W (a − t , y − t ) equal to 1, as set out in the equation above. Then we
need only determine the relative weight α on [W (a − t , y − t ) − PV (a − t , y − t ) ] .
There are at least two ways to do this. One way is to regress the proportion of
older persons in the labor in a year on the index I ( y ) , where the index value is
based on different values of α , and then choose the α that maximizes the
regression r-squared value.

      Estimation can also be based on independently estimated averages of the
two components of the index I . The two components are ….

Notice that these means are obtained by calculating the measures at the
individual age-year levels and then averaging over the individual age-year
measures. In this case, the value of α is determined by a time series regression
of the labor force participation of older workers on these two components, setting
the coefficient on W ( y ) equal to 1 and estimating the α coefficient on [W − PV ]( y ) .
