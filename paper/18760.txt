On Financing Retirement with an Aging Population

                                              ABSTRACT

A problem facing the United States is financing retirement consumption as its population ages. Proposals
for switching to a saving-for-retirement system that do not rely on high payroll taxes have been challenged
on the grounds that welfare for some cohorts will fall. We show how to devise a transition path from
the current U.S. system to a saving-for-retirement system that increases the welfare of all current and
future cohorts, with estimates of future gains that are twice as large as those found with typically used
macroeconomic models. The gains are large because there is more productive capital than commonly
assumed. Furthermore, the gains are amplified if we lower capital taxes in addition to payroll taxes
because the value of business equity increases relative to the capital stock. Our quantitative results
depend importantly on accounting for differences between actual government tax revenues and what
revenues would be if all income were taxed at the income-weighted average marginal tax rates used
in our analysis.

1. Introduction

Many countries including the United States are facing the challenging policy issue of how to finance
retirement consumption as the population ages and the number of workers per retiree falls. One

proposal is to move from the current U.S. retirement system—which relies heavily on payroll
taxes in order to make lump-sum transfers to retirees—to a saving-for-retirement system that

eliminates these payroll taxes and old-age transfers. To do so in a welfare-improving way for all

birth-year cohorts poses a challenge given the limited ability of governments to raise debt. Using a
general equilibrium overlapping-generations (OLG) model, we show that a move from the current

U.S. system to a saving-for-retirement system is feasible and welfare improving for all birth-year

cohorts, especially future cohorts who have gains as high as 15 percent of lifetime consumption.
Further tax reforms that eliminate capital taxes and flatten and broaden the tax system result

in welfare gains that are as high as 25 percent of lifetime consumption, even in an environment

without large government debt and lump-sum taxes.

      These welfare gains are much larger than those estimated with typically used macroeconomic

models for two reasons. First, our estimate of the U.S. capital stock at reproduction cost is

5.8 times GNP—nearly twice as large as estimates commonly used in macroeconomic analyses.
Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987), for example, use a capital share consistent with a capital stock

of 2.8 times GNP, which is the size of fixed assets reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis

(BEA).1 Our capital stock is larger because we include consumer durables, inventories, land, and
business intangible capital, which implies additional productive capital of 3 times GNP. Changing

the tax system appropriately implies a dramatic increase in the productive capital stock, from 5.8

GNPs to 7.7 GNPs.

      A second and lesser-known reason for the larger welfare gains in our model is that the tax

reforms we consider result in a large increase in the value of private business equity because the

price of businesses’ productive capital is a decreasing function of tax rates on capital.2 The increase
in the market value of equity permits the financing of retirement consumption through savings,

thereby eliminating the need to tax workers’ labor income to finance lump-sum transfers to retirees.

  1   We do not include the large stock of nonrival human capital in the model’s capital stock because in retirement,
      human capital cannot be sold and the proceeds used to finance retirement consumption.
  2   For a closed economy, the private sector’s net worth is the value of equity plus the net government debt.

                                                          1
Typical macroeconomic analyses that restrict attention to capital reported in the BEA fixed asset

tables and abstract from capital tax factors that imply increasing equity values find welfare gains

that are half as large as our estimated gains.

    With our OLG model, we compute both balanced growth paths and equilibrium transition

paths, with the initial state calibrated to the current U.S. economy. The simulated data from the

model we use are consistent with the U.S. national income and product accounts and U.S. produc-
tive capital stocks. The transitions involve both changes in demographics and changes in taxes and

government transfers. We model the current U.S. economy has having 3.4 workers per retiree and

study the transition as that number falls to about 2. Coincident with the demographic transition
is the phasing in of new policy. For the sake of comparison, we first consider transitions to a

tax-transfer system that is essentially the one currently in use—that is, with its high labor and

capital income tax rates and large transfers to retirees. With the population aging, we assume
that taxes must rise to finance the additional old-age transfers.

    We then compare the results of continuing the current U.S. policy with three variations of

a saving-for-retirement system, modifying the policy in steps so that we can highlight the role
each factor plays. First, we show what happens if we eliminate payroll taxes on Medicare and

Social Security along with accompanying transfers made to retirees that are neither welfare nor
local public goods. The payroll taxes are those imposed by the Federal Insurance Contribution

Act (FICA). A second variation on the new system involves eliminating all capital taxes, that is,

taxes on profits and distributions. Finally, we compute the impact of a further tax reform that
flattens the income tax schedule for labor income and broadens the tax base. We determine the

growth paths for all policy experiments and make welfare comparisons. For the transition path,

the measure of welfare is remaining-lifetime consumption equivalents for each birth-year cohort
currently alive and each cohort joining the workforce in the future.

    In order to generate transition paths that will leave all birth-year cohorts better off, we devise

a tax and transfer scheme that delays the fall in transfers to retirees and allows for only modest
increases—at least initially—in consumption tax rates that affect budget sets of retirees. Current

retirees cannot take advantage of lower payroll taxes and changes in interest rates on retirees’ assets

are of second-order importance. Workers, on the other hand, can take advantage of lower taxes

                                                  2
on wages, and therefore we immediately lower payroll taxes. This step results in an immediate

rise in the labor input and GNP. To balance the government’s budget during the early part of

the transition, we also eliminate some implicit transfers for workers. Implicit transfers are those
equal to the difference between actual tax revenues and what tax revenues would be if income

were taxed at the income-weighted average marginal tax rates that we use in our analysis.3 Total

government revenue is much larger than collected tax revenue because important components of
income are not taxed and because the income tax schedule is convex. Eliminating part of these

transfers effectively flattens the tax schedule and broadens the tax base. In all of the experiments

we consider, we retain current expenditure shares for government purchases of goods and services
and transfers normally included in the national income and product accounts (NIPA) other than

transfers for Medicare and Social Security.

      To determine which, if any, modeling choices are crucial for our main findings, we rerun our
policy experiments using various versions of the OLG framework. The only significant deviations

arise when we follow the literature in restricting attention to capital stocks reported in the BEA
tables and abstracting from capital tax factors that imply increasing equity values. In this case,

we can construct a welfare-improving transition, but the welfare gains of future birth-year cohorts

are roughly half the size of the gains in our benchmark model.

      In Section 2, we discuss the related literature. Section 3 presents the model used to evaluate the

alternative retirement financing systems. In Section 4, we show how to modify the U.S. Department

of Commerce NIPA and fixed asset tables to be consistent with theory. In Section 5, we select the
parameters to be consistent with these modified accounts. In Section 6, we report the balanced

growth paths for an economy with the current tax system in which the growth rate of new workforce

entrants continues at 1 percent annually and for alternative economies in which growth in the
number of new workforce entrants falls, and we report the equilibrium paths and welfare differences

for each birth-year cohort. In Section 7, we provide a summary of the findings.




  3   In order to better estimate the impact of tax reforms on macroeconomic activity, we follow Barro and Redlick
      (2011) and use income-weighted average marginal income tax rates rather than average rates.

2. Related Literature

      The literature concerned with financing retirement consumption is large and growing. Papers
most closely related to ours focus on shifting from the current pay-as-you-go Social Security system

to mandatory savings programs with individual accounts.4 The main conclusion from this literature

is that the long-term gains from switching to a saving-for-retirement system are positive—especially
if distorting taxes on incomes can be reduced—but the welfare gains for future cohorts come at the

cost of welfare losses for generations living during the transition. For example, Huang, Imrohoroglu,
and Sargent (1997) study transitions following a surprise elimination of social security in which

the government fully compensates all cohorts alive at the time of the policy change by issuing

a large amount of government debt. Although labor income taxes in the future can be lowered,
they are temporarily high while the government pays off the entitlement debt, and they result

in welfare losses for generations born just after the policy change.5 Conesa and Krueger (1999),

Nishiyama and Smetters (2007), and Imrohoroglu and Kitao (2012) argue that adding idiosyncratic
uncertainty makes the switch more challenging because social security provides partial insurance

in circumstances in which private insurance is unavailable. The policy reforms we consider do

not eliminate government social insurance and assistance programs for the poor. The reforms we
consider eliminate only Social Security and Medicare transfers for the elderly.

      In order to consider alternative fiscal policy plans more systematically, Conesa and Garriga

(2008) consider a set of social welfare functions and derive optimal policies. They are interested
in designing plans that are welfare improving for transitional generations. They show that such

a plan is possible but find paths for tax rates, especially tax rates on capital income, that “call

into question its relevance” as an actual policy option (p. 294). For example, in their baseline
economy in which the government chooses both labor and capital income tax rates, the optimal

capital income tax rate oscillates between 60 percent and −60 percent. Here, we focus attention



  4   The Feldstein (1998) volume is a nice collection of papers that consider saving-for-retirement systems in the
      United States, Chile, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Argentina. Of particular relevance for our
      paper are the transitional studies of Feldstein and Samwick (1998) and Kotlikoff (1998), who study the United
      States. See also De Nardi, Imrohoroglu, and Sargent (1999) for a detailed analysis of the U.S. system.
  5   Kotlikoff, Smetters, and Walliser (1999) study transitional dynamics following a wide array of policy options
      and find that although “privatization offers significant long-run gain, it does so at some nontrivial short-run
      costs” (p. 533). See also Kotlikoff, Smetters, and Walliser (2007).

on smoothly declining paths for income tax rates and find that it is easy to construct policies that

are welfare-improving for all current and future cohorts.

      Another avenue for the government is to issue a large amount of debt, which people can buy
when young and sell during their retirement. The debt is used to smooth consumption over one’s

lifetime. In a model calibrated to U.S. data, Birkeland and Prescott (2007) find that the needed

quantity of debt is about 5 times GNP—much larger than that observed in any advanced nation.6
In this paper, we restrict the quantity of debt that the government can issue to be no greater than

about 50 percent of GNP. We view restriction as more political than economic. But given that the

capital stock in our analysis is much larger than that used in Birkeland and Prescott (2007), we
find that there is no need for large government debt with a saving-for-retirement system, even if

the number of workers per retiree falls significantly.7



3. The Model Economy Used

The model economy has an OLG structure with measure n1t arriving as working-age households at

the beginning of date t. The year since entry into the workforce is called age and is denoted by j.

The measure of age j households at date t is njt . The maximum possible age is J . The probability
of an age j < J household at date t surviving to age j + 1 is σtj > 0. The n1t are parameters that

define the population dynamics. We restrict attention to


                                                n1t+1 = (1 + ηt ) n1t


with n10 = 1, where ηt is the growth rate of households entering the workforce.



3.1. State vector

To simplify notation, we use recursive competitive equilibrium language. Given that the economy

  6   Prescott (2004) also considers a reform of the U.S. Social Security system that requires a large amount of debt
      to finance the transition.
  7   The problem is not that the aging population will lead to overaccumulation of capital with a saving-for-
      retirement system. As Thompson (1967, p. 1206) established, absent forced savings, there cannot be an
      equilibrium with overaccumulation of capital if debt contracts are permitted. Abel et al.’s (1989) findings that
      overaccumulation of capital was not the case in the United States in the period they examined hold for the
      economies and policies we consider.

is nonstationary, t is included as an element of the aggregate state vector. All stocks are beginning

of period stocks. The variables that define the aggregate state vector s are as follows:

 (i) t = 0, 1, 2, . . . , is the time period.

(ii) {aj , nj } are the assets aj (net worth) of an age j household and nj the measure of age j

     households.

(iii) B is the government debt owned by the private sector.

(iv) KT 1 and KT 2 are the aggregate tangible capital stocks for the two business sectors (described

     below).

(v) KI1 and KI2 are the aggregate intangible capital stocks for the two business sectors.

     Two business sectors are needed because different legal categories of businesses are subject to
very different tax systems and, as a consequence, the market values of their equity and net debt

relative to their capital stock are different. The empirical counterpart of sector 1 is Schedule C
corporations, which are subject to the corporate income tax. Schedule S and other corporations

that distribute all profits to owners, unincorporated businesses, and household businesses are in

sector 2, as are government enterprises.


3.2. Prices and policy

The relevant equilibrium price sequences for the households are interest rates {it } and wage rates

{wt }.

     Policy specifies the following sequences:

 (i) Tax rates τ = {τtc , τ1t
                           d     d
                              , τ2t , τtℓ , τ1t
                                             π
                                                }, where c denotes consumption, d distributions from
     businesses to their owners, ℓ labor, π profits. Note that sector 2 businesses are not subject to

     the corporate profit tax and must distribute all their profits to their owners.

(ii) Age-dependent lump-sum transfers to households {ψtj }.

(iii) Government debt {Bt }.



                                                  6
(iv) Pure public good consumption {Gt }.

      Constraints on the stock of government debt relative to GNP are Bt ≤ φBt GN Pt , where

φBt are policy-constraint parameters. The motivation for this constraint is that empirically, gov-
ernments have limited ability to commit to honoring their sovereign debt promises. The final

set of policy variables is the public goods consumption, {Gt }, which is a given fraction of GNP:

Gt = φGt GN Pt .


3.3. The households’ problem

Savings are in the form of an annuity that makes payments to members of a cohort in their

retirement years conditional on them being alive. All members in a cohort enter symmetrically,

and there are no non-convexities. Consequently, all retirees of a given age at a point in time agree
as to their optimal retirement distribution. Effectively the return on savings depends upon the

survival probability as well as the interest rate.

      Symbol ℓ denotes labor services of a household. Aggregate labor supply L is

                                                      X
                                                L=         nj ℓj .
                                                       j

The value function of an individual of age j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , J } satisfies

                               vj (a, s) = ′max {u (c, ℓ) + βσtj vj+1 (a′ , s′ )}
                                           a ,c,ℓ≥0


subject to

                            a′ σtj = (1 + it ) a + 1 − τtℓ wt ℓ − (1 + τtc ) c + ψtj
                                                          


                            s′ = F (s) .

The prime denotes the next period value of a variable and vJ+1 = 0.8 Households with j > JR are

retired and their ℓ’s are zero. Note also that a component of the state is t. The equilibrium law of

motion of the aggregate state variable F is taken as given by the private agents.



  8   Later, we explore the impact of two assumptions made here, namely, perfect annuity markets and fixed labor
      productivities over the life cycle, and show that they do not impact our main quantitative results.

                                                       7
3.4. Technology

One sector is subject to the corporate income tax and produces intermediate good Y1t , and one
sector produces intermediate good Y2t . The aggregate production function of the composite final

good is

                                                  Yt = Y1tθ1 Y2tθ2 ,

where the exponents are positive and sum to 1.

     The aggregate sectoral production function is Cobb-Douglas with inputs of tangible capital

KiT t , intangible capital KiIt , and labor Lit :

                                           θiT   θiI                   1−θiT −θiI
                                    Yit = KiT t KiIt (Ωt Lit )


for i = 1, 2. The labor-augmenting technical level at date t in both sectors is Ωt , which grows at

rate γ, so

                                               Ωt+1 = (1 + γ) Ωt .


     Capital stocks depreciate at a constant rate, so

                                    KiT,t+1 = (1 − δiT ) KiT t + XiT t

                                    KiI,t+1 = (1 − δiI ) KiIt + XiIt

for i = 1, 2, where T and I denote tangible and intangible, respectively, and X is investment.

Depreciation rates are denoted as δ and are indexed by sector and capital type. The resource
balance constraint is

                                       Yt = Ct + XT t + XIt + Gt ,
               P                       P
where XT t =     i   XiT t and XIt =       i XiIt .




3.5. Government budget constraints

Some notation must be set up before the law of motion for government debts can be specified. The

prices of the intermediate good relative to the final good are p1t and p2t . Accounting profits of

Schedule C corporations are given by

                                Π1t = p1t Y1t − wt L1t − X1It − δ1T K1T t ,

                                                          8
and distributions to its owners are

                                           π
                               D1t = (1 − τ1t ) Π1t − K1T,t+1 + K1T t .

Other business distributions to its owners are

                           D2t = Π2t = p2t Y2t − wt L2t − X2It − δ2T K2T t .


    We can now specify the law of motion of government debt:
                               X
         Bt+1 = Bt + it Bt +        njt ψtj + Gt − τtc Ct − τ1t
                                                             π         d
                                                                Π1t − τ1t        d
                                                                          D1t − τ2t D2t − τtℓ wt Lt .
                                j

Thus, next period’s debt is this period’s debt plus interest on this period’s debt, plus transfers, plus

public consumption, minus tax revenues. Taxes are levied on consumption, on profits of Schedule
C corporations, on distributions of Schedule C corporations to their owners, on distributions of

other business firms to their owners, and on labor income.

    Later, when we compare model predictions with data, we use income-weighted average marginal
tax rates rather than average tax rates and therefore include transfers in ψj equal to the difference

between what the government’s tax revenues would be if all income is taxed at these marginal rates

and what is actually collected by the government. To be more concrete, consider two examples.
First, if the average marginal tax rate on labor, τ marg , exceeds the average rate, τ avg , then we

assume that a household with wage income wℓ earns (1 − τ marg )wℓ in after-tax wages and receives

implicit transfers of (τ marg − τ avg ) wℓ. Implicit transfers are also added in the case of untaxed in-
comes. For example, suppose fringe benefits in the amount f are deducted from household wages.

In this case, we model the after-tax wages as (1 − τ ℓ )wℓ and the implicit transfers households
receive as τ ℓ f , where τ ℓ is the average marginal tax rate on labor.


3.6. Equilibrium conditions

The equilibrium conditions are as follows:

 (i) Labor, capital, and goods markets clear at each point in time.

(ii) The household policy functions {a′ = fj (s)}j imply the aggregate law of motion s′ = F (s).

4. The Accounts for the Economies

We choose parameters of the model so that the balanced growth path of our baseline model is
consistent with averaged values in the U.S. national accounts and fixed asset tables over the period

2000–2010.9 Here, we describe adjustments that are made to the accounts so that they better
conform to the theory used to construct the model economy.



4.1. NIPA Accounts

Table 1 displays the annual averages from the U.S. national income and product accounts with

several adjustments made to NIPA GNP.10 Adjusted GNP is equal to NIPA GNP after subtracting

sales tax and adding imputed capital services for consumer durables and government capital. Thus,
unlike NIPA, we are consistent in using business sector prices and in treating consumer durables

and government capital like other investments when constructing the national income and product
accounts.

      We categorize income as “labor” or “capital.” Labor income includes compensation of employ-

ees plus part of proprietors’ income and comprises 59 percent of total adjusted income. Capital
income includes all other NIPA categories of income, except the sales tax part of taxes on produc-

tion and imports. The rental income of consumer durables is imputed and added to capital income.

Specifically, we add consumer durables depreciation to NIPA depreciation and impute consumer
durables rents less depreciation to the rental income of households. The imputed income is the

product of the average after-tax real return on capital and the current-cost net stock of consumer

durables. Services of government capital are also imputed and added to capital income; they are
estimated to be the product of the average after-tax real return on non-public capital and the

current-cost net stock of government capital. We do not add depreciation of government capital

because it is already included in NIPA depreciation. We use an after-tax real return of 4 percent
when imputing income for both durables and government capital.


  9   The primary sources of data are the U.S. Department of the Treasury (1918–2012), the U.S. Department of
      Commerce (1929–2012), the Board of Governors (1945–2012), and Bell and Miller (2005). In McGrattan and
      Prescott (2013), we provide further details about constructing the model accounts. Some parameter estimates
      are based on IRS data that are only available through 2010.
 10   Throughout, we are using data definitions prior to the BEA’s 2013 comprehensive revision, which will not be
      fully completed until early 2014.

                                                       10
      On the product side, we consolidate expenditures into three categories: consumption, tangible

investment, and defense spending. Consumption includes private consumption of nondurables and

services and the nondefense spending portion of NIPA government consumption, with adjustments
made for sales tax and imputed capital services.11 Consumption measured this way comprises 74

percent of total adjusted product. Tangible investment includes gross private domestic investment,

consumer durables, the nondefense portion of government investment, net exports, and net foreign
income, with an adjustment made for sales taxes on consumer durables. This category is 21

percent of adjusted total product. To estimate the division of gross private domestic investment

into investment of Schedule C corporations (which we earlier categorized as sector 1 business) and
all other private business, we use balance-sheet data of corporations from the IRS and Board of

Governors Flow of Funds. Specifically, we assume that the ratio of investments is equal to the
ratio of depreciable assets and therefore assume that 83.5 percent of corporate investment is made

by Schedule C corporations. The remainder is included with noncorporate investment. Defense

spending—which we label G throughout—is NIPA’s national defense concept and is a little over 4
percent of total adjusted product.

      Here, we have included nondefense government consumption in our measure of consumption

and nondefense government investment in our measure of tangible investment. Later, we assume
that nondefense expenditures are part of lump-sum transfers made to households. Nondefense

expenditures include expenditures on general public service, public order and safety, transportation

and other economic affairs, housing and community services, health, education, and welfare and,
when added up, is about 13.6 percent of adjusted GNP for the period 2000–2010. Transfers, as

they are categorized by the BEA, are smaller, about 12.6 percent of adjusted GNP over the period

2000–2010. More than half of these transfers are Social Security and Medicare, which together
add up to 6.6 percent of adjusted GNP. Later, when we consider policies eliminating transfers for

Medicare and Social Security, we always assume that the other transfers along with nondefense

government spending are not cut; added together, these categories are 19.6 percent of adjusted
GNP.



 11   We assume that all sales taxes in NIPA are assessed on consumption, with pro rata shares attributed to
      nondurables, services, and durables.

                                                     11
4.2. Fixed asset tables

The revised fixed asset tables are reported in Table 2 for the period 2000–2010. The stocks of

tangible capital categorized as private and public fixed assets and consumer durables are values
of reproducible costs reported by the BEA in its fixed asset tables. As with tangible investments,

we estimate that 83.5 percent of corporate capital is owned by Schedule C corporations implying
a stock of 0.67 times adjusted GNP in the category of private fixed assets. The remaining 1.52

GNPs of private fixed assets is categorized with other business; roughly 1.14 GNPs is residential

capital. Together, private and public fixed assets are equal to 2.8 times adjusted GNP. If we include
consumer durables, the total stock reported by the BEA is 3.1 times adjusted GNP.

      To derive an estimate of the total tangible capital stock, we add the value of inventories from

the NIPA accounts and the value of land from the Flow of Funds balance sheets. We include land
in the tangible capital stock because it is in large part a produced asset associated with real estate

development. Developers can and do vary the stock of real estate by shifting land use, say from

farms to suburbs or single-family homes to high-rise apartments.12 With inventories and land
included, the total tangible capital stock is 4.1 times our measure of adjusted GNP.

      To derive an estimate of the total capital available for financing retirement consumption, we

add the value of intangible capital owned by private businesses as estimated by McGrattan and
Prescott (2010). The stock of business intangible stock is estimated to be about as large as business

tangible capital, averaging about 1.7 GNPs over the ten-year period 2000–2010.13 This estimate is

derived indirectly using growth theory and data from U.S. national accounts and tax collections.
There are also related studies of intangible capital that use expenditure data and find that total

U.S. investment in business intangible capital is of a similar magnitude to investment in business

tangible capital. For example, Corrado, Haskel, Jona-Lasinio, and Iommi (2012) estimate that
U.S. intangible investments are 10.6 percent of GDP over the period 1995-2009 while tangible

investments are 9 percent of GDP.14

 12   See Rossi-Hansberg and Wright (2007) for introducing developers into a competitive equilibrium model with
      endogenous cities. The BEA does not include land as a component of fixed assets at reproduction costs because
      it does not have good measures of these costs. We use market values in our capital stock number because of
      the lack of measures of the value of land at reproduction costs.
 13   This estimate includes intangible capital of U.S. multinationals used in operations abroad and excludes software
      that is already included in the BEA measures of fixed assets.
 14   Corrado et al. (2012) is a cross-country study that extends earlier work of Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel

                                                         12
      We do not include human capital owned by individuals in our measure of the capital stock

because retired people do not rent their human capital to the business sector and cannot sell it in

order to finance retirement consumption.15

      Notice that the total stock in Table 2 is 5.8 times adjusted GNP, almost twice as large as the

stock of reproducible assets reported in the BEA’s fixed asset tables. Including only fixed assets

reported by the BEA is standard in the literature. Later, we discuss how our results would change
if we did the same.



5. Parameters

Table 3 reports the parameters used in the baseline economy—the economy with current U.S. de-
mographics and current U.S. policies. These parameters imply that the model’s balanced growth

path is consistent with U.S. statistics.16

      The first set of parameters governs demographics. For the baseline economy, we set the growth
rate of the population equal to 1 percent and the work life to 43 years. We chose these parameters

because they imply that the ratio of workers to retirees is 3.39, which is equal to the ratio of

full-time equivalent workers to the number of people age 65 and over. We used BEA estimates in
the NIPA accounts for the number of full-time equivalent workers and Census data for population

by age.

      The preference parameters are chosen so that the model’s labor input and labor share are
consistent with that of the United States. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS),

we find that total hours of work relative to the working-age population averaged 1,442 hours per

year. If discretionary time per week is 100 hours, then the fraction of time at work is 0.277.


      (2005) who include the following categories of intangible asset types: computerized information (software
      and databases), innovative property (mineral exploration, scientific R&D, entertainment and artistic origi-
      nals, new products or systems in financial services, design and other new products or systems), brand equity
      (advertising and market research), and firm-specific resources (employer-provided training and organizational
      structure). Software and mineral exploration are included with investment reported by the BEA prior to the
      2013 comprehensive revision, which is what we use in our analysis. See also Nakamura (2010, Figure 1) who
      concludes that “intangibles are as important as tangibles.”
 15   The stock of human capital is large, with just the part acquired on the job at around 2 times GNP, according to
      independent estimates of Heckman, Lochner, and Taber (1998) and Parente and Prescott (2000). Abstracting
      from this stock would not be appropriate when addressing some other questions.
 16   See McGrattan and Prescott (2013) for full details on data sources.

                                                         13
Assuming logarithmic preferences, namely,


                                          u (c, ℓ) = log c + α log (1 − ℓ) ,


we set α equal to 1.143 to get the same predicted hours of work for the model.17 In addition, we

set β = 0.987, so that the model’s predicted division of income into labor and capital matches that
of the U.S. accounts shown in Table 1.

      The technology parameters in Table 3 govern technological growth, investment rates, and

capital income shares across business sectors. The growth rate of labor-augmenting technology
is set equal to 2 percent, which is consistent with trend growth in the United States. The share

parameter in the aggregate production function θ1 —which determines the relative share of income

to Schedule C corporations—is set equal to one-half. This is somewhat arbitrary because we do
not have detailed NIPA data covering only Schedule C corporations. Instead, we have information

on receipts and deductions from corporate tax returns and base our estimate on these data.18

      The choice of tangible capital shares (θ1T , θ2T ) and tangible depreciation rates (δ1T , δ2T )
ensures that the model’s investments and fixed assets line up with tangible investments and stocks

reported by the BEA and Flow of Funds. As we noted earlier, we use data from the IRS on

depreciable assets of Schedule C corporations to determine the relative quantities of investments
and fixed assets for the model’s two sectors. Doing so, we estimate tangible capital shares of

θ1T = 0.182 and θ2T = 0.502 in the two sectors. The annual depreciation rates which generate

investment rates consistent with U.S. data are δ1T = 0.051 and δ2T = 0.015. The high capital
share and low depreciation in sector 2 follow from the fact that we have included housing and land.

      The intangible capital shares and depreciation rates, θ1I , θ2I , δ1I , δ2I , are not uniquely iden-

tifiable with the data we have. For the baseline model, we assume that two-thirds of the intangible
capital is in Schedule C corporations and one-third in other businesses, and we set the depreciation

rates on intangible capital equal to that of tangible capital in Schedule C corporations.19

 17   Later, we report results for an alternative specification of preferences that allows us to vary the labor supply
      elasticity.
 18   We experimented with lowering this share parameter and found our main results unaffected.
 19   We did extensive sensitivity analysis and found that the results are not sensitive to the allocation of intangible
      stocks across sectors, but rather to the aggregate stock of capital available for retirees to finance consumption.

                                                          14
      The last set of parameters in Table 3 includes the policy parameters. We set the level of

government consumption equal to 0.044 times GNP for all periods, that is, φGt = 0.044 for all t.

This is the average share of military expenditures in the baseline economy for the ten-year period
2000–2010. We set the maximum debt constraint parameter φBt equal to the average ratio of

U.S. government debt to GNP for 2000–2010. Thus, φBt = 0.533 for all t. When we consider

changing tax and transfer policies, we hold the spending and debt shares fixed.

      Tax rates are listed next in Table 3. There are two categories of businesses that are subject

to different taxation: Schedule C corporations and all other businesses. Schedule C corporations

that are subject to the corporate income tax. The statutory corporate income tax rate τ1π is about
40 percent for the United States when federal and state taxes are combined. However, the total

revenues recorded by the IRS—which is 2.6 percent of GNP over the period 2000–2010—indicates

that the effective tax rate is lower, on the order of 33 percent, the rate we use here.20

      An additional tax on distributions τ1d is paid by investors in these corporations, where dis-

tributions are in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We use an estimate of 14.4 percent,

which is equal to the average marginal rate as computed by the TAXSIM model times the fraction
of equity that is in taxed accounts. (See Feenberg and Coutts (1993) for details on the TAXSIM

model.) The average marginal rate that we use is that for 2013 (rather than an average over 2000–
2010) because we want to take into account the expiration of policies under the Jobs and Growth

Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. To calculate the fraction of equity that is in taxed accounts,

we use two different methods that yield close to the same estimate. First, we compute the fraction
of equity in pension funds, life insurance reserves, individual retirement accounts, and nontaxable

accounts of nonprofits. The estimates are based on balance sheet data with equity detail from the

U.S. Flow of Funds (Table B.100.e) and data on equity holdings in retirement accounts from the
Investment Company Institute (2012). These data indicate that 44 percent of equity holdings are

in nontaxable accounts. Second, we use NIPA and IRS data to compute the fraction of corporate




 20   The revenue estimate includes the small portion of property tax revenues paid by corporations, which we
      estimate to be about 0.3 percent of GNP based on assessed land values.

                                                     15
dividends distributed to nontaxed entities.21 These data indicate that 45 percent of the dividends

are in nontaxable accounts.

      For the tax rates on other business distributions (τ2d ) and labor (τ ℓ ), we use an estimate of
the income-weighted average marginal tax rate on wage-like income based on the calculations of

Barro and Redlick (2011) extended with the TAXSIM model. Over the period 2000–2010, this rate

is estimated to be 38.2 percent when federal, state, and FICA taxes are included.22

      Our second category of businesses includes businesses that distribute their accounting earn-

ings to their owners and whose earnings are treated as ordinary income for tax purposes. This

business category includes unincorporated businesses and pass-through corporate entities, namely,
Schedule S corporations, regulated investment companies (RICs), and real estate investment trusts

(REITs). We add household and government businesses to this set. The primary output of house-

hold businesses is imputed rents of real estate and consumer durables that are used by the owning
household. Owner-used real estate is subject to sizable property taxes in the United States. These

property taxes are treated as taxes on the returns to property used in a business. The government

production sector is not explicitly taxed, although some implicit taxes and transfers are associated
with government business.23

      The remaining policies shown in Table 3 are the tax on consumption and transfers to house-

holds, which depend on equilibrium outcomes. In the case of the consumption tax, we set the rate
residually at 10 percent to balance the government’s budget constraint. In the case of transfers,

we pre-set the ratio of transfers to GNP, which is an equilibrium outcome. Government transfers
in the baseline economy are chosen to be 37 percent of GNP. Recall that our measure of transfers

includes nondefense spending plus the usual government transfers, which is about 26 percent of

GNP. Thus, we are assuming that the model transfers exceed NIPA nondefense spending and the


 21   In various issues of the BEA’s Survey of Current Business (U.S. Department of Commerce 1929–2012), BEA
      estimates of personal income are compared with IRS estimates of adjusted gross income, with details of
      nontaxed distributions to pension funds, life insurance reserves, fiduciaries, and nonprofits.
 22   The composition of the 38.2 percent is 23.1 percent for federal taxes, 4.5 percent for state and local taxes, and
      10.6 percent for FICA taxes.
 23   Since the value added of government business is small, we think that just aggregating it with the noncorporate
      taxpaying sector is reasonable because it has a negligible effect on the quantitative findings reported in this
      paper. Our strategy is to develop and use as simple an abstraction as possible to answer the questions we are
      addressing. Even with this strategy, the abstraction is far from simple, and modeling all of the unimportant
      details of the tax system would greatly complicate the analysis.

                                                          16
usual transfers by about 11 percent of GNP. We add these implicit transfers to the NIPA measures

because we want the model’s tax rates to be approximately equal to the income-weighted average

marginal income tax rates for the U.S. tax system. We also treat the deduction of fringe benefits,
which are about 25 percent of total compensation, as an implicit transfer. These categories add

up to roughly 11 percent of GNP.24 If all individuals receive an equal share of transfers—with the

exception of Medicare and Social Security payments that are aimed at retirees—then the split of
transfers is 23.4 percent of GNP for workers and 13.6 percent of GNP for retirees.

      With estimates of tax rates and capital stocks, the total value of the business sector can be

determined in the model and, when added with government debt, can be compared to estimates
of private net worth in the U.S. Flow of Funds. With taxes, the market value of business equity

is lower than the value of business capital less net business debt. Let Vi be the market value of

business sector i. In this case, the following equilibrium relations are used to predict Vi :

                                V1 = 1 − τ1d K1T + 1 − τ1d (1 − τ1π ) K1I
                                             ′                       ′
                                                                                                            (5.1)
                                      ′
                                         + 1 − τ2d K2I
                                                   ′
                                V2 = K2T               .                                                    (5.2)

The factor (1 − τ1d ) in the first equation is the cost of a unit of capital in terms of the composite
output good. The factor (1−τ1π ) affects the second term because intangible capital investments are

expensed, which reduces taxable accounting profits.25 For sector 2, all profits except those used

to finance intangible capital investment are distributed to the households who own the businesses.
The total value of the business sector is V = V1 +V2 , which is the value of both net private business

debt and equity held directly and indirectly. Theory predicts that private net worth equals business

equity V plus government debt B.

      The Flow of Funds reports estimates of net worth for the private sector that averaged 4.1

times adjusted GNP in the period 2000–2010. If the model data are consistent with values for

U.S. fixed assets, tax rates, and government debt, then the predicted net worth is 5.4 times GNP.
This follows from application of the formulas for V1 and V2 . Several factors need to be considered
 24   Estimates of the difference between marginal and average tax rates based on the TAXSIM model are on the
      order of 12 percent, which yields roughly 7 percent of GNP in implicit transfers. Fringe benefits, if taxed,
      imply roughly 4 percent of GNP in implicit transfers.
 25   We are using the fact that the purchase price for tangible capital is approximately 1 since the capital con-
      sumption allowance adjustments of the period were small, as were investment tax credits and taxes on capital
      equipment.

                                                        17
when comparing predicted and reported private net worth. First, the stock of tangible capital in

Table 2 includes about 0.6 GNPs of public fixed assets that are legally owned by the government

and not included in the U.S. net worth reported in the Flow of Funds. Second, about 0.2 GNPs of
government debt is foreign owned and not part of U.S. net worth reported in the Flow of Funds.

Third, the stock market in the period considered is low relative to theoretical predictions by a

significant amount. Fourth, our baseline model has no aggregate uncertainty and as a result,
there is no aggregate risk premium. Fifth, to estimate private net worth, the Federal Reserve

must estimate the value of unincorporated businesses that are not publicly traded; owners of these

businesses have an incentive to understate the true value.

    The theoretical relationships in (5.1)-(5.2) highlight why distinguishing different types of capi-

tal taxes and different types of capital is essential to any study of household saving. If, for example,

we follow previous work and include only taxes on profits and tangible capital stocks, then the
                                                                  ′     ′
value of business equity is the total stock of tangible capital, K1T + K2T , which depends only

indirectly on business income taxes. Taxes on distributions have a direct impact on valuations of
Schedule C corporations because the price of capital for these companies rises with a fall in the tax

rate on distributions. In effect, as the tax rate falls, the government’s ownership stake falls and the

share price paid by household rises. As a result, any tax reform that involves lowering tax rates on
dividends or capital gains has a direct and positive impact on household net worth. Distinguishing

tangible and intangible capital is necessary because the tax treatment of these assets is different.

Any tax reform that involves lowering tax rates on profits of Schedule C corporations or distri-
butions of pass-through entities implies a change in the relative price of tangible and intangible

capital because investments in intangible capital are expensed before taxable accounting profits

are computed. Eliminating tax rates on profits results in equal tax treatment for intangible and
tangible capital and a rise in household net worth.

    Table 4 compares the model’s balanced growth predictions with the U.S. national accounts

(Table 1), fixed asset tables (Table 2), and the labor input. The point of the comparison is to show
that the baseline model is consistent with these key U.S. aggregate statistics.




                                                  18
6. Evaluation of Alternative Policies

Next, we turn to our policy experiments.26 We start by analyzing a policy regime that is effectively
a continuation of current U.S. policy—that is, a system that taxes labor and capital incomes and

uses part of the proceeds to finance the consumption of retirees. Because the number of workers
per retiree is falling, a continuation of this policy necessitates increasing one or more tax rates over

time.27 In the experiments reported here, we assume that the consumption tax is increased in order

to finance additional old-age transfers.28 We compare a continuation of the current U.S. policy
with three variations on a saving-for-retirement regime. To start, we eliminate FICA taxes and

transfers to retirees that are neither welfare nor local public goods. We then set all taxes on profits

and distributions to zero. Finally, we consider an additional tax reform, which is to eliminate
implicit transfers due to marginal tax rates increasing with income and tax deductions such as

fringe benefits. This last reform essentially flattens the income tax schedule and broadens the tax

base.

      In this section, we report the welfare consequences for these alternative policy regimes. The

initial state is the balanced growth path in the baseline economy of Section 4. At time t = 0, a

demographic transition occurs, and we determine the welfare consequences for each cohort alive at
the time of the unexpected demographic and policy regime change and for all cohorts entering the

workforce in years subsequent to the change. But first we examine the balanced growth impact of

the policy and demographic changes.


6.1. Balanced growth comparisons

The upper panel of Table 5 summarizes the tax rates and transfers as we vary demographics and

fiscal policies. The first column lists the policy parameters in the baseline economy with current

U.S. policy and current U.S. demographics. (These are the same as in Table 3.) The population
growth rate in the baseline economy is 1 percent, and the ratio of workers to retirees is 3.4.


 26   In McGrattan and Prescott (2013), we provide details of the algorithm used to compute equilibria.
 27   The continuation policy we consider assumes transfers for Social Security and Medicare rise at the same rate
      as the retiree population. According to annual reports summarized in U.S. Social Security Administration
      (2013), this is a conservative estimate for the growth rate of these transfers.
 28   We also tried increasing the labor tax rate but could not raise sufficient funds to finance all of the additional
      old-age transfers due to the significant decline in the labor input.

                                                          19
    The second column of Table 5 lists taxes and transfers under the current policy assuming that

demographic change occurs. Under the new demographics, we assume that the population growth

rate falls to zero and the ratio of workers to retirees is 2. Continuing with the current system
necessitates an increase in the consumption tax from 10 percent to 14 percent. The share of GNP

set aside for transfers to workers stays the same on a per capita basis—falling to 20.5 percent of

GNP from 23.4 percent of GNP as the number of workers falls. Transfers to retirees increase as
a share of GNP because a larger fraction of the population receives Medicare and Social Security

transfers.

    The policies associated with variations on a saving-for-retirement system with new demograph-
ics are shown in the last three columns of Table 5. In all future policies, FICA taxes are eliminated,

as are the associated transfers for Medicare and Social Security. The third column shows the tax

rates and transfers that would be used in the event that only these changes are implemented—that
is, FICA taxes, Medicare, and Social Security are eliminated. Relative to a continuation of current

policy, the labor tax is lower by 10.6 percentage points, which is the average marginal tax rate for
FICA computed by Barro and Redlick (2011). Notice also that the transfers are only 30.3 percent

of GNP, down from 36.9 percent of GNP under current U.S. policy. The difference reflects transfers

for Medicare and Social Security, which are eliminated in the saving-for-retirement systems.

    The second variation of the saving-for-retirement system we consider eliminates capital taxes

on profits and distributions. The corresponding taxes and transfers for this case are shown in

column 4 of Table 5. Notice that the tax on consumption is much higher relative to the current
rate in this case. The rate shown is the one needed to balance the government’s budget with capital

taxes set to 0. The transfer-GNP ratios are the same as the case in which only FICA taxes are

eliminated.

    Finally, in column 5, we show the tax rates and transfers if implicit transfers are eliminated.

Recall that implicit transfers of roughly 11 percent of GNP are added to NIPA measures to account

for the fact that the model uses marginal rather than average tax rates and treats untaxed income
(e.g., fringe benefits) as transfers. With implicit transfers eliminated, the income tax schedule is

flattened, and marginal rates are set equal to average rates. In this case, the labor tax falls another

12 percentage points to 15.6 percent, as shown in column 5. Further eliminating implicit transfers

                                                  20
for fringe benefits implies a lower consumption tax rate, which is set residually.29 This rate is 28

percent in the case in which only transfers for Medicare and Social Security are eliminated and

falls to 23 percent if implicit transfers are eliminated as well. Since the remaining transfers are not
age dependent, with the new demographics, two-thirds of the transfers are given to workers and

one-third to retirees.

      Equilibrium outcomes for the various policy regimes are shown in the lower panel of Table 5.
The results in the first column are the same as those for the baseline economy in Table 4. Note

also that the equilibrium interest rate for this economy is 4.68 percent. The results of continuing

the current U.S. policy are reported in the second column of Table 5. With fewer workers, labor
input falls roughly 9 percent and GNP falls roughly 6 percent. Consumption and capital shares

rise, primarily because GNP falls. The welfare loss of continuing the policy is significant, roughly

4.7 percent in annual consumption.

      The last three columns in the lower panel of Table 5 show the results for variations on the

saving-for-retirement system with FICA taxes and old-age transfers eliminated. Several key find-

ings emerge. Most notably, GNP, household net worth, and welfare are significantly higher for
all three saving-for-retirement policy regimes relative to the case in which current U.S. policy is

continued. Including all three reforms, GNP is 44 percent higher than if the current U.S. policy
is continued. The gains in household net worth are even greater, especially with capital taxes

eliminated. Net worth is 86 percent higher if capital income taxes are cut, but implicit transfers

are not, and 114 percent higher if both capital income taxes and implicit transfers are cut. When
compared to a continuation of U.S. policy, the saving-for-retirement plans yield significant gains

in welfare: 15 percent per year if FICA taxes and old-age transfers are eliminated, 18 percent if

capital taxes are also eliminated, and 25 percent for the full tax reform with tax schedules flattened
and the tax system broadened in addition.30

      The huge gains in net worth are due in part to an increase in productive capital stocks and

in part to the price of capital rising as capital taxes are cut. Because tangible capital is not


 29   The ratios of defense spending and government debt to GNP are held at their baseline levels.
 30   Later, we rerun our experiments in a one-sector model with only tangible capital and a capital stock to GNP
      ratio of 3 and show that welfare gains are roughly half of what we find here for the policy comparisons.

                                                       21
expensed, we see a much larger rise in this stock relative to intangible capital when capital taxes

are eliminated. The tangible capital stock to GNP ratio is in the range of 5.9 to 6 with capital

taxes eliminated—much higher than the ratio of 4.2 found with a continuation of U.S. policy. On
the other hand, the ratio of intangible capital to GNP is roughly 1.7 in the economies with and

without capital taxation.

      The impact of the new demographics and new policy on the total labor input depends on two
offsetting factors: there are fewer workers but, with labor tax rates lower, greater incentives to

work. If the only change is in demographic composition, labor input falls about 9 percent. This

is the case in which U.S. policy continues with new demographics, as shown in column 2 of Table
5. If FICA taxes are eliminated, the labor input stays roughly as it was in the baseline economy.

Further cuts in labor taxes that accompany the elimination of implicit transfers imply a 9 percent

increase in the total labor input relative to the baseline value.

      Next we consider transitions from the baseline economy—with the current U.S. tax and trans-

fer system and current demographics—to the four alternative policies with new U.S. demographics.


6.2. Welfare comparisons by cohorts

A question that arises is, What are the welfare consequences in the transition to balanced growth?
Do some birth-year cohorts lose? Answering these questions requires computing the equilibrium

transition paths if the United States stays with the current policy and, alternatively, if it switches to

a saving-for-retirement policy.31 For the transition to all three versions of the saving-for-retirement
policy, we show how to find paths for tax rates and transfers—paths that are nonnegative and vary

smoothly over time—so that no cohorts lose during the transition.

      In all cases, we start with the initial state in the baseline economy and hold the ratios of debt
to GNP and defense spending to GNP fixed over time. The initial state is summarized by the level

of government debt and the distribution of household asset holdings. The initial distribution of

ages is determined by the parameters of the baseline economy, and in all transitions, we assume




 31   In McGrattan and Prescott (2013), we describe how we compute the transition paths using parallel computations.

                                                        22
a linear decline in the population growth rate over first forty-five years.32 The initial population,

the path of population growth rates, and survival probabilities then determine the evolution of the

distribution of ages.

      Table 6 summarizes the key variables on the transition paths as the U.S. economy transitions

from the current demographics to the new demographics. Four future policies are considered, with

the eventual balanced growth paths summarized earlier. (See Table 5.)


6.2.1. Continue U.S. policy

The first transition, which is a continuation of U.S. policy, is shown in Table 6A. Components of

the government budget constraint are shown first as a share of GNP, national account and fixed

assets are shown next, again as a share of GNP, and levels of several key variables in the last rows
of the table.

      The main policy changes are increases in transfers for the retirees and increases in consumption

taxes to finance them, where the latter are residually determined to satisfy the government budget
constraint. The rate of increase in transfers for Medicare and Social Security is a function of the

rate of increase in the retiree population. More specifically, let rt be the fraction of the population

that is retired in year t, and let zt be the ratio of new retirees in period t relative to new retirees
on the final balanced growth path, that is, zt = (rt − r1 )/(r∞ − r1 ), which starts at 0 and rises to 1

over time. We assume that transfers for Medicare and Social Security paid to retirees are equal to

0.066+0.028 zt on the transition path, where 0.028 GNPs are the additional transfers needed on
the new balanced growth path. Remaining transfers are equal to 0.303 GNPs, with fraction rt of

that paid to retirees and fraction 1 − rt paid to workers in year t. The consumption tax revenues
required to finance these transfers rise from 7.5 percent of GNP to 10.6 percent.

      The continuation of U.S. policy is our reference point when conducting welfare analysis of

saving-for-retirement policies. It will be useful to compare the paths of endogenous variables in

Table 6A with those associated with the saving-for-retirement reforms shown in Table 6B–6D



 32   We also considered more immediate changes in the growth rate and found that the results are not sensitive to
      this choice.

                                                        23
6.2.2. Eliminate FICA taxes, Medicare, and Social Security

The first saving-for-retirement policy that we analyze involves the elimination of FICA taxes and
transfers for Medicare and Social Security. In this case, we use a step-by-step approach to construct-

ing a welfare-improving transition for all birth-year cohorts. Our goal in presenting intermediate

results is to provide intuition for the final numerical experiment reported in Table 6B.

    The step-by-step construction is illustrated in Figure 1. The path marked “Step 1” shows the

welfare gains—and, for some birth-year cohorts, losses—of gradually eliminating FICA taxes and

old-age transfers. The welfare measure that we use is remaining lifetime consumption equivalents
of cohorts by age at the time of the policy change. The decline in both the labor tax rate and the

share of transfers to retirees occurs at the rate of decrease in the ratio of new workers to eventual

new workers (for example, τtℓ = .382 − .106zt ). In other words, the rates are gradually lowered.

    Figure 1 shows that current retirees are indifferent between this gradual elimination of FICA

taxes and old-age transfers and the continuation of current U.S. policy because their benefits are not

affected. Furthermore, since labor tax rates remain temporarily high at 38 percent, consumption
tax rates need not rise to make up any revenue shortfall. Current workers and some future workers,

however, face the higher tax rates on labor when they are working but receive lower transfers by
the time they reach retirement. Relative to a continuation of current policy, they are worse off.

    Next, consider a variation on that transition path with old-age transfers gradually reduced

as before and FICA taxes immediately eliminated. The welfare results for this case are shown in
the path marked “Step 2” of Figure 1. Notice that many of the cohorts with welfare losses in the

first step have welfare gains when the tax rates are immediately eliminated. They can take full

advantage of the lower tax rates. Notice, however, that the current retirees are worse off now.
They are worse off because consumption tax rates have to rise to make up the shortfall in revenue

with lost revenue from FICA taxes, and because they are retired, they cannot take advantage of

lower tax rates on wages.

    The third step in the construction of a welfare-improving transition path involves a change

that makes both current retirees and current workers better off by temporarily cutting some implicit

transfers to workers. We do this without eliminating any government spending on public goods


                                                 24
and services and transfers other than Medicare and Social Security. Recall that transfers—when

nondefense spending is included—are equal to 37 percent of GNP. Spending on Medicare and

Social Security is 6.6 percent of GNP, spending on public goods and services other than Medicare
and Social Security is 19.6 percent of GNP and the rest, roughly 11 percent of GNP, is implicit

transfers, which account for the difference between what the IRS actually collects and what tax

revenues would be if all income were taxed at income-weighted marginal taxes.

    The path marked “Step 3” in Figure 1 shows the welfare gains if we temporarily reduced

workers’ implicit transfers, which is equal to the fraction of the population working times 11

percent of GNP. We assume that the transfers are restored at the same rate that the population
of retirees increases, that is, they rise at the same rate as zt . What we see in this case is a large

welfare gain for current retirees because the tax rate on consumption can be lowered relative to the

regime with a continuation of the current U.S. taxes and transfers. In fact, if we only lowered the
workers’ implicit transfers in half temporarily, we would still find a welfare-improving transition.

Notice that some current workers and new cohorts would rather not eliminate these transfers, but
all would agree that the policy is better than continuing with the current U.S. policy.

    In Table 6B, we show the transition path for the case in which implicit transfers are temporarily

reduced by half. We also show the welfare gains by cohort for this case in Figure 2 (solid line).
The data shown in Table 6B provide us with an idea of why this policy change is desirable for all

cohorts. The impact of the immediate drop in labor tax rates outweighs the impact of a modest

rise in consumption tax rates; first decade averages show increases in the labor input of 8 percent,
GNP of 5 percent, and net worth of 4 percent—far greater than in the case that current policy is

continued. (Compare Table 6A and Table 6B.) Multiplying the consumption share of 72.8 percent

of GNP, we find that aggregate consumption is equal to 76.4—which is 3 percentage points higher
than the case in which U.S. policy is continued (compare Table 6A and Table 6B). As transfers

for retirees are phased out, we see that the labor input falls back to the baseline level, while GNP

and household net worth steadily rise. At the end of the transition, which is the last column of
Table 6B, GNP is higher by 12 percent and net worth is higher by 23 percent, confirming what we

found earlier in the balanced growth calculations. These results are drastically improved over the

case with current U.S. policy continued. (See the last column of Table 6A.)


                                                 25
6.2.3. Eliminate FICA and capital taxes, Medicare, and Social Security

The next major tax reform that we consider is the elimination of taxes on profits and distributions—
that is, we set all capital taxes to zero. Based on the lessons of the first reform—with just FICA

taxes and old-age transfers eliminated—we choose the paths for noncapital tax rates and transfers

as before and then gradually eliminate capital taxes. This choice avoids increasing consumption
tax rates early in the transition to make up for lost revenue and also avoids spikes in interest rates.

The specific paths for capital tax rates that we use are of the form τ − τ zt , where τ = 0.33, 0.144,

and 0.382, respectively, for the rate on Schedule C profits, the rate on Schedule C distributions,
and the rate on other business distributions.

    The results of this experiment are shown in Table 6C and Figure 2. Comparing these results

with the case in which capital tax rates held fixed, we see that the early part of the transition is
by design almost the same. As a result, the welfare impact for the cohorts alive at the time of

the policy change is quantitatively close. As the capital tax rates drop, we find a large increase in
tangible capital. As we noted earlier, because intangible capital is expensed from profits, the stock

does not rise as much as the stock of tangible capital when tax rates are lowered. In addition,

wages are higher and labor input lower over the transition than they were in the case in which
capital tax rates are fixed.


6.2.4. Eliminate FICA and capital taxes, Medicare, Social Security, and implicit transfers

The final reform assumes that implicit transfers are permanently eliminated on the new balanced

growth path and that tax rates on labor fall gradually from 27.6 percent to 15.6 percent (that is,
τtℓ = .276 − .12zt ). The difference in tax rates is the estimated difference in marginal and average

tax rates. In this case, the transfers on the new balanced growth path are equal to 19.6 GNPs and

include only the categories of nondefense spending and transfers other than Medicare and Social
Security that are usually included in NIPA measures. The results of this experiment are shown in

Table 6D and Figure 2.

    Notice first that the tax revenues on labor are a little more than 16 percent of GNP (or 27.6
percent of the labor share) at the start of the transition and eventually fall to about 9 percent of



                                                  26
GNP (or 15.6 percent of the labor share). Revenues for the consumption tax, which are residually

determined, are a little above 9 percent of GNP at the start and rise to 16 percent. In other words,

this reform assumes a shift from labor taxation to consumption taxation with little change in policy
at the start of the transition. The impact on welfare, shown in Figure 1, is large in terms of annual

consumption for future cohorts when compared with the option of continuing U.S. policy. Gains

for future cohorts are roughly 25 percent.

    In sum, we show how to construct a welfare-improving path when switching from the current

U.S. tax and transfer system to a saving-for-retirement system. The gains to future generations of

doing so are large.


6.3. Sensitivity of the results

How sensitive are these results to our model parameters? For variations on the model employed

above—which we refer to as the benchmark model—we rerun our numerical experiments. We

consider a number of variations on this benchmark model. We shut down annuities markets. We
introduce life cycle variation in productivities using Hansen’s (1993) efficiency weights and replace

wℓ in the household budget constraint with wℓǫj , where Hansen’s weight ǫj is a function of age.

We explore positive tax rates on capital instead of eliminating them entirely. We allow for a more
flexible utility function, namely,


                               u (c, ℓ) = log c + α (1 − ℓ)1−ζ / (1 − ζ) ,


which nests the benchmark model if we set ζ = 1. Finally, we analyze a one-capital, one-sector
version of the model with parameters chosen so that the total capital stock is 3 times GNP. In

all versions of the model, with the exception of the one-capital, one-sector version, we recalibrate

parameters to match the data in NIPA and the Flow of Funds. In the one-capital, one-sector
version, we set the capital share equal to 0.33, the discount factor equal to 0.99, the depreciation rate

equal to 0.06, and the weight on leisure in utility equal to 1.25. In terms of the tax experiments for

the one-capital, one-sector model, we follow the literature and abstract from taxes on distributions.
Thus, in this case, when we eliminate capital taxes, the only change to be made is eliminating the

tax on corporate profits.

                                                   27
      The results for the balanced growth gains are reported in Table 7.33 The first row of Table 7

is the benchmark economy with results matching the last line of Table 5. The second row shows

the case without annuity markets. The eventual gains are higher than in the benchmark. Welfare
gains with all reforms are 28 percent. The third row has the case with age-dependent productivities

based on Hansen (1993). The eventual gains are only slightly lower than in the benchmark. With

eventual profits tax rates positive, at 12 or 4 percent, we do not find an increase in welfare. Because
of the finite lifetime, there is no guarantee that welfare will be highest at zero, but for our model

the peak in balanced growth welfare occurs at roughly one-half of 1 percent. For the results listed

in the row labeled “lower labor elasticity,” we chose ζ = 2, which implies a Frisch elasticity that
is one-half of that used in the benchmark model. In addition, we lowered the weight on leisure to

α = 0.756 so as to generate the same aggregate labor input as in the benchmark model. As shown
in Table 7, the welfare losses due to the demographic transition are slightly higher with the lower

labor elasticity than with the benchmark parameters—5.2 percent versus 4.7 percent—and the

welfare gains from eliminating FICA taxes and retiree transfers are slightly lower, but the overall
differences are not large. For example, with all three policy reforms (last column of Table 7), the

welfare gains are 22.4 percent, which is still much larger than typical welfare estimates.

      Typical welfare estimates are those of a one-capital, one-sector model with the tangible capital
stock equal to roughly 3 times GNP and no intangible capital. The welfare gains of this case are

shown in the last row of Table 7. The predicted loss of continuing with current U.S. policy is about

2 percentage points higher, and the predicted gains of switching to a saving-for-retirement system
are roughly half of that found with benchmark parameters. With the capital stock at 3, we find

that much smaller welfare gains result from switching to a saving-for-retirement system, even in

the first experiment with only FICA taxes eliminated. The gains are 8 percent versus 15 percent
in the benchmark. When capital taxes are eliminated, the gains in the one-sector model hardly

rise—a difference of only 0.7 percentage points—whereas we find a difference close to 3 percentage

points with our benchmark parameters. In this case, there is no amplification of the effects due to
a change in the price of capital; the price of capital is 1 in all periods. With all three reforms, we



 33   Analogues of Table 6 and Figure 2 are reported in McGrattan and Prescott (2013) for all variations of the
      benchmark model.

                                                      28
find a welfare gain of roughly 13 percent in the one-capital, one-sector version of the model and a

25 percent gain in our benchmark.

    What about welfare, cohort by cohort, during the transitions? In all cases, we can construct
welfare-improving transitions without increasing debt or lowering transfers for welfare and local

public goods. When we vary life cycle productivities or the final profits tax rates, the same paths

for taxes and transfers can be used as shown in Table 6. When we shut down annuity markets or
cut the labor elasticity in half, we need to reduce workers’ implicit transfers in the early stages

of the transition a little more than we did with the benchmark parameters. In the one-capital,

one-sector model with the productive capital stock at 3, we need to modify the phasing in of taxes
and transfers slightly to make all new cohorts better off. But overall, the impact on existing cohorts

is relatively similar across all numerical experiments.

    In summary, we find that including all capital available to retirees for financing their retirement
consumption and distinguishing between different taxes on profits and distributions is quantita-

tively important when deciding whether to abandon tax and transfer schemes currently used in

the United States in favor of a private saving-for-retirement scheme.



7. Summary

A challenging economic policy issue facing the United States and many other nations is the financing

of retirement as the population ages and the number of workers per retiree falls. We find that the fall
in the number of workers per retiree can be handled without major change in the current retirement

financing scheme. Some tax policy changes, however, dramatically increase welfare. These changes

entail lowering or eliminating income taxes and relying more on saving for retirement and less on
lump-sum transfers to retirees. The broadening of the (nonhuman) capital stock is important for

our analysis, as is requiring the model to be consistent with both the national accounts and the

fixed asset tables. Estimates of the welfare gains arising from switching from the current system
to a saving-for-retirement system are roughly twice as large as those found with typically used

macroeconomic models.

    Through discussions and insights we hope and expect that better abstractions for predicting


                                                  29
the consequences of alternative tax and transfer policies will develop. We do not model human

capital investments made over working lives, and this may also have a consequence for the stock

of savings.34 Other possible extensions include adding bequest motives, intragenerational hetero-
geneity, and open economy effects.




 34   Wallenius (2011) has analyzed the consequence of rival human capital production on the job for the intertem-
      poral elasticity of substitution of labor, but did not focus on assessing the consequence for the aggregate stock
      of savings. See also Ueberfeldt (2009).

  a
      This category includes business transfers and excludes subsidies.
  b
      Imputed capital services are equal to 4 percent times the current-cost net stock
      of government fixed assets and consumer durable goods.
  c
      The corporate share of gross private domestic investment is 56.5 percent. To
      determine the share of Schedule C corporations, we assume that the ratio of
      investments for these corporations and all other corporations is the same as
      the ratio of their depreciable assets. Based on balance sheet data from the
      IRS corporate tax returns, this would imply that 83.5 percent of corporate
      investment is made by Schedule C corporations.

Note: The sources of data on tangible capital stocks are the fixed asset tables pub-
lished by the BEA prior to the 2013 comprehensive revision, corporate tax returns
published by the IRS, and the Flow of Funds accounts published by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve. The intangible capital stocks are estimates from
McGrattan and Prescott (2010).
  a
      The corporate shares of private fixed assets, inventories, and land are 36.8
      percent, 92.1 percent, and 15.0 percent, respectively. In the case of inventories,
      we assume that 13 percent of farm inventories are corporate based on the
      ratio of corporate farmland and buildings relative to total corporate stocks
      reported in Table 828 of the U.S. Statistical Abstract, 2012. To determine
      the share of Schedule C corporations, we assume that the ratio of stocks for
      these corporations and all other corporations is the same as the ratio of their
      depreciable assets. Based on balance sheet data from the IRS corporate tax
      returns, this would imply that 83.5 percent of corporate capital is owned by
      Schedule C corporations.
