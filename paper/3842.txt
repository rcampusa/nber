                   MEASURING THE CONTRIBUTION OF
              PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEZ4


                             ABSTRACT

      Our purpose in this paper is to examine how one might
 evaluate and measure the contribution of public infrastructure

capital on private sector output and productivity growth in
Sweden. We do this by specifying and implementing empirically a
number of alternative econometric models, using annual data for

Sweden from 1960 to 1988.

     Using a dual cost function approach, we find that increases
in public infrastructure capital, ceteris oaribus, reduce private

sector costs. We compute that amount of public infrastructure
capital that would rationalize the cost savings incurred by the

private business and manufacturing sectors, and find that the
amount that can be rationalized in this manner is less than what
was in fact available in 1988, but that the extent of excess

public infrastructure capital has been falling in the 1980's.

                         by Ernst R. Berndt and Bengt Hansson

 I.      Introduction

          Although much attention in macroeconomics has been focused on the

 effects of goverrunent spending on private sector output and productivity

 growth, and even though private sector capital accumulation has long been

 studied in terms of its effects on economic growth and
                                                           productivity,
 surprisingly little consideration has been given to the    corresponding effects
 of public infrastructure capital stock formation.     By public infrastructure
 capital stocks, we refer to the highways, airports, mass transit
                                                                      facilities,
 water supplies, sewer systems, police and fire stations, courthouses and

 public garages, etc., that provide an environment in which private production

 is facilitated.

         As David Aschauer (1989] and Alicia Munnell [1990a,b],
                                                                  among others,
have recently emphasized, this relative neglect of public infrastructure

capital is particularly startling, for the amount of such infrastructure

capital is substantial, both absolutely and relatively.1 Munnell [1990a,

Table 3], for example, reports that in 1987 in the United States, the value of

the total private (nonfarm business plus farm) capital stock was $4.1 trillion

dollars, while the total non-military public infrastructure capital stock was

$1.9 trillion •-    about 461 of the private sector stock. For Sweden, our

estimate of the private business sector capital stock in 1988 is 817 billion

SEX, while that for the public infrastructure capital stock is 355 billion SEX

      about 43% of the private sector stock. In both countries, infrastructure

capital is substantial.

        Government investments in long-lived capital equipment and buildings

undoubtedly provide valuable infrastructure services for the private business

sector, as well as for individual consumers. The construction of new roads,

 or   the maintenance and upkeep of existing highways, for example, can have    a

 substantial impact on the time required to transport goods and services, and

 to conduct other business affairs. Thus it is reasonable to expect that

 public sector infrastructure capital formation has a significant impact on the

performance and productivity of the private sector.2

       In this context, it is of interest to examine relative growth rates of

capital accumulation in the private and public sectors of Sweden and the

United States. As is shown in Table 1, surprisingly similar trends have

occured in these two countries since 1960, with both revealing a rather sharp

slowdown in public infrastructure capital formation in the 1970's. More

specifically, over the 1960-88 time period, the annual average growth rate

(AACR) of real capital stocks in the private sector was 3.8% in Sweden and
 PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                           -
                                                                       pag• 3   -




 3.41 in the US; the 1974-88 AACR for Sweden (3.01) and the US
                                                               (3.11) were both
 less than that from 1960-73 (4.71 for Sweden and 4.3Z for the Us).

       Since 1973, however, growth of the public infrastructure capital stock

 has lagged considerably behind that in the private sector, both in the US and

 Sweden. While the AACR from 1960-73 for core infrastructure capital (high-

 ways, airports, mass transit, electric and gas plants, telecommunications,

water supply facilities and sewers) was substantial at 4.11 in both countries,

 growth fell sharply to 1.31 (Sweden) and 1.41 (US) from 1974 to 1988. And if

one excludes electricity generation and distribution investments from the core

capital, in Sweden the growth rate of infrastructure capital since 1974 is
0.01 --   zero.
      The rough coincidence of this slowdown in public infrastructure capital

formation with the much-discussed decline in productivity growth in both these

countries is striking. A back of the envelope calculation reveals further

that the simple correlation between annual multifactor productivity growth in

Sweden's private business sector and the growth rate of its public

infrastructure capital stock from 1961 to 1988 is 0.55, while that between

productivity growth and the growth rate of this infrastructure stock lagged

one year is 0.65.      Is there in fact a relationship between public infra-

structure capital formation and the productivity growth slowdown in Sweden?

Or, as has been conjectured by Charles Schultze [1990], is this correlation

simply a temporal coincidence, without any cause-effect implications?

      Our   purpose   in this paper is to examine how one might evaluate and

measure the contribution of public infrastructure capital on private sector

output and productivity growth. We do this by specifying and implementing

empirically a number of alternative econometric models using annual data for

Sweden from 1960 to 1988.

       The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section II we begin
                                                                       by
 summarizing and critiquing the theoretical framework and empirical results

 reported in several recent studies of public infrastructure capital formation

 based on US data. In Section III we provide an alternative theoretical

 framework, using modern duality theory. Then in Section IV we discuss

 measurement issues and econometric implementation. In Section V we report

 empirical results for the total private business sector in Sweden, and in

 Section VI we focus on the manufacturing sector only. Finally, in Section VII

we present a summary of our findings and provide suggestions for future

 research.



II.    Brief Review of Literature

       The literature on modeling the contribution of public infrastructure

capital to economic growth is substantial; much of it is in the context of

regional economics and economic development.3 A common specification in this

literature is that of a production function relating value-added output Q to

the quantities of labor input L, private capital input 5, and public

infrastructure capital K:

             Q —   F(L, 5, K1).                                            (1)

      In an early theoretical article, James E. Meade l952], develops a

specification in which it is assumed that F is homogeneous of degree one in

all inputs L, 5 and K1. Since by assumption Ki affects Q, and since it is

exogenous to the firm but does not directly receive a factor payment from the

firm, Meade calls this specification an "unpaid factor" model. Another

specification considered by Meade is one where F is homogeneous of degree one

in only the private inputs L and 5, and in which the marginal product of the

public infrastructure capital is positive; Meade calls this an "atmosphere"
 PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                                       -   Page 5



 model.   In this atmosphere model, returns to scale over all inputs are
 typically   increasing, although they are constant over private inputs. A third

possibility, of course, is one in which no constraints are placed on the

homogeneity of the F function, implying no restrictions on returns to scale.4

      At this point it is worth remarking that relatively few empirical

studies have been reported in the literature that incorporate public

infrastructure capital Kj as an input into production or cost functions. An

implication of this is that in most studies the K measure is an omitted

variable, and that therefore the resulting estimates of private returns to

scale may suffer from an omitted variable bias. What the sign of this bias is

cannot be stated in general, for it depends on the specific representation of

the production or cost function. An intriguing question that emerges,

however, is whether the recent spurt of literature on economic growth

emphasizing the existence of increasing returns to scale for private inputs,

is based in large part on such an omitted variable bias.5

      Although most of public infrastructure literature is theoretical, a

number of econometric studies have been undertaken. Among the more recent

analyses, those by David A. Aschauer (1989J and Alicia H. Munneil [1990a,b}

are of particular interest to us. We now briefly summarize their findings.

      Aschauer assumes that the production function in (1) is Cobb-Douglas.

and he estimates parameters for all three of the returns to scale specifica-

tions noted above. Moreover, he adds to the estimating equation a time

counter variable "t"         to   incorporate the effects of disembodied technical

progress, and a capacity utilization variable CU. For his specification with

no constraints placed on returns to scale, Aschauer estimates parameters of

the equation

               in Q -   hi        —    + a1•ln   L +   a2•ln K + a3•lnKj   +
 PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                                            -
                                                                                         Page 6 -



                                      a4•ln   CU +   a5't   + u                                     (2)
 where in is the natural logarithm, u is a traditional stochastic disturbance

 term, and the degree of returns to scale over all inputs is equal to a1 +
                                                                           a2 +
 a3 + 1.    Aschauer also derives and estimates a productivity equation
                                                                                                 having
 the form

     ln A —    b0   +
                        b1•ln   L +   b2•ln K + b3•].n      Ki +     b4•].n CU +   b5t   +   v      (3)

where A is the normalized level of inultifactor productivity computed from a

Divisia index of growth in output Q minus growth in the private                         inputs L and

     and v is a random disturbance term. Note that Meade's unpaid factor and

atmosphere models are testable special cases of (2) and (3).

      Aschauer's measure of Ki is the net stock of non-military public

structures and equipment, which is based on values presented in a US

Department of Commerce publication, Fixed Reproducible Tannible Wealth 1925-

    K includes federal, state and local capital stocks of equipment and

structures. Annual data on US private business sector output Q, hours L,

private capital K. and multifactor productivity A are obtained from the US

Department of Labor publications Monthly Labor Review, while the                         capacity
utilization measure is from the federal Reserve Bulletin and is restricted to

the manufacturing sector of the US economy. Based on this 1949-85 annual

data, Aschauer reports results of estimating equation (2) as:

  ln Q -    in K —      -5.60 + 0.29•in     L -   0.44•ln   K.1, +   0.36•ln                      (4)
                        (10.90) (3.04)            (7.95)             (9.79)

                    +   O.451n    CU +    0.OiO•t           R2 — 0.977        SER — 0.0078
                    (11.31)              (4.46)             DW — 1.74

where absolute values of t-statistjcs are in parentheses, SER                      is    the standard

error of the regression and DW is the Durbin-Watson test statistic. Note that

the 0.36 coefficient on in K1 is positive and statistically significant, and

that it implies that if public infrastructure capital were increased by 1%,
 PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                             -   Page   7-

 ceteris   paribus, the private business sector output would increase by O.36X.

 Estimated returns to scale are 1.21. but the null hypothesis of constant

 returns to scale in all inputs (Meade's unpaid factor model) cannot be

 rejected at usual significance levels. The implied elasticity of output with

 respect to labor is 0.29. while that with respect to private capital is 0.56

 (-0.44 + I); the relative values of these two elasticities differ
                                                                           considerably
 from the wconventional wisdoaN, in which the ratio of the L to
                                                                     5 output
elasticities is typically 3:1, not 1:2.6

        A related set of empirical efforts have been reported by Alicia Munnell.

As in Aschauer, in Munneli [1990aJ it is assumed that the production function

is Cobb-Douglas, but CU rather than in CU is added as a regressor, and the t

variable is not included. When no constraints are placed on returns to scale,

Munnell's estimating equation is of the form

        in Q -   in   L — c0 + c1•ln L + c2•ln 5 + c3'ln K + c4•CU +
                                                                                 (5)

where c is a random disturbance term that follows a first-order
                                                                         autoregressive
(AR1)   process.      Returns to scale over all inputs equal c1 + c2 + c3 + 1.

        Munneil considers two    alternative   measures of non-military K, both

based on the same data sources employed by Aschauer. One is what she calls

the Ncore infrastructure capital, and it consists of highways, airports,             mass

transit facilities, electric and gas plants, water supply facilities and

sewers; a second measure is more general, and it includes not only the core

infrastructure capital, but also non-military public buildings such as

schools, hospitals, police and fire stations, courthouses, garages and

passenger terminals, and those used in conservation and development. In 1987,

about 63X of the total non-military public capital consisted of core

infrastructure, education, hospital and other buildings constituted about 28%,

and conservation and development structures provided the remaining 9%.
 PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                                       -   Page   8-

        Using 1949-1987 annual data for the US private nonfarto               business sector
 and   the total nonmilitary public capital measure for K, Munnell reports

 estimates of (5) as:

    in Q -   In   L —   4.45   -   l.02'ln   L +    O.64•in K + 0.3l•ln   K1 + 0.66.CU,    (6)
                        (7.3) (4.4)                (4.1)        (3.2)         (5.8)

having an R2 of 0.998, a SER             equal     to 0.0099, and an estimate of the first-

order autocorrelation coefficient equal to 0.74, with a t-statistic of 4.7.

Very similar results were obtained when the K1 measure was confined to the

core infrastructure capital. Specifically, Munnell reports estimates as:
    in Q -   in   L —   4.37   -   1.06•ln   L +   0.62•ln K + 0.37•ln    Ki + 0.68•CU     (7)
                        (6.9) (4.5)                (4.0)        (3.9)         (5.8)
with an K2 of 0.998, SER           —   0.0096 and an estimate of p — 0.67, with a t-
statistic    of 3.9. Hence the two estimates of the elasticity of output (or,

average labor productivity) with respect to K1 range from 0.31 to 0.37, very

close to the 0.36 estimate reported by Aschauer. Although point estimates of

returns to scale over all inputs are 0.92 for the more inclusive measure of
                                                                                                 K1
and 0.93 for core infrastructure, the null hypothesis of constant returns to

scale is not rejected at usual significance levels. The implied elasticities

of output with respect to labor input in (6) and (7) are -0.02 and -0.06,

respectively, while those with respect to private capital input are 0.64 and

0.62; the negative values for the labor elasticity are of course unreasonable,

and the relatively large value for the private capital output elasticities is

at sharp variance with conventional wisdom.

       More reasonable results are obtained in Munnell [1990b], where the

underlying data are pooled cross-section annual time series for the 48

continental states over the 1970-1988 time period. The Ki data is "core

infrastructure" state and local capital and it includes cumulated and

depreciated government capital outlays defined as direct expenditures for the
 PU5LIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                                             Page 9 -

construction   of buildings, roads and other improvements, including additions,

replacements, and major alterations to fixed works and structures, whether

contracted privately or built directly by the government; these outlays

encompass highways, sewage and water supply facilities, but exclude all

federal government, and in particular, all military expenditures.

        Munnell estimates an equation similar to (6) with the state's

unemployment rate replacing the CU variable and with the dependent variable

being in Q rather than in Q -         in   L:

        in Q — d0 +   d1.in   L +   d2•in                                     v,
                                            K., +     d3•in   Ki + d4•UN +                      (8)
and with the three alternative returns to scale specifications. In the

unrestricted version analogous to (4), returns to scale are equal to d1 + d2 +

d3.    Munnell reports OLS estimates of the unrestricted equation as follows:

       in Q — 5.75 + 0.59•in L +      0.3l•ln           + O.15•ln K - 0.007UN                   (9)
             (39.7) (43.2)       (30.1)                  (9.0)               (4.7)

where t-statistics are in parentheses; the R2 is 0.993, and the standard error

of the regression is 0.088. The implied elasticity of output with respect to

infrastructure capital is 0.15, which is positive and statistically

significant, but is considerably smaller than the 0.31 .                 0.39 estimates
reported in the studies by Munnell (1990a] and Aschauer (1989J discussed

above, each of which employed national data. Note that the estimated returns

to scale from this model are 0.59 +             0.31 + 0.15 — 1.05, which implies
increasing returns to scale. When Meade's "atmosphere" returns to scale

restrictions are imposed (d1 + d2 —             1),   the fit is only marginally affected

(the R2 fails to 0.992 and the SER increases to 0.090), but when Meade's

"unpaid factor" returns to scale constraints are introduced (d1 + d2 +    —
                                                                       d3
1),   the goodness of fit declines considerably (the R2 is 0.990, but the SER

increases to 0.102). Munneil reports similar findings when the infrastructure

                                                                          Page 10 -



capital   is disaggregated into stock of highways, stock of water and sewer

systems, and stock of other state and local public capital (primarily

buildings). Finally, the value of the elasticity of output with respect to

labor input (0.59) relative to that with respect to private capital (0.31) is

more in line with the conventional wisdom, although the 0.59/0.31 ratio is

still less than 3:1.

      One implication of the use of the Cobb-Douglas functional form in these

studies is that the L, Ki and 5 inputs are assumed to be substitutable

inputs, implying that increases in Kj are by assumption specified to increase

the average and marginal productivity of the labor and private capital inputs.

In an effort to gain more information about substitutability relationships

among inputs, Munnell estimated parameters of a translog production function,

a functional form more general than the Cobb-Douglas. Although she does not

report estimates of substitution elasticities, she interprets OLS parameter

estimates of the translog model as implying that 5 and L are strongly

substitutable inputs, that 5 and Ki are weakly substitutable, and that Ki and

L are complementary (although the relationship is not statistically

significant).

      The studies by Aschauer and Munnell generate provocative and intriguing

findings, but they suffer from a number of serious drawbacks. First, in the

literature on cost and production, the highly restrictive Cobb-Douglas

functional form is hardly ever employed anymore, and instead more flexible

functional forms are used. Second, there is a serious issue of what is

endogenous and what is exogenous, and the extent to which the production

function estimates -   - Cobb-Douglas or translog - -   suffer   from a simultaneous

equations bias. Specifically, the right-hand variables in the various

equations estimated by Aschauer and Munnell include measures of labor input

                                                                       Fag.   11 -


(hours paid) and utilization (either capacity utilization or state

unemployment rate), and strong arguments have been made that in this type            of a
context such variables should be treated as endogenous, not exogenous; in such

a case estimation by OLS   produces   biased and inconsistent parameter

estimates.7 Third and finally, although this approach provides one measure of

the impact of Ki on private sector costs and productivity, it does not provide

a framework in which one can begin to assess whether the amount of K is

insufficient or excessive.

      A more appropriate approach, we believe, is to follow developments of

the last two decades in modern duality theory and to specify a variable cost

function dual to a production function -    -a   cost function that reflects the

optimizing behavior of individual firms.8 In the present context, for

example, one can specify a variable cost function for the private sector in

which firms are envisaged as attempting to produce a given level of output at

minimum private variable cost, conditional on quantities of fixed inputs such

as Kj and perhaps K.1,, where private variable costs include labor, and perhaps

energy and other non-energy intermediate materials. In the next section, we

outline this alternative theoretical framework, and show how it permits us to

measure benefits of public infrastructure capital, or more precisely, how to

obtain measures of the shadow value of this capital.



III. An Alternative Theoretical Framework

      In the economic theory of cost and production, the notion of a

production function plays a central role. Essentially, a production function

is an engineering notion revealing the maximum possible output Q that can be

produced within a time period, given quantities of the inputs x1, x2,...,x.

A useful way of viewing the production function relationship is to think of it
 PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                       -
                                                                   Page 12 -



as a book whose pages contain alternative blueprint designs for combining

 inputs to produce output level Q. Clearly, the production function and the

book of blueprints must be consistent with laws of nature and other

engineering relationships. While laws of nature are by definition stable and

do not change over time, our understanding and discovery of these laws, as

well as our ability to exploit technological possibilities, has improved with

time. One way of accounting for such advances in the state of technical

knowledge, therefore, is to think of them as adding new pages to the book of

blueprints. For such reasons, often a time counter variable "t" is included

in the production function relationship.

      Economic content can be added to the notion of a production function if

one assumes that firms optimize. In particular, assume that the prices of

inputs purchased by the firm are given (call these prices p), and that

conditional on the level of output Q and other environmental factors beyond

the firm's control, called Z (including the state of technical knowledge t,

but also other variables), firms choose quantities of the inputs so as to

minimize the private costs of producing output Q. Given standard continuity

and regularity conditions on the production function, according to modern

duality theory there exists a cost function dual to the production function,

having the general form

            C —   g(Q,p,Z)                                                  (10)

where C is the total private cost of purchasing the input quantities xj at

prices Pj. The dual cost function is increasing in Q and in p, and is

homogeneous of degree one in p.

      When private firms optimize, they take into account the environment in

which they operate. One of these environmental variables is the state of

technical knowledge, which, although typically exogenous to the firm, affects
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTUR! CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                               -
                                                                          Page 13 -



its    production possibilities. Another environmental variable affecting

production relationships but exogenous to the firm is the amount of available

public infrastructure capital Ki. Since both the t and Ki variables affect

the production function, they also influence cost relationships. It is

therefore useful to specialize the Z inputs in the dual cost function (10) and

to re-write it as

                C —     g(Q,p,Kj,t).                                              (11)

        Among the n inputs, it is often the case that some inputs (such as

private capital stocks of structures and equipment) are fixed in the short-

run,   while   other inputs (labor hours, energy, non-energy intermediate

materials) are variable. In this case, in the short-run firms optimize by

choosing those quantities of variable inputs that minimize total variable

input costs C,,, given Q,          Pv' Xj, t   K.?, where K is the private firm's

capital stock, p.,, is the set of input prices for the variable inputs, and C,,

is the sum     of short-run    costs over the variable inputs. Following I'aul A.

Samuelson (1953], one can specify a short-run or variable private cost

function, written as

               C,,, —
                        h(Q.PvKpKi.t).                                           (12)

        A concept that will be of particular use to us in this paper is the

notion of the shadow value of the public infrastructure capital stock Kj.

Holding other things fixed, one can assess the impact on the private firm's

costs of there being an exogenous increase in the amount of available public

infrastructure capital, i.e., one can compute the marginal benefits to the

private sector (in terms of reduced costs) of there being an increase in K1.

For the total private cost function (11), define the shadow value of

infrastructure capital B as

               B1 —     - ÔC/aKj   > 0,                                          (13)
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                                  -
                                                                             Page 14 -



and for the variable private cost function (12), define the corresponding

shadow value Bj as

                vi — - ac,/aKi > 0.                                                  (14)

          For the private sector firm     minimizing   short-run variable costs, there

is also a shadow value relationship involving its private capital stock.

Accordingly, define the shadow value of private capital B as

                    —   - 8Cj/ôKp > 0.                                               (15)

If the    private   sector firm were in long-run equilibrium with respect to its

private inputs, then the marginal benefits of K would just equal its marginal

costs. Call the ex ante one-period price of private capital PK. Then at

this long-run equilbrium point, the optimal amount of private sector capital

K;
     is   that amount at which marginal benefits equal marginal costs, i.e..

                    — K; <—>      — PK.                                              (16)
          Factors affecting the optimal provision of public (rather than private)

infrastructure capital }( are more complex, and may involve normative issues

of equity; for a discussion of issues underlying the optimal amount of public

goods, see the chapters of modern public finance textbooks, such as that by

Joseph Stiglitz [1986}. In the case of pure public goods, one could define

total marginal benefits of Kj capital as the sum           of   the L,i shadow values over

all private sector firms, plus the sum         of   corresponding marginal benefits over

all final consumers; call this social or total marginal benefit of K1 capital

B5. Alternatively, if there is no congestion in the consumption of public

goods, the total marginal benefit could be the largest benefit accruing to any

one or set of consumers, rather than the sum           over all consumers. One rather
simple notion of the optimal provision of Ki capital is that amount of

infrastructure capital 4        for   which social marginal benefits Bj just equal

                                                                          Page 15 -



marginal   costs P1(1, where PKi is the one-period social price of public

infrastructure capital Kj, i.e.,

              Ki—4<—>8i8—PKi.                                                     (17)

        One other result from duality theory will also be of importance to us.

By assumption, private sector firms choose quantities of variable inputs so as

to minimize private variable costs, given the constraints expressed in (12).

It turns out that the optimal, variable cost-minimizing quantities of the

variable inputs 4     simply   equal the derivative of (12) with respect to

i.e.,

              4   —                                                               (18)

This empirically useful result is typically known       as   Shephard's Lemma; for a

discussion end derivation, see W. Erwin Diewert (1974J.

        In order to implement this theory of cost and production empirically,

and to estimate shadow values of private and public capital in Sweden, we must

gather appropriate data and specify mathematical functions for the cost

functions (11) and (12). To this we now turn our attention.



IV.     Data and Econometric Inrnlementation

        The production and input data used in this study consist of prices and

quantities for variable inputs (labor -      L,   energy - E, non-energy materials -

14),quantity estimates of the private sector capital stock K. and the public

infrastructure capital stock Ki, ex ante one-period or rental prices for

private (P5) and public infrastructure (P1(j) capital, and output quantity Q.

        For this initial empirical analysis, we have employed data at two levels

of aggregation. First, for the private business sector, the measure of output

Q is value-added in constant 1985 prices; in this case, L is the only variable,

input. For the manufacturing sector, we also compute as a measure of output a
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                          -
                                                                     Page 16 -



gross output series (sales plus net changes in inventories, adjusted for
inflation). When output is value added, the only variable input is L, and

with gross output, the variable inputs are L, E, M, and, in some cases, K.

      For both the private business and the manufacturing sectors, the labor

quantity measure L is total hours worked, while P1 is total compensation to

employees plus employers' contributions to social security, all divided by L;

further details on data sources and construction procedures for the labor data

are given in Hansson (l99lc].

      For manufacturing, the energy quantity index E is a Divisia quantity

index covering 18 different types of energy (mineral coal, coke, charcoal,

fuel wood, other types of fuel wood, propane and butane gas, petrol, paraffin

oil, diesel oil, four types of heating oils, town gas, and electricity). The

aggregate energy price index is then computed as total energy costs divided by

E. Non-energy intermediate materials are total intermediate materials minus

energy; total payments to non-energy intermediate materials in current and

constant currencies are computed by reversing the double deflation procedure

involving value-added and gross output. Further details on the E and M data

for the manufacturing sector are provided in Iiannson [l991c).

      Aggregate capital input for the private sector       is computed as a

Divisia quantity index of machinery and buildings stocks, with the share

weights employing ex ante rental prices of capital, calculated according to

the formula wk —   q(r +   6k)'   where   is the investment deflator for the kth

capital good, r is the five-year government bond yield, and          is the constant

rate of depreciation for the kth type of capital asset. Note that at this

stage of our research, corporate taxes are not included in the rental price

measure.9 Capital stocks for buildings and machinery are computed separately

using the perpetual inventory method, with depreciation rates set to equal

                                                                        Page 17   -




those reported by Hulten and Wykoff [1980,1981).b0 For the manufacturing

sector, gross investment series are available back to 1870, but for the entire

private business sector'1, consistent series are available only since 1950.

For the non-manufacturing sectors, 1950 benchmark capital stocks are computed

separately by sector, calculated as a number no larger than 1/6k) times the

average investments for the first three years in the 1950's. The aggregate

rental price P5 is computed as total expenditures on private capital divided

by the Divisia quantity index 5.       Further   details on the construction of the

aggregate 5 and P5 are found in Hansson (1991cJ.
       Aggregate public infrastructure capital Ki is computed as a Divisia

quantity index of machinery and building stocks, with share weights reflecting

cx   ante   rental prices as noted above; in particular, the government bond yield

is employed as the measure of r. The core public infrastructure capital stock

includes streets, roads and highways (central and local governments), mass

transit, airports, sewers and water systems, railroads and electric

facilities. Depreciation rates for individual asset types in the public

sector were set to the same value as in the private sector, except that road

maintenance was depreciated at 25% per annum. The 1960-88 time series of Kj

is presented in Table A-i in the appendix to this paper.

       In 1960 (1988), the aggregate public infrastructure capital stock in

Sweden consisted of the following sector-specific distribution: electricity

generation and distribution, 40.8% (49.2)1; water systems and sewers, 4.1%

(7.5%); railway transport, 34.6% (20.6%); urban, suburban and interurban

passenger transport, 3.3% (3.1%); air transport, 1.4% (3.4%); streets, roads

and highways, 15.7% (16.1%). Since the electricity share is so large, and

since private sector consumers purchase electricity services, we have

constructed an alternative measure of the aggregate public infrastructure

                                                                        Page 18 -



capital      stock that excludes the electricity generation and distribution

sector. The 1960-88 time series of Ki excluding electricity is also given in

Table A-i in the appendix to this paper.

         In terms of econometric implementation, our immediate task is to specify

functional forms for the variable cost functions such as (11) and (12). The

specifications we employ differ depending on the measure of output employed.

In particular, when value-added is the measure of output (as it is in the case

of the private business sector), the only variable input is labor, and in this

case the variable cost function reduces to an input requirement function

relating labor input to Q, K. K, and t. However, when gross output is used

as the measure of output (it and value-added are alternative measures of

output in the manufacturing sector), the variable cost function becomes more

complex, incorporating not only Q, 5,       Kj   and t, but also prices of the

variable inputs.

         We begin with the specification for value-added output. One convenient

functional form for the labor input requirement function is the following,

analogous to that considered in Hansson [1991aJ (the corresponding variable

cost function is simply obtained by multiplying both sides by PL):


         L —      + flQQ + tQtQ +        + K + jKi + QKQ
             + jQKj•Q +             +            + .5'fl11K/Q.                   (19)




For estimation, to avoid potential problems with heteroskedasticity, it is

useful to divide both sides of (19) by Q, thereby having L/Q as the dependent

variable in the estimation equation. Note that with this functional form, no

constraints are placed on long-run returns to scale. However, if one sets

—        —       — iQ — 0,   then there are long-run constant returns to scale over
    QQ
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                                  -   Page   19 -


all   private and public inputs (Meade's unpaid factors model), and if one

instead sets L —             — pq — Ppi — 0,      long-run constant returns to scale

occur for the private inputs (Meade's atmosphere model).

        One convenient feature of the specification in (19) is that, using the

marginal benefit equal marginal cost conditions in (16) and (18), one can

solve for optimal amounts of 4 and 4, provided that in the latter case

one restricts benefits to those accruing to the private business sector (and

excludes those infrastructure benefits enjoyed by final demand consumers).

These optimal capital stock levels turn out to be

        In the econometric implementation, an additive disturbance term is

appended to the L/Q equation based on (19), and it is assumed to be

independently and identically normally distributed. However, since Q could

possibly be jointly determined with L/Q, a Hausman specification test will be

undertaken to test for the correlation of the various transformations of Q

with the equation disturbance term)2

        For the manufacturing sector, when value-added is the measure of output

we employ the same specification as for the private business sector, i.e.. the
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                                 -
                                                                            Page 20 -



L/Q version of (19), However, when the gross output measure is employed in
manufacturing, inputs other than L are variable. In this case, several

specifactions are available.

         One possibility, in the tradition of Dale W. Jorgenson [1986], is to

treat all the L, E, M and K inputs as variable, as in (11). Letting Q now be

gross output rather than value-added, following Hansson [199la) one can

specify the total (private) cost function to have the following normalized

general Leontief form, where — PK. +             + E + PM and TC PKK + PLL + PEE

Using Shephard's Lemma as expressed in (18), we can derive cost-minimizing

demands for the jth input, simply by differentiating (22) with respect to Pj.

This gives us four demand equations --         for   L, E, M and K. As an example, for

IL1, the cost-minimizing demand equation consistent with the total cost function

(22) is

Demand equations for L, E and M can be derived analogously.

         For econometric implementation, an additive disturbance term is appended

to each of the five equations (the cost function (22), the demand equation for

private    capital (23), and corresponding demand equations for L, E and H), and

the resulting disturbance vector is assumed to be independently and

identically multivariate normally distributed, with mean vector zero and

constant covariance matrix 0. Estimation can be carried out using the method

of maximum likelihood, with appropriate cross-equation parameter restrictions

imposed.

      Note also that with this (private) cost total function (22), one can

compute the shadow value using (13); in this case, however, the benefits of

infrastructure capital consist of reduced costs over all the L, E, H and

inputs, not just over the L input as was the case in the value-added model

considered earlier.

      Moreover, since energy demands are explicitly incorporated, to avoid

double-counting it is appropriate that the infrastructure capital stock                          be

re-defined in this gross output model as the previous core infrastructure

capital minus the electricity generation and distribution capital.



V.    Results: The Private Business Sector in Sweden

      We begin by reporting results when the Cobb-Douglas functional forms of

Aschauer and Munnell are employed, but with annual Swedish data for l964-88)

With no constraints placed on returns to scale, use of Aschauer's equation (2)

and 1964-88 annual data for Sweden resulted in the following estimated model:

      in Q -    in       —   -9.111 +   l.072•ln   L -    l.6661n    +    i.60l•in Kj          (25)

                     +   O.031•in CU + O.021•t                R2 — 0.979, SER     —   0.0151

where numbers in parentheses are absolute values of t-statistics. Note that

although the 1.601 coefficient on in                is positive and statistically

significant, it implies an elasticity of output with respect to Ki greater
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                                           -   Page   22 -


than   unity --   hardly      a credible result; the estimate of the labor elasticity

is also greater than unity, although its 1.072 value is considerably smaller.

Moreover, the -1.666 coefficient on In K implies a negative marginal product

for K capital, since the implicit estimated elasticity of output with respect

to K is -0.666. Finally, the estimated overall returns to scale consistent

with this Aschauer-type equation is 2.010 (1.072 -                   1.666 + 1.601 +     1),   which

is not a plausible result. We conclude that estimating a Cobb-Douglas

production function equation as Aschauer did but using Swedish data results in

an equation that does not make much sense, even though the estimated

coefficient on ln K is positive and statistically significant.14'15

        As we noted in Section II, the Cobb-Douglas functional form used by

Alicia Munneli (1990aJ is related to Aschauer's specification, but it excludes

the time variable. Based on Swedish private business sector annual data from

1964 through 1988, we obtained the following OLS equation:'6

        in Q -    in L   —    -4.298   -   0.596•ln   L +   0.369•ln K + 0.687•ln      K1      (26)
                              (1.21) (2.58)                 (3.71)       (3.12)

                         +   0.075•ln      CU          R2 — 0.995,     SER —   0.019
                             (4.21)                    DW — 0.874

Here the implied elasticity of output with respect to infrastructure capital

is smaller than above but still very large (0.687, and statistically

significant), the elasticity with respect to K is more reasonable at 0.369,

and that with respect to labor (-0.596 + 1 —                    0.404) is somewhat small when
compared to that for labor. The implied overall returns to scale estimate

based on (26) is 1.460; this is not significantly different from unity, for

the restriction of Meade's unpaid factors model is not rejected (x2 test

statistic of 1.92, and a 0.05 critical value of 3.84), nor is the restriction

rejected for Meade's atmosphere model (constant returns to scale for private

inputs only), where the                test statistic is 1.46.17
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                                    -
                                                                               Page 23 -



      We conclude1 therefore, that although results obtained from Munnell's

specification are a vriori more plausible than those resulting from use of

Aschauer's model, the Munnell model implies a very large elasticity of output

with respect to infrastructure capital.18 Moreover, as we noted at the end of

Section III, the Aschauer and Munnell Cobb-Douglas production function

specifications have serious drawbacks, not only in terms of econometric

specification (e.g., they ignore the endogeneity of labor demand), but also by

not taking into account the optimizing behavior of firms. Recent developments

in duality theory have helped overcome these drawbacks.

       We now turn to results obtained when we estimated parameters of a dual

restricted variable cost function, in particular, equation (19) with both

sides divided by Q. Using annual Swedish data from 1960 to 1988, we obtained

the following results:

  L/Q — -0.004 - 0.185E-3•t + 1300.4/Q + 0.539E-7•Q          -                  +   0.289Ki/Q
                                                                 0.137.lc?/Q

                                                -                    -

                   0.431E-6•Kj + 0.267•5Kj/Q2       0.09l.K/Q2            0.676.K/Q2     (27)
  (4.79)           (4.15)      (4.18)               (3.87)                 (2.76)

with an R2 of 0.9995, a SER of 0.00012,and a Durbin-Watson test statistic of

2.146. Since one might argue that this specification could suffer from a

simultaneous equations bias due to Q being endogenous, we performed a Hausrnan

specication test and checked whether the various right-hand variables

involving Q were correlated with the equation disturbance term. The chi-

square test statistic we obtained was 7.52, which is considerably less                  than

the 0.10 (12.0) and 0.05 (14.1) critical values with seven degrees of freedom;

hence we do not reject the null hypothesis that Q is exogenous.19

      In terms of returns to scale specifications, the restrictions implied by

long-run constant returns to scale over all inputs (Meade's unpaid factors

model) are decisively rejected (the x2 test statistic is 93.60, while the 0.05
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                         -
                                                                    Page 24 -



critical   value with four restrictions is 9.49), as are the restrictions

implied by long-run constant returns to scale over private inputs only (the

test statistic is 109.93, and a 0.05 critical value of 9.49).

      As is seen in (27), the L/Q input-output coefficient is affected by 5

and K in a nonlinear fashion. We have computed the short-run elasticity of

demand for private labor with respect to private capital, and with respect to

public capital, that are implied by these parameter estimates. These short-

run elasticity estimates vary considerably over the sample, even in sign. All

that can be said in general is that during the 1960's and late 1980's, private

labor and private capital were short-run substitutable inputs (the estimated

elasticity of L with respect 5 was negative), while private labor and public

capital were short-run complementary inputs (the estimated elasticity of L

with respect to K was positive);20 during the 1970's and up to the mid

1980's, the signs were reversed.

      Of particular interest to us is the calculation of the optimal private

and optimal public infrastructure capital stocks implied by equating the

estimated shadow values (marginal benefits) of these stocks to their ex ante

rental prices, as formulated in equations (16), (17), (20) and (21). We have

computed these optimal capital stocks, and have then calculated the ratio of

the optimal capital stock K* to the actual capital stock K, by year for 5 and

for Kj. Results of this calculation are presented in Table 2 below.

      Before discussing these estimates, we believe it useful to remind

readers that in the case of the public infrastructure capital Kj, use of (17)

and (21) implies that the optimal amount of Ku called 4, is that amount

that can be rationalized given that benefits (in terms of reduced labor Costs)

accrue only to the private business sector. To the extent that benefits

computed in this way are understated (since any benefits to final consumers

                                                                          Page 25 -

understated. Moreover, since the optimal private capital stock K;            rises
with decreases in the one-period rental price of private capital PK.            ceteris

taxes are not incorporated into the measure of PK        (and   on this see footnote

9), the ratio of K;   to   Iç is understated. Hence, there is some reason to

believe that both of these ratios are understated. However, if the bias can

plausibly be argued to be relatively constant over time, the time trend in

these ratios can still provide useful information.

       We begin with the ratio of optimal to actual private sector capital

stocks. As is seen in Table 2, this ratio is above unity and increases from
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURZ CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                           -
                                                                      Page 26 -



1960 to 1964, it stays above unity but falls and then increases until 1970,

and then it begins falling more steadily, hitting levels below unity in 1975;

at the end of the time period in 1988, the ratio had fallen to 0.845, implying

that in 1988 the existing capital was underutilized, and that a capital stock

about 15% smaller is all that could be rationalized by the marginal benefit

equal marginal cost condition in the Swedish private business sector.

      For the public infrastructure capital, the ratio of optimal to actual

capital stocks is above unity from 1960 until 1967. it hits a peak of 1.064 in

1964, it falls from 1970 to about 1983, and then rises slightly at the end of

the 1980's, reaching a level of 0.905 in 1988. Hence, if one incorporates as

benefits of K1 only those reduced labor costs accruing to the private business

sector in Sweden, in 1988 the level of K1 was about 9% too large. The extent

of such apparent excess infrastructure capital was falling in the late 1980's,

however, from 13% in 1983 to 9% in 1988, consistent with the widely held view

that, for example, roads and highways were not as well maintained as had been

the case in the 1970's and early 1980's.

      Finally, to assess the effects on private sector productivity growth of

changes in the public infrastructure capital stock, we have undertook several

historical and counterfactual simulations. Specifically, we first computed

"actual" private business sector multifactor productivity (MFP) growth using

historical data on output growth minus growth in aggregate input, where actual

K.1, growth is weighted by the ex ante rental price of capital PK.1,; we call this

actual growth series MFPa.

      Second, to purge from this MFPa series the effects of K not being in

long-run equilibrium, we used the historical data   series   on PK.    L' Q t     and

K1, as well as parameter estimates from (27), to compute optimal private
         *                                                    *          *
capital K; we then calculated the corresponding optimal L given K. Q, t
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                        -
                                                                   Page 27 -



and K1. Finally, we constructed the corresponding aggregate input series over

L* and 4 using the Divisia index procedure, and then we obtained an MFP

series as growth in output minus growth in this long-run equilibrium but

counterfactual aggregate input. We call this private sector equilibrium

productivity series MFPe, reflecting the fact that it simulates private sector

productivity growth had it been in long-run equilibrium. Note that any

differences between MFP5 and MFPe reflect the effects of the private sector

capital stock being out of long-run equilibrium.

      Third, there are several alternative ways by which one might investigate

the effects on private sector MFP of varying growth paths of infrastructure

capital Kj. For example, one could fix for the entire 1960-88 sample the

ratio of K1 to Q from some chosen year (say, 1960. 1974 or 1988), generate a

counterfactual K series given historical growth in Q, calculate private
                         *      *                  8
sector long-run optimal K. and L given this new I(i series, and then

compute the implied rate of MFP growth. While interesting, these results

would vary with choice of the benchmark year (1960, 1974 or 1988), and thus

interpretation would be problematic. This consideration led us to employ as

an alternative K1 series that amount of K1 that could be rationalized by

private business sector cost savings, i.e. we solved (20) and (21) to obtain

4 an   4,   inserted these values into (19) to obtain L*, and then computed

MFP growth as growth in output minus growth in this counterfactual but optimal

aggregate private input; we call this optimal productivity growth series MFP0.

      The results of our calculations are presented in Table 3 below. In the

first row of Table 3, it is seen that the slowdown in actual MFP growth from

1960-73 (an AACR of 4.290%) to 1974-88 (1.188%) was 72.3% ((4.290 -    1.188)
/4.290). From the second row we see that had the private sector capital stock

been in long-run equilibrium in each year, then the slowdown would have been
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                                -
                                                                           Page 28 -



65.2% rather    than 72.3% of 1960-73 actual MFP growth, or 9.8% smaller; thus

9.8% of the slowdown can be Nexplained by private sector capital stock

disequilibrium.

         In the bottom row of Table 3 we report HFP growth had the public

infrastructure capital been optimal (Kj —     4),       as viewed through private

business sector cost savings. There it is seen that had Kj —           4,   then

private sector long-run optimal MFP growth would have been lower from 1960 to

1973 (3.920% vs. 4.290%), it would have been higher from 1974 to 1988 (1.538%

vs. 1.188%), and thus the MFP growth slowdown would have been 60.8%, rather

than the actual 72.3%. The marginal impact of optimal 4, assuming private

sector long-run equilibrium, is to reduce the slowdown by 6.1% ((0.652 -

0.608)/0.723),    and the cumulative impact of private and public sector

disequilibrium is to reduce the private sector MFP growth slowdown by 15.9%

((0.723 -    0.608)/0.723).
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                                         -   Page   29 -


         We   conclude, therefore, that while reduced infrastructure capital
investment      in Sweden since 1974 has contributed to the productivity growth

slowdown in the private business sector, this impact has been rather modest.21

Much of the productivity growth slowdown is apparently still "unexplained",

although Hanssons (l991b) results provide intriguing evidence that reduced

exploitation of scale economies may have played a very prominent role.

         This completes our discussion of empirical results obtained for the

private business sector. We now provide some preliminary, more detailed

evidence using data from one sector within the aggregate private business

sector, namely, the manufacturing sector.



VI.      Results: The Hanufacturin Sector in Sweden

         Using annual 1960-1988 data for the Swedish manufacturing sector only,

we have estimated by ordinary least squares parameters of the labor demand

equation (19), where both sides are divided by value-added output Q. The

results we obtained are as follows:

with an R2 of 0.9995, a SER of 0.000l2,and a Durbin-Watson test statistic of

1.906.

         In terms of returns to scale specifications, the restrictions implied by

long-run constant returns to scale over all inputs (Meade's unpaid factors

model) are also decisively rejected in the manufacturing sector (the                          test

statistic is 78.63, while the 0.05 critical value with four restrictions is

9.49), as are the restrictions implied by long-run constant returns to scale

over private inputs only (the x2 test statistic is 68.54, and a 0.05 critical
value of 9.49).

      We have also computed optimal private and public capital stocks,

assuming that benefits in the form of reduced labor costs accrue only to the

manufacturing sector. Our estimates are given in Table 4 above. A number of

results are worth noting.

      First, somewhat surprisingly, the ratio of optimal to actual private

capital in manufacturing is less than one in all years, with its high value of

0.994 in 1964 and a lowest value of 0.690 in 1988; although there are a few

wiggles in the late 1970's, this ratio falls rather steadily ever since 1970.

These results imply that in the Swedish manufacturing sector, the amount of
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL IN SWEDEN                         -
                                                                    Page 31 -



underutilization   of capital is considerable, and that this underutilization

has increased in the last two decades.

       With respect to public capital, a priori one would expect that if one

computed benefits as reduced labor costs for only the manufacturing sector,

the amount of public capital rationalized by this cost saving would be less

than if benefits included the entire private business sector. Hence, one

would expect the ratio of optimal to actual     viewed from the vantage of the

manufacturing sector to be less than that when assessed from the viewpoint of

the entire private business sector. For the most part, this is what we find.

With the exception of the beginning years in the sample (1960.63), the ratio

of 4   to    is smaller in Table 4 (for manufacturing only) than in Table 2

(for the entire private business sector). As seen in Table 4, in 1988, this

ratio is but 0.760, while in Table 2 it is 0.905; hence the amount of excess

infrastructure capital is about 25% when benefits are confined to the

manufacturing sector, but only 10% when benefits include all components of the

private business sector. While one might question the magnitudes of these

estimated excess supplies of public infrastructure capital (and we certainly

view these estimates with considerable caution), we are heartened that their

relative sizes in the manufacturing and the entire private business sector are

for the most part consistent with prior expectations.

       To this point we have only considered value-added measures of output.

As we noted in Section IV, when gross output becomes the measure of output,

variable inputs include not only L, but also E, M and K.,.   In this case the

benefits of infrastructure capital are larger than simply labor savings, for

they include the entire reduction in variable costs. Recall that in Section

IV we discussed a gross output specification in which all private inputs (L,

E, H and K) were considered variable - -        a   specification we called a total

(private) cost function.

       Using annual manufacturing data for Sweden from 1960 to 1988. we have

estimated by maximum likelihood parameters of the total cost function (22).

the        demand equation (23). and corresponding demand equations for L, 5 and

M. Parameter estimates from this model are reported in Table 5 above.

                                                                     Page 33 -



      Although it is difficult to interpret parameter estimates directly, all
but six of the estimated 28 parameters are larger in absolute value than their

estimated asymptotic standard errors. In terms of returns to scale, the

restrictions corresponding with constant returns to scale over all inputs

(Meade's unpaid factors model) are decisively rejected; the likelihood ratio

test statistic is 85.5. while the 0.01       critical value with seven degreees

of freedom is 18.5; similarly, the null hypothesis of constant returns to

scale over private inputs only is also rejected decisively, for the test

statistic is 139.9, while the 0.01       critical value with twelve degrees of

freedom is 26.2.

      The parameter estimates in Table 5 can be employed to compute various

elasticities and shadow value relationships. In 1975. the approximate mid-

point of the sample, the short-run elasticities of demand for variable inputs

with respect to changes in the quantity of Ki capital are estimated to be

-0.60 for L, 0.02 for M, 1.39 for E and 0.86 for 5. Using (13), we have also

computed the amount of K capital rationalized by the cost savings accruing to

the manufacturing sector, called 4, and divided it by the actual K value;

the ratio of optimal to actual Ki capital is presented in Table 6 below, as

are corresponding ratios for 5 capital, which in this case is assumed to be a

variable input.

      As in seen in Table 6, for the private capital input 5, the ratio of

optimal to actual 5 is on average about unity, and it has a U-shaped tine

trend, above unity at the beginning of the sample, a minimum value of 0.037 in

1978, and then it rises at the end of the sample. This U-shaped pattern

implies of course an autocorrelated residual, which in turn might reflect a

misspecification in treating 5 as a variable rather than a quasi-fixed input.

For public infrastructure capital K1, the time trend of optimal to actual K1

is generally decreasing over time until about 1982, having a high value of

1.025 in 1960, a minimal value of 0.736 in 1982, and then wiggling a bit,

ending up at 0.749 in 1988. For the 1980's, the level of optimal to actual I(

from this total cost gross output model is surprisingly similar to that

obtained using the value added specification (see Table 4); in both cases, the

time trend indicates that viewed from the vantage of cost savings accruing

only to the manufacturing sector, the amount of excess public infrastructure

capital has decreased.

VII.   Concluding Remarks

       Our   purpose   in this paper has been to discuss alternative frameworks for

evaluating and measuring the contribution of public infrastructure capital in

Sweden on private sector output and productivity growth. We have reviewed the

theoretical and empirical models developed by Aschauer and by Munnell, who

have implemented them empirically using U.S. data. In our judgment, these

Cobb-Douglas production function models have a number of serious drawbacks.

When these models are estimated using Swedish data for the entire private

business sector and for the manufacturing sector, we obtain coefficient

estimates on public infrastructure capital that are statistically different

from zero, but do not make much sense.

       We then implemented a number of dual cost function models, and found

that results were more plausible. In particular, although in each of the

Cobb-Douglas production and dual cost function models the constraints of

constant returns to scale over all inputs (Meade's unpaid factors model) are

rejected, as are the restrictions implied by constant returns to scale over

private inputs only (Meade's atmosphere model), we find that increases in

public infrastructure capital, ceteris paribus, reduce private costs. We have

computed that amount of public infrastructure capital that would rationalize

the cost savings incurred by the private business and manufacturing sectors,

and find that the amount that can be rationalized in this manner is less than

what is in fact available in 1988, but that the extent of excess public

infrastructure has been falling in the 1980's.

       In interpreting these findings, we wish to offer several concluding

remarks. First, the benefits we have estimated are those only realized by the

incorporate   the cost and time savings of public infrastructure capital enjoyed

by final consumers. Second, our estimates of the cost of capital need further

work, not only to incorporate the effects of taxes22, but also in assessing

the sensitivity of our findings to alternative choices of the discount rate

for public projects.23 Third, in some preliminary analyses we have not been

able to obtain satisfactory results for a dynamic gross output model in the

manufacturing sector when private capital is a quasi-fixed input; further

research on this type of model could be very useful. Fourth, although our

model is already a bit rich in parameters given the sample size, it would seem

worthwhile investigating whether results could be sharpened when public

infrastructure capital is disaggregated, say, into roads and highways, other

transportation-related infrastructure capital, and all other public

infrastructure capital. Finally, although our analysis has focused on

implications for cost savings to the private sector of changes in public

infrastructure capital stock, we have neglected entirely any discussion of the

optimal pricing of such publicN or NnearpublicR goods; as Clifford Winston

[19911 has recently emphasized, this too is an important and closely related

issue.

sectors has been considered by Ricardo J. Caballero and Richard K. Lyons
[1989].

which indicates that increases in in 1(, ceteris paribus, have a strong and
significant positive impact on multifactor productivity.

7lnterestingiy, although Aschauer considers the simultaneous equations bias
issue, he focuses on the correlation of Kj with the equation disturbance term,
which could occur if current government spending "surprises: affected both Q
and K. Aschauer re-estimates his equations by two-stage least squares using
lagged Ki as an instrument, and finds his results are essentially the same as
those obtained by OLS.

8For a review of recent developments in the econometric implementation of
models of cost and production, see Berndt [1991], especially chapter 9,
"Modeling the Interrelated Demands for Factors of Production: Estimation and
Inference in Equation Systems".

91n private conversations with Jan Sodersten, we have learned that in many
cases, assuming the marginal corporate tax rate is zero may well be a
realistic assumption.

'°For a discussion of measurement issues involved in constructing capital
stocks, see, among others, Berndt [1991), especially chapter 6, section 1,
"Investment and Capital Stock: Definitions and General Framework."

The private business sector is an aggregate of agriculture, mining,
manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail trade, restaurants and
hospitals, parking and leasing, other passenger land transport, freight
transport by road, water transport, supporting services to land transport,
post office services, telecommunications, financial institutions, insurance
and letting of other premises, business services and personal services.

'3The data begin in 1964 rather than 1960 since time series on CU in Sweden
are not available before 1964.

'4The returns to scale restriction in Meade's atmosphere (constant returns to
scale in private inputs K. and L) specification is decisively rejected, for
the x2 test statistic with 1 degree of freedom is 24.1468, much larger than
the critical value at any reasonable level of significance. Similarly.
Meade's unpaid fact2r (constant returns to scale in all inputs) model is also
rejected, for the XL test statistic with 1 degree of freedom is 16.1924, which
also is larger than the critical value at usual significance levels. Finally,
since the Durbin-Watson test statistic was in the inconclusive region, we
estimated this equation using the maximum likelihood procedure with an AR(].)
stochastic disturbance specification. The unsatisfactory results remained.
Specifically, the coefficients (absolute values of t-statistics) on ln L,
ln    and in Kj were, respectively, 0.856 (3.05), -1.402 (4.23) and 1.278
(3.77).

15When  inK1 was excluded entirely as an input, the estimated returns to scale
fell to 0.773.

t6The results we obtained were much more reasonable when In CU was employed
rather than CU.

17w1th in Ki is excluded entirely, the estimated returns to scale fall
drastically to 0.484.

18Results deteriorate further when an AR(l) model is estimated.

19The instruments used in the first-stage regression of 2SLS include in
addition to the constant term, t, K1,, and K1, real gross domestic product in
Europe, real gross domestic product in the US, the 5-year Swedish government
bond yield, total hours worked in the local government sector, and total hours
worked in the central government sector, as well as nonlinear transforms of
these variables.

20Note that these substitutability, complementarity relationships are similar
to those reported by Munneil [l990b], based on the translog production
function.

210ne can also compute the elasticity of private sector multifactor
productivity growth with respect to changes in the stock in public
infrastructure capital; this elasticity varies by year, and in our sample it
ranges from a low of 0.058 in 1960 to a high of 0.171 in 1985; in 1988, the
last year of our sample, this elasticity was 0.149, very similar to the 0.15
elasticity reported by Munnell [1990bJ in her pooled cross-section, time
series estimation using US data by state.

22 this, however, see footnote 9.

23There is a very large literature on this issue. For a recent discussion,
see Robert C. Lind [1982].
