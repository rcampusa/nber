Inflation Expectations and Firm Decisions: New Causal Evidence

                                          ABSTRACT

We use a unique design feature of a survey of Italian firms to study the causal effect of inflation
expectations on firms’ economic decisions. In the survey, a randomly chosen subset of firms is
repeatedly treated with information about recent inflation whereas other firms are not. This
information treatment generates exogenous variation in inflation expectations. We find that
higher inflation expectations on the part of firms leads them to raise their prices, increase demand
for credit, and reduce their employment and capital. However, when policy rates are constrained
by the effective lower bound, demand effects are stronger, leading firms to raise their prices more
and no longer reduce their employment.

       “With nominal short-term interest rates at or close to their effective lower bound in many countries,
       the broader question of how expectations are formed has taken on heightened importance. Under
       such circumstances, many central banks have sought additional ways to stimulate their economies,
       including adopting policies that are directly aimed at influencing expectations of future interest
       rates and inflation.” Janet Yellen (2016)

       “When we are at practically zero nominal rates, the real rates are being driven by the expectation
       of inflation. So lower expectations of inflation imply higher real rates… that’s why we fight negative
       expectations of inflation.” Mario Draghi (2015)

        expectations…” Haruhiko Kuroda (2014)


1      Introduction
Since the onset of the effective lower bound (ELB) on policy interest rates following the start of
the Great Recession, there has been increasing interest among policy-makers and academics in
policies that operate through expectations channels. Mainstream macroeconomic models, in
particular, suggest that policies aimed at raising the inflation expectations of agents should lead to
lower perceived real interest rates, thereby stimulating economic activity through increased
demand for both durable and non-durable goods. Unconventional policies such as forward
guidance and quantitative easing were in part motivated by the desire of central banks to raise
inflation expectations. More generally, the fact that most economic decisions are forward-looking
implies that changes in the expectations of households and firms about the future should exert
immediate effects on their economic behavior. However, the endogeneity of economic
expectations has made testing this channel a challenge.
       In this paper, we report new empirical evidence on how changes in inflation expectations
affect economic decisions using persistent and exogenously generated variation in the expectations of
firms in Italy. In a quarterly survey of firms that has been running since 1999, the Bank of Italy
introduced an information treatment in 2012 to a randomly selected subset of the panel of firms
participating in the survey. These firms continued to receive this treatment for years thereafter. The
treatment was to provide selected firms with recent and publicly available information about actual
inflation in the Italian economy at the time of the survey, immediately prior to asking them about their
inflation expectations. A control group was, in contrast, not provided with any information about
recent inflation over the same time period. We show that this information treatment led to large and
persistent differences in the inflation expectations of treated firms relative to those in the control


                                                                                                           1
group. These exogenous and time-varying differences in expectations serve as a powerful instrument
to characterize the effect of expectations on firms’ decisions.
        Exploiting this instrumental variable strategy, we document that higher inflation expectations
on the part of firms translate into their economic decisions. When using the full sample period we
find that firms with higher inflation expectations raise their prices somewhat and reduce both their
employment and capital relative to firms with lower inflation expectations. The economic magnitudes
involved for the employment and investment decisions are large, and declines in employment occur
disproportionately among blue-collar and temporary workers. Consistent with higher prices and fewer
inputs, sales decline when firms raise their inflation expectations. These responses appear to reflect a
stagflationary view of inflation among Italian firms, as they tend to perceive higher inflation as being
associated with worse macroeconomic conditions and lower demand for their firms, a perception
which is largely consistent with the historical experience. Changes in inflation expectations also affect
the financing decisions of firms. When firms raise their inflation expectations, they tend to utilize
more of their credit lines and apply for loans with new financial institutions, which reflects fears of
reduced access to funds in the future, and they also increase their leverage and slightly reduce their
liquidity. When focusing solely on the ELB period, the effects of inflation expectations on prices and
credit utilization are stronger, while the effects on employment disappear. This is consistent with firms
perceiving a stronger demand-side channel of inflation at the ELB, a feature we confirm using their
expectations of other economic variables. This mechanism is in line with the predictions of New
Keynesian models at the ELB (e.g. Woodford 2011).
        Strikingly, we document that firms in the treatment group ultimately earn modestly higher
profit shares than firms in the control group, even though no such difference was present prior to the
treatment period. The rise in profits is consistent with the fact that the provision of information about
inflation helped firms make better decisions but the fact that the rise in profits is relatively small helps
explain why most firms were choosing not to track this publicly available information in the first
place. We interpret this finding as providing direct evidence for rational inattention models (Sims
2003, Mackowiak and Wiederholt 2009, Afrouzi 2016).
        Our results build on a growing literature studying how inflation expectations of economic
agents relate to their decisions. Much of this work has focused on households, in part due to the greater
availability of household surveys reporting inflation expectations. For example, Bachmann et al.
(2015) find little correlation between households’ inflation expectations and their desired

                                                                                                          2
consumption levels using the Michigan Survey of Consumers, but subsequent works have found
stronger and positive correlations between expectations and consumption using the New York Fed’s
Survey of Consumer Expectations (Crump et al. 2015), a German survey of households (Dräger and
Nghiem 2016), and a broader cross-section of European households (Duca, Kenny, and Reuter 2017).
         This literature, however, has faced two sources of difficulty. One is the endogeneity of
agents’ economic expectations and the absence of clear sources of identifying variation to make
causal statements. 1 The other is the lack of quantitative information on the macroeconomic
expectations of firms, thereby restricting much of the literature to expectations of households.2 Both
issues are tackled in Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Kumar (2018, henceforth CGK), who use an
experimental design in a quantitative survey of firms in New Zealand to assess how exogenous
variation in inflation expectations of managers from an information treatment affects their
subsequent choices over prices, wages, employment and investment. While closely related, the
approach taken in this paper has a number of important advantages relative to this prior work. First,
the breadth and duration of the Italian survey and information treatment are significantly larger.
Whereas CGK have a single information treatment and a single follow-up survey to measure ex-post
outcomes, the quarterly survey in Italy has a large panel of firms to whom the treatment is repeatedly
applied over the course of more than six years. Since the treatment varies over time due to changes
in the level of actual inflation, this delivers much more powerful identification. Second, we can
characterize how expectations affect economic decisions over different time horizons and the results
indicate that the effects of changing inflation expectations may take time to translate into actions.
Third, the Italian survey also covers large firms (a quarter of firms in the survey have more than 500
employees) while CGK’s survey in New Zealand had very few firms of more than 500 employees.
Fourth, the Italian survey has questions about why firms plan to change their own prices which, when
combined with questions about aggregate and firm-level economic outlooks, can help understand
the channels underlying the causal effects of inflation expectations. Fifth, we can merge survey

1
  One notable exception to this in the literature on consumption and inflation expectations is D’Acunto, Hoang, and
Weber (2016). They exploit the rise in expected inflation associated with the anticipation of VAT changes in Germany
as an exogenous source of variation in inflation expectations relative to households in neighboring countries that did
not have this policy change. Another is Coibion, Georgarakos, Gorodnichenko, and van Rooij (2019), who apply
information treatments to a randomly selected subset of surveyed households in the Netherlands and study how the
resulting exogenous variation in inflation expectations affects spending decisions.

  There are several notable papers on the expectations of firms. Gennaioli, Ma and Shleifer (2015) show that CFOs’
expectations of earnings growth are highly predictive of their firms’ investment plans and ex-post investment levels.
Frache and Lluberas (2017) study the quantitative inflation expectations of firms in Uruguay. Boneva et al. (2016)
study firms’ pricing expectations in the U.K.

                                                                                                                    3
responses with administrative data to not only validate survey responses but also study treatment
effects for a wide range of outcome variables. Finally, New Zealand avoided deflation and the ELB
on nominal policy rates and one may be concerned that the effects of firms’ inflation expectations
could be different at the ELB period. Because the sample period for the Italian survey includes an
ELB period, we can provide direct answers as to how central banks’ attempts to raise inflation
expectations influence the behavior of firms and, more generally, the macroeconomy.
       Our paper is also closely related to recent work utilizing the same survey data. For example,
Conflitti and Zizza (2018) study how inflation expectations of respondents in the Italian survey of
firms respond to exogenous changes in wages arising from contract renewals. Bartiloro, Bottone,
and Rosolia (2017) study how the cross-sectional variation in inflation expectations of firms
depends on observable characteristics of firms and the availability of information. Using the
randomized provision of information to firms, they assess whether the weight assigned to new
information varies over time. Bottone and Rosolia (2019) study how Italian firms respond to
monetary policy shocks. Relative to these papers, we provide causal evidence on how exogenous
changes in inflation expectations affect the decisions of Italian firms.
       This paper complements a growing literature which utilizes random control trial methods to
characterize how information affects agents’ macroeconomic expectations. Binder and Rodrigue
(2018) and Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Weber (2019) are recent examples using U.S. households’
expectations of inflation, Roth and Wohlfart (2018) do so with expectations of the real economy,
while Armona, Fuster and Zafar (2017) apply this approach to house price expectations. Experiments
on firms are less frequent. Besides CGK, Hunziker, Raggi, Rosenblatt-Wisch and Zanetti (2018)
assess how Swiss firms’ long-term inflation expectations change under various types of information
treatments. Coibion, Gorodnichenko, Kumar and Ryngaert (2018) study how first and higher order
beliefs of firms in New Zealand respond to different information treatments and how these affect
firms’ subsequent decisions. The experiment among Italian firms is similar in spirit to this prior work
but differs significantly in its repeated nature and the fact that external data on firms’ actions is
brought to bear to study how their decisions are impacted by their beliefs.
       Our results speak directly to whether policies that operate primarily through expectations
channels can be effective. Providing exogenous information to firms clearly induces changes not just
in their beliefs but also in their economic behavior, which supports the idea that policy-makers can
affect economic outcomes through shaping agents’ expectations of the future (see e.g. Wiederholt

                                                                                                     4
(2015) for a model in which central banks communicate to rationally inattentive agents). These
expectations channels can be important not just for monetary policy (e.g. forward guidance) but also
for fiscal policies, as exemplified in recent discussion of anticipated VAT changes (D’Acunto,
Hoang, and Weber 2016). Furthermore, because the European Central Bank (ECB) was facing the
effective lower bound on interest rates during a sub-period of our analysis, our results speak directly
to the expectations channel precisely in the circumstances when that channel is expected to be most
relevant for policymakers. In particular, we find that firms interpret higher inflation during the ELB
as being associated with much stronger demand side effects than outside the ELB period and change
their behavior outside and inside the ELB, much as standard models would predict when nominal
interest rates do not offset changes in expected inflation (Woodford 2011).


2     Data Description
We pool together four different sources of information to characterize how inflation expectations
affect the economic decisions of firms. The first is the Survey on Inflation and Growth Expectations
(SIGE, henceforth), which allows us to measure expectations and some firm decisions. The SIGE is
also the source of the randomized information treatment that serves to generate exogenous variation
in inflation expectations. Second, we match the SIGE with the Italian Central Credit Registry (CCR,
henceforth), which is an information system operated by the Bank of Italy that collects data supplied
by banks and financial companies on credit granted to customers and also other information. The
third data source comes from the Italian National Social Security Institute (INPS, henceforth), which
provides information on employment and wages at the firm level. Finally, we match the SIGE with
the Company Accounts Data Service (CADS, henceforth), which contains balance sheet information
on Italian limited liabilities firms. The latter allows us to measure profits, investment, liquidity,
leverage and other financial characteristics of the firms. We discuss each of these in turn.


2.1     The Survey on Inflation and Growth Expectations
The SIGE is a quarterly business survey run since December 1999 by the Bank of Italy. 3 The
reference universe consists of firms operating in industry excluding construction and non-financial
private services4 with administrative headquarters in Italy and employing 50 or more workers. Since


3
 Until October 2018 the survey was conducted jointly with the newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore.

 The following are excluded from the survey: financial intermediaries and insurance companies, general government
and the educational and healthcare sectors as well as other community, social and personal services.

                                                                                                               5
the first quarter of 2013, construction firms with at least 50 employees have been added. The sample
is stratified by sector of economic activity (industry, non-financial private services and construction),
geographical area (North-West, North-East, Centre, South and Islands) and number of employees
(50-199, 200-999, 1000 and over). In recent years, each wave has about 1,000 firms (400 in industry
excluding construction, 400 in non-financial private services and 200 in construction). Over the
years, about 2,000 firms have participated in the survey. The list of firms used to extract the sample
is drawn from the Bureau Van Dijk’s Aida database and is updated on average every five years.
Sampling weights are provided to ensure that the distribution of firms (in terms of employment) in
the sample represents the distribution of firms in the population.
        The survey is carried out by a specialist firm that distributes the questionnaire to company
managers who are best informed about the topics covered in the survey. About 90 percent of the data
is collected through computer assisted web interviews in the form of an online questionnaire
featuring a purpose-designed interface, while the remaining 10 percent are collected through
computer assisted telephone interviews. Data are collected in the first three weeks of March, June,
September and December. The response rate is about 45 percent on average.
        The purpose of the survey is to obtain information on firms’ expectations concerning
inflation, the general economic situation, own-product prices and demand, investment and
employment. Most of the data—with the exception of own-product prices changes (past and
expected), inflation expectations and current number of employees—are qualitative and relate to
firms’ assessments about their own business activity as well as about macroeconomic matters in
the reference quarter and looking ahead. The qualitative questions in the questionnaire typically
have three or more possible answers (for example: worse, the same, better). Most of the questions
are repeated throughout the various waves. On occasion, the survey contains questions on specific
aspects of the economy that warrant further investigation. A typical questionnaire is presented in
Appendix 1. More information about the survey is provided in Grasso and Ropele (2018).
Descriptive statistics are provided in the Appendix.


2.2     Central Credit Register (CCR)
The CCR is an information system managed by the Bank of Italy that collects information on
lending activity of financial intermediaries (banks, other financial intermediaries, special purpose
vehicles) that operate in Italy. It contains monthly detailed information on all individual loans

                                                                                                       6
granted by financial intermediaries to borrowers for which the overall exposure is above 75,000
euros towards a single intermediary (this threshold was lowered to 30,000 in January 2009).5
Loans are divided into three broad categories: overdraft loans (uncommitted credit lines), term
loans (these include leasing, mortgages and committed credit lines), loans backed by receivables.
In the present analysis we focus on the utilization rate of overdraft loans as this category of credit
should be less contaminated by supply-side variation.6
         From the CCR we also retrieve information on the number of loan applications as an
alternative measure of credit demand. The CCR keeps track of the requests advanced by
intermediaries to obtain preliminary information (“servizio di prima informazione”) about the
credit position of a potential borrower. Banks use this service only when the borrowing request
originates from a new applicant, as the CCR regularly updates banks with information on the
overall credit position of their existing clients. The preliminary information request can be
precisely identified as an actual loan application because the bank lodging the inquiry has to report
the reason for the request.


2.3      Data from the National Social Security Institute (INPS)
The Italian Social Security Institute INPS regularly compiles data archives on the national social
security system and more generally on welfare-related issues by collecting administrative
information that employers, operating in the private non-agricultural sectors, have to provide in
order to pay pension contributions to their employees. Among other things, for each worker the
employers report the gross take-home pay (which is the full net pay grossed up with labor income
taxes and pension contributions levied on the employee), the broad occupational category (e.g.
blue-collar or white-collar workers) and type of contract (e.g. open-ended or fixed-term). From
this master data file, INPS constructs various datasets with information at the firm level where
each firm is uniquely identified by the fiscal code (that can be used to link the information with
the other data sources). In this study, we will use firm-level monthly information on the number



5
  If a loan is in default, the overall credit exposure of the firm is automatically registered in the CCR, even if the loan
amount is below the threshold.
6
  Banks can at any time revoke (totally or partially) the amount of credit lines granted to firms and typically do so
when the borrowers’ creditworthiness deteriorates. In Italy the share of firms whose credit line was totally or partially
cancelled was about 8 percent each year between 2012 and 2014. Then, it gradually declined reaching 5 percent in
2017 in line with the overall improvement the credit quality.

                                                                                                                         7
of employees, annual average gross wage by occupational category and annual average share of
various types of workers. These data are available from 1990 to 2018.


2.4    The Company Accounts Data Service (CADS)
The CADS is a proprietary database owned by Cerved Group S.p.A., a leading information
provider in Italy and one of the major credit rating agencies in Europe. CADS includes detailed
information on balance sheet and income statements for almost all Italian limited liability
companies since 1993. Information is drawn from official data recorded at the Italian Registry of
Companies and from financial statements filed at the Italian Chambers of Commerce. Companies
provide data on a compulsory basis. Each company’s financial statement is updated annually. From
this dataset, we collect yearly balance sheet information on various assets and liability items (e.g.
fixed assets, cash, inventory, financial debt and net equity) as well as yearly information from
income statement (e.g. sales and profits).


3      Information Treatment and Inflation Expectations
A unique feature of the Italian survey of firms is the randomized treatment of firms in terms of the
information about recent inflation with which they are provided. In this section, we first describe
this information treatment and then present evidence on how this treatment feeds into the inflation
expectations of firms, which provides the basis for our identification strategy to assess the causal
effect of inflation expectations on firms’ economic decisions.
       Before 2012Q3, all firms in the survey received information about recent inflation
dynamics before being asked about their economic expectations. In 2012Q3 the survey was
redesigned and participating firms were randomly split into two groups that were sent two versions
of the survey. One group, corresponding to about one-third of the sample, received the following
question about inflation:
               “What do you think consumer price inflation in Italy, measured by the 12-
               month change in the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, will be…”
over three different horizons: 6-month ahead, one-year ahead, and 2-year ahead. We refer to this
group of firms as the control group. Starting in 2014Q1, firms were also asked about their
expectation of annual inflation at a two-year horizon two years ahead (that is, average annual
inflation rate in three and four years from the date of the survey), which we refer to as the 4-year


                                                                                                   8
time horizon. The inflation expectations question comes at the beginning of the survey,
immediately after verifying their industry classification and asking for their number of employees
and their share of exports in revenues.
         The remaining two-thirds of panelists were instead asked the following question:
                   “In [previous month], consumer price inflation measured by the 12-month
                   change in the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices was [X.X]% in Italy
                   and [Y.Y]% in the Euro area. What do you think it will be in Italy …”
over the same horizons as asked in the other version of the question. All other questions in the survey
are identical. The treatment therefore consists of giving firms additional but publicly available
information about the most recent rate of inflation in both Italy and the Euro area.7 Since the inflation
rate varies over time, the size of the treatment varies as well. Assignment into treatment and control
groups was randomly redrawn in 2012Q4 and stayed fixed until 2017Q2.8 At that point, there was a
new randomized assignment of firms across the treatment and control groups, as well as the addition
of another information treatment group which we do not include in our analysis.9
         Prior to 2012Q3, all firms were in the treatment group, meaning that all firms were receiving
the information about most recent inflation in Italy and the Euro area. As can be seen in Figure 1,
the inflation expectations of both groups of firms closely tracked the actual inflation rate in Italy,
which was reported to all firms at the time. Starting in 2012Q3 however, we begin to see large gaps
appearing between the inflation expectations of the two types of firms. As the inflation rate fell
sharply from late 2012 through mid-2015 (from 2.5 percent per year to below zero), the average
forecast of the treated group fell much more rapidly than that of the control group. Despite starting
off with the same average forecast at the end of 2012, the average forecast of the treated group was
0.5 percentage point lower by the end of 2014 than the control group’s. This pattern reversed itself
when inflation rose sharply in 2017: the average forecast of the treatment group rose rapidly, by more
than one percentage point, while the average forecast of the control group rose by about half a

7
  The treatment provides potentially two different pieces of information: i) inflation rate in Italy and ii) inflation rate
in the Euro area. However, the correlation between these two series in our sample is above 0.95 so we do not have
enough variation to identify the effect of each inflation series separately.
8
  To verify that the selection of firms into treatment and control groups was actually random, we regress a dummy
variable for whether a firm was treated on observable characteristics of each firm, including their size, their export
share, the average absolute size of their price changes in the previous 12-month, as well as sector and geographic fixed
effects. The results are reported in Appendix Table 2. None of the observable characteristics are statistically
significantly correlated with being treated which is random assignment into treatment.

  The new treatment involved telling firms about the ECB’s inflation target. These data have not yet been cleared by the
Bank of Italy for research purposes. In the assignment of firms in 2017Q2, nearly 60 percent of firms from the control group
moved into the original treatment group while nearly 20 percent of firms in the treatment group moved to the control group.

                                                                                                                          9
percentage point. Panel B of Figure 1 illustrates that the treatment also has a pronounced effect on the
cross-sectional dispersion of beliefs: firms in the control group have systematically more dispersed
expectations than those in the treatment group after 2012, even though no such difference was
apparent before the differential provision of information began.10
         To quantify the extent to which the information treatment affects firms’ inflation expectations,
we first create a dummy variable equal to one if firms are treated and zero otherwise. We then multiply
that dummy by the level of inflation associated with that treatment. This creates a time-varying
measure of the treatment given to a firm each quarter, which we denote 𝑇 with i and t indexing firms
and time (survey waves).11 The time-variation reflects the fact that treated firms receive a different
treatment each period (as the level of inflation varies over time). To quantify the effect of this time-
varying treatment on the reported inflation forecast of firm i at time t for horizon h (i.e., 𝐹 𝜋                   ), we
then regress their expectations that quarter on the treatment variable for that quarter:
         𝐹𝜋           𝛼      𝛽 𝑇       𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 , .                                                                 (1)
We use Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors to account for cross-sectional and time
correlation in the errors and include seasonal fixed effects for each sector of economic activity.
         The results are presented in Table 1. Being provided with information about recent inflation
has a significant and large effect on inflation expectations across horizons. We find that information
about inflation being 1 percentage point higher raises the average forecast of firms by 0.59
percentage point at a six-month horizon, 0.55 percentage point at a one-year horizon, with effects
falling at longer horizons to a low of 0.37 percentage point at the four-year horizon. The large weight
being assigned to this information is consistent with experimental evidence in CGK, documenting
that firms place a lot of weight to information presented to them about recent inflation dynamics.
More generally, the fact that inflation expectations respond less than one-for-one to inflation is
consistent with the under-reaction of inflation expectations to aggregate information documented in
the literature (e.g. Coibion and Gorodnichenko 2012, 2015, Bordalo et al. 2018). As the horizon of


10
   Bartiloro et al. (2017) similarly find that the provision of information through the SIGE affects the 12-month ahead
inflation expectations of recipients and reduces the dispersion in their beliefs.
11
   There are alternative ways to define the treatment. For example, we can measure the information received by treated
firms as the difference between recent inflation and the 2 percent target (or just below 2 percent) of the ECB. Alternative
definitions like this one yield almost identical results. Another possible way could be to use a simple 0-1 dummy variable
(being zero for the uninformed firms and one for the informed ones) and include in the regression time fixed effects. Using
such a specification for the treatment yields the result that, across forecasting horizons, informed firms report lower
inflation expectations (on average by about 0.3 percentage points) compared with the uninformed firms (results are
available upon request). This is in line with the patterns shown in Figure 3 Panel A.

                                                                                                                       10
expectations increases, the R2 declines, consistent with the view that it may be harder to move firms’
longer-term inflation expectations.12 In short, these results show that expectations at longer horizons
are affected as well, albeit to a smaller extent than at shorter horizons.13
         Figure 2 plots the distribution of reported forecasts from the two groups for selected
quarters. As can readily be seen, the distributions are quite different: beliefs are much more
dispersed in the control group that receives no information, with much wider tails of very high or
low forecasts of inflation. Figure 3 shows that this holds across forecasting horizons for a specific
quarter. Consistent with the results presented in Table 1, these figures support the idea that
information treatments have pronounced effects on the inflation forecasts of firms across horizons
but the effect is strongest for short-term inflation expectations.
         We can also use the survey data from SIGE to characterize the persistence of the treatment
effect on expectations. Figure 1 indicates that treated firms have persistently different expectations
than those in the control group. However, it is unclear whether this is because the information
treatment has a persistent effect on beliefs or because the signals from recent inflation are themselves
persistent. Since the signals received are time-varying due to changing level of the most recent
inflation rate being reported to treated firms, we can differentiate between the persistent effects of a
single signal and the persistence of the signals themselves by examining the effect of past
information on current beliefs. Specifically, we estimate an expanded version of equation (1):
          𝐹𝜋           𝛼      𝛽, 𝑇        𝛽, 𝑇           𝛽, 𝑇          ⋯      𝛽   ,   𝑇      𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 , ,             (2)
which effectively estimates the dynamic response of expectations to signals (which are given by the
coefficients 𝛽 , , 𝛽 , , … , 𝛽      ,   ). The results are reported in Table 2. While the effect of a
contemporaneous treatment on inflation expectations is large (𝛽 , ), these effects seem to die out
quickly, although the persistence and serial correlation in the treatments complicate interpretation of
estimated duration effects.14 The previous quarter’s treatment has only a small effect on current

12
   Panel B of Appendix Table 3 assesses the response of expectations of different horizons to the treatment using a
common sample (since 4-year ahead forecasts are available for a shorter sample) and documents similar results.
13
   There is little evidence indicating that firms respond differently to the signals provided. Specifically, we reproduce
estimates of equation (1) for different subsets of firms, breaking them into groups based on observable characteristics.
Because information about firms in the survey is somewhat limited, we restrict our attention to four specific dimensions
along which firms can differ: sector (manufacturing, services, construction), their size (based on average number of
employees), their exposure to other economies (exports as a share of revenues), and their location (North vs Center vs
South and Islands). The results are presented in Appendix Table 4. We find very little variation in how information
treatments affect inflation expectations.
14
   If treatments were uncorrelated shocks, one could interpret equation (2) as estimating a moving average representation
so that 𝛽 , , 𝛽 , , … , 𝛽 , would directly provide an impulse response to treatment. In practice, year-on-year inflation (the

                                                                                                                         11
expectations, and older treatments have no discernible effect on current expectations after
conditioning on more recent treatments. Hence, the effect of information treatment on inflation
expectations largely dissipates within six months.15,16 This is also consistent with the results in CGK,
finding that firms which were followed-up six months after being provided information did not have
inflation expectations that were much different from firms in the control group. But unlike their
evidence from a one-time experiment, our results follow from repeated treatment of a much larger
number of firms over the course of several years, yielding a much more precise identification of the
dynamic effects on expectations of the provision of information to firms.
         The evidence provided so far relates directly to the ability of policymakers to alter firms’
inflation expectations. First, our results suggest that conditional on firms being exposed to
information about inflation, their inflation expectations respond strongly. Hence, there is room for
policies to significantly affect agents’ expectations, if information can be transmitted to them in a
direct and transparent manner. Second, our results indicate that the persistence of information
treatments on inflation expectations is quite low: the effects of information treatments are small after
three months and gone after six. Hence, generating persistent changes in agents’ economic
expectations would likely require persistent communication strategies on the part of policymakers.
One-time announcements are unlikely to deliver persistent changes in beliefs, at least about inflation.


4        Expectations and Economic Decisions
In this section, we consider the causal effect of firms’ inflation expectations on their economic
decisions (price-setting, hiring and credit demand) exploiting the random information treatment to
generate exogenous variation in inflation expectations. We rely on the following empirical
approach. Letting 𝑦            be the outcome variable for firm 𝑖 at time 𝑡                   𝑘, we regress economic
outcomes on inflation expectations formulated at time 𝑡                     1 (𝐹     𝜋        ):



information treatment in the survey) is persistent and therefore 𝛽 , , 𝛽 , , … , 𝛽 , combine persistence of the response
and the persistence of treatments. In an extreme case of treatment being a random walk, coefficients on lags of treatment
may be small because firms need to know only the most recent value of the treatment.
15
   When estimating equation (2), we restrict the sample to include only firms that are consistently present for 𝑞 waves.
Because firms may not participate in each wave of the survey, the sample size shrinks as 𝑞 increases. An alternative is to
assume that firms are not treated in the quarters when they do not respond to a survey. We can implement this alternative
approach by setting past treatments to be equal to zero for periods when firms did not participate in the survey. As
documented in Appendix Table 2, the results under this alternative assumption are almost identical.
16
   A weakly persistent information effect is also reported in Bartiloro et al. (2017). We also find that inflation expectations
exhibit weak persistence in response to treatment when we use local projections.

                                                                                                                           12
         𝑦        𝛼      𝛾 𝐹      𝜋           𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑠           𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟       ,   ,                            (3)
where 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑠 is a vector of firm-level controls. The vector includes the expectations of other
economic variables such as firm i’s expectations about firm-specific business conditions over the next
three months, firm-specific employment growth in the next three months, firm-specific expected
liquidity in the next three months, perceptions about current Italy’s general economic situation, and
perceptions about the probability of improvement in Italy’s general economic situation over the next
three months. These variables help us control for firms’ expectations so that the coefficient 𝛾 may be
interpreted as a response of outcome variable 𝑦 to a surprise movement in inflation expectations. Note
that controls are taken from wave 𝑡          2. We use this timing of the controls because these expectations
and perceptions are elicited after the information treatment in each wave 17 and thus the
contemporaneous expectations and perceptions can respond to changes in inflation expectations,
which in turn react to the provided information. Because firms cannot change prices, employment or
credit utilization contemporaneously in response to the information treatment, inflation expectations
𝐹    𝜋        are taken from wave 𝑡          1 as we vary 𝑘 from zero to horizon 𝐾. We instrument for the
inflation expectations at time 𝑡        1 using the information treatment at time 𝑡             1, which is equal to
zero for the control group and recent inflation for the treatment group. We focus on 12-month ahead
inflation expectations since we do not have enough instruments to control for the term structure of
inflation expectations. Our key identifying restriction is that there are no channels through which the
information treatment affects economic decisions other than inflation expectations (or the other
expectations we control for). We winsorize outcome variable 𝑦 at bottom and top 2 percent. As in
equation (1) we use Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors to account for cross-sectional and time
correlation in the errors and include seasonal fixed effects for each sector of economic activity. We
first conduct our empirical analysis using the full sample length (2012Q3-2019Q1) and then in
Section 6 we present the estimation results obtained using the subsample 2014Q3-2018Q2 data that
cover the effective lower bound on policy rate period.


4.1    Effect on prices
We first turn to the effect of inflation expectations on firms’ pricing decisions. To do so, we rely on
survey questions that ask firms to report the percentage change in their prices over the last twelve


17
  In contrast, CGK elicit expectations before and after the treatment so that one can measure treatment effects directly
in one wave.

                                                                                                                    13
months (𝑑𝑝 ) and use these responses at different horizons to characterize the evolution of price
changes using equation (3).18 We report results of these regressions in Panel A of Table 3. The
instrument using the random assignment of firms to treatment/control groups is very strong (F-
statistics of over 100). The results point toward only small and relatively transitory effects on prices.
An exogenous increase in inflation expectations of 1 percentage point leads firms to report annual
price changes that are 0.2 percentage point higher after a quarter, but these effects die out over the
subsequent two quarters. One year later, there is no evidence that firms with higher inflation
expectations raise their prices more than firms with lower expectations. Hence, these results point
toward small effects of inflation expectations on price changes of firms. We also find little
difference between IV and OLS estimates (reported in Appendix Table 6), indicating that the effects
of potential endogeneity of inflation expectations with respect to firms’ price setting decisions are
limited. The absence of strong effects from inflation expectations on pricing decisions is also
consistent with experimental results in CGK. They found that a 1 percentage point decrease in
inflation expectations induced by an information treatment was followed by an approximately 0.1
percent decrease in prices after six months, broadly in line with the estimates found here albeit
estimated less precisely and at a single time horizon.


4.2    Effect on Employment
Given that firms also report the number of their employees in each wave of the survey, we can also
assess whether inflation expectations affect firms’ employment decisions. To do so, we use the log
change in employment between time 𝑡               1 and time 𝑡       𝑘 as dependent variable in equation (3).
The results are presented in Panel B of Table 3, using the same instrumental variable strategy as
before. Unlike the results with prices, we find large and statistically significant effects of inflation
expectations on firms’ employment decisions, especially at longer horizons. Firms with 1
percentage point higher inflation expectations reduce their employment by 0.7 percent after 12
months, with the effects continuing to rise thereafter. Unlike the results with prices, there is now a
pronounced difference between OLS and IV estimates. With OLS (Appendix Table 6), inflation



18
  We verify the quality of responses about reported price changes in two ways. First, we compute the rate of inflation
based on price changes reported in the survey. We find that the correlation between this measure of inflation and the
official inflation rate is high (0.75). Second, we compare responses about past price changes with responses about
expected future price changes (which are also measured with quantitative questions). The correlation between these
two measures is approximately 0.5, which points to strong consistency of responses over time.

                                                                                                                  14
expectations appear much less correlated with employment decisions of firms. Only with our
instrument we recover large economic effects of inflation expectations on employment decisions.19
          One may be concerned that our results are potentially driven by two confounding forces.
First, managers could be choosing to not take the necessary time to report actual levels of
employment. Second, managers could provide answers to conform to what they think might be
expected of them or answers that are “anchored” by information treatments. To assess the
quantitative significance of these concerns, we use end-of-quarter employment data from INPS for
the firms covered in the SIGE.20 We generally find high consistency of employment reported in
the two sources (the correlation is 0.95) but occasionally there are considerable discrepancies
largely due to differences in the definitions of a firm, as a result of which we drop outliers.21,22 As
documented in Panel C of Table 3, we find similar results using actual employment data from
INPS as we do from employment numbers reported in the survey. Our results using this alternative
source indicate that these forces are not behind our findings of persistently reduced employment
after managers exogenously increase their inflation expectations.


4.3     Effect on Credit Utilization and Loan Applications
The Italian CCR maintained by the Bank of Italy allows us to construct for each firm at each quarter
the utilization rate of credit lines (i.e. the ratio of the amount of credit line drawn at t to the total
amount of credit line). We then use the change in the utilization rate between time 𝑡                        1 and time
𝑡    𝑘 as dependent variable in equation (3). The results are presented in Panel D of Table 3, using
the same instrumental variable strategy as before. 23 We find large and statistically significant

19
   The very gradual response of employment may seem surprising. One interpretation is that it reflects regulations in
the Italian labor market that severely restrict the ability of firms to fire workers, especially once their size exceeds 60
workers as almost of the firms in our sample do. In such a setting, firms may be forced to rely on attrition to reduce
their employment rolls, which could explain why employment falls in such a persistent way.
20
   We merge the data from INPS with those from SIGE using as unique identifier the fiscal code of each firm and
time variable (year-quarter). With this procedure nearly 85 percent of firms in the two datasets are matched.
21
   We manually verified a number of these cases and found that, in general, employment numbers reported in the
survey were in line with total employment numbers reported in financial statements for the broader firm (e.g., a
corporate group), indicating that the employment numbers in the data from INPS were for more narrow definitions of
the firm (e.g. headquarters).
22
   Another important source of differences is that SIGE bottom-codes employment at 50. We verify in Panel A of
Appendix Table 10 (restrict the sample to firms with more than 50 employees) and Panel B of Appendix Table 10
(replace SIGE employment growth rate with INPS employment growth rate for firms with exactly 50 employees) that
our results are not driven by bottom-coding.
23
   In this case the sample size declines somewhat. This is mostly due to the fact that when merging the SIGE data with
the Italian Credit Register using the identification key represented by the combination of firm fiscal code and time,
there are some unmatched cases. To make sure that with this restricted sample the selection of firms into treatment
and control groups remains random, we replicate Appendix Table 1 using only the observations for which we have

                                                                                                                       15
positive effects of inflation expectations on firms’ credit utilization decisions, especially at longer
horizons. Firms with one percentage point higher inflation expectations increase their credit
utilization by approximately one percentage point after 3 months and longer horizons.
         Using the Italian CCR, we can also examine how firms change their loan applications to new
financial institutions in response to changes in their inflation expectations. Using specification (3)
with the cumulative number of loan applications between time 𝑡 and time 𝑡                           𝑘 as dependent
variable, we find (Panel E of Table 3) that raising expected inflation leads to an increase in the
number of loan applications to new potential lenders on the part of firms. As we do not observe loan
applications to current lenders, we cannot directly identify whether this response reflects an increase
in loan demand to finance e.g. investment or whether it is precautionary in nature, e.g. due to
concerns that current lenders are likely to restrict their supply of credit to the firm. We provide
evidence in section 5 that the precautionary motive is the more likely interpretation for the rising
credit utilization and loan applications in the face of higher inflation expectations.


4.4    Effects on other economic decisions
There are a number of other economic variables that we can observe only at the annual frequency.
Because our time series is already quite short however, we want to first verify that our estimation
yields sensible results at this lower frequency. To do so, we estimate the same specification for select
variables as before but at the annual frequency. For expectations variables on the right-hand side in
the regression specification, we use inflation expectations from the fourth quarter of year 𝑡                    1 and
other expectations as controls from the third quarter of year 𝑡            1. Dependent variables are measured
as (log) changes between year 𝑡           1 and 𝑡      1 of annual values. We present results from doing so
with employment from both SIGE as well as INPS in rows 1 and 2 of Table 4. A one percentage
point increase in inflation expectations leads to around a 0.5-1 percent decline in employment,
consistent with results at the quarterly frequency. Our instrument remains strong at the annual
frequency. Thus, these results indicate that annual data remains sufficiently informative for
identifying the economic effects of changes in inflation expectations. We therefore apply this
approach to study how other economic decisions of firms respond to changes in inflation
expectations.


information on credit. We continue to find that none of the observable characteristics are statistically significantly
correlated with being treated with the only exception being a slight over-representation of firms in the trading sector.

                                                                                                                    16
Fixed Assets
The financial reports of firms in CADS include a measure of year-end tangible fixed assets (net of
amortization). We can therefore create a proxy for investment by firms using log changes in fixed
assets. When these changes are regressed on inflation expectations using our IV procedure, we find
(row 3, Table 4) sharp declines in the stock of fixed assets following exogenous increases in inflation
expectations: more than 1 percent over two years for each 1 percentage point increase in inflation
expectations. As with employment, this is in sharp contrast to the finding in CGK that higher
inflation expectations are followed by rising employment and investment on the part of firms.


Sales
In Section 4.1 we documented that higher inflation expectations lead firms to increase the average
prices of their products. We now explore how total revenues of firms respond to changes in inflation
expectations. To do so, we use information on sales values from the income statements in CADS to
construct the log changes in sales between year 𝑡    1 and 𝑡    1 and regress it on a number of control
variables and inflation expectations instrumented as before. We find (row 4, Table 4) significant
declines in sales growth in response to exogenous increases in inflation expectations: nearly 2
percent over two years for a 1 percentage point increase in inflation expectations. The fall in sales
is consistent with the fact that firms raise prices and reduce employment and capital.


Balance Sheet Ratios
Using the financial statements compiled in CADS we next examine if exogenous changes in
inflation expectations lead to changes in the composition of firms’ balance sheets. We first look at
the asset side of firms’ balance sheets and then at the liability side.
        We construct a broad measure of liquidity as the ratio of current assets (assets which can
be converted or are expected to be converted to cash within a year) to total assets. Applying our
empirical specification to the change of this variable between year 𝑡      1 and 1 , we find (row 5,
Table 4) that higher inflation expectations induce firms to change their composition of assets
toward less liquid forms. The economic magnitude of the effect is small. To better understand the
sources of this small effect, we look at the main components of current assets, namely trade credit



                                                                                                    17
(or accounts receivables), inventories and cash, whose response to inflation expectations might be
different. For each of these variables we construct the ratio of a given variable to total assets.
       For trade credit (row 6, Table 4) we find a negative (and weakly significant) effect of
inflation expectations indicating that firms respond to an exogenous rise in inflation expectations
by reducing their trade credits. On the one hand, this result might mirror the fall in revenues and
therefore the decrease in volumes of sales that mechanically may bring down trade credit. On the
other hand, depending on the perceptions of firms on the sources of the increase in inflation
expectations and thus on the economic outlook, firms may become more risk adverse and be less
willing to grant trade credit to their customers.
       Applying our empirical specification to the cash ratio (cash and liquid financial assets to
total assets), we find (row 7, Table 4) limited evidence that changes in inflation expectations are
associated with changes in the composition of assets. Turning instead to the annual value of
inventories held by firms, we find (row 8, Table 4) that higher inflation expectations lead to
increases in firms’ inventories. Note that inventories include both stocks of intermediate materials
as well as stocks of goods in production and produced. As documented in Section 5, firms that
raise their inflation expectations also tend to expect higher raw material prices in the next 12
months, which could account for why firms would accumulate an inventory of these inputs before
the expected price changes materialize.
       We also consider whether a firm changes its leverage, calculated as the ratio of financial
debt to the sum of financial debt and net equity at market prices, with inflation expectations
instrumented as before. We find evidence (row 9, Table 4) that changes in inflation expectations
lead to significant changes in leverage. Specifically, a 1 percentage point increase in inflation
expectations increases leverage by 0.8 percentage points over two years. This result is thus
consistent with the positive effect of higher inflation expectations on credit demand documented
in Section 4.3. In short, our data indicate that exogenous changes in inflation expectations lead to
statistically significant financial changes in the composition of firms’ balance sheets.


Wages and Employment Composition
The data from INPS also include annual data on the total wage bills of firms, which can be combined
with total employment numbers to create a measure of average wages for each firm. Following the
same approach, we present the effects of inflation expectations on average wages in row 10 of Table


                                                                                                     18
4. Average wages appear higher a year after the rise in inflation expectations but the effect is not
statistically significant. The INPS data also include, at an annual frequency, decompositions of
employment and wage bills between white-collar and blue-collar workers so we can therefore assess
whether changes in inflation expectations are associated with changes in employment shares of each
as well as changes in relative wages of the two types of labor. Results for how average wages of
each group respond to exogenous variation in inflation expectations are presented in rows (11) and
(12) of Table 4. The results for average wages within each group are just as noisy as those for
average wages: we cannot reject the possibility that both are unchanged but confidence intervals
encompass a wide range of possible responses when inflation expectations rise. However, we find
small but statistically significant evidence of a change in the composition of firms’ labor force, with
the share of blue-collar workers falling when inflation expectations rise (row 13, Table 4). Since
white-collar workers earn approximately 50 percent more on average, there is a composition effect
pushing toward higher average wages. Given that the share of white-collar workers is rising by 0.27
percentage point for each 1 percentage point rise in inflation expectations, the composition effect
therefore accounts for an approximately 0.135 percent increase in average wages.
       Further evidence of a composition effect comes from the availability of information on the
share of temporary workers in the employment of the firm. Row 14 of Table 4 indicates that higher
inflation expectations by Italian firms cause a reduction in the share of temporary workers. Since
the latter are the easiest to hire and fire, their declining share is consistent with the reduction in
total employment following increases in inflation expectations. However, given that in our sample
of firms temporary workers (as defined by INPS) account for only 7.5% of total employment, this
composition effect alone cannot account for the total employment declines observed in Table 3.


4.5    Do all firms respond to inflation expectations in the same way?
While all of our results are obtained from utilizing the entire cross-section of firms, it could be that
the response to information treatments or the effect of inflation expectations differs along a number
of observable characteristics of firms. As discussed in Section 3, the effect of the treatment on
inflation expectations itself does not vary along any of the four observable dimensions (sector,
size, geography, export share). However, there are a number of channels through which equal
revisions in inflation expectations could lead to differential economic responses by firms, such as



                                                                                                     19
differential elasticities of demand with respect to real interest rates, different compositions of
inputs, different export shares, etc.
        Indeed, we find that some differences arise along firms’ observable characteristics when
we look at the effects of inflation expectations on actions. For ease of exposition, we focus on
price, employment and credit utilization responses at the specific horizon of six months after
treatment. We re-estimate equation (3) on sub-groups of firms, again using the information
treatment as an instrument for inflation expectations. Table 5 reports results for price, employment
and credit utilization responses (see Appendix Table 7 for other variables). While firms in service
and manufacturing respond in approximately the same way for both prices and employment to
changes in inflation expectations, firms in the construction sector are far more sensitive both in
terms of pricing and employment decisions. Higher sensitivity for construction enterprises is also
detected in terms of credit utilization. This could reflect the greater sensitivity of construction to
real interest rates and also the willingness of these firms, generally perceived as more risky
borrowers, to front load external financing in the advent of tighter credit conditions. We also find
a much higher sensitivity of employment decisions to inflation expectations for firms that export
little to none, which likely reflects the fact that exporters are less sensitive to business conditions
in their home country since more of their revenues come from foreign sources. Finally, there is a
striking difference in behavior of firms across regions: firms in the South of Italy are much more
sensitive to inflation for their employment decisions than firms in the rest of the country, even
after controlling for their sector, size and trade exposure. Economic and social differences between
the South and North of Italy have long been identified in the literature (e.g., Tabellini 2010). These
results present a new dimension along which economic behavior differs across these regions.


4.6     Summary
The provision of information about recent inflation to a randomized set of firms within the SIGE
generated exogenous cross-sectional and time-series variation in inflation expectations across firms.
By combining this variation with other survey and administrative data, we document how changes
in inflation expectations on the part of Italian firms affect their behavior. When firms exogenously
raise their inflation expectations, they tend to temporarily raise their prices but persistently decrease
their employment and investment with employment changes happening disproportionately among
blue-collar and temporary workers. We find some evidence that firms change their financial assets

                                                                                                      20
in response to different inflation expectations. Furthermore, they utilize their available credit more
and accumulate more inventories as their price expectations increase and their sales decrease. In the
next section, we consider possible motives behind these reactions to changes in inflation expectations
and discuss how they relate to models of information rigidities.


5        What Drives Firms’ Responses to Changes in Inflation Expectations?
To shed light on the mechanisms behind firms’ small and transitory price increases, long-lasting
employment and investment declines and persistent credit utilization increases when their inflation
expectations rise, we utilize other survey questions from the SIGE that can help understand what
underlies firms’ responses. In our analysis, we use the following econometric specification:
         𝐹𝑦       𝛼     𝛾𝐹     𝜋            𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟                                                                 (4)
where 𝐹 𝑦 is the forecast of firm i at time 𝑡 for variable 𝑦. Similar to specification (3), we instrument
inflation expectations 𝐹         𝜋        with the treatment variable at time 𝑡            1.24 As in equation (1) we
use Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors to account for cross-sectional and time correlation in
the errors and include seasonal fixed effects for each sector of economic activity.


Perceptions and Expectations of Aggregate Conditions
In addition to questions about aggregate inflation, firms in the SIGE are asked about other aggregate
economic outcomes. Previous work has documented correlations between individuals’ outlooks for
inflation and other economic variables. For example, Carvalho and Nechio (2014) find that
households in the U.S. believe that inflation is associated with stronger economic outlooks,
consistent with a movement along a Phillips curve, while Dräger and Lamla (2015) find that
household expectations are consistent with a Taylor rule, such that higher inflation expectations are
associated with even higher expectations of nominal interest rates. In the same spirit, the SIGE asks
respondents about whether they think Italy’s general economic situation is better, worse, or the same
compared with the previous three months. We create a variable equal to one if firms choose “better”,
zero if “the same”, and negative one if “worse”. Respondents are also asked about the probability of
an improvement in Italy’s economic situation over the next three months. This question has 6

24
   We find similar results for a specification in which the regressors and the regressand are taken from the same wave, that
is, we use 𝐹 𝜋        rather than 𝐹 𝜋           as the regressor. With this alternative timing, we allow beliefs about other
variables to move immediately in response to informational treatments (questions about these variables appear in SIGE after
expectation questions are asked).

                                                                                                                        21
possible answers: zero, 1-25 percent, 26-50 percent, 51-75 percent, 76-99 percent and 100 percent.
If respondents pick a bin with a range, we assign the midpoint of that range.
        We characterize how these expectations change when firms change their inflation
expectations by regressing these non-inflation beliefs on firms’ 12-month ahead expectations, again
using the information treatment as an exogenous source of variation about inflation expectations.
As documented in rows 1 and 2 of Table 6, we find that higher expectations of inflation lead firms
to become more pessimistic about the economic outlook: firms with higher inflation expectations
think Italy’s economic situation is worse and perceive lower probabilities of an improvement in the
economy over the next few months. This result differs not only from Carvalho and Nechio (2014)
but also from CGK. These latter authors find that New Zealand firms who raise their inflation
expectations following an information treatment do not change their expectations of real economic
variables in an economically meaningful way. This association of higher inflation with worse
expected economic outcomes on the part of Italian firms could therefore rationalize why
employment responses are so sharply negative when firms expect higher inflation expectations and
why firms raise the utilization degree of their credit lines.


Expectations for Firm’s Outlook
Because the SIGE also includes questions about managers’ expected outlook for their own firm,
we can assess whether this increased pessimism about the aggregate economic outlook in the face
of higher inflation expectations also translates into greater pessimism about the outlook for the
firm. Specifically, the survey asks respondents whether they think business conditions for their
company will be “much better”, “better”, “the same”, “worse”, or “much worse” over the next
three months, for which we assign values ranging from 2 (for “much better”) to -2 (for “much
worse”). A second question asks them whether they expect the total demand for their products to
improve, worsen or stay the same over the next three months. A third set of questions we consider
asks firms to rate if their liquidity situation in three months will be insufficient (-1), sufficient (0),
or more than sufficient (+1) and if they think their current access conditions to credit market are
worse (-1), the same (0) or better (+1) compared with previous three months.
        To assess whether changes in inflation expectations affects firms’ other economic
expectations, we again re-estimate equation (4) using responses to these other survey questions as
the dependent variable, using the information treatment to identify exogenous changes in inflation

                                                                                                       22
expectations. As documented in rows 3 through 6 in Table 6, higher inflation expectations lead
Italian firms to expect worsening business conditions for their company over the next 3 months
including reduced demand as well as reduced liquidity and access to credit. This anticipation of
reduced liquidity and access to credit could help explain why firms raise their prices, as in Gilchrist
et al. (2017), and simultaneously reduce their employment and investment. It also provides a
natural justification for the fact that firms are choosing to take out a larger share of their currently
available credit lines and seek out new financing sources, as shown in Table 3.
        The response of firm-specific uncertainty to inflation expectations is also consistent with this
interpretation (rows 7 and 8). Firms are asked to assign probabilities to three possible outcomes for
their business conditions over both the next three months and the next three years: “better”, “worse”,
and “the same”. From this assignment of probabilities to these three bins (which are assigned
outcome values of +1, -1 and 0, respectively), we compute the implied standard deviation for their
perceived outlook for the firm over each of the two horizons. When we regress these measures of
firm-specific uncertainty on inflation expectations, instrumenting with the treatment, we find that
higher inflation expectations generate higher uncertainty about the outlook. This suggests that higher
inflation expectations have both first- and second-moment effects: they are associated with worse
economic outlooks and higher levels of uncertainty. The heightened uncertainty may itself contribute
to reductions in employment and investment (e.g., Bloom 2009) as well as higher prices (Ilut,
Valchev and Vincent 2019) but we lack identifying variation to separate the two effects.
        This worsened outlook for firms with higher inflation expectations is reflected in their planned
actions. For example, firms are asked about their investment plans over the current or subsequent
calendar year (relative to the previous year in the former case and the current year in the latter case).25
Possible answers by firms are qualitative: “much higher”, “a little higher”, “about the same”, “a little
lower”, and “much lower”. We can use these quasi-year ahead forecasts in investment to assess
whether and how inflation expectations affect investment plans using equation (4). We find (row 10,
Table 6) that higher inflation expectations (again instrumented with information treatments) are
associated with plans for lower investment over a one-year horizon. The survey also asks firms to
provide qualitative forecasts about their expected changes in employment over the following three


25
  Which horizon they are asked about depends on the quarter in which the survey is held. Generally, in the first two
quarters of the calendar year, firms are asked about how investment in the current calendar year will compare to the
previous calendar year while in the last two quarters of the year, firms are instead asked about how investment will
compare in the subsequent calendar year relative to the current calendar year.

                                                                                                                 23
months (possible responses are “lower”, “unchanged”, “higher”). When we use the latter as
dependent variables, we again find evidence that higher expected inflation reduces employment of
firms (row 9, Table 6). Hence, the results using expected future levels of investment and
employment confirm the findings from actual levels of employment and investment.
        In short, each of these results suggests that firms perceive higher inflation as associated not
only with worse aggregate outcomes but also deteriorating conditions for their firms, which
seemingly induce them to reduce their employment and investment.


Motivations for Price Changes
If firms perceive a diminished outlook for their business, why do they then tend to raise prices when
their inflation expectations rise? Another useful dimension of the survey is that firms are asked about
their expected price changes as well as the factors inducing them to either raise or lower prices.
Specifically, in each wave, firms were asked to first predict their price changes over the next twelve
months (with a quantitative answer in percent) then to characterize which forces were pushing them to
change their prices. For the latter, firms were asked to indicate the direction and intensity through
which the following four factors would affect their price-setting decisions over the following twelve
months: total demand for their products, the price of raw materials, labor costs, and the pricing
decisions of their competitors. Combining the qualitative answers for both the direction (up/down/no
change) and intensity (low/average/high) allows us to apply a seven point scale (from -3 for a factor
having a strong negative effect on prices to a 3 for a factor having a strong positive effect on prices) to
their answers for each factor. In Figure 4 we report the time development of each factor together with
the average expected price change over the next 12 months.
        Using the expected change in prices and each of the factors accounting for price changes as
dependent variables, in turn, in equation (4), we characterize in Table 6 to what extent and why higher
inflation expectations on the part of firms lead them to change their expected path of futures prices.
        First, we find a similar pattern of responses for the expected path of future prices as we did
for actual prices: higher inflation expectations are initially associated with slightly higher expected
prices on the part of firms (row 11, Table 6). Second, firms with higher inflation expectations perceive
a reduction in demand for their goods, which puts downward pressure on their prices (row 12).
Competitors’ pricing decisions also apply downward pressure to firms’ prices when their inflation
expectations are higher (row 15). These two forces are consistent with the fact that firms with higher

                                                                                                        24
inflation expectations anticipate a reduced level of economic activity (hence competitors reducing
their prices) as well as a worsened outlook for their own firm (the reduction in demand for their
goods). There is little change in perceptions of how labor costs will affect price pressures (row 14),
indicating that firms do not view higher inflation as translating in a significant way into higher wages.
        However, higher inflation expectations are associated with higher expectations of prices for
raw materials on impact (row 13). It is this higher expectation that appears to account for the fact
that firms initially raise their prices. These expectations of higher raw material prices dissipate over
several quarters, which likely accounts for why firms’ prices do not appear to be persistently higher
after an increase in their inflation expectations. Together, these findings indicate that Italian firms
seem to interpret news about recent inflation as reflecting supply-side shocks: they anticipate higher
raw material prices but lower demand for their products. Consistent with this interpretation, we
observe a much stronger negative correlation between inflation and unemployment for New Zealand
than for Italy.26 Structural decompositions of output and inflation in Italy also suggest an important
role for supply-side shocks. For example, Albonico et al. (2017) find that TFP and investment risk
premium shocks have played a much larger role in accounting for economic dynamics in Italy prior
to the Great Recession than in France, Germany or Spain. The notion that firms in Italy and New
Zealand may draw very different implications about the source of underlying changes in inflation
depending on their historical experience, and therefore react very differently to changes in their
expectations of future inflation, is formalized in Acosta and Afrouzi (2019). Intuitively, when firms
are rationally inattentive, free signals about an endogenous variable like inflation will be used by
firms to draw inferences about the shocks driving economic activity. Firms in different countries that
have experienced different correlations between real economic activity and inflation will naturally
interpret these signals differently and make different economic decisions.


Is this inattention costly for firms?
The fact that providing publicly available information about recent inflation to firms leads them to
significantly revise their beliefs, as documented in Figure 3 and Table 1, suggests that managers
and CEOs choose to be inattentive to inflation. One possible motivation for this could be that


26
  Between 1989 and 2007, the correlation between CPI inflation and the unemployment rate (both series are detrended
with the Hodrick-Prescott filter) in New Zealand was -0.67 but was only -0.21 in Italy. Relatedly, when we regress
CPI inflation on the unemployment rate, the R2 is 0.45 for the New Zealand sample and 0.04 for the Italian sample.
Both of these results are consistent with more supply-side shocks in Italy than in New Zealand.

                                                                                                                25
inflation – especially when firms operate in a low and stable inflation environment – is largely
irrelevant to their decisions. But the fact that exogenous changes in these expectations lead firms
to change their behavior belies this interpretation: inflation expectations clearly matter for the
decisions of firms. Reconciling these two facts—firms are inattentive to inflation but react to free
information about inflation—can be done in a rational inattention context if profit functions are
relatively flat with respect to inflation (which justifies inattention) but not completely flat (which
justifies changing behavior when firms change their beliefs), as shown in Acosta and Afrouzi
(2019). Providing rationally inattentive firms with free information about inflation should
therefore lead to a positive, but small, change in their profits.
        This prediction is testable in our data given that we know which firms are treated with this
information and that we can observe the profits of firms in CADS data. Because there is a lot of
idiosyncratic volatility in reported profit shares (i.e., the ratio of profits to sales), we winsorize top
and bottom 2 percent of data and employ Huber-robust regressions to estimate the effect of treatment
on profit shares. The results are presented in Panel A of Table 7. Column (1) utilizes firm-level
controls as in specification (3), column (2) includes industry and year fixed effects, column (3) has
no controls. Across specifications, we find that firms in the treatment group had higher profits during
the period in which they were treated, which is consistent with the fact that they incorporated the
information and made decisions that allowed them to improve their performance. However, the
difference in profits across the two groups is quite small: estimates range from 0.1 to 0.3 percent of
sales. Given that the Huber-robust standard deviation of the profit share in the cross-section is 8.5
percent per year, our estimates suggest that being treated raises the profit share by only 3.3 percent
of one standard deviation of annual profit shares. Panel B of Table 7 shows that prior to 2012, when
all firms received the same information, average profits were indistinguishable across the same two
groups of firms. In short, consistent with rational inattention, the provision of free and publicly
available information to firms has small positive effects on profits on average.


6       The Effective Lower Bound Period
Our evidence suggests that Italian firms might have interpreted news about recent inflation as
reflecting supply-side shocks, thus driving prices and employment in opposite directions.
Theoretical work has shown however that at the effective lower bound (ELB) on policy rates,
negative supply-side shocks can have expansionary effects: the higher expected inflation induced

                                                                                                       26
by a shock lowers the ex-ante real rate thus stimulating interest-sensitive sectors of the economy
and possibly offsetting the usual recessionary effects of the shock.27 More generally, the inability
or unwillingness of policy-makers to change nominal interest rates at the ELB means that increases
in expectations of inflation lead to declines in the real interest rate, rather than increases as when
the Taylor principle is satisfied. Inflationary shocks should therefore have stronger positive
demand-side effects than they normally would (e.g. Woodford (2001) for fiscal shocks). More
generally, the presence of constraints on policy-makers’ ability or willingness to respond to shocks
implies that economic dynamics can change at the ELB.28
         In light of these considerations, we consider to what extent our results change when we focus
exclusively on the ELB period. While there is not a unique way to date the ELB in the Euro area, in
what follows we let the ELB period begin in 2014Q4 and end in 2018Q2.29 The smaller time sample
means that weak instruments become an issue at longer horizons (since these further shorten the
sample), so we restrict the set of horizons in our estimations to 3 quarters. The results are presented
in Table 8, using the same instrumental variable strategy as before. Several remarks are in order.
First, we find that the effects on firms’ prices are larger and more persistent relative to the effects
estimated on the full sample (Panel A). An exogenous increase in inflation expectations of one
percentage point leads firms to report annual price changes that are 0.7 percentage points higher after
a quarter as well as in the subsequent two quarters. Second, turning to firms’ employment decisions,



27
   The evidence on whether negative supply-side shocks actually have expansionary effects at the ELB is mixed.
Wieland (2019), for example, studies the Japanese earthquake of 2011 as well as oil price shocks during ELB episodes
and finds no evidence of expansionary effects from negative supply shocks. In terms of the mechanism underlying the
proposition, Bachmann et al. (2015) use the micro data from the Michigan Survey of Consumers conducted in the
United States and document that the impact of expected inflation on the readiness to spend on durables is negative,
small in absolute value, and statistically insignificant, regardless of whether the ELB binds or not. However, other
evidence is more favorable to this hypothesis. For example, Ichiue and Nishiguchi (2015) use the micro data from the
Opinion Survey on the General Public’s Views and Behavior run by the Bank of Japan, which covers a low interest
rate environment for a longer period than the United States and find that higher inflation expectations lead to greater
current spending. D’Acunto et al. (2016) find that the higher inflation expectations in Germany following an
anticipated increase in the VAT during the ELB led to a rise in consumption, consistent with the underlying mechanism
that delivers expansionary effects of negative supply-side shocks.
28
   If Italian firms viewed Euro area policy as being independent of Italian economic conditions, then the ELB would
not be expected to have any differential effect on expectations. However, the correlation between Italian inflation and
Euro-area inflation was 0.95 over this time period, so this was unlikely to be the case.
29
   In September 2014 the Governing Council of the ECB decreased the fixed rate on the main refinancing operations by 10
basis points to 0.05 per cent. At the press conference following this decision, the President of the ECB Mario Draghi made
clear that he viewed the ECB as having reached the ELB: “And now we are at the lower bound, where technical adjustments
are not going to be possible any longer.” Hence, we treat all subsequent quarters as being at the ELB. In 2018Q2, the ECB
declared its intention to finish its quantitative easing program thus signaling a beginning of normalization. Similar results
for ELB running from 2014Q2 to 2019Q1 (the last observation we have) are in Appendix Tables 8 and 9.

                                                                                                                         27
the results now indicate the lack of a statistically significant relationship with inflation expectations
(Panels B and C). This change in response of employment reflects the fact that point estimates are
now less negative (or even small and positive), not an increase in standard errors. Third, the effects
of inflation expectations on firms’ credit line utilization are even larger when the economy is at the
ELB (Panel D). Specifically, firms with 1 percentage point higher inflation expectations increase
their credit demand by 1 percentage points after 6 months and by nearly 2 percentage points after 9
months.30 As for loan applications, we do not find significant effects of higher inflation expectations.
This result could reflect the fact that when firms perceive better aggregate outcomes and improved
business conditions they express their loan demand to their incumbent lenders.
         As done before, in order to shed light on the mechanisms behind firms’ responses to higher
inflation expectations during the ELB period, we regress firms’ non-inflation beliefs on firms’
inflation expectations (exploiting the information treatment as an exogenous source of variation about
inflation expectations) for this period and report results in Table 9. Interestingly, rows 1 and 2 show
that firms with higher inflation expectations now exhibit a more optimistic outlook on Italy’s current
economic and perceive higher probabilities of an improvement in the economy over the next few
months (in this latter case though the effect is not statistically significant). This association of higher
inflation with better macroeconomic economic outcomes could therefore rationalize why Italian firms
do not cut back on their workforce and increase more significantly their credit utilization.
         As reported in rows 3 through 6, firms’ increased optimism about the aggregate economic
outlook in the face of higher inflation expectations transmits to a more buoyant outlook for their firms’
business conditions. Firms with higher inflation expectations anticipate improved business conditions
for their company over the next 3 months, increased demand for their products and a better liquidity
position. Perceived access to credit is expected to improve with higher inflation, although in this case
the estimated coefficient on inflation expectation is not statistically significant.31
         Firms’ improved business and economic outlooks when they have higher inflation
expectations seemingly translate into their planned actions during the ELB. Contrary to our


30
   Similar results obtain when instrumenting firms’ inflation expectations with a 0-1 dummy variable (and time fixed
effects) to distinguish between uninformed and informed firms.
31
   The response of uncertainty to inflation expectations also differs from that in the full sample (rows 7 and 8). Whereas
estimates in the full sample indicated that higher inflation expectations led to higher uncertainty in both in the short-
and medium-term (with larger effects in the medium-term), during the ELB period we find instead that firms with
higher inflation expectations only expect higher uncertainty in the short-term (the coefficient becomes nearly five
times larger) but expect no more uncertainty in the medium-term than firms with lower inflation expectations.

                                                                                                                      28
findings over the entire sample, we now find that firms with higher inflation expectations (again
instrumented with information treatments) plan higher investment expenditures over a one-year
horizon and expect to expand their number of employees, consistent with them picturing a brighter
outlook for the firm (rows 9 and 10).
       Each of these results then points towards a stronger response for the expected path of future
prices changes during the ELB period. And this is what we find (row 11): firms with 1 percentage
point higher inflation expectations expect to raise their prices in the next 12 months by more than they
did over the full sample. Furthermore, firms with higher inflation expectations now emphasize more
than just raw materials prices as pushing them to raise their prices: they now cite a perceived increase
in the demand for their goods (row 12) and their competitors’ pricing decisions (row 15), in addition
to even higher expectations of prices for raw materials (row 13). The first two forces are consistent
with the fact that firms with higher inflation expectations anticipate an increased level of economic
activity as well as improved outlook for their own firm (the increase in demand for their goods).
Again, there is little change in perceptions of how labor costs will affect price pressures (row 14),
indicating that firms do not view higher inflation as translating in a significant way into higher wages
either in or out of the ELB.
       Overall, these findings indicate that in the period from 2014Q4 to 2018Q2 when the official
policy rates were at the effective lower bound, Italian firms associated higher inflation with better
aggregate outcomes and also improved conditions for their business, seemingly inducing them to
plan higher investment expenditures and hiring over the future, along with more pronounced price
increases than outside the ELB. However, given that the treatment was applied to a small set of
firms relative to the overall economy, the estimated effects on the actions of firms do not include
the general equilibrium effects that would follow if all firms in the economy were acting this way
and should therefore best be viewed as a lower bound of the effect of inflation expectations on
firms’ decisions at the ELB.
       One interpretation of these results is that they confirm a central prediction of New
Keynesian models, namely that the ELB leads to more positive demand-side effects of inflationary
shocks since these are associated with declines rather than increases in the real interest rate, due to
constraints on the central bank’ interest rate setting. While most work has focused on the extent to
which this applies for households, we provide new evidence that these differences extend to firms.
However, this is not the only possible explanation. There could have been other factors changing

                                                                                                     29
between 2014 and 2018 that could induce managers to respond differentially to news about
inflation. For example, the ECB launched its Quantitative Easing program in 2015 (see Hartmann
and Smets (forthcoming) for an overview of the ECB’s policies during the sample period). More
generally, if demand side shocks became more prevalent during the ELB period than previously,
and if managers were aware of this and correctly incorporated this information into their forecasts
and decisions, then we would expect to see a changing effect of inflation expectations on economic
decisions of firms: information about higher inflation could reveal the presence of positive demand
shocks during the ELB period rather than supply shocks prior to the ELB period, leading to
differential effects on employment and investment decisions. These two possible explanations—
there being a larger share of demand shocks during this time period versus supply shocks having
more demand side effects due to the ELB—are observationally equivalent in our data. We cannot
distinguish between these two possibilities.


7      Conclusion
Using a unique experiment that generates exogenous variation in the inflation expectations of firms in
Italy, we provide new evidence on the causal effect of inflation expectations on firms’ economic
decisions. These results are useful along several dimensions. First, they speak directly to the causal
effects of inflation expectations on economic behavior. While previous work has largely focused on
how inflation expectations of households relate to their consumption decisions, we show that firms’
inflation expectations directly affect their economic decisions as well. This suggests that
communication policies of central banks may be able to directly affect firms’ decisions through their
inflation expectations, if these policies can reach firms (Kumar et al. 2015, Coibion et al. 2018).
        Second, our results support predictions of New Keynesian models in which higher inflation
expectations have more positive effects on economic activity during periods of fixed nominal
interest rates. We find that firms with higher inflation expectations during the ELB raise their prices
more, hire more workers, utilize their credit lines more, and plan to do more investment than firms
with higher inflation expectations outside the ELB, likely due to the fact that the former expect
higher demand for their goods.
        More generally, our results also speak to the broader success of central banks’
communication strategies and the degree to which inflation targeting regimes have “anchored”
inflation expectations. Providing firms in Italy with recent information about inflation has large


                                                                                                      30
effects on their forecasts and significantly reduces the disagreement in their beliefs, suggesting
that they are largely unaware of recent inflation dynamics. This does not speak highly of their prior
knowledge of this readily-available information and suggests that central banks in general, and the
ECB in particular in this case, have a lot of room to improve the way they communicate with the
public. The transitory effects of information treatments on inflation expectations further suggest
that a successful communication strategy must not only be able to reach decision-makers within
firms but do so in a persistent way. Furthermore, our results illustrate how the way in which
individuals can interpret announcements about inflation may be context-dependent. One can see
this in the difference between how Italian firms respond to information treatments relative to firms
in New Zealand, as well as the differential response of Italian firms during the ELB.
Communications strategies that aim to change agents’ economic expectations therefore need to
incorporate the fact that different agents, or agents at different times, may not always draw the
same conclusions when faced with the same information. Understanding what drives this inference
by agents should be addressed in future research.

Notes: i and t index firms and time (survey waves). 𝐹 𝜋            is one-year-ahead inflation expectation of firm i in wave 𝑡. Treatment is equal to the most recent inflation rate
presented to a firm for treated firms and zero for control firms. Seasonal dummies for each sector are included but not reported. Other controls from Table 3 are included but not
reported. Estimation sample is 2012Q3-2019Q1. Standard errors reported in parentheses are as in Driscoll and Kraay (1998). ***, **, * denote statistical significance at 1, 5 and 10
percent level.

assignment into treatment and control groups is fixed (that is, firms cannot be re-assigned from one group to another after initial assignment), all regressors are
averages over the survey period. p-value (F stat) reports the probability value of all regressors (other than the constant) having zero coefficients. Average absolute
size of price changes is the average absolute value of responses to the following question: “In the last 12 months, what has been the average change in your firm’s
prices?”. Estimation sample is 2012Q3-2019Q1. ***, **, * denote statistical significance at 1, 5 and 10 percent level.

Notes: i and t index firms and time (survey waves). 𝐹 𝜋          is one-year-ahead inflation expectation of firm i in wave 𝑡 1. In
Panel A, the dependent variable is 𝑦      ≡ 𝑑𝑝 ,     where 𝑑𝑝 ,  is the average change in firm i’s prices over the previous 12 months
in period 𝑡 𝑘. In Panels B and C, the dependent variable is 𝑦     ≡ log 𝐿 , /𝐿 ,       where 𝐿 is the number of employees in firm
i at time 𝑡. In Panel D, the dependent variable is 𝑦   ≡𝑢,       𝑢,     where 𝑢 is the utilization rate of credit lines by firm i at time
t. In Panel E, the dependent variable is 𝑦     ≡ 𝐴𝑝𝑝 ,      ⋯ 𝐴𝑝𝑝 , where 𝐴𝑝𝑝 is the number of loan applications made by firm
i at time t. Specification is given by equation (3). Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is the estimation method. Seasonal dummies for
each sector are included but not reported. Other controls are included but not reported. Estimation sample is 2012Q3-2019Q1.
Standard errors reported in parentheses are as in Driscoll and Kraay (1998). ***, **, * denote statistical significance at 1, 5 and 10
