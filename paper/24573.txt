This paper investigates the causal effect of high school curriculum on various student outcomes
including academic performance at the university, happiness, physical and mental health, self-
confidence, confidence in academic ability, and attitudes towards studying and learning. We
exploit a curriculum reform in China, the implementation of which started in 2004. The reform
covered all provinces and municipal cities, and was rolled out in different years in different
provinces. The new curriculum pivoted away from the old lock-step course structure where all
students took the same courses and only those subject that were covered in the national university
entrance exam were considered important. In contrast, the new curriculum introduced a course
credit system, changed textbooks, and provided flexibility in course selection. It also introduced
elective courses and made such courses as arts and physical education mandatory, and a
graduation requirement. Using survey data on university students and employing a difference-in-
difference approach, we find that the students who were exposed to the new curriculum in high
school have better academic performance in university. They are happier, and their physical and
mental well-being is better. These students are more likely to have positive attitudes towards
themselves and they are more involved in student clubs. They have more confidence in their
academic ability, they have more positive attitudes towards studying, and they have more general
self-confidence. These results indicate that the reform had a significant impact on students’
academic success and well-being by allowing them to focus on subject matters in which they are
interested, and by reducing undue stress of a regimented curriculum.

           The Impact of High School Curriculum on Confidence, Academic Success, and
                     Mental and Physical Well-Being of University Students


I.      Introduction

        It is well documented that educational attainment has a causal impact on wages (see Card

1999, Meghir and Rivkin 2011 for reviews). Primarily motived by the fact that there is substantial

heterogeneity in the financial returns to the quantity of schooling between countries as well as

within a country, a parallel literature has investigated the extent to which the quality of education

impacts student outcomes. Specifically, researchers have analyzed whether the structure of the

delivery of education and the course content have an impact on students test scores, on students’

propensity to attain more education, and on their future labor market success. 1

        One major branch of this literature examines the extent to which students’ future

achievements and behaviors are impacted by what is taught in the classroom. For example, Brown

et al. (2016) analyzed whether high school courses in financial education, mathematics and

economic influence students’ financial debt when they become adults. Similarly, Bernheim et al.

(2001) investigated the impact of exposure to financial curricula in high school on asset

accumulation in adulthood. Altonji (1995), Levine and Zimmerman (1995), and Joensen and

Nielsen (2009) are examples of the inquiry into whether taking advanced math and science classes

in high school has an impact on labor market outcomes. Other examples of research that investigate

the impact of high school curriculum and course content include Rose and Betts (2004) who

reported that specific high school math courses influence earnings of students one decade after

graduation, and Cole et al. (2016) who showed that state-mandated mathematics courses taken as



1
  These analyses include such inquiries as whether the length of the school year and additional instructional
time influence student learning, achievement and subsequent earnings (Lavy 2015, Pischke 2007) and
whether homework is beneficial to students learning (Eren and Henderson 2008).

                                                     1
part of the high school curriculum lead to more investment income and better credit management

in the future.

        This literature, briefly summarized above, has two important attributes. First, the

overwhelming majority of research employed data from developed countries, particularly the

United States. Second, research has focused on outcomes such as students’ likelihood of attending

college, their choice of college major, or financial decisions and labor market outcomes in the

future. 2 A notable exception is a recent paper by Cantoni et al. (2017) which exploited a curriculum

reform in China and analyzed the impact of the reform on students’ political attitudes. This Chinese

reform, the implementation of which started in 2004, was rolled out through different provinces of

China until 2012 3. As we detail in Section II and as described in Cantoni et al. (2017), the reform

was a major overhaul of the high school curriculum. The reform changed the textbooks and

significantly modified the way in which classes are taught. Teachers underwent training for the

new curriculum. A major component of the new curriculum was the introduction of a system that

allowed the students to take elective courses in many subjects, which in turn provided flexibility

for students to focus on subject matters in which they were interested. The new curriculum also

placed emphasis on physical education by making it impossible to replace a physical education

class with math or science classes, which had been typical practice under the old curriculum to

better prepare the students for the high-stakes university entrance exam. 4

 A technical summary of the literature on the impact of high school curriculum on college choice and labor
market outcomes is provided by Altonji, Blom and Meghir (2012).
3
  The preparation for the reform started in 1999. This curriculum reform covered the entire basic education
system in China. We focus on the high school curriculum in this study. We discuss the details of the reform
in section II.
4
 As described in section II, the new curriculum mandates the students to take 198 45-minute physical
education classes over three years in high school to be able to graduate.

                                                    2
       Cantoni et al. (2017) focus on the impact of high school politics classes of this new

curriculum. The authors argue that the politics classes of the new curriculum were designed for

“moral and ideological education” (Cantoni el al. p. 346), and they show that the contents of the

new politics classes matched the government’s objective of shaping students’ political and social

beliefs. The authors find that students who were exposed to the new curriculum have more positive

views on China’s governance and that they are more skeptical of free markets. This result implies

that classroom instruction and course content can be a vehicle through which students can be

indoctrinated, and through which their political views can be shaped.

       In this paper we use the same Chinese high school curriculum reform to estimate the causal

effect of the reform on students’ educational success in university, on their mental health as well

as physical well-being. We also analyze the extent to which the reform had an impact on students’

happiness, self-confidence, and confidence in their academic ability.

       The hypothesis that students’ physical well-being (measured by the body mass index), and

their mental health could be impacted by the curriculum reform is motivated directly by the goals,

the structure and the implementation of the reform. For example, the reform placed emphasis on

physical education with specific goals of instilling exercise habits in high school students and by

making physical education a graduation requirement. While physical education was almost always

substituted away with a math or science class under the old curriculum, the design of the new

curriculum makes it impossible to avoid physical education classes.

       The reform alleviated excessive academic burden on students by eliminating the mandatory

block course structure where each student had to take the same required courses. Under the new

curriculum, the workload in traditional core courses such as mathematics, physics, history, and so

on, is significantly reduced. More specifically, the new curriculum reduced the classroom hours



                                                3
for the required courses and introduced elective courses. These elective courses cover almost all

subjects, including core subjects such as mathematics, physics, biology, and chemistry. Students

can also take elective courses in many other subject ranging from information technology to

history to geography. Thus, students were provided with the option of taking courses in the subjects

of their interest, rather than being forced to take a pre-determined sequence of classes. The new

curriculum also introduced an “independent research studies” course which is designed to enhance

students’ skills for independent study and to cultivate their creativity. These major changes in

curriculum arguably increased student learning by allowing students to focus on subject matters in

which they are interested, and by reducing undue stress of a regimented curriculum.

        We employ data from the Beijing College Students Panel Survey (BCSPS), which contains

information on about 4,250 undergraduates from 15 universities in and around Beijing. 5 Using a

difference-in-difference strategy, we exploit cohort-varying exposure to the curriculum reform. In

each province, younger students were exposed to the new reform while older students completed

high school under the old curriculum. Students from different provinces were “treated” by the new

curriculum in different years because provinces started their implementation of the new curriculum

in different years (see Table 1).

        We find that the new curriculum had a significant and positive effect on students’

educational success in university and on their attitudes towards learning. Specifically, students

who are exposed to the new curriculum in high school receive more “A” grades in university, and

they rank higher among their peers by grade point average in comparison to those who studied

under the old curriculum. Students of the new curriculum are more likely to reveal a willingness



5
 Cantoni et al. (2017) used data on 1,954 undergraduate students from Peking University., and exploited
cohort-varying exposure to the curriculum reform to identify the impact of the new curriculum on students’
political views.

                                                    4
to learn and to master the course material. These students are also more engaged in social activities

(student clubs) in university, and have more confidence in their academic abilities, and more self-

confidence generally.

       The new curriculum also made students more likely to retain a healthy body mass index,

and less likely to have mental health issues such as feeling sad and melancholic, feeling depressed,

feeling panicked, and feeling as though their own life has no value. Students who attended high

school under the new curriculum are also happier. These results, taken together, indicate that the

education reform had a significant impact on students’ academic success and well-being.

       In Section II we provide the background regarding the curriculum reform in China (the

Eighth Curriculum Reform). Empirical framework is explained in Section III. The data used in the

paper are presented in Section IV. The empirical results and robustness checks of the results are

reported in Section V and VI. Section VII is the conclusion.



II.    The Eighth Curriculum Reform in China

Timing of the Eighth Curriculum Reform
       The so-called Eighth Curriculum Reform, implemented by Chinese central government,

aimed at substantially increasing the quality of basic education in the country. One of the primary

goals of the reform was to abandon the rigorous exam-oriented education system, which had been

widely criticized (Dello-Iacovo 2009). The Eighth Curriculum Reform is one of the most

ambitious education reforms that aims to provide su shi jiao yu (quality education) in China. The

reform covered the entire basic education system including preschool, compulsory education

(primary school and middle school) and high school. In this paper we focus on the part of the

curriculum reform that targeted high schools, the enactment of which began in 2004.



                                                 5
        The implementation of the high school curriculum reform took place in different years in

different provinces. Following the preparation phase of the reform between 1999 and 2003, the

high school curriculum reform was first formally implemented in 2004 in four provinces

(Shandong, Hainan, Guangdong and Ningxia) in China. Other provinces and municipal cities

joined the reform in succession in the following eight years until 2012.

        In Table 1 we provide the year in which each province or municipal city started the

implementation of the new high school curriculum. 6 The beginning year of the reform’s

implementation in a province was not random. It depended on whether the provinces or municipal

cities were ready in training teachers and providing supplemental materials (Cantoni et al. 2017).

Although there is no clear pattern in the timing of the introduction of the new curriculum among

the provinces, we conduct a variety of robustness tests and placebo analyses to verify that our

results are not driven by endogenous rolling out of the program.

Goals of the New Curriculum
        According to the “Basic Education Curriculum Reform Outline 7” issued by the Ministry

of Education of China in 2001, the reform has some general targets including “developing students’

initial creativity, practical capability, scientific and human accomplishment, and environmental

consciousness,” “shaping students with strong body and good psychological health; helping

students form healthy aesthetic taste and life style,” “shaping students with patriotism, collectivism




6
 Cantoni et al. (2017) write that the high school curriculum reform started in the Guangxi province in 2010.
We find, however, that, the Guangxi province started implementing the curriculum reform in 2012.
Specifically, Guangxi province issued the “Guangxi Regular High School Curriculum Reform
Implementation Plan” in January 2012, announcing that Guangxi province would start the high school
curriculum reform in that year. http://www.gxedu.gov.cn/Item/3318.aspx.

and the love for socialism,” and “equipping students with the conscience of socialist democracy,

the rule of law and social responsibility,” 8

         There are six specific implementation goals of the reform as stated in the “Basic Education

Curriculum Reform Outline”. These goals are outlined as (1) Change the existing curriculum,

which puts too much emphasis on imparting knowledge to students, to a new curriculum to

emphasize helping students form positive and active attitudes towards study. Make the process of

learning become a process of acquiring the ability to learn and forming correct values for students;

(2) Change the current curriculum, which contains too many subjects, to a more balanced

comprehensive and selected curriculum. Adjust the curriculum to satisfy different needs of

students in different areas in China; (3) Reduce the workload of students by removing the “hard,

sophisticated, seldom-used and outdated” contents from courses. Pay attention to students’ actual

interest, and select the most fundamental knowledge and skills for students which could provide

lifelong benefits to students; (4) Change the current style of cramming-teaching which only

requires students to memorize and accept what is taught in class, and cultivate students’ abilities

in collecting and processing information, acquiring knowledge, analyzing and solving problems

independently, as well as in communication and cooperation; (5) Employ the curriculum to

improve students’ development, teachers’ teaching skills and class quality, instead of screening or

selecting students; (6) Improve the adaptation of the curriculum to students and schools by

changing the centralized management of curriculum to a 3-tier management at national, local and

the school level.




8
 Whether the reform was successful in hitting the first target (shaping students with patriotism, collectivism
and the love for socialism) was analyzed by Cantoni et al. (2017).

                                                      7
Specific Changes in the Curriculum
        Detailed implementation plans of the high school curriculum reform are stated in the

“Regular High School Curriculum Project (Trial) 9 ” which were issued by the Ministry of

Education of China in 2003. First, although the standard compulsory classes of the old curriculum

(Chinese, foreign languages, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, history, politics and

geography) are retained, subjects of general technology and information technology are added to

the new curriculum. In addition, the new curriculum required students to enroll in new courses

such as social practice and investigate studies, as well as community service. Second, the number

of hours devoted to compulsory classes during high school are reduced substantially, and elective

classes are introduced. Third, a credit system is introduced to determine the weight of each subject

in the overall curriculum and to evaluate the performance of students. Specific requirements on

the number of credits must be fulfilled in order for students to graduate from high school.

        Under the old system, only those subjects which would be tested in the national university

entrance exams were considered as necessary part of the curriculum. Thus, under the old

curriculum students usually did not take or they took only a few of the so-called “subsidiary

courses” such as music or physical education because these courses were not covered with China’s

national university entrance exam 10. In contrast, the new curriculum made it mandatory for all

students to take a specific number of minimum credits in all subject including physical education

10
  In China, all students who wish to go to college must attend the national college entrance examination
(negligible number of students may have the chance to be accepted by a university directly, without taking
the college entrance exam, due to their special talents or awards received in national or international
competitions). The total scores of a student in the exam decides whether the student will be accepted by a
university or not. In the college entrance exams, all students are required to take exams on Chinese, math
and English. If a student follows the Arts track in high school, then student also needs to take exams on the
subjects of history, politics and geography. If a student follows the Science track in high school, the student
also needs to take exams on the subjects of physics, chemistry and biology.
                                                      8
and art. This meant that the new curriculum forced the students to take classes such as arts and

physical education even though these classes are not the focus of the university entrance exams.

       In the new curriculum subjects such as Chinese, mathematics and physics contain elective

components, in addition to being compulsory. These elective courses cover additional topics that

could be of interest to students. More generally, electives include two levels of courses. The so-

called “Elective I” courses are required to be provided in all high schools, while schools are

required to provide “Elective II” courses based on their local attributes and students’ interests. In

these elective classes, students use separate textbooks which are different from the textbooks used

in compulsory courses. This design allows students to have more freedom in the subjects they

study compared to students who went to high school under the old curriculum.

       In contrast to the old lock-step curriculum in which all student took the same, mandatory

classes, the new curriculum established a credit system. Students earn 2 credits by studying a

module (containing 36 classes, each of which is 45 minutes long) and they need to pass a test on

the material covered in that module. The new curriculum requires students to complete a minimum

number of credits in each compulsory subject and at least a certain amount of total credits in

elective courses to graduate from high school. Students covered by the new curriculum are required

to spend relatively more time on investigative studies, arts and physical education than on subjects

such as physics and chemistry. For example, according to the new curriculum, the minimum

number of credits required for chemistry (the compulsory section) is 6 during the three academic

years in high school, while the number of credits required for arts, physical education and health,

and investigative study are 6, 11 and 15, respectively. In addition, the new curriculum requires

students to participate in comprehensive social activities (such as community service). All

students are required to attend at least one week of social practice each year and they are also



                                                 9
required to engage in at least 10 days of community service to earn credit. As a consequence, under

the new curriculum, students have less workload in the traditional “major subjects” such as math,

chemistry, history, etc., but have more time to devote to subject of their interest, to arts and do

physical exercise. They also spend more time out of school to engage in social activities.



Changes in Textbooks
        Along with the re-design of the curriculum, textbooks for all subjects were re-written. The

new textbooks in all subjects changed dramatically in a number of dimensions, including the

purpose, structure, content and difficulty. The new textbooks were designed under the guidance of

the core goal of the curriculum reform to alter the exam-oriented focus, to increase students’

interest in the subject matters and to cultivate the ability to study independently. For example, as

stated in the “Curriculum Standards of Mathematics in Regular High School 11”, one purpose of

the new mathematics textbook is to help students develop the ability to acquire knowledge in

mathematics independently, which was not the goal of the old version of the textbook. The contents

of the new and old versions of the math textbooks are also different. In the new textbook of the

compulsory math courses, only the most fundamental knowledge in mathematics is presented. A

series of other topics in mathematics are covered in elective mathematics courses. These optional

elective courses include topics on the history of mathematics, economic mathematics, the

application of mathematics on information security and so on, which were not covered in old

textbooks. The new math textbook also integrated the concept of mathematical modeling into

every topic in the book to help develop students’ creativity and capacity of thinking analytically.

Similar significant changes can be found in the textbooks in all other subjects 12.



Teacher Training and Exams

        As part of the new curriculum reform teachers underwent extensive training to equip them

with skills to teach the new curriculum. Local governments were asked to formulate and implement

their own schedules to train teachers for the new curriculum. No teacher was allowed to work until

he/she completed the training program. Besides fully understanding the new curriculum, teachers

were instructed to develop better teaching skills and methods. Teachers were coached to cultivate

in students the ability to work independently and motivate students to question, investigate, and

research 13.

        The “Basic Education Curriculum Reform Outline” states that a new student evaluation

system should be established. Specifically, the goal of this new evaluation system is not only pay

attention to students’ scores in exams, but to also focus on students’ potential in all dimensions,

and to help students build their identify and self-confidence. To be consistent with the new

curriculum, local education authorities started to change the national university entrance exam

accordingly. For example, Shandong province (one of the first four provinces to employ the new




12
  As another example, in the physics textbook of the new curriculum students are only required to learn
materials in mechanics and electricity, while under the old curriculum students were required to study
mechanics, electricity, thermodynamics, optics and atoms. The Ministry of Education of China published
the standard curriculum for regular high schools for 15 subjects (such as Chinese, math, English, physics,
chemistry, physical education and health, arts, etc.) in 2003, which contain all the details of the curriculum
for each subject.

Outline” and the “Opinions from the Ministry of Education on Further Enhancement of Teacher Training
for the New Basic Curriculum”, issued by the Ministry of Education of China.


                                                     11
curriculum) changed the structure and contents of its university entrance exam in 2007 14. A newly

designed comprehensive test was added to the university entrance exam. This comprehensive test

covered materials in the subjects of arts, technology (general and information), physical education

and health, and so on. The comprehensive test accounts for 60 (out of 750) points of the university

entrance exam 15. Other provinces and municipal cities adjusted their university entrance exams as

well.



III.    Empirical Strategy

        We employ a difference-in-difference strategy to investigate the causal effect of China’s

Eighth Curriculum Reform of High Schools on student outcomes in university by estimating the

following specification:

(1)               𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝑋𝑋′𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜷𝜷𝟑𝟑 + 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 + 𝜃𝜃𝑝𝑝 + 𝜆𝜆𝑐𝑐 + 𝛾𝛾 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖

        where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 stands for the outcome of university student 𝑖𝑖 who entered high school as part

of cohort j in province p. Outcomes include educational success of the student in university,

measured by such variables as the number of courses in which the student received an “A,” the

current rank of the student in his/her class in university, whether the student skipped major classes

last semester. Other outcomes include variables that gauge the extent of the student’s enthusiasm

for learning: whether the student wants to learn more from each class, and how much he/she wants

to master the class materials. We also use as dependent variables two indicators of student’s self-

confidence in their ability to learn: whether he/she is confident in mastering class material and



14
  The national university entrance exams in China are held by each province and municipal city. Some
provinces and municipal cities may employ the same tests, but some areas administer their own tests.

15
  Details can be found in the “Guidance Plan for Regular College Admission in Shandong Province 2007”.
http://kszy.jnjyw.edu.cn/kcgg/200412/795.html.

                                                           12
whether the student is confident that he/she can solve the hardest problems in during the

coursework.

       Other dependent variables are indicators of physical and mental health (a healthy BMI, and

various measures of mental well-being), the level of happiness of the student, and indicators of

being self-content. Detailed definitions of the dependent variables are discussed below in the Data

section.

       Our main explanatory variable 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is an indicator that takes the value of

one if cohort j in province p entered high school when the new curriculum was in effect. The

coefficient 𝛽𝛽 captures the effect of the curriculum reform on the outcomes of interest; 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 and 𝜃𝜃𝑝𝑝

stand for a set of high school cohort fixed effects and province fixed effects, respectively. λc

represents university fixed effects associated with the 15 universities in the sample, γ is the fixed

effect that distinguishes between two levels of students surveyed (freshmen and juniors), and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 is

the error term. Standard errors are clustered at province×high school cohort level.

       The vector Xijp contains demographics information of the students, including age, gender,

ethnicity status, and single child status. Also included in X are variables related to the family

background of the student including parents’ educational level and self-reported family social

status. Definitions of these covariates are displayed in Table 2.

       The results are not confounded by fixed differences between provinces such as cultural

factors, because such time-invariant differences are captured by province fixed-effects, and

identification is obtained from cross-cohort variation within a province. Similarly, potential

differences in attitudes and preferences across cohorts are filtered out by cohort fixed-effects.

Furthermore, the students we analyze are only two years apart in age (ignoring the small group of

irregular students, such as those who took the university entrance exam multiple times). As


                                                    13
highlighted in Cantoni et al. (2017) who used the same identification strategy, the timing of the

introduction of the new curriculum across provinces was not random, but differences between

provinces and across cohorts are accounted for in the specification shown in Equation (1).

Extensions of this specification are discussed later in the paper.     Finally, we entertain the

possibility that the introduction of the new curriculum might be a function of cohort-specific

school spending. To account for this potential confounding, in some specifications we also control

for province-and cohort-specific education spending per high school student when the student was

in high school.

       Table 1 presents information on the introduction of the new curriculum in each province.

Columns (1) shows the year in which the province started implementing the new curriculum

reform and column (2) presents the year when the first cohorts of students, who studied under the

new curriculum, graduated from high school. High school graduation years are the same as

university entry years. This is because the highs school ends in the Spring, university entrance

exam takes place in June, and classes start in September.



IV.    Data

Descriptive Statistics of the Sample

       The data set used in this study is the Beijing College Students Panel Survey (BCSPS)16.

We employ the only publicly available wave of 2009. The sample contains university students who

were surveyed towards the end of the Spring semester, in June 2009. The survey, by design,

includes only freshmen and juniors. This means that students in the sample entered universities


16
   The data can be downloaded from the Chinese National Survey Data Archive (CNSDA).
http://www.cnsda.org/index.php?r=projects/view&id=93659073. The survey is called CSDPS in the
CNSDA.


                                               14
either in the Fall of 2006 or in the Fall of 2008 17 . Students were randomly sampled from 15

universities in and around Beijing (Li, 2016). These students entered high school in 2003 or 2005.

The sample, however, also includes some students who entered high school in 2001, 2002 or 2004.

These are the students who took the university entrance exam more than once, and are enrolled in

a university after they (typically) took the exam one year after high school graduation. As we show

later, dropping these students from the analysis has no impact on the results. We drop students

from Tibet, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau from the analyses because they come from a

completely different high school systems and curricula 18.

        Direct information on students’ year of entry to high school is not available. We do,

however, know the year in which each student took the national university entrance exam. We also

know how many times the students took the exam. Because the university entrance exam is held

once a year, we can accurately determine the year in which the student entered high school.

Locations of students’ high schools are also provided in the data set. Therefore, we can determine

whether the students were treated by the new curriculum in high school based on the high school

entrance year of the students, the location of the students’ high school, and the timing of

introduction of the new curriculum in each province and municipal cities 19.



17
  By design of the survey, all students should be university freshmen and juniors. Nineteen students,
however, reported that they were sophomores. Because the survey was conducted in June 2009, it might be
the case that these students could have reported themselves as rising sophomores (who have completed
their first year of university and will become sophomores in the Fall). It also may be the case that these
students simply did not provide the correct answers. As we will explain later, in order to determine the high
school cohort of the students, we need to know the current matriculation levels of the university students.
Therefore, we drop these 19 students from the sample.
18
  A total of 38 observations (less than 1% of the sample) are dropped under all these restrictions. Including
these observations do not affect the results.
19
  Shanghai did not participate in the eighth national curriculum reform. As the most developed area and
the pioneer in education reform in China, Shanghai implemented its own curriculum reform in 1998 which
had similar goals as the national curriculum reform (Yin, 2013; OECD, 2016-3). All students from

                                                     15
        In Table 2, we present the summary statistics of student attributes. As shown in column (1),

only about eight percent of the sample went to high school under the new curriculum. This is

because the survey was conducted in Summer 2009, and as displayed in Table 1, with the exception

of Shanghai, the implementation of the reform did not start until 2004. This, in turn, implies that

the students who studied under the new curriculum started graduating from high school in 2007

(with the exception of “treated” high school students from Shanghai, who started graduating in

2001). Thus, most students in the sample attended high school under the old curriculum. By design

of the data collection, only university freshmen and juniors are surveyed, and 48 percent of the

sample are juniors. Above Average Family Social Status is a dummy variable which takes the value

of one if the student indicated that his/her family’s social status is better or much better than the

average in their city/town.

        Columns (3) and (4) of Table 2 display the means of the variables by curriculum type, and

reveal that some attributes are different between students who went to school under the old and

the new curricula. Not surprisingly, those who studied under the old curriculum are about one

year older on average, and they are more likely to be juniors in university (as opposed to being

freshmen). Father education, family social status, and minority status are also different between

the two groups. These raw differences disappear, however, when we control for province fixed

effects and high school cohort fixed effects. As shown in Table 3, and as reported by Cantoni et

al. (2017, Table 2), once we adjust for these fixed-effects, there is no difference in personal

attributes of the students who were exposed to the new curriculum and those who studied under

the old curriculum. Specifically, Table 3 displays the results of the exercise that investigates if the



Shanghai are considered as being treated by the new curriculum in the analyses. As shown in the paper, the
results do not change when we exclude the students from Shanghai from the analysis.


                                                   16
sample is balanced in student attributes by curriculum type. Each row presents the results from a

different regression where the dependent variables are listed in columns (1) to (8) and the entries

are the estimated coefficients and standard errors of the New Curriculum dummy. Each regression

includes province and cohort fixed effects. The results of Table 3 indicate that exposure to the

new curriculum is not correlated with student attributes ranging from age to gender to parental

education.



Dependent Variables

        The dependent variables measure students’ educational outcomes in university, their

confidence in their academic ability, level of happiness, healthy body mass index, mental health,

self-confidence, and attitudes towards studying. The descriptive statistics of the outcome variables

are provided in Table 4.

        The variables that gauge the educational outcomes include the total number of “A” grades

received by the student during the first semester in university. The reason to ask this question as

“first semester in university” is because about half of the sample are freshmen students and they

were in their second semester when they took the survey (the survey was registered towards the

end of the Spring semester). Thus, the grades in the spring semester of the freshmen year were

not yet known when the survey was taken. Another variable measuring university success is

student’s current rank (by GPA) in university. Along the same lines, “Often Skipped Classes in

Major Courses” is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if the student declared that he/she

often skipped classes in major courses during the previous semester. “Number of Clubs Joined”

stands for the number of student clubs the student has become a member of, representing student’s

sociability.



                                                17
        There are two variables measuring attitudes towards studying. The variable “Wants to

Learn as Much as Possible” takes the value of one if the student agreed or completely agreed with

the statement “I want to learn as much knowledge as possible from classes.” Similarly, “Strong

desire to master course material” is another indicator variable that takes the value of one if the

student agreed or completely agreed with that statement.

        Students’ confidence in their academic ability is measured by two dummy variables, which

take the value of one if the students agreed or completely agreed with the statements “I believe I

can master the knowledge and materials covered in class” and “I believe I can solve the hardest

problem in class.” Self-confidence is measured by two indicators based on whether the student

agreed or completely agreed with the statements that “I tend to think myself as a loser” and “I hold

a positive attitude towards myself.” The student were also asked to rate their level of happiness on

a 100 points scale where higher scores represents a higher level of happiness.

        We employ 10 indicators of mental health. 20 The survey asked the students to report how

much they agree with the following statements regarding how they felt during the preceding week

1) “I feel sad and melancholic”; 2) “I feel depressed”; 3) “I feel that I can become unhappy easily”;

4) “I feel that there is nothing to expect for”; 5) “I lose interest in almost everything”; 6) “I feel

that I cannot acquire any joy from what I do”; 7) “I feel panicked”; 8) “I feel perturbed”; 9) “I feel

that my life has no value at all”, 10) “I sometimes get scared for no reason.” Potential answers to

these questions include “Does not apply at all”, “Sometimes applies”, “Often applies” and

“Completely applies”. We created indicators that take the value of one if the corresponding answer

was “often applies” or “completely applies.” Averaging these 10 indicators of mental and



20
  There are additional questions in the survey that can be considered as indicators of mental health, albeit
less obviously. Analyses of those questions are reported in the Appendix.


                                                    18
emotional health, we created the variable Mental Health Index. Higher values indicate poorer

mental health.

        Physical well-being is measured using the Body Mass index (BMI). The data set includes

information on the height and weight of each student. Using this information we calculated the

BMI for each individual to determine if the BMI is in the healthy range of 18.5 to 23.9. 21 22



V.      Results

        The baseline results of our difference-in-difference estimations regarding the educational

outcomes, confidence in academic ability and academic attitudes (willingness to learn) are

presented in Table 5A. The results pertaining to physical and mental health, self-confidence and

happiness are provided in Table 5B.

          All regressions include province fixed effects high school cohort fixed effects, and a

dummy to indicate that the student is a freshman. Standard errors are clustered at the province-by-

cohort level. The results, displayed in column (1) of Table 5A show that students who are exposed

to the new curriculum receive about 0.5 more “A” grades in their first semester in university in

comparison to students who attended high school under the old regime. Students treated by the

new curriculum rank about 4 student higher in their class. The results also show that students who

studied under the new curriculum join more clubs, and they are less likely to skip class although

this last effect is not statistically different from zero.



21
  The range for healthy BMI (18.5-23.9) among Chinese is suggested by “Guidance for Preventing
Overweight and Obesity among Chinese Adults” issued by the Ministry of Health of China.
22
  In our sample more than 99 percent of college students have a BMI lower than 30, which is the cutoff
level for obesity. Thus, there would not be almost no variation in the dependent variable if we used obesity
as an outcome.


                                                    19
        Table 5A also demonstrates that the new curriculum increased students’ confidence in their

academic ability and their eagerness to master the course material. Specifically, students who

attended high school under the new curriculum are 6 to 7 percentage points (20 percent) more

likely to indicate that they are confident that they can master the class material and that they can

solve the hardest problems. They are about 4 percentage points (6 percent) more likely to reveal

that they want to learn as much as possible, and 8 percentage points (14 percent) more likely to

say that they have a strong desire to master the class material.

        Column (2) of Table 5A adds individual controls to the baseline model. These variables

are listed in Table 2. The inference does not change, which is not surprising as individual attributes

are not expected to be correlated with the introduction of the new curriculum in the province. It

may be argued that provinces that initiated the implementation of the new curriculum earlier than

others did so because they had more resources in comparison to other provinces and that these

resources, and not the curriculum itself, may have impacted student outcomes in university. To

guard against this possibility, we obtained data on total education expenditures per high school

student at the provincial level in each year. The data are from the China Educational Finance

Statistical Yearbooks. We averaged the per pupil education expenditures over the 3 years in high

school for each high school cohort in each province. 23 Column (3) of Table 5A shows that

controlling for per pupil education spending in high school has no impact on the estimated

coefficients.

        Table 5B presents the effect of the high school curriculum reform on students’ happiness,

physical health (whether their BMI is in the healthy range) and indicators of mental health when


23
  For example, for students who entered high school in 2003 in a given province, the educational spending
for those students is the average educational spending in that province in between 2003 and 2005, the period
during with the students were in high school.


                                                    20
they are in university. The results indicate that students who studied under the new curriculum are

happier in comparison to students who studied under the old curriculum. The magnitude of the

difference is around one point from a baseline average of 83 points. We also find that students

who went to high school under the new curriculum in high school are about 7 percentage points

(10 percent) more likely to have a healthy body mass index.

           Table 5B also presents the estimated effects of the new curriculum on various mental

health indicators. Because we measure multiple aspects of mental health that are similar, we adjust

the p-values for multiple comparisons using the improved Benforroni correction method of Simes

(Simes 1986, Newson 2010, Benjamini and Yekutieli 2001). 24 Adjusted p-values, which are

presented in column (5), are only slightly larger than the unadjusted p-values in column (4), and

they don’t alter the inference. Studying under the new curriculum improves the mental health of

the students. For example, those who studied under the new curriculum in high school are nine

percentage points less likely to feel sad or melancholic, and they are 5 percentage points less likely

to feel depressed. The magnitude of the impact of the new curriculum is about the same in other

indicators of mental health, and new curriculum generates an improvement in overall mental health.

Specifically, exposure to the new curriculum reduces the mental health index by four percentage

points, which represents a 28 percent improvement in mental health (the mental health is the

average of the 10 indicators mental health difficulties). Appendix Table A1 displays the results

that use some other outcomes that arguably gauge mental stress of the student. The regressions

are based on the specification used in column (3) of Table 5B. The results are in line with those

reported in Table 6B.




24
     Examples of this implementation include Kottelenberg and Lehrer (2017) and Erten and Keskin (2018).

                                                    21
VI.    Robustness, Extensions, and Placebo Tests

       We implement a series of tests to evaluate the robustness of the results. We start with the

investigation of the sensitivity of results to variations in sample composition. First, we exclude

students from Shanghai. As discussed earlier, Shanghai implemented its own curriculum reform

with similar goals in 1998. Thus, in models reported in Tables 5A and 5B, university students

from Shanghai high schools are considered as being treated by the new curriculum. As shown in

column (1) of Tables 6A and 6B, dropping 68 students from Shanghai did not alter the results.

       Column (2) drops 243 students who enrolled at a university without taking the university

entrance exam.       High school students in China can get acceptance to universities by

recommendation, without taking the university entrance exam. Some high schools have quotas to

recommend students to particular universities. The primary mechanism is winning a prize in a

competition in a subject such as Chinese, English, Math, etc. Students can also be recommended

to universities for winning a title such as "outstanding student" or "outstanding student leader." In

addition, students may get accepted by universities if they have learned some minority language.

Excluding these students did not alter the results. Finally, Column (3) of Tables 6A and 6B

excludes students who took the university exam multiple times. There are 723 students in this

group, and dropping them had no impact on the results either.

       Tables 7A and 7B investigate the sensitivity of the results to variations in model

specification. As was the case in all previous models, each regression controls for province fixed

effects, high school cohort fixed effects, university fixed effects, and an indicator to control for

whether the student is a freshman or junior in university. Column (1) in Tables 7A and 7B presents

the results displayed in column (3) Tables 5A and 5B for comparison purposes. These models

include student attributes as well as education spending per high school student in the province of



                                                 22
the student when the student was in high school. Column (2) adds time-varying province-level

controls. They are the size of the cohort (the number of students) entering high school in the

province, and per capita income of the province when the cohorts entered high school. The results

do not change.

       It could be the case the income differences between provinces before the implementation

of the curriculum reform (in 2003) could be systematically related to differences across cohorts.

Thus, Column (3) controls for cohort fixed effects interacted with per capita income in student’s

province in 2003 (the year before the beginning of the reform implementation). The results are

not impacted by this modification either.

       To investigate if student attributes are different between the old vs. new curricula, we used

the student characteristics used in the regressions to predict our outcome variables, and tested

whether the predicted outcomes were different between the curricula. The result of this exercise,

displayed in Appendix Table A2 indicates that the impact of the new curriculum on predicted

outcomes is indistinguishable from zero.

       As an additional robustness check we investigated whether students from a particular

province were driving the results. To do that, we estimated the benchmark model shown in column

(3) of Tables 5A and 5B by dropping one province at a time. Panels of Figure 1 displays the

estimated coefficients with their 90-percent confidence intervals. As shown in Figure 1, the results

are not driven by a particular province.

       Cantoni et al. (2017) analyzed the impact of the same curriculum reform on political beliefs

of students who attend Peking University and found that the reform shaped the beliefs of these

students. Our sample differs from theirs as we have students from 15 different universities. To

investigate if we obtain a similar result in our sample, we employ two variables that measure the



                                                23
degree to which the students are satisfied with China’s current level of development, and how

optimistic they are about China’s future economic development. This analysis uses as dependent

variables the scores (from 0 to 100) assigned by the students to two questions: “How satisfied are

you with China’s current level of development in all aspects?” and “How optimistic are you about

the prospect of China’s development in all aspects in the future?”

       Appendix Table A3 shows that the new high school curriculum enhances students’

optimism about China’s current and future economic development. Those university students who

studied under the new curriculum are about 2 percent more satisfied with China’s current economic

conditions in comparison to students who studies under the old curriculum, and they are 3 percent

more optimistic about China’s future economic development.

       As a placebo test, we randomly assigned the years of the introduction of the new curricula

to the provinces in the sample. Specifically, we used the actual implementation dates and

randomly assigned them to the provinces in our sample without replacement. We repeated this

process with 10,000 placebo treatments and estimated the outcomes using the benchmark

specifications employed in column (3) of Tables 5A and 5B. We plot the distribution of the t-

statistics obtained from these 10,000 random placebo treatments in Figure 2. The vertical line in

each figure marks the location of the t-statistic obtained from the actual treatment (based on the

results rein column 3 of Tables 5A and 5B). Each panel of Figure 2 also displays the share of the

t-statistics obtained from placebo regressions that is larger than the actual t-statistic. The results

show that randomly assigning placebo treatments provide very different results when the actual t-

values estimated in the papers indicated significant effects. These results, taken together, indicate

that the findings reported in the paper are robust, and that they are not an artifact of confounders.




                                                 24
VII Conclusion


       In this paper we investigate the causal effect of a high school curriculum reform in China

on students’ educational outcomes in university, as well as on their happiness, mental and physical

health, self-confidence, confidence in their academic ability, and attitudes towards learning. The

reform, the implementation of which started in 2004, covered all provinces of China and it was

rolled out in different years in different provinces.

       The new curriculum, which is major overhaul, pivoted away from the old lock-step course

structure where all students took the same required courses and only those subjects that were

covered in the national university entrance exam were considered important. In contrast, the

reform introduced a course credit system, changed the textbooks, and significantly modified the

way in which classes are taught, and allowed the students to take elective courses in many subjects.

The new curriculum also introduced an “independent research studies” course which is designed

to enhance students’ skills for independent study and to cultivate their creativity.

       In addition, the new curriculum made such courses as arts (music and painting) and

physical education mandatory and a graduation requirement. The new curriculum also placed

emphasis on physical education with specific goals of instilling exercise habits in high school

students, and by making it impossible to replace a physical education class with math or science

classes, which had been the typical practice under the old curriculum to better prepare the students

for the high-stakes university entrance exam.

       Using survey data on students from 15 universities and employing a difference-in-

differences strategy, we exploit cohort-varying exposure to the curriculum reform. We find that

the curriculum reform had a significant and positive effect on all student outcomes analyzed.

Specifically, students who were exposed to the new curriculum in high school have better


                                                  25
academic performance in university. Students of the new curriculum are more likely to reveal a

willingness to learn and to master the course material. These students are also more engaged in

social activities (student clubs) in university, they have more confidence in their academic ability,

and more overall self-confidence.

       The reform not only improved students’ educational success in university, but it also

improved students’ mental health by making them less likely to have problems such as feeling

depressed, feeling panicked, or feeling as though their own life has no value. The new curriculum,

which included a strictly-enforced physical education requirement, made students more likely to

retain a healthy body mass index. Finally, students who attended high school under the new

curriculum are also happier.

       A number of sensitivity analyses demonstrate the robustness of the results, and

indicate that high school curriculum has a significant impact on students’ academic success and

mental and physical well-being by allowing them to focus on subject matters in which they are

interested, and by reducing undue stress of a regimented structure.
